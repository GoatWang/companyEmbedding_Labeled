› our science › scientists at jgi › simon prochnik – comparative plant and algal genomics simon prochnik – comparative plant and algal genomics simon prochnik education phd in genetics university of edinburgh uk ba ma in genetics university of cambridge uk summary simon prochnik joined the jgi nearly ten years ago to work on the genome of the singlecelled green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii he has continued to lead computational analysis of the genome sequences of singlecelled eukaryotes and algae more recently his interests have turned to leveraging genomics for improving crops such as citrus and cassava research interests there are two major themes to simon’s research the evolution of complexity and the studying natural diversity and ancestry in crops to understand and predict potential improvements he compares the proteins encoded by various organisms to detect unique sets of proteins with unique functions for example a comparison of proteins encoded in the chlamydomonas genome to those of other organisms revealed catalogs of genes that are involved in photosynthesis many of which were unknown despite decades of research this gene catalog is helping us understand how plants convert sunlight into energy the next generation cassava project from the bill and melinda gates foundation and the uk department for international development to cornell university funds his work on improving cassava a crop that feeds some  million people daily yet suffers from poor yields and diseases a technique called genotypingbysequencing generates very high resolution genetic fingerprints which he has used to make a  detailed genetic map and genome assembly of cassava by comparing the traits and the fingerprints of wild cassava and farmer varieties he is tracing natural variation that may help improve yields and disease resistance awards and service instructor cold spring harbor programming for biology course bmgf and ukdfid next generation cassava breeding grant
