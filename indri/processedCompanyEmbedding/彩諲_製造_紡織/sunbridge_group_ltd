please read our financial services guide fsg for more information recently listed sunbridge group ltd asx sbb has seen its shares fall by more than  from its ipo price although shares spiked up more than  earlier this week still shares have sunk a long way below its ipo price of  cents and are currently trading at  cents at that price the company has a market cap of around  million not far off its cash holding of  million despite sunbridge posting revenues of  million in just five months to end of may  it’s also below the company’s last reported net assets of  million at the end of december  factor in the retailer’s strong growth in revenues and net profit – putting the company on a trailing pe ratio of x – and sunbridge looks to be the bargain of the century that is until you dig a little deeper sunbridge is involved in retailing mens clothing and accessories in china sunbridge owns a hong kong company mega rich international limited which in turn owns  of two chinese companies those two companies are involved in designing procuring and then selling their product to  distributors who then onsell the product to more than 0 retail stores not exactly what you would call a clean structure the company also has 4 of its own retail stores and plans to expand its own footprint – a sensible move – which cuts out the distributors and allows sunbridge to retain control from design to selling the product to retail customers increasing profit margins and lower costs the majority of the shares in sunbridge are owned by the ceo  with shares held in escrow for 4 months but other larger shareholders who held  of the shares in the ipo 0 million shares are selling out almost as soon as their month escrow period ended at the end of may – hence the recent share price falls interestingly many if not all of these shareholders appear to be shelf companies setup by chinese citizens in a notorious tax haven the british virgin islands according to the guardian newspaper “in china it is said that you have not succeeded until you have your own subsidiary in the british virgin islands” there are several other red flags including unusually large net profit margins and high returns on assets so high in fact that sunbridge’s return on assets beats every stock on the asx except for rea group limited asx rea carsalescom ltd asx crz  fund managers – who have little in the way of assets anyway – and biotech stock acrux limited asx acr another concern for investors is a common practice in china – according to the company – of providing loan guarantees to unrelated companies at the end of  sunbridge had  million of contingent liabilities but where it will be in future is anybody’s guess those liabilities are not held on the balance sheet either investors may also be concerned about the company’s plan to build an storey head office given it says it has just  senior executives and the inhouse design teams are situated close to apparel manufacturing hubs foolish investors may want to steer clear of this company given those issues there are plenty of lessrisky alternatives on the asx – like this company which pays strong dividends boasts excellent
