with the nhs broke privacy law the pairs initial agreement failed to comply with the uks data protection act nick summers nisummers  in medicine comments  shares share tweet share save bloomberg via getty images an nhs trust broke the law by sharing sensitive patient records with googles deepmind division the uks data watchdog has ruled the longawaited decision falls in line with the conclusion drawn by dame fiona caldicott the uks national data guardian in may the pairs agreement failed to comply with the data protection act  according to the information commissioners office ico because patients werent informed that their information was being used the ico also took issue with the size of the dataset —  million partial patient records — leveraged by deepmind to test streams an app for detecting acute kidney injury in april  new scientist revealed that deepmind and royal free london nhs trust were working together on a medical project as the ico notes in its letter to the trust their agreement was actually formalised in september  with royal free serving as the data controller owner and deepmind as the data processor partnerinitially the deal was hashed out so streams could be further developed by deepmind and put through clinical safety testing during this period the ico says the trust — which ultimately takes responsibility as data controller — broke four principles in the data protection act the first which demands processing be fair lawful and transparent was broken because the trust and deepmind didnt go far enough in their efforts to contact patients common law states however that consent can be implied if the data is being used for direct care tests and fullblown medical use are different however so the ico disregarded this defencethe royal free did not have a valid basis for satisfying the common law duty of confidence and therefore the processing of that data breached that duty the ico said in its letter to the royal free nhs trust in this light the processing was not lawful under the actthe second broken principle which is actually the third in the act requires data processing to be adequate relevant and not excessive following its investigation the ico concluded that  million patient records were too many for deepminds purposes the commissioner considered the trusts defence but couldnt see why that volume of information was necessary for the companys trials the commission is not persuaded that it was necessary and proportionate to process  million partial patient records in order to test the clinical safety of the application the processing of these records was in the commissioners view excessive the ico saidthe trusts failure to alert patients broke another principle that states data should be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under section  of the data protection act patients should have the opportunity to pull their information from any data processing the lack of transparency meant there was no way for patients to know never mind act on this right put plainly if the patients did not know that their information would be used in this way they could not take steps to objectthe final principle concerns data protection standards the ico notes that additional agreements including a privacy impact assessment were drawn up in january and november  by this time however deepmind had already processed patient data the watchdog is content with how deepmind handles data but disagrees with the documentation that was drawn up back in september  it didnt go far enough the ico says and could have resulted in a breach of the data protection act the commissioner does however recognise that the royal free has since improved the documentation in place between the trust and deepmindthe documentation drawn up last november means that streams is now on a better legal footing thats important given the app has now passed the testing phase and is being used in hospitals nevertheless the ico has asked the trust to commit to a series of changes these include establishing a proper legal basis under the act for the current deepmind agreement and any future trials completing a new privacy impact assessment and commissioning an audit of the initial trial periodthe ico has stressed that it doesnt want to impede innovation it recognises the work deepmind has done and the impact streams has already had on the uks national health service privacy however should not be at the cost of progress information commissioner elizabeth denham argues what stood out to me after looking through the investigation is that the shortcomings we found were avoidable she said in a blog post the price of innovation didnt need to be the erosion of legally ensured fundamental privacy rights i have every confidence the trust can comply with the changes weve asked for and still continue its valuable work m m ago in wearables fifa envisions a future where players wear ingame

family line of successionedit main article line of succession to the danish throne frederik crown prince of denmark the first law governing the succession to the danish throne as a hereditary monarchy was the kongeloven lex regia enacted  november  and published in  it declared that the crown of denmark shall descend by heredity to the legitimate descendants of king frederick iii and that the order of succession shall follow semisalic primogeniture according to which the crown is inherited by an heir with preference among the monarchs children to males over females among siblings to the elder over the younger and among frederick iiis remoter descendants by substitution senior branches over junior branches female descendants were eligible to inherit the throne in the event there were no eligible surviving male dynasts born in the male line as for the duchies holstein and lauenburg where the king ruled as duke these lands adhered to salic law meaning that only males could inherit the ducal throne and by mutual agreement were permanently conjoined the duchies of schleswig a danish fief holstein and lauenburg german fiefs were joined in personal union with the crown of denmark this difference caused problems when frederick vii of denmark proved childless making a change in dynasty imminent and causing the lines of succession for the duchies on one hand and for denmark on the other to diverge that meant that the new king of denmark would not also be the new duke of schleswig or duke of holstein to ensure the continued adhesion of the elbe duchies to the danish crown the line of succession to the duchies was modified in the london protocol of  which designated prince christian of schleswigholsteinsonderburgglücksburg as the new heir apparent although he was strictly the heir neither to the crown of denmark nor to the duchies of schleswig holstein or lauenburg by primogeniture originally the danish prime minister christian albrecht bluhme wanted to keep the separate hereditary principles but in the end the government decided on a uniform agnatic primogeniture which was accepted by the parliament this order of succession remained in effect for a hundred years then the salic law was changed to malepreference primogeniture in  meaning that females could inherit but only if they had no brothers in  the mode of inheritance of the throne was once more changed this time into an absolute primogeniture this imposed no immediate change on the line of succession as it was then as prince vincent had not yet been born the current line of succession is the crown prince frederik prince christian princess isabella prince vincent princess josephine prince joachim prince nikolai prince felix prince henrik princess athena princess benedikte princess elisabeth privileges and restrictionsedit following the transformation of denmarks monarchy from elective at least theoretically although it had generally descended to the eldest son of the house of oldenburg since  to hereditary in  the socalled kongelov established the reign by the grace of god of king frederick iii and his posterity of the articles of this law all except article  and article  have since been repealed article  states no prince of the blood who resides here in the realm and in our territory shall marry or leave the country or take service under foreign masters unless he receives permission from the king under this provision princes of denmark who permanently reside in other realms by express permission of the danish crown ie members of the dynasties of greece norway and the united kingdom do not thereby forfeit their royalty in denmark nor are they bound to obtain prior permission to travel abroad or to marry from its sovereign although since  those not descended in maleline from king christian ix are no longer in the line of succession to the danish throne however those who do reside in denmark or its territories continue to require the monarchs prior permission to travel abroad and to marry article  of the kongelov stipulates with respect to blood members of the royal dynasty they should answer to no magistrate judges but their first and last judge shall be the king or to whomsoever he decrees the wording excludes those whose blood cannot be traced to a danish monarch eg the present crown princess although all other articles of the kongelov have been repealed by amendments to the constitution in   and  these two articles have thus far been left intact notesedit princess benediktes children have no succession rights this is because the marriage consent given to her had very specific provisions if benedikte ever became the heir presumptive she and her husband would have to take permanent residence in denmark and her children would only have succession rights if they had applied for naturalization upon reaching adulthood and taken up residence in denmark a at the time of becoming the immediate heir to the throne and b no later than when they reached the age of mandatory schooling under danish law since the children continued to be educated in germany well past the mandatory schooling age they are deemed to no longer have succession rights queen annemarie has no succession rights and her descendants have none through her because the permission granted for her marriage stipulated that she renounced her claim

me up icons of entrepreneurship the real reason dave mcclure is out at  startups theres a huge shakeup reeling silicon valley that has repercussions around the funding world by heather wilde heather wilde is cto of roceteer and is also known as the unicorn whisperer because of her special focus on entrepreneurs she is a personal and professional growth expert executive coach author and speaker heathriel cto roceteerheathriel write a comment credit getty images they say revolutions dont happen overnight they take years of anguish and suffering and hardship until one day the dam breaks and a flood of people rise up together to create real change for years the venture capital culture with silicon valley as its nexus has been rife with behavior that many consider abrasive and rude however looking only slightly under the surface it has turned out that it goes far beyond that in the past weeks weve seen the complete collapse of binary capital a fund led by justin caldbeck who allegedly assaulted multiple women and jonathan teo who allegedly assisted in covering up this behavior dave mcclure founder of  startups was forced to apologize for his lewd behavior as well as resign from his role there and as gp of the fund elizabeth yin resigned in protest for his misconduct and there are reports that others are not far behind reid hoffman urged others in silicon valley to stand with him in signing a decency pledge that would show which funds are allies to women yet as more funds showed their support for this other reports came forward against some of the people using this hashtag which highlighted the point that the unethical behavior of certain vcs is unlikely to end anytime soon since this story initially broke more people have started to come forward cheryl yeoh posted her experiences with dave mcclure which may have been the lynchpin for his resignation comments made by cathryn chen myself and others are eerily echoed in the words of amy varle founder of the peoples property shop it actually makes me cry to read these comments and know im not alone i have literally been stalked and bribed with a  investment via the latest guy its made me sick on a daily basis there has been backlash against these women vcs sam altman and chris swies got involved in the fray chris sacca himself named in the new york times article disputed the claim against him as more women are coming forward men are starting to fight back turning this into a shesaid hesaid clearly something isnt working as ive been digging into this story since i started covering it ive found that it goes deeper than simple gender bias not only have women come to me with their stories ive heard from men who have had similar experiences of their being harassed while vulnerable  only they feel the repercussions for their coming forward would be too harmful for them to deal with wherever there is a power imbalance it is too easy for things to be misconstrued on the vc side they may very well be innocently thinking hey this person is really fun to hang out with unfortunately theyre not taking into account the worldview of the person on the other side this other person is in an automatically vulnerable position theyre not on the same level as the vc because they have a fiduciary responsibility to their company to make payroll pay vendors get product out etc to them at some level the vc represents certainty security that person will never be really fun to hang with chris sacca dave mcclure even justin caldbeck and all the rest may well have had purely innocent intentions  in their own minds where they have failed is they did not take into account the other people around them im happy to talk to anyone in silicon valley or anywhere who would like help in understanding perspective maybe then well start to make some progress meet icons of entrepreneurship at this years iconic tour in la speakers include tony robbins tony hawk and dollar shave clubs michael dubin to

korsmønter or cross coins minted by harald bluetooth in the late th century organised minting in denmark was introduced on a larger scale by canute the great in the s lund was the principal minting place and one of denmarks most important cities in the middle ages but coins were also minted in roskilde slagelse odense aalborg århus viborg ribe ørbæk and hedeby for almost  years danish kings – with a few exceptions – have issued coins with their name monogram andor portrait taxes were sometimes imposed via the coinage eg by the compulsory substitution of coins handed in by new coins handed out with a lower silver content danish coinage was generally based on the carolingian silver standard periodically the metal value of the minted coins was reduced and thus did not correspond to the face value of the coins this was mainly done to generate income for the monarch andor the state as a result of the debasement the public started to lose trust in the respective coins danish currency was overhauled several times in attempts to restore public trust in the coins and later in issued paper money in  a new currency was introduced in denmark the krone crown one krone had the value of   danish rigsdaler species accounting for  kroneskillinger later for  common skillings until the late th century the krone was a denomination equal to  mark a subunit of the danish rigsdaler a new krone was introduced as the currency of denmark in january  it replaced the rigsdaler at a rate of  kroner   rigsdaler this placed the krone on the gold standard at a rate of  kroner   kilogram fine gold the latter part of the th century and much of the th century saw expanding economic activity and thus also a need for means of payment that were easier to handle than coins consequently banknotes were increasingly used instead of coins the introduction of the new krone was a result of the scandinavian monetary union which came into effect in  with the coins being adopted two years later and lasted until world war i the parties to the union were the three scandinavian countries where the name was krone in denmark and norway and krona in sweden a word which in all three languages literally means crown the three currencies were on the gold standard with the kronekrona defined as  ⁄ of a kilogram of pure gold the scandinavian monetary union came to an end in  when the gold standard was abandoned denmark sweden and norway all decided to keep the names of their respective and now separate currencies denmark returned to the gold standard in  but left it permanently in  between  and  the krone was tied to the german reichsmark following the end of the german occupation a rate of  kroner to the british pound was introduced reduced to   kroner   us dollar in august the same year within the bretton woods system denmark devalued its currency with the pound in  to a rate of  to the dollar a further devaluation in  resulted in rates of  kroner in  it was decided to stop printing

colour schemeedit a tinbronze øre coin a cupronickel krone coin an aluminium bronze kroner coin  series the design of the coin series is intended to ensure that the coins are easy to distinguish from each other the series is therefore divided into three sequences each with its own metal colour this division into colours has its roots in history in earlier times the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations silver for the nexthighest and copper for the lowest coin denominations this correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present coin series see examples to the right the øre coins are thus minted from coppercoloured bronze the   and krone coins from a silvercoloured cupronickel alloy and the  and krone coins from golden aluminium bronze the coins differ in terms of size weight and rim within each sequence the diameter and weight of the coins increase with their value the øre and krone coins have smooth rims while the rims of the  and krone coins are milled the rims of the  and krone coins have interrupted milling the   and krone coins

especially the relationship between danes and denmark and the unifying of denmark as a single kingdom is a subject which attracts debate this is centred primarily on the prefix dan and whether it refers to the dani or a historical person dan and the exact meaning of the mark ending most handbooks derive the first part of the word and the name of the people from a word meaning flat land related to german tenne threshing floor english den cave the mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland see marches with probable references to the border forests in south schleswig the first recorded use of the word danmark within denmark itself is found on the two jelling stones which are runestones believed to have been erected by gorm the old c  and harald bluetooth c  the larger stone of the two is popularly cited as denmarks baptismal certificate dåbsattest though both use the word denmark in the form of accusative ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ tanmaurk danmɒrk on the large stone and genitive ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ tanmarkar pronounced danmarkaɽ on the small stone the inhabitants of denmark are there called tani danɪ or danes in the accusative history main article history of denmark see also history of greenland and history of the faroe islands prehistory the gilded side of the trundholm sun chariot dating from the nordic bronze age the earliest archaeological findings in denmark date back to the eem interglacial period from – bc denmark has been inhabited since around  bc and agriculture has been evident since  bc the nordic bronze age – bc in denmark was marked by burial mounds which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the sun chariot during the preroman iron age  bc – ad  native groups began migrating south and the first tribal danes came to the country between the preroman and the germanic iron age in the roman iron age ad – the roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in denmark and roman coins have been found in denmark evidence of strong celtic cultural influence dates from this period in denmark and much of northwest europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the gundestrup cauldron the tribal danes came from the east danish islands zealand and scania and spoke an early form of north germanic historians believe that before their arrival most of jutland and the nearest islands were settled by tribal jutes the jutes migrated to great britain eventually some as mercenaries by brythonic king vortigern and were granted the southeastern territories of kent the isle of wight and other areas where they settled they were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading angles and saxons who formed the anglosaxons the remaining jutish population in jutland assimilated in with the settling danes a short note about the dani in getica by the historian jordanes is believed to be an early mention of the danes one of the ethnic groups from whom modern danes are descended the danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in ad  are attributed to the emergence of a danish king a new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and ribe the oldest town of denmark was founded about ad  viking and middle ages main articles viking age and kalmar union the ladby ship the largest ship burial found in denmark from the th to the th century the wider scandinavian region was the source of vikings they colonised raided and traded in all parts of europe the danish vikings were most active in the eastern and southern british isles and western europe they conquered and settled parts of england known as the danelaw under king sweyn forkbeard in  and france where danes and norwegians founded normandy with rollo as head of state more anglosaxon pence of this period have been found in denmark than in england larger of the two jelling stones raised by harald bluetooth denmark was largely consolidated by the late th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in frankish sources as kings reges under the reign of gudfred in  the danish kingdom may have included all the lands of jutland scania and the danish islands excluding bornholm the extant danish monarchy traces its roots back to gorm the old who established his reign in the early th century as attested by the jelling stones the danes were christianised around  by harald bluetooth the son of gorm it is believed that denmark became christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising christian power in europe the holy roman empire which was an important trading area for the danes in that case harald built six fortresses around denmark called trelleborg and built a further danevirke in the early th century canute the great won and united denmark england and norway for almost  years with a scandinavian army throughout the high and late middle ages denmark also included skåneland the areas of scania halland and blekinge in presentday south sweden and danish kings ruled danish estonia as well as the duchies of schleswig and holstein most of the latter two now form the state of schleswigholstein in northern germany in  denmark entered into a personal union with norway and sweden united under queen margaret i the three countries were to be treated as equals in the union however even from the start margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating denmark as the clear senior partner of the union thus much of the next  years of scandinavian history revolves around this union with sweden breaking off and being reconquered repeatedly the issue was for practical purposes resolved on  june  as swedish king gustav vasa conquered the city of stockholm the protestant reformation spread to scandinavia in the s and following the counts feud civil war denmark converted to lutheranism in  later that year denmark entered into a union with norway early modern history – main articles denmark–norway and danish colonial empire portion of the carta marina an early map of scandinavia made around the start of the union with norway after sweden permanently broke away from the personal union denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour king christian iv attacked sweden in the – kalmar war but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union the war led to no territorial changes but sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of  million silver riksdaler to denmark an amount known as the älvsborg ransom king christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses most notably glückstadt founded as a rival to hamburg and christiania inspired by the dutch east india company he founded a similar danish company and planned to claim ceylon as a colony but the company only managed to acquire tranquebar on indias coromandel coast denmarks large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in africa and india the empire was sustained by trade with other major powers and plantations – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation in the thirty years war christian tried to become the leader of the lutheran states in germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of lutter the result was that the catholic army under albrecht von wallenstein was able to invade occupy and pillage jutland forcing denmark to withdraw from the war denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions but king gustavus adolphus intervention in germany was seen as a sign that the military power of sweden was on the rise while denmarks influence in the region was declining in  swedish armies invaded jutland and claimed scania in  in the  treaty of brømsebro denmark surrendered halland gotland the last parts of danish estonia and several provinces in norway in  king frederick iii declared war on sweden and marched on bremenverden this led to a massive danish defeat and the armies of king charles x gustav of sweden conquered both jutland funen and much of zealand before signing the peace of roskilde in february  which gave sweden control of scania blekinge trøndelag and the island of bornholm charles x gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked denmark and in august  he began a twoyearlong siege of copenhagen but failed to take the capital in the following peace settlement denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of trøndelag and bornholm the battle of öland during the scanian war between an allied danonorwegiandutch fleet and the swedish navy  june  denmark tried to regain control of scania in the scanian war – but it ended in failure following the great northern war – denmark managed to restore control of the parts of schleswig and holstein ruled by the house of holsteingottorp in the  treaty of frederiksborg and the  treaty of tsarskoye selo respectively denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its neutral status allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars in the napoleonic wars denmark traded with both france and the united kingdom and joined the league of armed neutrality with russia sweden and prussia the british considered this a hostile act and attacked copenhagen in both  and  in one case carrying off the danish fleet in the other burning large parts of the danish capital this led to the socalled danishbritish gunboat war british control over the waterways between denmark and norway proved disastrous to the unions economy and in  denmark–norway went bankrupt the danishnorwegian union was dissolved by the treaty of kiel in  the danish monarchy irrevocably and forever renounced claims to the kingdom of norway in favour of the swedish king after the dissolution of the union with norway denmark kept the possessions of iceland which retained the danish monarchy until  the faroe islands and greenland all of which had been governed by norway for centuries apart from the nordic colonies denmark continued to rule over danish india from  to  the danish gold coast ghana from  to  and the danish west indies from  to  constitutional monarchy –present the national constitutional assembly was convened by king frederick vii in  to adopt the constitution of denmark a nascent danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the s after the european revolutions of  denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on  june  a new constitution established a twochamber parliament denmark faced war against both

love this biotinbysarah e lenssenon july  size ct maxstrengthi was having some serious hair loss issues i would get out of the shower and brush my hair and so much would fall out it was very upsetting my brush after just one brushing would look like i hadnt cleaned it in six months  thats how much hair i was losing then i found natrol biotin and started using it with pronexa by hairgenics  clinical strength hair growth  regrowth shampoo with biotin – after about  weeks i noticed a huge difference in my hair much much less hair falling out when brushing overall healthier thicker hair and i am so happy that i was able to stop and reverse my hair loss issue definitely use these products to stop thinning hair in its tracksread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsplease dont take if your acne pronebyella girlon january  size ct maxstrengthverified purchaseso im a big fan of vitamins i was excited to find this particular bottle of biotin took it religiously for months well i broke out horribly i mean disgustingly like ive never have before in an attempt to stop the ongoing break outs i changed the way i eat i gave up chocolate coffee  of my vitamins no change then one day i did research on biotin according to many articles big amounts of biotin will cause break outs for some people i was horrified took this bottle and threw it away im still trying to get my skin back biotin works yes but this particular extra strength might be too much for some people as far as my personal experience i must give this a one star and hopefully i save someone some headaches this acne has ruined my self esteem ive had a pimple here and there before but never this bad and it was hell trying to figure out what was causing it also my little sister was taking them and breaking out too not as bad as me but the worst shes ever had too as soon as i did my research i ran to tell her she has also informed me that her break outs arent as bad anymore since taking this pills off her daily routine so it really wasnt just me having this effects i now take an acne medication orally pills and in the ingredients it actually contains biotin it has  mcg thats a big difference from  mcg i mean look at the diffrence obviously this might work for some people but it ruined my skin do your research before taking any type of pills always read the back of the bottles it could have saved me from running my face for so many months read more  comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsworks great even if youre forgetfulbyamazon customeron november  size ct maxstrengthverified purchasei am the most forgetful person and have only been taking these  times a week and still noticed a difference my hair has become stronger softer and noticeably longer after just  weeks i did not experience any acne symptoms like many reviews have said but i do think it made my skin a bit oilier than usual but nothing too noticeable love this productread more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsbeware the acnebyebsaon june  size ct maxstrengthverified purchasebe very careful using this product while biotin is good for you excessive biotin can limit the absorption of other b vitamins i took this to help my hair grow back and i immediately broke out with a horrible case of acne all over my face apparently thats a pretty common reaction for alot of people although some people are able to take large doses of this and not have any issues i recommend trying a small dosage first then slowly upping your intake  mcg is alot to start with you guysread more comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starswhich is great i take them in the morningbybella bon july  size ct maxstrengthverified purchasethis seemed to give me about half an inch of hair growth in around three weeks nail growth seems normal but they grow fast without it so that is hard to gauge my only complaint would be more energy with these which is great i take them in the morning but they still sometimes keep me awake when its time for bed that can be annoying as i generally dont have any issues falling sleep normally no breakouts i drink a lot of water no nausea seems a decent product with good results dont expect to have nails and hair grow inches and inches in a week but over several months it can helpon a side note im prone to headaches and ive gotten a lot after the first week unsure if it is related but something to consider maybe half a pill insteadread morecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsget itbysunnyon december  size ct maxstrengthverified purchasei got these and was skeptical they would work but after taking them for the past  months my hair has grown out healthy and long at a much faster pace than it usually does i definitely recommend it its worth investing in these vitamins they dont taste like anything either and the tablet is about the size of a tic tac i definitely recommend this productread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsgreat for hair lossbyalexison april  size ct maxstrengthverified purchasei started taking this a little over  weeks ago for my hair growth i just had a baby and those of you with kids know you loose a lot of hair after pregnancy and nail growth it doesnt seem to be do too much so far but i have noticed a little bit of difference in my hair loss its not as significant as usual i am maybe loosing half as much hair as before i used to loose half a handful in the shower and now maybe lose  noticeable strands each shower as for my nails i havent seen any difference at all they are still very brittle and grow at a slow rate hopefully i see some more improvements soon and if i do i will come back and
