involved is worth itbyfemale readeron  may i was a bit nervous about using these japanese patterns particularly regarding the sizing and also the bother of having to trace off the pattern however i had bought the book originally because i love the look of japanese clothing designs and thought that buying patterns in a book like this is excellent value as you get several different ones for about the same cost as one or two normal patterns initially i made the boatneck jumper and it fitted but i didnt particularly like what id made  partly the fabric id choseni wanted to make the shirt coat and finally got round to it recently and i am delighted with the result tracing the patterns off is a bit awkward trying to see which lines you are supposed to be following is tricky and i would definitely recommend marking them first and you do need to be very careful but having done it i would say it is well worth it i am a size  depending on clothing manufacturer size  for marks and spencer topsand so used the small size i thought id make a toile initially as i didnt want to waste money on decent fabric only to find the garment didnt fit so i chose a medium weight calico which cost me about £i had no problem with the instructions until i came to the sleeves there were two problems  one was that the difference between the front and back of the sleeve top is very little and as there are no triangular notches to denote where to match the sleeve to the armskye working out which way round to put the sleeve in was tricky to solve this i had to work out which actually was the front and which was the back by comparing it with anormal pattern the second problem was that i have never come across a set in sleeve which you didnt have to gather at the top to make it fit into the armskye but the instructions made no mention of this gathering and indeed the sleeve top was smaller than the armskye so i just set aboutpinning the sleeve  and i had to stretch it to fit  into the armskye and then tacked it and stitched it surprisingly it worked and looks fairly normal although i do keep looking at it and wondering if it is i cant help thinking that maybe the sleeve pattern should be slightly different so that it has to be gathered to fit it in to the armskye and when i have got time i might investigate sleeve shapes and alter iti did my own variation on the ends of the sleeves as you can see in the photo which i cant get to rotatei am an experienced sewer and would not recommend these patterns to a beginner unless you have someone to guide you through the process however if you are experienced and prepared to be patient and persistent then i would recommend them i was very pleased with how this garment turned out and have in fact now dyed it green and am delighted with it i shall be making it again and shall also try out other patterns in the book read more top critical reviewsee all  critical reviews›  people found this helpful  out of

loading the comments at the moment please try again later out of  starshow to resize largerbyeleyaon  march format paperbackverified purchasebought this book in great excitement as the shapes look fairly straightforward and therefore a good starting point it also appealed that they were petite as i am slim i traced the pattern and added allowances when cutting the fabric as per instructions in the book i made a skirt with a box pleat somehow the back yoke piece was  shorter than the back skirt panel so i cut an inch off the panel despite this the finished skirt is inches too big i used the large pattern and a mm instead of half inch seam as several reports suggested that the patterns were small and i wanted to give myself some space for my postbaby tummy the resulting skirt is a uk size  i am a  now i have to find it a new home as i cant bring myself to unpick everything and redo the wretched invisible zipperon the plus side i seem to have stumbled across a way to enlarge the skirt if these sizes dont do it for you when tracing the pattern onto fabric add seam allowances as directed i calculate this provided an extra  inches to the total circumference you could make the box pleat slightly smaller say  marking instead of   with corresponding adjustment to the front yoke band or add width straight up and down at the fold when laying out pattern pieces again with corresponding adjustment to yoke use a slightly smaller seam allowance when sewing you only have to cut off the extra fabric from a wide one anyway but remember to be consistent in your seam allowance i think this may have gained me an extra inchthis is the only pattern i have tried so farthe book itself is beautifully presented however and suggests a fabric for each pattern it is almost like a catalogue or magazine in that it has pictures of lots of other items suggesting how you might style each piece it is good for inspiration for ways you could tweak a pattern perhaps one you already have that you know fits to make something similar but slightly different i like some of the tops for example but have found a very similar simplicity paper pattern for about £ to use so that a i dont have to trace pattern pieces and b the sizing is hopefully a bit more reliableplus points great for ideas nicely presented normal models the authors friends i think a value pattern book given that you would pay a lot more for  basic paper patterns small number of pattern pieces per itemminus points you have to trace the patterns once you have decoded them sizing is a bit hit and miss instructions probably not great for the first time sewer comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert product linkpaste the products web address belowproduct not

book as christmas gift and so far have made one top from this book i like the fact that there are variations on each pattern tracing the patterns isnt a issue to me as i tend to trace patterns any way so that i can make in a different size if need be with regards to the sizing i originally made the top in the large size as id read the reviews on here however it was enormous so i had to unpick all my sewing and start again i made the small size in the end and im a size  the pattern was simple to follow and im pleased with result in the endcomment  people found this helpful was this review

paperbackthis is probably my favourite sewing book so faras described there are  patterns with modifications to create the full  garments the style is quite simplistic and clean with a lot of neutral cotton and linen fabrics being used very much a japanese aesthetic that i like i think if you are more experienced andor the style is not to your taste you will find this book quite boring  if youre looking for closefitted garments turn away now however if you want comfortable clothing then you are probably looking in the right placepersonally i have modified some of the patterns when i want to give them some shape adding ties to the a line dress for example so if you feel this way too i would advise you to look at the patterns as more like basic blocks for you to build your understanding of patterns and sewing upon i find that the range of patterns and the simple modifications between each are really helpful in showing how clothes can be constructed from the simplest of shapes and built up to create more complex designssome of the patterns can be hard to understand i have the wrap style skirt in mind as it is quite hard to work out how it all comes together from the images some of the information has been lost in translation and i think the instructions are sometimes too brief but so far they are relatively easy to understand i have also have had trouble sometimes distinguishing the patterns from eachother on the pattern sheets but with a little patience and a highlighter i can work it outsome people have mentioned sizing as an issue for the record i am a uk size  with quite generous curves and i tend to fit a small in these patterns i havent had any trouble so far as i think the loose fit is quite forgiving however i am just one example out of many with their simple shapes i dont think they would be too hard to modifyin a nutshell if you are looking to build confidence in sewing and want some lowrisk basic patterns to try out then give this book a

november format paperbackno wonder this book is gathering likes on amazon  simple patterns are included to make a wardrobe of  wearable garments the full size patterns come in four sizes  what a bonus

have just made the a line skirt from this book and it went together with no problem at all the only thing i did different was follow the instructions for fitting the zip from a colette tutorial rather than from the book i found the sizing good the only reason i havent given it  stars is that it would have been good to have the pattern in different colours it is a multi size overlaid pattern and i found it a bit difficult to work out the pattern pieces and see where the lines were when tracing but i am very happy with the skirt and am looking forward to making morecomment  people found this

bit awkward trying to see which lines you are supposed to be following is tricky and i would definitely recommend marking them first and you do need to be very careful but having done it i would say it is well worth it i am a size  depending on clothing manufacturer size  for marks and spencer topsand so used the small size i thought id make a toile initially as i didnt want to waste money on decent fabric only to find the garment didnt fit so i chose a medium weight calico which cost me about £i had no problem with the instructions until i came to the sleeves there were two problems  one was that the difference between the front and back of the sleeve top is very little and as there are no triangular notches to denote where to match the sleeve to the armskye working out which way round to put the sleeve in was tricky to solve this i had to work out which actually was the front and which was the back by comparing it with anormal pattern the second problem was that i have never come across a set in sleeve which you didnt have to gather at the top to make it fit into the armskye but the instructions made no mention of this gathering and indeed the sleeve top was smaller than the armskye so i just set aboutpinning the sleeve  and i had to stretch it to fit  into the armskye and then tacked it and stitched it surprisingly it worked and looks fairly normal although i do keep looking at it and wondering if it is i cant help thinking that maybe the sleeve pattern should be slightly different so that it has to be gathered to fit it in to the armskye and when i have got time i might investigate sleeve shapes and alter iti did my own variation on the ends of the sleeves as you can see in the photo which i cant get to rotatei am an experienced sewer and would not recommend these patterns to a beginner unless you have someone to guide you through the process however if you are experienced and prepared to be patient and persistent then i would recommend them i was very pleased with how this garment turned out and have in fact now dyed it green and am delighted with it i shall be making it again and shall also try out other patterns in the bookread more  comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsdisappointing tiny sizesbynaomion  november format paperbacki borrowed this book from my local library as the patterns looked lovely i would like to warn all potential buyers that the patterns in this book are sized for approximately sizes  to  if i had bought this book i would be returning it for a refund as it is not mentioned at all that the sizings are so small perhaps the listing should be edited to reflect this the patterns are beautiful and i would love to be able to make them perhaps as other reviewers have suggested it would be useful to have instructions on how to increase the sizes if possibleread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starshow to resize largerbyeleyaon  march format paperbackverified purchasebought this book in great excitement as the shapes look fairly straightforward and therefore a good starting point it also appealed that they were petite as i am slim i traced the pattern and added allowances when cutting the fabric as per instructions in the book i made a skirt with a box pleat somehow the back yoke piece was  shorter than the back skirt panel so i cut an inch off the panel despite this the finished skirt is inches too big i used the large pattern and a mm instead of half inch seam as several reports suggested that the patterns were small and i wanted to give myself some space for my postbaby tummy the resulting skirt is a uk size  i am a  now i have to find it a new home as i cant bring myself to unpick everything and redo the wretched invisible zipperon the plus side i seem to have stumbled across a way to enlarge the skirt if these sizes dont do it for you when tracing the pattern onto fabric add seam allowances as directed i calculate this provided an extra  inches to the total circumference you could make the box pleat slightly smaller say  marking instead of   with corresponding adjustment to the front yoke band or add width straight up and down at the fold when laying out pattern pieces again with corresponding adjustment to yoke use a slightly smaller seam allowance when sewing you only have to cut off the extra fabric from a wide one anyway but remember to be consistent in your seam allowance i think this may have gained me an extra inchthis is the only pattern i have tried so farthe book itself is beautifully presented however and suggests a fabric for each pattern it is almost like a catalogue or magazine in that it has pictures of lots of other items suggesting how you might style each piece it is good for inspiration for ways you could tweak a pattern perhaps one you already have that you know fits to make something similar but slightly different i like some of the tops for example but have found a very similar simplicity paper pattern for about £ to use so that a i dont have to trace pattern pieces and b the sizing is hopefully a bit more reliableplus points great for ideas nicely presented normal models the authors friends i think a value pattern book given that you would pay a lot more for  basic paper patterns small number of pattern pieces per itemminus points you have to trace the patterns once you have decoded them sizing is a bit hit and miss instructions probably not great for the first time sewerread

made a few simple things previously such as pajamas i got this book as christmas gift and so far have made one top from this book i like the fact that there are variations on each pattern tracing the patterns isnt a issue to me as i tend to trace patterns any way so that i can make in a different size if need be with regards to the sizing i originally made the top in the large size as id read the reviews on here however it was enormous so i had to unpick all my sewing and start again i made the small size in the end and im a size  the pattern was simple to follow and im pleased with result in
