message a public publicly traded publicly held company or public corporation is a corporation whose ownership is dispersed among the general public in many shares of stock which are freely traded on a stock exchange or in over the counter markets in some jurisdictions public companies over a certain size must be listed on an exchange contents  history  securities of a company  advantages  disadvantages  stockholders  general trend  privatization  trading and valuation  see also  references historyedit in the early modern period the dutch developed several financial instruments and helped lay the foundations of modern financial system the dutch east india company voc became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public in other words the voc was officially the first publicly traded company because it was the first company to be ever actually listed on an official stock exchange while the italian citystates produced the first transferable government bonds they did not develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market corporate shareholders as edward stringham  notes companies with transferable shares date back to classical rome but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable secondary market existed neal  p  securities of a companyedit usually the securities of a publicly traded company are owned by many investors while the shares of a privately held company are owned by relatively few shareholders a company with many shareholders is not necessarily a publicly traded company in the united states in some instances companies with over  shareholders may be required to report under the securities exchange act of  companies that report under the  act are generally deemed public companies advantagesedit publicly traded companies are able to raise funds and capital through the sale in the primary or secondary market of shares of stock this is the reason publicly traded corporations are important prior to their existence it was very difficult to obtain large amounts of capital for private enterprises the profit on stock is gained in form of dividend or capital gain to the holders the financial media and analysts will be able to access additional information about the businessclarification needed the owners are able to share risks by selling shares to the public if he holds  of the share he will pay all the debt however if he holds  he only needs to pay  of the debt it increases the asset liquidity and the company does not need to depend on fund from the bank it improves the transparency of company information by releasing annual account report and transaction record the company may be better known to the publicor increase its popularity if some shares are given to the managers the conflicts between managers and shareholders the principalagent problem will be remitted disadvantagesedit many stock exchanges require that publicly traded companies have their accounts regularly audited by outside auditors and then publish the accounts to their shareholders besides the cost this may make useful information available to competitors various other annual and quarterly reports are also required by law in the united states the sarbanes–oxley act imposes additional requirements the requirement for audited books is not imposed by the exchange known as otc pink the shares may be maliciously held by outside shareholders and the original founders or owners may lose benefits and control the principalagent problem or the agency problem is a key weakness of public company the separation of companys ownership and control is especially prevalent in such countries as uk and us stockholdersedit in the united states the securities and exchange commission requires that firms whose stock is traded publicly report their major shareholders each year the reports identify all institutional shareholders primarily firms owning stock in other companies all company officials who own shares in their firm and any individual or institution owning more than  of the firms stock general trendedit for many years newly created companies were privately held but held initial public offering to become publicly traded company or to be acquired by another company if they became larger and more profitable or had promising prospects more infrequently some companies—such as investment banking firm goldman sachs and logistics services provider united parcel service ups  chose to remain privately held for a long period of time after maturity into a profitable company however from  to  the number of corporations publicly traded on american stock exchanges dropped  according to one observer gerald f davis public corporations have become less concentrated less integrated less interconnected at the top shorter lived less remunerative for average investors and less prevalent since the turn of the st century davis argues that technological changes such as the decline in price and increasing power quality and flexibility of computer numerical control machines and newer digitally enabled tools such as d printing will lead to smaller and more local organization of production privatizationedit a group of private investors or another company that is privately held can buy out the shareholders of a public company taking the company private this is typically done through a leveraged buyout and occurs when the buyers believe the securities have been undervalued by investors in some cases public companies that are in severe financial distress may also approach a private company or companies to take over ownership and management of the company one way of doing this would be to make a rights issue designed to enable the new investor to acquire a supermajority with a supermajority the company could then be relisted ie privatized alternatively a publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies with the target company becoming either a subsidiary or joint venture of the purchasers or ceasing to exist as a separate entity its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both when the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a merger subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created de novo — this often happens in the financial sector subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies are not generally considered to be privately held companies even though they themselves are not publicly traded and are generally subject to the same reporting requirements as publicly traded companies finally shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures can be reoffered to the public at any time — firms that are sold in this manner are called spinouts most industrialized jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations that detail the steps that prospective owners public or private must undertake if they wish to take over a publicly traded corporation this often entails the wouldbe buyers making a formal offer for each share of the company to shareholders normally some form of supermajority is required for this sort of the offer to be approved but once it happens then usually all shareholders are compelled to sell at the agreedupon price and the company either becomes a subsidiary ceases to exist or becomes privately held trading and valuationedit the shares of a publicly traded company are often traded on a stock exchange the value or size of a company is called its market capitalization a term which is often shortened to market cap this is calculated as the number of shares outstanding as opposed to authorized but not necessarily issued times the price per share for example a company with two million shares outstanding and a price per share of us has a market capitalization of us million however a companys market capitalization should not be confused with the fair market value of the company as a whole since the price per share are influenced by other factors such as the volume of shares traded low trading volume can cause artificially low prices for securities due to investors being apprehensive of investing in a company they perceive as possibly lacking liquidity for example if all shareholders were to simultaneously try to sell their shares in the open market this would immediately create downward pressure on the price for which the share is traded unless there were an equal number of buyers willing to purchase the security at the price the sellers demand so sellers would have to either reduce their price or choose not to sell thus the number of trades in a given period of time commonly referred to as the volume is important when determining how well a companys market capitalization reflects true fair market value of the company as a whole the higher the volume the more the fair market value of the company is likely to be reflected by its market capitalization another example of the impact of volume on the accuracy of market capitalization is when a company has little or no trading activity and the market price is simply the price at which the most recent trade took place which could be days or weeks ago this occurs when there are no buyers willing to purchase the securities at the price being offered by the sellers and there are no sellers willing to sell at the price the buyers are willing to pay while this is rare when the company is traded on a major stock exchange it is not uncommon when shares are traded overthecounter otc since individual buyers and sellers need to incorporate news about the company into their purchasing decisions a security with an imbalance of buyers or sellers may not feel the full affects of recent news see alsoedit companies portal crown corporation government agency nondepartmental public body public bodies

company becomes insolvent for example say a private limited company issues  shares valued at  each shareholder a and shareholder b own  shares each and paid in full for  shares each if the company becomes insolvent the maximum amount shareholder a and shareholder b each pay is  the value of the remaining  unpaid shares each member holds a private limited company has greater tax advantages than a sole proprietorship partnership or similar organization the company exists into perpetuity even if an owner sells or transfers his shares securing jobs and resources for the community because a
