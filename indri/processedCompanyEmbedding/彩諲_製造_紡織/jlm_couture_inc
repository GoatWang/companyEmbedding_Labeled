ltd jlm was founded by longtime bridal gown designer jim hjelm he was born and raised in worcester massachusetts where at an early age he became interested in fashion design as a child he designed wardrobes for the comic book character brenda starr and grew up with the dream of one day designing for the theater or film industry however after attending the new england school of design he was simply eager to find work after a jobhunting trip in  to new york city proved unsuccessful a friend told him about an opening in boston at the house of bianchi a major bridal house he got the job and essentially by accident became a bridal gown designer he stayed at bianchi for two years and learned the basics patterns laces and the construction of wedding gowns he also began to develop his own flare for the traditional wedding gown design in  hjelm took a position with a rival bridal house priscilla of boston where he would work for  years it was here that he learned the business side of the bridal gown industry and developed a reputation as a topnotch designer of both bridal gowns and party dresses gaining luster for designing clothes for the daughters of american presidents lucy baines johnson and julie and trisha nixon hjelm regarded the johnson wedding as one of his most enjoyable and rewarding experiences he stayed a full week in the white house working out of the lincoln bedroom producing the wedding gown and  bridesmaids gowns in  hjelm finally moved to new york becoming a designer for galinabouquet inc from his new boss steve lawrence hjelm learned in his owns words how to be a little tough his name at this point had enough value that galina often featured him in the companys ads which added further to his name recognition after several years at galina and  years in the bridal industry hjelm felt he was ready to launch his own label in  he found a business partner in joseph l murphy an accountant by training who was the boyfriend of a showroom model they turned to families and friends to raise the money needed to launch the company which was incorporated in april  and then taken public in  by first devonshire of spokane washington priced at  a share thus jim hjelms private collection became the only publicly held bridal house in the industry the company got off to a smooth start which was not surprising to hjelm who had a bankable name and all the requisite contacts after a quartercentury in the business he later told the press i knew we would be successful it wasnt scary at all he also discovered the joys of working for himself and the freedom to add his own touches when you work for somebody else he told wwd in  you have to stay with the look of the house when you have your own firm you wear ten hats production boss designer at

more active in the running of the bridal company when he took the position as chief financial officer jim hjelms first collection under his own name premiered for the spring  season he pursued his preference for traditional wedding gown design especially heirloom dresses featuring nets silks and antiquelike laces this approach by his own admission was in keeping with his background its my bostonian upbringing and working with priscilla all those years when youre a snob its very difficult as long as his conservative taste was shared by brides the company prospered but in the early s trends would change and he would have to adapt in the meantime the company made a number of moves in october  it acquired exclusives for the bride inc a year later trademarks and inventories were bought from samir  associates inc a twoyearold company which designed and marketed special occasion womens apparel these assets then formed the basis of a wholly owned subsidiary named samir of new

challenges the poor economy proved especially harmful to its line of expensive bridal gowns which were priced in the  range the average price for a wedding gown however was around  a trend recognized by readytowear manufactures such as armani anne klein and donna karan to offset the drop in demand for its highend gowns hjelm introduced the jh collection line of gowns that used synthetic fibers and retailed at the  price point according to a  crains new york business article making matters worse prices for beaded lace skyrocketed and theft of the companys merchandise increased dramatically when workers were denied their request for a pay raise they slowed production by a third in protest a  crains profile offered another summary of this period for the company after a whirlwind romance jim

in  the fledgling wedding dress manufacturer was stuck in a time warp its entire product line made up of dated traditional styles jim hjelm tried to answer the problem of declining sales of traditional gowns by forming a contemporary classic division to produce gowns with simpler styling less lace and bead work and less ornamentation overall to take charge of the line a young designer named lezaro perez who had developed a strong reputation in the contemporary category was brought it the gowns would then be marketed under his name the creation of the new division did not however address the underlying problems at the company the board of directors decided that it was time for jim hjelm to relinquish his management responsibilities and concentrate on design in january  murphy was installed as president and he began to implement a threepronged strategy to turn around the companys fortunes cut costs increase sales by diversifying the line and find a new customer base part of

sold off hjelm took an important step in  when it created a new line called occasions collection which grew out of a focus group the company sponsored in november  according to forbes murphy heard one woman complain i have ten ugly bridesmaids gowns hanging in my closet that i dont have the heart to throw away her sentiment was repeated by others after months of going to weddings calling up friends

editions price new from used from ringbound october   please retry — — — ringbound — are the combined human resources at jlm couture inc productive there is no absolute answer to this question this report considers the extent to which the companys labor deployment indicators differ from global benchmarks in this report we consider forecasts of differences between labor ratios and the resulting return on this human investment compared to global benchmarks the estimation of such differences is commonly called a gap analysis what is the ratio of shortterm and longterm assets to employee what are typical capitallabor ratios how different are these ratios to companies serving the same link in the value chain what are the average sales and net profits per employee compared to global benchmarks these and over  other indicators of labor productivity are considered in this report the report does so by going beyond traditional analyses by considering companies competing in the same or similar industrial classification at a global level the goal of this report therefore is to assist consultants human resource managers strategic planners and corporate officers in gauging estimates of a companys human resource indicators compared to firms competing or participating in the same economic sector at the global level this report is not about whether a particular company or industry has performed well or poorly in the past or will do so in the future with the globalization of markets greater foreign competition and the reduction of entry barriers it becomes all the more important to benchmark a companys human resource indicators against other firms on a worldwide basis doing so however is not an obvious task first one needs to find firms competing in the same sector but not necessarily competing directly with the company in local markets these firms should not be perceived therefore to be direct competitors to the company in question but simply those that have been classified by various sources eg edgar or similar foreign filings as competing to serve customers in the same link of the value chain or broad industrial classification as identified by sic naics or similar codes second given the international nature of the task one needs to control for exchange rate volatility finally one needs use comparable financial standards this report overcomes these issues and gives full human resources benchmarks visavis worldwide competitors who are present in the same narrow industrial classification benchmarks cover laborasset ratios laborliability ratios and laborincome ratios since our reports are printed on demand the statistics reported are for the latest quarter and are the most up to date available  updates are produced each year each report provides

icon group searches across over  companies for others producing similar products offering similar services or are in the same stage of the value chain for a particular industrial classification we then collect the financials for each of these firms and standardize these into comparable categories assets liabilities income and ratios from there we eliminate all currency effects by standardizing
