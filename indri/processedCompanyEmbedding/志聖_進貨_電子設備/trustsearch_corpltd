of three types of structures an independent partnership a bank or a law firm each of which specializes in being a trustee of various kinds of trusts and in managing estates trust companies are not required to exercise all of the powers that they are granted further the fact that a trust company in one jurisdiction does not perform all of the trust company duties in another jurisdiction is irrelevant and does not have any bearing on whether either company is truly a trust company therefore it is safe to say that the term trust company must not be narrowly construed the trust name refers

fiduciary capacity in the administration of the corporations debt for example in a normal bank loan the lender normally lends money to the company usually with conditions called covenants accepts payments from the company monthly and monitors the financial conditions of the company to ensure that it is meeting all its agreed upon conditions for example that its ratio of profits to expenses stays above a certain amount however most large companies borrow money not from banks but by selling bonds when the company sells bonds a corporate trust company can handle the acceptance of payments from the company which it passes on to the bondholders and is the entity which monitors the company to ensure it is meeting covenants in the event of the companys bankruptcy the corporate trust company represents the interests of the bondholders and acts to recover as much of the loan proceeds as possible see alsoedit trust business antitrust monopolies nobel foundation referencesedit  wanda
