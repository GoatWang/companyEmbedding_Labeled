nasdaq ment today announced that the calibre® perc™reliability verification product has been added to the tsmc ip quality program tsmc and mentor graphics jointly developed electrical checks to help improve ip dependability as part of the tsmc qualification process the companies are also collaborating on an offering that will allow ip partners to access tsmccompliant checking on a peruse basis this extends the capabilities customers enjoy today with the calibre perc product to tsmc’s ip partners enabling further preverification of thirdparty ip and increasing the coherence between customer and thirdparty ip reliability verification “the goal of tsmc is not only to make ip easy to exchange and reuse within the tsmc open innovation platform® oip environment but also to ensure dependability quality and robustness for our customers” said suk lee tsmc senior director design infrastructure marketing division “we have done extensive work with mentor to define the initial reliability checks for tsmc which will help identify design issues that could increase the risk of failures when circuits are operating in the field” this ip quality initiative is built on top of eda enablement collaboration between tsmc and mentor graphics in the past  months automating reliability checks on previously noncheckable rules with the offering of a new esdlup checking deck from tsmc early adopters of tsmc nm nm and nm technologies have enjoyed this unique reliability solution as the benefits of tsmc are proliferated through the ip space under the program tsmc will provide ip alliance partners with calibre perc rule decks that perform reliability checks designed to address customers’ advanced circuit verification needs for electrostatic discharge esd electrical overstress eos signals crossing multiple power domains advanced erc and other reliability concerns the calibre perc product was the platform selected for these checks because it provides advanced functionality by enabling checks that combine knowledge of both the physical layout and the netlist which defines device types and connectivity in addition mentor will offer additional calibre perc service options to ip companies participating in tsmc ip submitted to tsmc can also be provided to mentor graphics where designated customer application engineers run the tsmc checks using inhouse datacenter facilities and provide the ip companies with reports indicating passfail results along with pointers to any errors and hotspots     “working closely with tsmc we’ve defined a program that makes advanced reliability checking available to all tsmc oip ip alliance partners” said joseph sawicki vice president and general manager of the designtosilicon division at mentor graphics “this means that our mutual customers will be able to incorporate tsmcqualified ip into their designs with a high confidence that those ip blocks will pass fullchip reliability checks at signoff” tsmc will implement these initial checks in their tsmc quality program starting with multiproject shuttles in early  tsmc and mentor will also be working to expand the number of checks offered to thirdparty ip providers

contents  history  locations  management  products  see also  references historyedit in  the idea of computeraided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups  those who founded mentor valid logic systems and daisy systems one of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of mentor whose backgrounds were in software development at tektronix ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications they felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the computer aided engineering cae programs they would build by february  most of the startup team had been identified by march the three executive founders tom bruggere gerry langeler and dave moffenbeier had left tektronix and by may the business plan was complete the first round of money  million came from sutter hill greylock and venrock associates the next round was  million from five venture capital firms and in april  a third round raised  million more mentor graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to oregon apollo computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform based in chelmsford apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of mentor graphics began their initial meetings when mentor entered the cae market the company had two technical differentiators the first was the software  mentor valid and daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses the second was the hardware  mentor ran all programs on the apollo workstation while daisy and valid each built their own hardware by the late s all eda companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as apollo and sun microsystems after a frenzied
