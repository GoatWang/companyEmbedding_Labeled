us something before we lose momentum againi was a little displeased there was nothing from jin kang quoted in the last pr about nokomis in my opinion the last thing we need for shareholder value and confidence is komars name anywhere in the companys statements  board members is a nice addition but having komar step aside would be the best for everyone or at the very least make no mention of him and his association with wyy we are after all attempting to turn a new page here  not be bogged down with the ball and chain of passed management decisionsmorereplyreplies jjobenot surprising the good will achieved by nopoint due to nokomis  director additions has faded the sp is back in the low s and barring some unforeseen news will eventually make its way into the s and lower nopoint continues to survive on the govt awards from the large umbrella contract awarded some years ago nopoint has yet to release info on any major commercial contracts even though they espoused over a year ago a renewed focus on commercial business in nopoints last ly report over  of revenues was attributable to the govt umbrella contractask yourself this if nopoint is such a good investment why hasnt steve at the bar komar cryin jim mccubbin or any of the other insiders purchased shares with their own funds answer is simple theres no pointmorereplyreplies gggrailpossibly some good news here but remember widepoint is not really a cybersecurity company where they fit in is more in the temsmms and credentialing arena and this is where they need to hammer out their space theres a lot of dogs in the cyber kennel many of them are larger and many just seem larger but if you look at their debt they shrink considerablywhether wyy is a great dane or a chihuahua will be determined over the next few months the stakes for the company are large and they need to perform within their defined scope and sweet spot and not get too far off course in order to move to the next levelall this must occur concurrently with any packaging of the company for any potential future sale should be interestingmorecyberheavy dhs reauthorization bill passes housethe reauthorization would boost cyber protections

shame on managementthen nokomis doubled down  reloaded up the boat a nd time after shallowing more management lies – shame on nokomis almost  years have gone by since the nd set of lies during which wyy’s  stakeholder did absolutely nothing proactive or constructive finally wyy’s largest shareholder showed a little initiate and proposed  additional directorshowever the one director they nominated prof paul johnson who has excellent knowledge and prospective of wyy and its board  who previously questioned wyy’s financial reporting and shenanigans by management was blocked by komar and mort  feckless nokomis rolled their heels the net effect of all of this is that there are only  directors added to the board which in effect carry no weightwe still have komar in charge of the board  the majority of the directors clearly support komar even when the company’s financial reporting  fiduciary responsibility come into questionin addition to this nyweide failed  so the same management team which mislead investors  destroyed the value of wyy  burned through s of millions of capital raised proceeds continue to be in charge to expect a different outcome now with the same management in place  the same people in control is borderline psychotic   morereplyreplies rrichwhat kind of changes can the new board members promote to effect change possibly sell out merge split additional cost cutting more management changes privatize spin off one of the divisions hire more cyber specialist or even a cyber consulting firm what changes can we expect or hope for other then the two new board members well for one the expense cutting of the last three quarters should be taken effect we have two less executives salaries approx k plus sales and development cost were reduced also some real estate sales transaction and general consolidations all should be adding up to less expenses and more profits most of these were started last year by komar and accelerated under the departed nyweide and should start showing up soon more importantly is the new revenue potential that exist with the many b gov it contracts that are being decided right now widepoint wisely decided not to go after any single part of these contacts bidding themselves but to use a more universal approach and contract with others to allow them to use their mobile security and identity solutions when they bid we all know about the agreements with samsung att hp kyrocera and others i know i keep repeating this but a good part of widepoints future depends on the many b gov it contracts like the alliant  who wins the awards and how much is widepoint involved if the winners are samsung att and hp individually or even as a team widepoint will benefit greatly nextgov says “winning a slot on alliant  could absolutely make a company’s decade”right now the new board members most likely will do just like most of us are doing waiting to see how the streamlining and expense reduction of the past three quarters will work out and how the many large government cyber contracts now being decided pan out in a perfect world cost will be reduced new contracts start rolling in new investors join us and the
