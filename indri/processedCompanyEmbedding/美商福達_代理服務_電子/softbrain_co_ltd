announced strong growth in sales and profit in fy consolidated net sales increased  yoy to ¥mn operating income rose  to ¥mn ordinary income climbed  to ¥mn and net profit attributable to owners of parent increased  to ¥mn net sales rose for a fifth consecutive year reaching a record high for the third year in a row while operating income rose for a third consecutive year reaching a record high for the first time in  years operating income reached ¥mn for the first time in the company’s history earnings growth was due to strong performances from the company’s two mainstay businesses the esales manager related business and the field marketing business both of which achieved growth is sales and profits the operating income margin improved by  percentage points to  on sales growth in the esales manager related business which boasts a high marginal profit ratio the net profit attributable to owners of parent rose at a faster rate than ordinary income owing to a decline in the effective tax rate the company also surpassed its earnings targets which it revised upward in october  we understand this is because in h the company secured multiple largescale projects for esales manager and also won more orders than expected for salessolutionsfocused consulting and skills training doubledigit sales and profit growth in two mainstay businesses  trends by business segment  esales manager related business in the esales manager related business net sales for external customers same below increased  yoy to ¥mn and segment profit rose  to ¥mn sales of esales manager which account for over  of segment sales rose  yoy on strong sales of cloudtype and hostingtype services sales of consulting and skills training for sales person also rose  on strong demand segment profit margin showed significant improvement rising to  from  in fy on sales growth from highmargin esales manager multiple largescale projects secured in h contributed to this sales growth because of its ease of use some customers have switched from competing products to esales manager  field marketing business the field marketing business posted recordhigh earnings with net sales increasing  yoy to ¥mn and segment profit rising  to ¥mn amid a shift to outsourcing by consumergoods manufacturers for their field activity operations at stores the company’s services have earned an excellent reputation among these manufacturers and this has enabled it to acquire the largescale projects that made a sizable contribution to the increases in sales and profits in this segment a feature of the company’s services is that it charges on a pervisit basis which clarifies costs for customers furthermore one of its strengths is that it is able to provide a variety of services including temporary staffing services that are tailored to meet customer needs and this was also a factor behind the company’s strong earnings  systems development business in the systems development business net sales increased  yoy to ¥mn and segment profit rose by  times to ¥mn in the context of its limited human resources the company is prioritizing securing stable earnings through careful project management growth in sales and profit was achieved in fy by deepening relationships with existing clients while forging relationships with new clients amid growth in it investment in japan  publication business in the publication business net sales increased  yoy to ¥mn and segment profit rose by  times to ¥mn while the publishing industry is shrinking owing to the emergence of ebooks there is still strong demand from companies for publications used to strengthen brands or as part of their pr activities and sales in this segment continued to trend upward profit also rose owing to sales growth and a decline in the allowance for costs related to publication inventory continued strengthening of financial position and rising profitability  financial position and management indicators looking at the financial position at the end of december  total assets increased by ¥mn compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥mn current assets rose ¥mn mainly due to the increases in notes and accounts receivable of ¥mn cash and deposits of ¥mn total liabilities increased ¥mn compared to the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥mn interestbearing debt decreased ¥mn while accounts payableother increased ¥mn advances received rose ¥mn and income taxes payable rose ¥mn net assets grew ¥mn to ¥mn primarily due to the recording of profit attributable to owners of parent all of the company’s main management indicators are improving amid earnings growth its shareholders’ equity ratio an indicator of stability rose to  in fy from  in fy and its interestbearing debt ratio declined to  from  the company has greatly strengthened its financial position over the past few years as net cash current deposits minus interestbearing debt rose to ¥mn about  times higher than three years ago ¥mn looking at profitability indicators operating margin roa and roe are all rising we believe the company has built a management base capable of generating sustainably high profitability ◆future outlook the company expects continued growth in sales and profit in fy but the forecast looks conservative  fy consolidated results outlook in fy the company forecasts that consolidated net sales will rise  yoy to ¥mn operating income will increase  to ¥mn ordinary income will rise  to ¥mn and net profit attributable to owners of parent will be up  to ¥mn while the pace of growth is slowdown to the singledigit range we believe the companys forecast is conservative in that it only includes factors that the company can estimate at present however esales manager orders look strong so far in fy and in the field marketing business we expect a positive impact from measures taken in fy to expand business bases and strengthen the company’s organizational structure therefore unless the market environment takes a turn for the worse we believe the company is very likely to surpass its forecast again in fy targeting further growth from esales manager through enhanced functionality and new product launches  trends in main businesses  esales manager related business the company continues to enhance the functions of esales manager as a sales support tool that is “no for usability” we expect to continue to grow steadily in this fiscal year in january  the company released esales manager remix analytics which provides optional functions that greatly enhance bi capabilities this function incorporates technology from tableau japan a leader in the bi tools market and features quick data visibility and an intuitive user interface ui wherein colorful graphs based on multifaceted data analysis can be quickly and easily displayed while most bi tools are capable of highlevel data analysis they also require expert operators and come with high costs in terms of time and money in many cases even if this tool was introduced it cannot accelerate management decision and strategic planning esales manager remix analytics meets the problems of customers because it resolves these issues allowing anyone to conduct data analysis in real time so we expect that the introduction needs is high in february the company formed an alliance with shanon inc provider of the shanon marketing platform smp and holder of the top market share in japan for ma tools for the past seven consecutive years integrating sales departments’ sales support tools and marketing departments’ ma tools allows clients to secure prospective customers identify correlations alert the sales department of highdeparturechance customers and make effective use of sales results when planning marketing activities as a first step a function was added whereby data entered in an online form generated on the smp can be quickly registered as business card data in esales manager and smp prospective customer data and esales manager customer and business card data can be mutually interlinked this allows integrated management and shared use of data by sales and marketing departments thereby allowing companies to develop more strategic sales activities the company plans to add more integrated functions such as an action history sharing function that allows more precise scoring through the sharing of action history data because of the close relationship between sales and marketing activities we expect such integrated functions to help the company make further progress in the area of customer development  field marketing business we expect that the field marketing business will grow steadily over the medium term as mentioned above consumergoods manufacturers are continuing to shift to outsourcing for their field activity operations at stores and we believe the company’s ability to respond to a wide range of customer needs by leveraging its “cast” registered staff members of around  people across the country will continue to be a strength with the japanese labor force expected to shrink year by year housewives are expected to play a larger part in the labor market we will be paying attention to mediumterm developments for the company’s effective utilization of housewives as a labor force which is part of its business model ◆shareholder returns and relationship with scala resumed dividend distributions in fy after an year hiatus the company indicates the dividend policy payout ratio of roughly   shareholder return policy on march   the company announced hitherto undecided fy dividend distributions of ¥ per share and fy dividend distributions of ¥ per share the company had halted dividend distributions in order to strengthen its financial position which was weakened by the failure of lehman brothers and prioritize investment in development thereafter the company achieved recordhigh earnings in fy and has accumulated sizable internal reserves so the company determined that its financial position was strong enough to resume dividend distributions after a hiatus of  years also in discussions with top shareholder scala regarding increasing of softbrain’s corporate value it was decided that the dividend payout ratio should remain at approximately  from fy onward unless a particular need for capital arises based on this dividend plan fy dividend distributions have been set at ¥ per share dividend payout ratio of  as a result we expect dividends to increase if earnings growth continues  relationship with scala on december   the company announced that it had terminated negotiations with top shareholder scala regarding a business tieup while cross selling and joint development partnerships were initially suggested it was determined that the two companies should pursue independent growth strategies as their customer bases softbrain focuses on corporate sales and marketing while scala focuses on it systems and business fields are different and few synergistic benefits are therefore possible thereafter the relationship between the two companies became strained as scala submitted shareholder proposals nomination of directors and auditors and allocation of surplus funds but amid discussions regarding increasing of softbrain’s corporate value it was announced on march  that the shareholder proposals had been withdrawn we understand that as a condition of this withdrawal if softbrain implements capital policies that would reduce the ratio of scala’s ownership it must offer scala an opportunity to participate in any such financing under the same conditions so as to maintain its ownership ratio in addition it was agreed that the dividend payout ratio should remain at approximately  unless a particular need for capital arises as long as these conditions are met we understand that scala has agreed to submit no further shareholder proposals and softbrain will continue to work to increase corporate value over the mediumtolong term under current management   ，，。 top 【】 ，、，。，。，、，。。 　　　　～　　ads securitiesfxcmfiscoironfxmorning starifitislipperemerging capitalingsaxoiforexswissquote     no
