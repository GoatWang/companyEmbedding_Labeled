authoragauthor write a comment rest assured how you treat everyone in a business is noticed and it has meaning credit getty images although he had been rude to my receptionist on the phone when trying to make an appointment and had refused to expand on what he was selling i agreed to see a very persistent advertising salesman mainly to stop him bugging the receptionist when he was led into my office he turned on his salesmans pitch all sugar and spice he was very polite incredibly attentive and his product was quite good even though i was wary because my staff had said he had been quite rude i gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided to buy from him after he had left several of my team came in and complained about how he had treated them when he had come into the office for his appointment he was hostile overly familiar and totally inappropriate that was it for me i didnt care how good his product was i didnt want anything to do with him or his company i rang him and told him only to receive a torrent of abuse before he slammed down the phone if i am not sure about a person i always ask my team what they think i ask them how the person acted when making their appointment how they treated the staff i put a lot of stock in how people treat my staff and i make no allowance for arrogance many a sales deal has been killed because rude sales people treat only the decision maker with respect my philosophy is to treat everyone in a business as a decision maker because in reality they all influence the outcome in some shape or form it all comes back to respect and we soon see through someone who only turns on the charm when they get in front of the boss to sell them something the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those

our product development includes extensive market input and feedback enabling us to introduce quality parts that address the most indemand parts you need for your business quality evaluation  benchmarking with a focus on exacting precision dorman analyzes both original parts and individual components at the beginning of its design process dorman’s analysis establishes a complete product baseline that enables it to identify oe design flaws as opportunities for design improvements these steps assure that every dorman window regulator released to the market delivers on its promise of proper fit form and long lasting function rigorous quality testing dimensional coordinate measuring the dimensional coordinate measuring of the doors helps minimize the risk of damage to the replacement regulator by eliminating the need to alter the product during installation no bending twisting or adjusting is required dorman’s regulator achieves a perfect fit right out of the box tensile testing tensile testing is used to evaluate individual elements of the part assembly this test measures the strength of the cable and the amount of force needed to unsecure the cable from its mounting or for the cable to fray material hardness testing extensive testing verifies that the correct material is being used for the application if a material tests poorly the dorman engineering team continues testing to determine if the failure is design or material related and makes the adjustments necessary to resolve the problem and provide a best in class product motor dyno testing this certifies motor performance of original window regulator and dormans redesigned window regulator verifies that the original part meets or exceeds the declared horsepower rating and the dorman part meets or exceeds our standards for performance cycle testing cycle testing validates the durability and performance of every dorman regulator and motor over extended cycles each regulator is installed in its corresponding door and tested for  cycles which is equivalent to three to four years of normal use onvehicle testing each and every dorman window regulator is tested on a vehicle to ensure a troublefree installation excellent performance and operational durability this reallife testing assists in creating stepbystep installation instructions and gives insight into future product enhancements innovation window slides oe problem plastic inserts used in original window slide becomes brittle and cracks over time allowing cable ends to tear free dorman replaced the original plastic with a nylon material which improved the durability and eliminated the premature pullout of the window regulator cable cable slides oe problem original cable guide relies on a rectangular design that commonly breaks causing the cable to pull free dorman redesigned the rectangular cable end to a cylindrical design with robust material to prevent breakage mounting brackets oe problem originally designed as a flat stamped steel piece that had the tendency to bend under limited regulator stress dorman replaced the original steel with a thicker more durable metal and reengineered the bracket in a rollededge design for additional strength this allows the bracket to withstand greater wear stress than the original design metal arms oe problem these metal arms were originally designed with mm steel and had the tendency to bend and twist under normal use dorman redesigned the metal arms with an improved grade of metal at an increased thickness to prevent the bending and twisting
