than  million or  of its original goal now stop and think about that for a moment if demand gets up to that point which i believe it can i cant wait to see the impact it will have once users start enjoying the power of wireless charging technology and telling their friends and family about it ill admit that i was a bit skeptical at first but that quickly changed once i started using it the advantages clearly outweigh any disadvantages i still havent found any disadvantages and have been extremely pleased with how fast it charges since ive been using the charging pads my phone is never on its death bed anymore and is easy and efficient to use as ill explain in my articles next week ill personally never go back to charging my phone with cables and this is why i wasnt surprised to see the positive reaction from the market as i tweeted out leading up to wednesdays launch twitter link conclusion with fli charge getting off to a fast start on indiegogo shares also started taking off wednesday as you can see in the image below shares of fh climbed as high as  a three month high before settling at  for a gain of  volume was  million compared to a threemonth average of k and a day average of k if shares can climb and hold over the  level expect to see a nice run which will should test the  levels the great thing about fli charge is that it will give the company another growing revenue stream as it continues to grow and monetize its patents and intellectual portfolios the company reached a settlement agreement with another infringer for m last month and looks well on its way to getting other patent infringers to come to the table the company has already reached agreements with microsoft nasdaqmsft zte otcpkztcoy among many others management has also been using fli charge for a long time now and knew there would demand after testing it out that demand is certainly out there and today proved it fli charge even started trending in indiegogo and has gained a lot of positive feedback from backers as you can see in the image below so with over  in cash per share fh is still highly undervalued and as the funding increases over the next month dont be surprised to see fhs share price continue trending upwards as the market has no choice but to factor that value into the company disclaimer link follow me on twitter and stocktwits disclosure i amwe are long fh i
