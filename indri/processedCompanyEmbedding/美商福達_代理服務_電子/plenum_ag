guthrie to establish a development group to create a turboprop engine designed to replace piston engines demand for the wasp radial engine was still strong and its production lines output was robust and profitable riley gave guthrie a modest budget of c guthrie recruited young engineers from the national research council in ottawa and from orenda engines in ontario in  the group began development of a turboprop engine intended to deliver  shaft horsepower the first engine was powered up and run successfully in february  it first flew on  may  mounted on a beech  aircraft at de havilland canadas downsview ontario facility fullscale production started in  entering service the next year by the th anniversary of its maiden flight in  over  ptas had been delivered not including the other versions the engine is used in over  different applications when de havilland canada asked for a much larger engine roughly twice the power of the large pt pratt  whitney canada responded with a new design initially known as the pt during development this was renamed to become the pratt  whitney canada pw turboprops such as the pt and pw may have a bypass ratio over  although propeller airflow is slower than for turbofans designedit epicyclic reduction gears on pratt  whitney canada pt gas turbine engine all versions of the engine consist of two sections that can be easily separated for maintenance a gas generator supplies hot gas to a free power turbine the starter has to accelerate only the gas generator making the engine easy to start particularly in cold weather air enters the gasgenerator through an inlet screen into the lowpressure axial compressor this has three stages on small and medium versions of the engine and four stages on large versions the air then flows into a singlestage centrifugal compressor through a folded annular combustion chamber and finally through a singlestage turbine that powers the compressors at about  rpm hot gas from the gas generator flows into the power turbine which turns at about  rpm it has one stage on the small engines and two stages on the medium and large ones for turboprop use this powers a twostage planetary output reduction gearbox which turns the propeller at a speed of  to  rpm the exhaust gas then escapes through two sidemounted ducts in the power turbine housing the turbines are mounted inside the combustion chamber reducing overall length in most aircraft installations the pt is mounted backwards in the nacelle so that the intake side of the engine is facing the rear of the aircraft this places the power section at the front of the nacelle where it can drive the propeller directly without the need for a long shaft intake air is usually fed to the engine via an underside mounted duct and the two exhaust outlets are directed rearward this arrangement aids maintenance by allowing the entire power section to be removed along with the propeller exposing the gasgenerator section to facilitate roughfield operations foreign objects are diverted from the compressor intake by inertial separators in the inlet accessories then intake at left covered exhaust at right then propeller mount operational historyedit inflight shutdown rate was  per  hours in  in canada  per  hours up to october  with  delivered engines flown more than  million hours the pt family logged  million flight hours from  to  while powertoweight ratio was improved by  brake specific fuel consumption by  and overall pressure ratio reached  its development continues and while today its highlevel configuration is the same as
