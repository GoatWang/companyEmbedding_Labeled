exponential moving average period deviation look back period oscillator sma periods signal sma periods takes the average of data over a period of time and migrates the period across the data series one data point at a time this formula smooths a data series and makes analysing volatile data easier a moving average that gives more weight to the more recent data in the period and less weight to the older data in the period compares a short period moving average and a long period moving average of prices macd is used with a day exponential moving average as a signal that identifies buying or selling moments a momentum oscillator formula that compares upward movements of the close price with downward movements rsi is considered overbought when above  and oversold when below  calculates the rate of price change compared with historical data it calculates the rate of change against a period of days prior to the current price the output is a percentage a moving average of the volume rather than the price vma represents the average volume over the specified periods of time and can be used to chart a stock calculates the standard deviation above and below a simple moving average of the data since standard deviation is a measure of volatility a large standard deviation indicates a volatile market and a smaller standard deviation indicates a calmer market a momentum indicator that compares closing price with the price range over a given time period a moving average is taken of the stochastic oscillator which reduces sensitivity to market fluctuations a fully customizable
