culture what drives us purpose passion and the power to affect change through design transcript of the video follows skip transcript pberic weyantb a culture of design really requires a lot of dialogue between people that are leading the firm and leading the direction of the firm as well as the ability to harness and take advantage of all the ideas that lots of people that work at the firm and participate at the firm havep pbamber lutherb every office seems to have their sort of uniqueness that allows them to develop their process and utilize that process on projects when you start to use an interdisciplinary or interoffice team that sort of evolves and becomes something entirely differentp pbanton germishuizenb design culture comes from leadership it comes from youth it comes from talent and i think it comes from driving a strong dialogue in an organization on the subjectp pblarry weeksb today more than ever successful environments are multiperspectival i think the messy vitality that happens in places that are loved by people that are successful and urban places – its very difficult for one person to get that i think the ways to get that is to entertain and nourish and fuel lots of voices coming together i think thats one reason that we focus on lots of disciplines within our office in fact every individual in our office can work across these disciplines so we speak with lots of voicesp pbjustin perdueb i think whats important in our healthy design culture is that youre always asking questions and youre never accepting what has been done before as the truth you should always be looking for new ideas and making sure that youre doing it the right way not just the way its been done beforep pbmichael moxamb an environment where people feel that the dialogue

collaborationp pbtranscriptbp pbtammy dioriobnbsp everything about what clarks wanted to do was mix the old and the new to bring our heritage but make it modern we were in an old mill building it was very industrial which we liked but as we grew we were very disconnected that impacted how we could uh work together and collaborate we were using a lot of space but not very effectively we didnt have a lot of open areas to gather and feel like one company we made a strong effort to try to make this new building something that clarks could be proud of and also bring clarks into the futurep pbsteve basquebnbspnbsp its all about that connection the atrium brings people into the space and then we ascend up the stair or you get off the elevator and you can see work being done in all of the spaces around the atriump pbtammy dioriobnbsp i think the biggest change is that our product was not displayed in the best way in the old building we worked together to really develop new spaces to showcase the product and for the designers to design the productp pbsteve basquebnbspnbsp the hand craftsmanship of the product and the attention to detail was probably the most important thing that weve tried to focus on that it doesnt have to be old to be craftedp pbsteven kellybnbspnbspnbspnbsp we understood clarks history you youve got a shoe company that has been around for almost  years theyve got the highest grade technology available to you theyre still taking wood blocks and putting it on the wood lathe like they did  years ago and then machine by hand with files to perfection so its a great story that combined their history with their present with an eye to the futurep pbtammy dioriobnbsp the employees have stopped me in the hallway just saying how much they love the building they love the collaborationp pbjohn dainenbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspbfor us as the model makers its been a vast improvement weve got the north light which we didnt use to have we used to have to close the light out with blinds because of the direct sunlight in the summerp pbpatrick gracebnbspnbspnbsp as a designer what we need is definitely lots of natural light which we are provided with here its nice that on each floor on each end theres a convenient little kitchenette that we all have access to with coffee and its great because you run into people that you may have had the opportunity to run into in the previous building that has been a great great changep pbdonna leungbnbspnbspnbsp now that weve been working in this building for about six months it really has reinvigorated everyone to work more closely together because the open nature of this building really fosters creativity and collaboration we can go off into a little nook and come up with creative ideas brainstorm ideasp pbgary

revit® mep revit® architecture and revit® structure software products“since adopting the revit platform we’ve seen much more effective interaction among the disciplines during the design process—and significantly better coordination” —stanis smith senior vice president stantec the firmfounded as a oneperson engineering consulting business in  stantec has grown to become a world leader in the delivery of sustainable and innovative solutions to both public and privatesector clients working from more than  locations throughout north america and the caribbean the firm’s  engineers architects and other employees provide a wide range of services including planning mechanical electrical and plumbing mep engineering architectural design surveying and project management over the years the firm has won numerous honors including most recently an international award from the american society of heating refrigerating and airconditioning engineers multiple disciplines one platformin july  stantec adopted revit® mep building information modeling bim software an intuitive design tool that works the way mechanical electrical and plumbing engineers think “we adopted revit mep primarily because it suits our approach to integrated design” says stanis smith senior vice president at stantec using the new software mep engineers can now collaborate effectively with the firm’s structural engineers and architects who recently implemented revit® structure and revit® architecture software a shared digital modelall of the revit applications are all built on a common software platform enabling the integration of key building disciplines in a shared building information model and allowing more effective communication and collaboration between all participants in the project delivery “by working with shared revit architecture revit mep and revit structure models on our projects—the architects engineers and external consultants all have a clear uptodate vision of the project and we can all make better decisions faster” says bill moore stantec’s practice technology coordinator the challengeone of those projects was the westin kelowna hotel in british columbia canada “it’s quite a large project—almost  square feet” says mikko leppanen one of the architects responsible for helping to spearhead revit implementation at the firm’s vancouver office “it’s a room story hotel that includes commercial retail units a restaurant a fitness room commercial kitchens a ballroom and an outdoor pool” the site also has an adjoining threestory parking garage historic location“that makes it one of the larger and more complex buildings to be located in the city of kelowna” says leppanen “and because the building is located in a historic part of the city the design of the hotel had to fit into the existing historical context” the solutionto perform the initial architectural work on the westin project stantec used autocad® software “then in spring of  stantec initiated a pilot project for implementation of the revit platform” says leppanen “while continuing to use autocad the design team began to create a parallel building information model with revit architecture within a few months the transition from autocad to revit architecture was complete and the design team proceeded into late design development and working drawings completely in revit” collaborate more effectivelyrevit structure greatly simplified collaboration with the external structural engineer on the westin project “the consultants at glotman simpson were very well versed in the use of revit structure” says leppanen “that made collaboration easy” bypass drelated problemslater in the project stantec brought its own mechanical and electrical teams on board “revit mep facilitated collaboration among all the teams on a single fully coordinated parametric model enabling us to deliver integrated solutions that bypassed the problems inherent in drawingbased technologies” says smith achieve outstanding coordination with parametric change management“revit is simply fantastic from a coordination point of view” says leppanen “we were able to rely on a link between the architectural and structural models that enabled either team to make design changes with reasonable confidence that the other team’s model would be automatically updated”stantec also saw improvements in coordination on the squarefoot renovation and expansion of the edmonton art gallery “that was the first major project we undertook in edmonton using revit mep” says clark “we’re adding two floors onto the existing building and including some spectacular new architectural features” easily model vital systemsthe team used revit mep to model the gallery’s stateoftheart mechanical and electrical systems including ductwork visible storm water piping and central plant equipment the software was particularly valuable in helping the engineers quickly and precisely coordinate new duct and equipment locations throughout the gallery’s complex existing areas simplify complex design challenges“revit mep absolutely helped us deal with the difficulties of blending the existing structure—and all of its underlying equipment and pipes—with the new additions” says mitchell “it would have been a nightmare without the model with the revit mep model our understanding of the building is incalculably better the way it helps us understand how the existing and new structures interrelate and what impact the changes will have on the building systems is absolutely the greatest advantage it has provided us” build better working relationshipsa better understanding of the project can also lead to better more efficient working relationships among the disciplines “using the revit model we can now cut our own sections” says clark “that gives us a much better picture of the building and also cuts down on the number of requests we have to make for sections from the architects” create stunning walkthroughs“and because we used the software to create our own walkthroughs i feel like i already know the building” adds clark “it gives everyone a much better sense of how the end product will actually look to the occupants of the building that’s tremendous especially because it allows us to show the architects that we’re thinking aesthetically about their building—and not just about how the pipes work” analyze earlier and more effectivelystantec engineers are particularly excited about the ies plugin for revit mep “we have a separate group that does a lot of building energy and performance analysis” says leppanen “ies is their analysis software of choice” using the revities plugin engineers can quickly calculate heating and cooling loads from within revit mep—without tedious data reentry alternatively they can import revit model data directly into ies and use the ies suite to carry out the full range of sustainable design analyses “we believe that the revities plugin will help us reduce the time it takes to model a project in ies ” use bim for better decisionsthis helps the firm venture into sustainable design in a way that it couldn’t easily do before “the link between the revit platform and the ies has the potential to provide us with a lot of energy analysis feedback very early in a project” says leppanen “this feedback is critical in helping us to make better design decisions early on in the design process—when they have the most impact on the energy and sustainable performance of the building” build sustainable solutionsthe ies plugin also helps the firm more easily achieve leed certification “an important part of our vision is to create solutions that conserve energy and reduce the need for scarce natural resources” says leppanen “we have quite a few projects at various levels of leed certification—from certified silver to gold as a matter of best practice sustainable design principles inform our projects regardless of whether or not they will be leed” easily repurpose design data“one of the many reasons that i really enjoy working in revit is that it takes very little effort to generate colored diagrams that illustrate information about the building such as functional diagrams generating area calculations is also tremendously easy” says leppanen “it’s just fantastic doing that using traditional design applications would take a huge effort and when we need more ‘photo realistic’ images we can always export data from the model into autodesk viz” serve clients better“our hope is that the revit platform will let us continue to do the tasks we’re already doing—just more effectively” says leppanen “in addition there is the potential for us to offer a whole range of enhanced services that build on the revit platform for example using the revit model we could easily provide quantity takeoffs or d images that would be very useful to our clients” exchange information easilywhen working with external clients stantec engineers share files and information using the autodesk® buzzsaw® ondemand collaborative project management solution “we have quite a large buzzsaw site” says moore “we’re using it on several major international projects where we have to contend with multiple time zones geographic separation of design teams and vast amounts of data being manipulated and edited daily buzzsaw has virtually eliminated the need for us to ship cds and dvds not only is it much faster but it’s also helped us cut communications costs tenfold” autocad civil d offers a civil solutionother autodesk products have helped the firm further increase efficiency for example several stantec offices recently began migrating from autocad® land desktop software to autocad® civil d® software a comprehensive product for the design analysis and documentation of a wide range of civil engineering project types “civil d enables us to get things done much faster and more efficiently for our clients” says david kasha practice technology coordinator “for example we can look at more design alternatives a lot more quickly and also make latestage revisions much faster” unify design teamsthe dynamic civil model at the core of autocad civil d also makes it easy to enforce cad standards “for example if our toronto office delivers a model to our calgary office and it’s not quite right—let’s say the styles are wrong—all we have to do is drag the correct styles from the calgary template drawings into the new drawings” says kasha “that’s a huge benefit to us in terms of worksharing” the resultsince adopting buzzsaw civil d and the revit platform in some of the firm’s offices stantec has begun to expand implementation of the products across the enterprise “we absolutely view these products as a potential competitive advantage as we move forward” says moore ”they’re being taken very seriously within our organization in fact people in our other offices have begun looking for suitable revit pilot projects for their own teams and we also envision the entire company migrating to civil d over the next two years” better more profitable projects“our kelowna office is using revit structure on projects in conjunction with external architects” says moore “plus in regina we’re working on a university project that involves both revit structure and revit architecture one of the largest projects currently under way is in toronto our office there is taking on three millionplus healthcare facilities—all using revit architecture” greater recognitionrecently autodesk honored stantec with the revit bim experience award for effective integration of the entire revit bim platform—with both inhouse multidisciplinary groups and external project team members the award also recognizes advanced implementation of revit mep for improved design coordination informed design decision making and integration with analysis applications pacific alliance technologiespacific alliance technologies of vancouver british columbia provided stantec with training and implementation services for the revit platform “they are very knowledgeable” says moore “we’d be hardpressed to find a question that would stump them”for additional information about these and other autodesk products visit wwwautodeskcomproducts to learn more about stantec visit wwwstanteccom download the story stanteccustomerstorypdf

hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater the process requires creating the necessary environmental conditions to promote the growth of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria these bacteria can be either naturally occurring or added to the groundwater the primary environmental factor which influences biodegradation is the availability of oxygen to promote microbial growth in addition nutrients can be added to further promote microbial growth where necessary oxygen can be delivered to the groundwater through a number of processes including  injecting air into the groundwater air sparging  reinjection of groundwater which has been aerated on surface and  injection of hydrogen peroxide into the groundwater the particular method used depends upon a number of factors including soil and contaminant characteristics in situ bioremediation is an emerging technology which has successfully been applied to remediation of dissolved hydrocarbon contaminants under a variety of site conditions service

crystal ball  product name erealvantage product name iscprime product name calpuff product name biochlor product name aermod product name aquifer test product name vapour extraction also called vacuum extraction soil venting and in situ volatilization vapour extraction is an effective technique for in situ remediation of sites contaminated with hydrocarbons or other volatile chemicals the technology involves the application of a vacuum to the vadose zone to remove the soil gases causing evaporation and removal of the volatile compounds it is accepted by regulatory agencies and has been a highly successful treatment technology for vadose zone soils twophase vapour extraction a variation on the basic technique can remove soil gases free product and contaminated groundwater its main advantages are achieving remedial objectives in situ within a relatively short time frame in a costeffective manner also in most cases the technology can be applied using simple reliable and readily available equipment with minimum site disruption product name air dispersion modelling air dispersion modelling is the primary solution for determining atmospheric pollutant levels at points distant from a source such as the impact of an industry on nearby residential areas the modelling involves knowledge of the pollutant source geography and climatological conditions models such as isc for industrial sources like exhaust stacks and landfills or caline for traffic pollution are recognized by regulators as providing reasonably accurate predictions of pollutant concentrations these programs combined have the capability of providing city wide air quality models including all industries and accounting for traffic patterns with the correct information air quality modelling can be performed anywhere and relies mainly on the quality of the source information and computer capability product name risk assessment risk assessment is an evaluation process used to describe the nature and magnitude of the risk associated with exposure of human or ecological receptors to a potential hazard ie chemicals or potentially hazardous activities risk assessment typically involves  problem formation contaminant pathway and receptor screening development of a conceptual model of exposure  data analysis exposure and toxicity assessment and  risk characterization risk estimation uncertainty analysis risk assessment can be either qualitative or quantitative depending on the nature and extent of the potential hazard risk management is the process of identification and implementation of appropriate measures to reduce or prevent potential risks as part of the risk management process effective risk communication is essential to ensure that all affected individuals understand the nature of the potential risk the possible effects and the importance of correct implementation of any risk management strategy product name strategic risk management approach to

development mechanisms evaluation of offsets sinks air quality and pollution control systems for all sectors point area and mobile source emission estimates education education and training programs public consultation product name in situ bioremediation in situ bioremediation involves the use of bacteria to naturally degrade dissolved hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater the process requires creating the necessary environmental conditions to promote the growth of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria these bacteria can be either naturally occurring or added to the groundwater the primary environmental factor which influences biodegradation is the availability of oxygen to promote microbial growth in addition nutrients can be added to further promote microbial growth where necessary oxygen can be delivered to the groundwater through a number of processes including  injecting air into the groundwater air sparging  reinjection of groundwater which has been aerated on surface and  injection of hydrogen peroxide into the groundwater the particular method used depends upon a number of factors including soil and contaminant characteristics in situ bioremediation is an emerging technology which has successfully been applied to remediation of dissolved hydrocarbon contaminants under a variety of site conditions service name consulting engineer  buildingsother stantec provides
