boiler hydronics about us csp concentrated solar power csp represents the most potential for providing energy from sunlight most people are familiar with images of the giant utility scale heliostat fields reflecting sunlight on a central tower where the heat gets used to produce steam for turbine generators there are many other kinds of solar concentrating systems including parabolic dishes troughs fresnel mirrors stirling engine systems and cpv recently there have been several large heliostat projects which represent one form of active csp parabolic troughs are the best example of an effective semipassive csp home csp manufactures our own parabolic ribs and heat fins for standard and compound parabolic trough applications these precut panels make assembling your own parabolic trough as easy as possible csp may also be categorized by application electricity heat or light photovoltaic systems can benefit from csp but conventional pv cells suffer from the fact that their output voltage goes down as temperature increases some systems use special high temperature cells while others utilize the excess heat by transferring it to a fluid for other use in what is called a combined heat and power system chp current csp market analyses have focused entirely on utility scale projects involving both heliostat and parabolic trough reflector systems the energy from these projects is ultimately intended largely for domestic and small business use so forecasts for market investment of  billion in csp over the next decade are certainly a reflection of the consumer demand as the home csp market has been completely ignored by the solar industry transitioning a profitable product from novelty item to mass market represents a huge opportunity while energy in sunlight peaks in the visible frequencies nearly half of the energy in sunlight is in the form of heat ie infrared and often we need energy in the home to make heat by concentrating the sun’s power on a smaller area greater heat transfer efficiency is achieved and by manipulating solar light with mirrors we can transport the heat to where it is needed without having to convert it to electricity first yielding an even more dramatic efficiency advantage  at a basic level there are two forms of concentrated solar energy active and passive active systems employ motors to track the sun and maximize efficiency passive systems simply attempt to gather as much energy as possible in a static configuration why now recent developments in microprocessors and embedded software technology have allowed the creation lowcost specialized controllers capable of the sophisticated analysis needed to make csp convenient practical and affordable by combining the latest microelectronics technology with physics and astronomy and applying results to the needs of the home a truly new paradigm of energy usage is possible with rising energy prices and widespread insecurity due to dependence on problematic sources why not utilize the energy falling on your home for free already you’ll enjoy peace of mind as well as one less bill thermal energy parabolic reflectors thermal energy › powered by

solutions systems integration services and dense cluster computing systems today announced that it is enhancing the myricom  gigabit ethernet adapter product line by adding gbaset support with this interface the myrig products can now deliver gigabitsecond speeds over a familiar rj ethernet connector and twisted pair cables for a number of different customer applications adoption of gbaset ethernet ports had been slow due to their high cost and high power consumption compared to available  gigabit ethernet gbe alternatives  however recent advances in semiconductor technology have dramatically changed both parameters and are now driving strong growth  according to crehan research gbaset is the fastest growing gbe connectivity solution in data centers and is expected to exceed all other alternatives by  reaching more than  million ports in   but data centers are only one of the markets that require fast network transfer speeds and the convenience of gbaset “the video content creation market has already embraced gbaset because of the high  gigabit ethernet wire speed and the convenience of running up to  meters on standard cat a cables” said ron amborn presidentceo of maxx digital a leading provider of cutting edge storage solutions for the feature film industry  “we have a long relationship with myricom and are very excited about both the gbaset introduction and cspi’s investments in the myrig product family” “the machine vision market embraced gigabit ethernet with the gige vision standard and is now ready to transition to gbe” according to john ilett president of emergent vision technologies which develops ultrahigh speed cameras for industrial and machine vision applications  “we have worked closely with myricom and their mva software and are pleased to see the gbaset enhancement  our customers want the high throughput provided by gbe along with the convenience of running through cat a cables” “we are very pleased with the market acceptance of our gbaset announcement” said william bent vpgm multicomputer division of cspi  “we are focused on delivering key networking technology enhancements through the myricom product family to
