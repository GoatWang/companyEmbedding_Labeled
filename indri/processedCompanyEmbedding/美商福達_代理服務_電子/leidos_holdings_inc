share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets asset impairment charges restructuring expenses acquisition and integration costs amortization of equity method investments gains and losses on disposal of assets and businesses and adjustments to the income tax provision to reflect nongaap exclusions see leidos nongaap financial measures and the related reconciliation included elsewhere in this release the company does not provide a reconciliation of forwardlooking adjusted ebitda margins nongaap or nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to gaap net income loss due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation because certain deductions for nongaap exclusions used to calculate projected net income loss may vary significantly based on actual events the company is not able to forecast on a gaap basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a gaap calculation of projected net income loss at this time the amounts of these deductions may be material and therefore could result in projected gaap net income loss and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations being materially less than projected adjusted ebitda margins nongaap and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations conference call information leidos management will
