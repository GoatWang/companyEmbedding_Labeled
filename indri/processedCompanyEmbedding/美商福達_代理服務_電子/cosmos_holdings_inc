administrative costs of  and depreciation expense of  for a net operating loss of  the approximate  increase in operating expenses in the year ended  against the corresponding period in  is primarily

accumulated deficit of  as of december   the company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease development of operations in order to continue as a going concern develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company had a working capital deficit of approximately  versus a working capital deficit of approximately  as of december   this change is attributed to the growth of the

activities during the twelve months period ended december   we believe that our current cash in our bank account and working capital as of december   will satisfy our estimated operating cash requirements for the next twelve months the company will require additional financing in fiscal year  in order to continue at its expected level of operations and potential acquisitions if the company is unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms or at all it may be forced to curtail its development activities we anticipate using cash in our bank account as of december   cash generated from the operations of the company from debt or equity financing or from a loan from management to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds if we fail to meet these requirements we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets further as a consequence we would fail to satisfy our sec reporting obligations and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be nonreporting plan of operation in the next twelve months specifically our plan of operations for the next  months is as follows we are planning to develop our business through organic growth and at the same level through the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that would add value to our company and its shareholders our organic growth would be driven by entering into a more profitable series of product in the pharmaceutical and over the counter segments for our subsidiary skypharm sa we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across new european market and entering into countries such as denmark and holland we are committed to pursuing various forms of business development this can include trading alliances licenses joint ventures dispositions and acquisitions moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products thus we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products the company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of our subsidiary skypharm and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company the companys focus is on branded pharmaceuticals overthecounter otc medicines and generic pharmaceuticals with plans to expand into cosmeticbeauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses the company in the following twelve months intends to start its operation within the markets of generic pharmaceutical products in cosmeticbeauty products as well as food  health supplements the specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the companys sales of these products including but not limited to price and costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness product labeling quality control and quality assurance changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may impact the companys business table of contents in addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets we currently have focused our services to our customers throughout europe we plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the european union market although we currently have no binding agreements commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions we anticipate that we will spend  evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding too this cost is made of up primarily legal fees consulting fees accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses we expect to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products product categories and channels as well as through entry into new geographic markets we evaluate potential acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital roic in excess of  basis points over our weightedaverage cost of capital wacc as to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector sec filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations including any acquired business so we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a company if we were to acquire them we anticipate that we will spend approximately  to locate conduct due diligence and evaluate possible acquisitions as noted above as of the date of this report we do not have any binding agreements commitments or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates we assess the foreseeable development of the company as being positive the pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the european trade market of medicines if service price and quality are strictly directed towards the customer requirements we will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service reliability and a high level of quality on the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities to minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply europe wide we secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares however during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs we still see the risks for the future development in a difficult and competitive environment increasing purchase prices and the stagnating selling price level on the background of our financial stability we however see ourselves as being wellequipped for managing the future risks risks that could endanger the survival of the company are currently not able to be identified we will evaluate and where appropriate execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins in particular we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities in addition we remain committed to strategic rd across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways significant equipment we do not intend to purchase any significant equipment for the next twelve months aside from a few pieces of it equipment nevertheless we will replace essential equipment for operations if it is required within the year employees in order to achieve our strategic objectives we have and will remain focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales selection development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products we intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business we have plans to increase the number of our employees by adding more sales people during the next twelve months table of contents revenue recognition we consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable goods or services have been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured these criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer and we have sufficient evidence of collectability such a payment history with the customer revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided our records at december   have been sufficient to satisfy all of the four requirements revenue has been recognized for all amounts billed prior to december   all of which were in respect of services rendered during december  or prior to january  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   there were no off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain foreign currency the company requires translation of the amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse takeover on september   assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at yearend rates of exchange and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of

may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our review includes evaluating both positive eg sources of taxable income and negative eg recent historical losses evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in

differentiated operating model based on a lean nimble and decentralized structure an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as research  development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others this operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling the company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value        table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations many factors may significantly affect the companys sales of its products including but not limited to efficacy safety price and costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness product labeling quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry the company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages currently most of the products that the company is trading compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic categories and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future   we regularly evaluate and where appropriate execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of branded pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical companies in areas that will serve patients that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins in particular we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition opportunities   going concern   the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using us gaap applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company generated a net loss of  for the three months ended march   and has a working capital deficit of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of march   these conditions raise substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company has not yet established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease development of operations   in order to continue as a going concern develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product and by sale of common shares however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of financial statement presentation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with principles generally accepted in the united states of america   principles of consolidation   our consolidated accounts include our accounts and the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries amplerissimo ltd skypharm sa and decahedron ltd all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated        table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents as of march   and december   there were no cash equivalents   the company maintains bank accounts in the united states denominated in us dollars and in the republic of cyprus in greece and in bulgaria all of them denominated in euros the company also maintains bank accounts in the united kingdom of great britain dominated in euros and great britain pound british pounds sterling   account receivable   accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information   inventory   inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted average method inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials ie packaged pharmaceutical products and the wrappers and containers they are sold in a periodic inventory system is maintained by  count inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment   we writedown inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions which may differ from actual results fixed assets   fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the useful lives except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life of the assets as follows   estimated useful life furniture and fixtures – years office and computer equipment  years   depreciation expense was  and  for the three months ended march   and march   respectively        table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     intangible assets   intangible assets with definite useful lives are recorded on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives the company uses a useful life of  years for an importexport license the company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period if the estimate of the intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life at march   no revision to the remaining amortization period of the intangible assets was made   amortization expense was  and  for the three months ended march   and march   respectively   impairment of longlived assets   in accordance with asc  longlived assets which include property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable   goodwill and intangibles   the company periodically reviews the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization including goodwill to determine whether impairment may exist goodwill and certain intangible assets are assessed annually or when certain triggering events occur for impairment using fair value measurement techniques these events could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors a decline in operating performance competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors specifically goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company uses level  inputs and a discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit a discounted cash flow analysis requires one to make various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the company’s budget and longterm plans discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss if any the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination that is the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit   prior to the acquisition of decahedron the company had no record goodwill value as a result of the acquisition of decahedron the company tested and expensed  of the goodwill allocated to the acquisition costs an amount equal to  for the period ending march          table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     fair value measurement   the company adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures or asc  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis asc  establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements the adoption of asc  did not have an impact on the companys financial position or operating results but did expand certain disclosures   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date additionally asc  requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs these inputs are prioritized below   level  observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active   level  unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us which reflect those that a market participant would use   the company did not have any level  or level  assets or liabilities as of march     cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of march   and therefore classified as level  within our fair value hierarchy   in addition fasb asc  fair value option or asc  was effective for january   asc  expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments   revenue recognition   we consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable goods or services have been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured these criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer and we have sufficient evidence of collectability such a payment history with the customer revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided   stockbased compensation   the company records stock based compensation in accordance with asc section  stock compensation and staff accounting bulletin sab no  sab  issued by the sec in march  regarding its interpretation of asc  asc  requires the fair value of all stockbased employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period the company values any employee or nonemployee stock based compensation at fair value using the blackscholes option pricing model        table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     the company accounts for nonemployee sharebased awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of asc  equitybased payments to nonemployees   foreign currency translations and transactions   assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at yearend rates of exchange and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated   gains or losses from foreign currency transactions transactions denominated in a currency other than the entitys local currency are included in net earnings   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by the accounting standard for income taxes asc  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   the company is liable for income taxes in the republic of cyprus and greece the corporate income tax rate in cyprus is  and  in greece and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective january   prior to  losses were carried forward indefinitely losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership   we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our review includes evaluating both positive eg sources of taxable income and negative eg recent historical losses evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets at march   the company has maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax   we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if in managements judgment the position is not morelikelythennot sustainable upon audit based on the positions technical merits this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary as of march   the company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax   basic and diluted net income loss per common share   basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented the per share amounts include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income basic and diluted loss per share for each of the three months ended march   and  is the same due to the antidilutive nature of potential common stock equivalents        table of contents   cosmos holdings inc notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements march     recent accounting pronouncements   in august  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date which delays the effective date of the revenue standard issued in  asu  revenue from contracts with customers in response to stakeholders requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in asu  and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers practitioners and users of financial statements the fasb proposed deferring the effective date of asu  respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in asu  is critical to its success   in november  the fasb issued asu no  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet prior to the issuance of the standard deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability this asu is effective for the company on april   with early adoption permitted the adoption of asu no  is not expected to have a material impact on the companys condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures   in january  the fasb issued asu  intangibles – goodwill and other topic  which simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step  from the current goodwill impairment test in the event that there is evidence of an impairment based on qualitative or quantitative assessments asu  does not change how the goodwill impairment is identified and the company will continue to perform a qualitative assessment annually to determine whether the two step impairment test is required until the adoption current accounting standards require the impairment loss to be recognized under step  of the impairment test this requires the company to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning fair value to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit has been acquired in a business combination then subsequently subtracting the implied goodwill from the carrying amount of the goodwill the new standard would require the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and subtract the carrying value from the fair value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment asu  is effective for the company for fiscal years after december   and early adoption is permitted asu  is required to be adopted prospectively and the adoption is effective for annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the year of adoption the company does not believe that the adoption of asu no  will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or the company’s consolidated results of operations   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “clarifying the definition of a business” with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or a business asu no  is effective for the company’s fiscal year commencing on january   the effect of this guidance is to be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted the company does not believe that the adoption of asu no  will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or the company’s consolidated results of operations   management does not believe that any recently issued but not effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the companys financial statements   note  acquisition of decahedron ltd   on february   the company completed the acquisition decahedron pursuant to

revenue   the company had revenue for the three months ended march   of  versus revenue of  for the three months ended march   this increase is mainly because of the organic growth attributed to our subsidiary skypharm which continued even more aggressively during the three months ended march   as well as through the additional revenue sources from our new subsidiary decahedron   operating expenses   total operating expenses for the three month period ended march   were  versus  during the three month period ended march   the increase in operating expenses in the three month period in

cash received from the acquisition of decahedron that took place within the three month period ended march     during the three month period ended march   there was  of net cash provided by financing activities versus  provided by financing activities during the three month period ended march   this variation was primarily because of the increase in financing activities of our subsidiary skypharm   we anticipate using cash in our bank account as of march   cash generated from the operations of the company and its operating subsidiary and from debt or equity financing or from a loan from management to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds if we fail to meet these requirements we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter markets further as a consequence we may fail to satisfy our reporting obligations with the securities and exchange commission sec and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be nonreporting   revenue recognition   we consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable goods or services have been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured these criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer and we have sufficient evidence of collectability such a payment history with the customer revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided   plan of operation in the next twelve months   specifically our plan of operations for the next  months is as follows   we are planning to develop our business through organic growth and at the same level through the acquisition of carefully targeted companies that would add value to our company and its shareholders our organic growth would be driven by entering into a more profitable series of product in the pharmaceutical and over the counter segments for our subsidiary skypharm sa we are committed to capitalizing on sales growth opportunities by increasing our customer pipeline across new european market and entering into countries such as denmark and holland   we are also committed to pursuing various forms of business development this can include trading alliances licenses joint ventures dispositions and acquisitions moreover we hope to continue to build on our portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand our product pipeline to generic and cosmetics products thus we are planning to formulate a sound sales distribution network specializing in generic as well as in cosmetic products the company is gradually giving more and more if not most of its interest to pharmaceuticals in terms of trade and hopefully soon enough to production also   our main objective is focusing on expanding the business of skypharm and our new subsidiary decahedron in connection with and concentrating our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company the companys focus is on branded pharmaceuticals overthecounter otc medicines and generic pharmaceuticals with plans to expand into cosmeticbeauty products as well as food supplements and to target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position   through our new subsidiary decahedron we plan to penetrate into the english pharmaceutical market and expand our wholesale networks we could utilize the ability of trading pharmaceutical products in and out of the english market according to the fx currency exchange rate of euro to english pounds        table of contents   we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities under these principles we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular ongoing portfolio review process and continue to consider trading development activities for our businesses   the company in the following twelve months intends to start its operation within the markets of generic pharmaceutical products in cosmeticbeauty products as well as food  health supplements the specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the companys sales of these products including but not limited to price and costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness product labeling quality control and quality assurance   changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services including delaying medical procedures rationing prescription medications reducing the frequency of doctor visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage may impact the companys business   in addition to expanding our product portfolio we also plan to evaluate offering our products and services to different geographical markets we currently have focused our services to our customers throughout europe we plan on expanding our geographical reach to new eras outside the european union market although we currently have no binding agreements commitments or contracts in any of these geographical markets some of the methods we will use to accomplish this are promoting our brand and marketing our products and services through the internet to new geographic areas creating strategic relationships with companies in the new geographical regions and possibly acquiring companies that operate in different geographical regions we anticipate that we will spend  evaluating the different methods and regions we plan on expanding too this cost is made of up primarily legal fees consulting fees accounting and auditing fees as well as related development expenses   we expect to continue growing through expansion into adjacent products product categories and channels as well as through entry into new geographic markets we evaluate potential acquisition targets based on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital roic in excess of  basis points over our weightedaverage cost of capital wacc   as to potential acquisitions of companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector sec filing requirements are such that we will have to file audited financial statements of all our operations including any acquired business so we plan that our first step in any potential acquisition process we undertake is to ascertain whether we can obtain audited financials of a target company if we were to acquire them we anticipate that we will spend approximately  to locate conduct due diligence and evaluate possible acquisitions except as described above in connection with medihelm as of the date of this report we do not have any binding agreements commitments or understandings with any potential acquisition candidates   we assess the foreseeable development of the company as being positive the pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the european trade market of medicines if service price and quality are strictly directed towards the customer requirements we will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service reliability and a high level of quality on the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities to minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply europe wide we secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management   over the medium term we assume that we will be able to further expand our market shares however during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs   we still see the risks for the future development in a difficult and competitive environment increasing purchase prices and the stagnating selling price level on the background of our financial stability we however see ourselves as being wellequipped for managing the future risks risks that could endanger the survival of the company are currently not able to be identified        table of contents   we will evaluate and where appropriate execute on opportunities to expand our businesses through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins in particular we are looking to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities in addition we remain committed to strategic rd across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways   off balance sheet arrangements   as of march   there were no off balance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies   in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management’s discussion and analysis section the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   foreign currency the company requires translation of the amplerissimo financial statements from euros to dollars since the reverse takeover on september   assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at yearend rates of exchange and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated gains or losses from foreign currency transactions transactions denominated in a currency other than the entitys local currency are included in net loss earnings   income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by the accounting standard for income taxes asc  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   the company is liable for income taxes in the republic of cyprus the corporate income tax rate in cyprus is  and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective january   prior to  losses were carried forward indefinitely losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership   we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our review includes evaluating both positive eg sources of taxable income and negative eg recent historical losses evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets   we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if in managements judgment the position is not morelikelythennot sustainable upon audit based on the positions technical merits this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary we operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions        table of contents   we record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense respectively   potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not the company has adopted asc  accounting for income taxes as of its inception pursuant to asc  the company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward the potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years   the company has net operating loss carryforwards in our parent cosmos holdings inc which are applicable to future taxable income in the united states if any additionally the company has income tax liabilities in the republic of cyprus the income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted we therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the united states but recognize the income tax liabilities in the republic of cyprus   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable a smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this item   item  controls

company amplerissimo ltd “amplerissimo” pursuant to a share exchange agreement the exchange agreement between the registrant and amplerissimo a company incorporated in cyprus the registrant acquired  of amplerissimos issued and outstanding common stock   on august   we through our cypriot subsidiary amplerissimo formed skypharm sa a greek corporation skypharm whose principal activities and operations are the development marketing and sales of pharmaceutical over the counter and cosmetic products   the company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both of the branded pharmaceutical market and generic pharmaceutical products market the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations many factors may significantly affect the companys sales of its products including but not limited to efficacy safety price and costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness product labeling quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products to compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry the company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages currently most of the products that the company is trading compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic categories and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future   we regularly evaluate and where appropriate execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of pharmaceutical products and companies in areas that will serve patients that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins in particular we look to continue to enhance our

established an adequate ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern these conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease development of operations   in order to continue as a going concern develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the company will need among other things additional capital resources managements plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through increased sales of product by sale of common shares and debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   summary of significant accounting policies   basis of financial statement presentation   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with principles generally accepted in the united states of america   principles of consolidation   our consolidated accounts include our accounts and the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries amplerissimo ltd and skypharm sa all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated   use of estimates   the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents as of september   and december   there were no cash equivalents   the company maintains bank accounts in the united states denominated in us dollars and in the republic of cyprus in greece and in bulgaria all of them denominated in euros   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information      table of contents    inventory   inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted average method inventory consists primarily of finished goods and packaging materials ie packaged pharmaceutical products and the wrappers and containers they are sold in a periodic inventory system is maintained by  count inventory is replaced periodically to maintain the optimum stock on hand available for immediate shipment   we writedown inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions which may differ from actual results   fixed assets   fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the useful lives except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life of the assets as follows   estimated useful life furniture and fixtures  years office and computer equipment  years   depreciation expense was  and  for the nine months ended september   and september   respectively   fair value measurement   the company adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures or asc  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis asc  establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements the adoption of asc  did not have an impact on the companys financial position or operating results but did expand certain disclosures   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date additionally asc  requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs these inputs are prioritized below   level  observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active   level  unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us which reflect those that a market participant would use   the company did not have any level  or level  assets or liabilities as of september     cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of september   and therefore classified as level  within our fair value hierarchy   in addition fasb asc  fair value option or asc  was effective for january   asc  expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments      table of contents    revenue recognition   we consider revenue recognizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable goods or services have been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured these criteria are assumed to have been met if a customer orders an item the goods or services have been shipped or delivered to the customer and we have sufficient evidence of collectability such a payment history with the customer revenue that is billed and received in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided   stockbased compensation   the company records stock based compensation in accordance with asc section  stock compensation and staff accounting bulletin sab no  sab  issued by the sec in march  regarding its interpretation of asc  asc  requires the fair value of all stockbased employee compensation awarded to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related requisite service period the company values any employee or nonemployee stock based compensation at fair value using the blackscholes option pricing model   the company accounts for nonemployee sharebased awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of asc  equitybased payments to nonemployees   foreign currency translations and transactions   assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at yearend rates of exchange and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated   gains or losses from foreign currency transactions transactions denominated in a currency other than the entitys local currency are included in net earnings   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method as required by the accounting standard for income taxes asc  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   the company is liable for income taxes in the republic of cyprus and greece the corporate income tax rate in cyprus is  and  in greece and tax losses are carried forward for five years effective january   prior to  losses were carried forward indefinitely losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership   we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our review includes evaluating both positive eg sources of taxable income and negative eg recent historical losses evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets at september   the company has maintained a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction in which it is subject to income tax   we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if in managements judgment the position is not morelikelythennot sustainable upon audit based on the positions technical merits this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary as of september   the company has no uncertain tax positions recorded in any jurisdiction where it is subject to income tax      table of contents    basic and diluted net income loss per common share

effective date of the revenue standard issued in  asu  revenue from contracts with customers in response to stakeholders requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in asu  and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers practitioners and users of financial statements the fasb proposed deferring the effective date of asu  respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in asu  is critical to its success   in november  the fasb issued asu no  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet prior to the issuance of the standard deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability this asu is effective for the company on april   with early adoption permitted the adoption of asu no  is not expected to have a material impact on the companys condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures   management does not believe that any recently issued but not effective accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the companys financial statements   note   income taxes

arrangements   as of september   there were no off balance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies   in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain      table of contents

regarding change of ownership   we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized our review includes evaluating both positive eg sources of taxable income and negative eg recent historical losses evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets   we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if in managements judgment the position is not morelikelythennot sustainable upon audit based on the positions technical merits this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary we operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions   we record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense respectively   potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not the company has adopted asc  accounting for income taxes as of its inception pursuant to asc  the company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward the potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years   the company has net operating loss carryforwards in our parent cosmos holdings inc which are applicable to future taxable income in the united states if any additionally the company has income tax liabilities in the republic of cyprus the income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted we therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to
