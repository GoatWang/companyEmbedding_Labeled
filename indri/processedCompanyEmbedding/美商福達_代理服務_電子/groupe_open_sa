algebraic group abelian variety v t e in mathematics a lie group ˈliː is a group that is also a differentiable manifold with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure lie groups are named after norwegian mathematician sophus lie who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups lie groups represent the bestdeveloped theory of continuous symmetry of mathematical objects and structures which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics as well as for modern theoretical physics they provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of differential equations differential galois theory in much the same way as permutation groups are used in galois theory for analysing the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations an extension of galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of lies principal motivations contents  overview  definitions and examples

with complex multiplication lie groups are smooth differentiable manifolds and as such can be studied using differential calculus in contrast with the case of more general topological groups one of the key ideas in the theory of lie groups is to replace the global object the group with its local or linearized version which lie himself called its infinitesimal group and which has since become known as its lie algebra lie groups play an enormous role in modern geometry on several different levels felix klein argued in his erlangen program that one can consider various geometries by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties invariant thus euclidean geometry corresponds to the choice of the group e of distancepreserving transformations of the euclidean space r conformal geometry corresponds to enlarging the group to the conformal group whereas in projective geometry one is interested in the properties invariant under the projective group this idea later led to the notion of a gstructure where g is a lie group of local symmetries of a manifold lie groups and their associated lie algebras play a major role in modern physics with the lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system here the representations of the lie group or of its lie algebra are especially important representation theory is used extensively in particle physics groups whose representations are of particular importance include su and the poincaré group on a global level whenever a lie group acts on a geometric object such as a riemannian or a symplectic manifold this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure the presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a lie group action on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates analysis on the manifold linear actions of lie groups are especially important and are studied in representation theory in the s–s ellis kolchin armand borel and claude chevalley realised that many foundational results concerning lie groups can be developed completely algebraically giving rise to the theory of algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field this insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups as well as in algebraic geometry the theory of automorphic forms an important branch of modern number theory deals extensively with analogues of lie groups over adele rings padic lie groups play an important role via their connections with galois representations in number theory definitions and examplesedit a real lie group is a group that is also a finitedimensional real smooth manifold in which the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps smoothness of the group multiplication μ  g × g → g μ  x  y   x y  is invariant under rotations this space therefore constitutes a representation of so these representations have been classified and the classification leads to a substantial simplification of the problem essentially converting a threedimensional partial differential equation to a onedimensional ordinary differential equation early historyedit according to the most authoritative source on the early history of lie groups hawkins p  sophus lie himself considered the winter of – as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups hawkins however suggests that it was lies prodigious research activity during the fouryear period from the fall of  to the fall of  that led to the theorys creation ibid some of lies early ideas were developed in close collaboration with felix klein lie met with klein every day from october  through  in berlin from the end of october  to the end of february  and in paris göttingen and erlangen in the subsequent two years ibid p  lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by  but during the s all his papers except the very first note were published in norwegian journals which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of europe ibid p  in  a young german mathematician friedrich engel came to work with lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups from this effort resulted the threevolume theorie der transformationsgruppen published in   and  lies ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics in fact his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of carl gustav jacobi on the theory of partial differential equations of first order and on the equations of classical mechanics much of jacobis work was published posthumously in the s generating enormous interest in france and germany hawkins p  lies idée fixe was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what évariste galois had done for algebraic equations namely to classify them in terms of group theory lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for special functions and orthogonal polynomials tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries in lies early work the idea was to construct a theory of continuous groups to complement the theory of discrete groups that had developed in the theory of modular forms in the hands of felix klein and henri poincaré the initial application that lie had in mind was to the theory of differential equations on the model of galois theory and polynomial equations the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying by the study of symmetry the whole area of ordinary differential equations however the hope that lie theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled symmetry methods for odes continue to be studied but do not dominate the subject there is a differential galois theory but it was developed by others such as picard and vessiot and it provides a theory of quadratures the indefinite integrals required to express solutions additional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of bernhard riemann on the foundations of geometry and their further development in the hands of klein thus three major themes in th century mathematics were combined by lie in creating his new theory the idea of symmetry as exemplified by galois through the algebraic notion of a group geometric theory and the explicit solutions of differential equations of mechanics worked out by poisson and jacobi and the new understanding of geometry that emerged in the works of plücker möbius grassmann and others and culminated in riemanns revolutionary vision of the subject although today sophus lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups a major stride in the development of their structure theory which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics was made by wilhelm killing who in  published the first paper in a series entitled die zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen transformationsgruppen the composition of continuous finite transformation groups hawkins p  the work of killing later refined and generalized by élie cartan led to classification of semisimple lie algebras cartans theory of symmetric spaces and hermann weyls description of representations of compact and semisimple lie groups using highest weights in  david hilbert challenged lie theorists with his fifth problem presented at the international congress of mathematicians in paris weyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of lie groups to fruition for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics but he also put lies theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between lies infinitesimal groups ie lie algebras and the lie groups proper and began investigations of topology of lie groups the theory of lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by claude chevalley the concept of a lie group and possibilities of classificationedit lie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis what must be understood is the nature of small transformations for example rotations through tiny angles that link nearby transformations the mathematical object capturing this structure is called a lie algebra lie himself called them infinitesimal groups it can be defined because lie groups are manifolds so have tangent spaces at each point the lie algebra of any compact lie group very roughly one for which the symmetries form a bounded set can be decomposed as a direct sum of an abelian lie algebra and some number of simple ones the structure of an abelian lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting since the lie bracket is identically zero the interest is in the simple summands hence the question arises what are the simple lie algebras of compact groups it turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families the classical lie algebras an bn cn and dn which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of euclidean space but there are also just five exceptional lie algebras that do not fall into any of these families e is the largest of these lie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties simple semisimple solvable nilpotent abelian their connectedness connected or simply connected and their compactness connected compact lie groups are all known they are finite central quotients of a product of copies of the circle group s and simple compact lie groups which correspond to connected dynkin diagrams any simply connected solvable lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank and any finitedimensional irreducible representation of such a group is dimensional solvable groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions any simply connected nilpotent lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices with s on the diagonal of some rank and any finitedimensional irreducible representation of such a group is dimensional like solvable groups nilpotent groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions simple lie groups are sometimes defined to be those that are simple as abstract groups and sometimes defined to be connected lie groups with a simple lie algebra for example sl r is simple according to the second definition but not according to the first they have all been classified for either definition semisimple lie groups are lie groups whose lie algebra is a product of simple lie algebras they are central extensions of products of simple lie groups the identity component of any lie group is an open normal subgroup and the quotient group is a discrete group the universal cover of any connected lie group is a simply connected lie group and conversely any connected lie group is a quotient of a simply connected lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center any lie group g can be decomposed into discrete simple and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows write gcon for the connected component of the identity gsol for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup gnil for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup so that we have a sequence of normal subgroups  ⊆ gnil ⊆ gsol ⊆ gcon ⊆ g then ggcon is discrete gcongsol is a central extension of a product of simple connected lie groups gsolgnil is abelian a connected abelian lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of r and the circle group s gnil is nilpotent and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian this can be used to reduce some problems about lie groups such as finding their unitary representations to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension the diffeomorphism group of a lie group acts transitively on the lie group every lie group is parallelizable and hence an orientable manifold there is a bundle isomorphism between its tangent bundle and the product of itself with the tangent space at the identity infinitedimensional lie groupsedit lie groups are often defined to be finitedimensional but there are many groups that resemble lie groups except for being infinitedimensional the simplest way to define infinitedimensional lie groups is to model them locally on banach spaces as opposed to euclidean space in the finitedimensional case and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finitedimensional lie groups however this is inadequate for many applications because many natural examples of infinitedimensional lie groups are not banach manifolds instead one needs to define lie groups modeled on more general locally convex topological vector spaces in this case the relation between the lie algebra and the lie group becomes rather subtle and several results about finitedimensional lie groups no longer hold the literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinitedimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix lie in lie group on the lie algebra side of affairs things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix lie in lie algebra are purely algebraic for example an infinitedimensional lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding lie group that is there may be a group corresponding to the lie algebra but it might not be nice enough to be called a lie group or the connection between the group and the lie algebra might not be nice enough for example failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity it is the nice enough that is not universally defined some of the examples that have been studied include the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold quite a lot is known about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle its lie algebra is more or less the witt algebra whose central extension the virasoro algebra see virasoro algebra from witt algebra for a derivation of this fact is the symmetry algebra of twodimensional conformal field theory diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are regular fréchet lie groups very little about their structure is known the diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to quantize gravity the group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finitedimensional lie group is an example of a gauge group with operation of pointwise multiplication and is used in quantum field theory and donaldson theory if the manifold is a circle these are called loop groups and have central extensions whose lie algebras are more or less kac–moody algebras see kac–moody algebra from loop algebra for an example there are infinitedimensional analogues of general linear groups orthogonal groups and so on one important aspect is that these may have simpler topological properties see for example kuipers theorem in mtheory for example a  dimensional sun
