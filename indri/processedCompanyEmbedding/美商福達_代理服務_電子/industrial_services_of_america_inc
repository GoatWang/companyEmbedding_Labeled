economy the green red and blue components of the colours of the countries represent the percentages for the agriculture industry and services sectors respectively industry is the production of goods or related services within an economy the major source of revenue of a group or company is the indicator of its relevant industry when a large group has multiple sources of revenue generation it is considered to be working in different industries manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in european and north american countries during the industrial revolution upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies this came through many successive rapid advances in technology such as the production of steel and coal following the industrial revolution possibly a third of the worlds economic output are derived that is from manufacturing industries many developed countries and many developingsemideveloped countries peoples republic of china india etc depend significantly on manufacturing industry industries the countries they reside in and the economies of those countries are interlinked in a complex web of interdependence contents  classification  isic

articles economic sector and industry classification industries can be classified in a variety of ways at the top level industry is often classified according to the threesector theory into sectors primary extractive secondary manufacturing and tertiary services some authors add quaternary knowledge or even quinary culture and research sectors over time the fraction of a societys industry within each sector changes below the economic sectors there are many other more detailed industry classifications these classification systems commonly divide industries according to similar functions and markets and identify businesses producing related products industries can also be identified by product such as construction industry chemical industry petroleum industry automotive industry electronic industry power engineering and power manufacturing such as gas or wind turbines meatpacking industry hospitality industry food industry fish industry software industry paper industry entertainment industry semiconductor industry cultural industry and poverty industry marketbased classification systems such as the global industry classification standard and the industry classification benchmark are used in finance and market research isicedit main article international standard industrial classification the international standard industrial classification isic of all economic activities is the most complete and systematic industrial classification made by the united nations statistics division isic is a standard classification of economic activities arranged so that entities can be classified according to the activity they carry out the categories of isic at the most detailed level classes are delineated according to what is in most countries the customary combination of activities described in statistical units considering the relative importance of the activities included in these classes while isic rev continues to use criteria such as input output and use of the products produced more emphasis has been given to the character of the production process in defining and delineating isic classes industrial developmentedit optimized logistics have enabled the rapid development of industry here is a thermal oxidizer during the industrial shipping process a factory a traditional symbol of the industrial development a cement factory in kunda estonia the industrial revolution led to the development of factories for largescale production with consequent changes in society originally the factories were steampowered but later transitioned to electricity once an electrical grid was developed the mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion with individual workers performing specific steps during the process this led to significant increases in efficiency lowering the cost of the end process later automation was increasingly used to replace human operators this process has accelerated with the development of the computer and the robot deindustrialisationedit main article deindustrialisation colin clarks sector model of an economy undergoing technological change in later stages the quaternary sector of the economy grows historically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage an example of the former is the decline in carriage manufacturing when the automobile was massproduced a recent trend has been the migration of prosperous industrialized nations towards a postindustrial society this is manifested by an increase in the service sector at the expense of manufacturing and the development of an informationbased economy the socalled informational revolution in a postindustrial society manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of offshoring measurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable traditionally success has been measured in the number of jobs created the reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector or the introduction of the lean manufacturing process related to this change is the upgrading of the quality of the product being manufactured while it is possible to produce a lowtechnology product with lowskill labour the ability to manufacture hightechnology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff societyedit main article industrial

other working conditions the trade union through its leadership bargains with the employer on behalf of union members rank and file members and negotiates labour contracts with employers this movement
