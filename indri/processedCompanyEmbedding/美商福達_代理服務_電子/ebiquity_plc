of the equivalent period last year with overall performance broadly in line with market expectations   the media value measurement practice mvm continued to grow in the first half of the year although we experienced a slowdown in the rate of growth as some contract renewals and new business awards were delayed  particularly in the us  as advertisers awaited the publication of the us association of national advertisers ana media transparency reports  we anticipate faster year on year revenue growth over the remainder of the year as advertisers action the anas recommendations prepared in partnership with ebiquity and firmdecisions which were released on  july   the marketing performance optimization practice mpo has generated significant growth across all markets and achieved record growth overall we expect strong performance from this practice over the remainder of the year   the market intelligence practice mi as previously reported operates in a highly competitive environment with revenues for this business anticipated to decline  revenue from our platform business portfolio was broadly flat year on year outside the us where revenue reflected pressure on client budgets our project based business further contracted as expected although at a faster rate than planned we are continuing to progress our product development and previews of our upcoming product launches have been well received by clients  these product enhancements should be available for the  renewal season   with approximately twothirds of group revenue denominated in nonsterling currencies we have received some revenue benefit from sterlings weakness in the first half of the year should this continue there will be further revenue benefit in the second half of the year accompanied by a proportionate increase in costs and an overall neutral impact on operating margins   the company is confident of achieving board expectations for the full year to  december  with improved growth in mvm and a strong performance in mpo offsetting the weaker than initially anticipated performance from mi    on  september  the company will release its interim report for the six month period ended
