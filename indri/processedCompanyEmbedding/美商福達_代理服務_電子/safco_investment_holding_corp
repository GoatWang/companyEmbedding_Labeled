concern if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements our major shareholders have indicated their willingness to provide additional funds to the company to cover any shortfalls however no written agreement or guarantee exists to this effect critical accounting policies and estimates fair value of financial instruments the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification paragraph  to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below level  quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date level  pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date level  pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument the carrying amounts of the companys financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated revenue recognition the company

unaudited   note   organization and operations and basis of presentation   safco investment corp formerly “ace consulting management inc” or the “company” was incorporated on september   under the laws of the state of delaware the company engages in consulting to corporations to improve growth strategies performance enhancement and maximization of share value   our objective is to become a leader of small to medium sized businessconsulting services our business strategy for accomplishing this objective includes attracting and retaining outstanding professionals on an asneeded basis develop longterm client relationships enhancing and extending our service offerings and building our corporate image our mission is to bridge us and chinese businesses in various fields to grow our consulting business our motto is to deliver reliable service and to provide value to our clients   we look to assist chinese companies in utilizing us knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in china likewise we seek to enhance the global competitiveness of chinese and american firms seeking to establish a presence overseas   meanwhile we have not generated meaningful revenues and our limited assets consist solely of cash   the unaudited condensed financial statements of the company for the nine months ended september   and  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for interim financial information applied on a consistent basis and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on form q and the requirements of regulation sk and regulation sx promulgated under the securities act of  as amended the “securities act”  accordingly they do not include all the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete audited financial statements however the information included in these financial statements reflects all adjustments consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary for the fair presentation of the company’s financial position and the results of operations results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year or any future annual or interim period the balance sheet information as of december   was derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” on april   these financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report   going concern   these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future as reflected in the financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit of  at september   and incurred a net loss of  and used cash in operating activities of  for the reporting period then ended these and other factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern in addition the companys independent certified public accounting firm in its report on the december   financial statements has raised substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   the company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue however the company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds   note   summary of significant accounting policies   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   management estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates reflected in the financial statements include but are not limited to valuation of deferred tax asset and sharebased compensation costs changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates actual results could differ from those estimates            fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below   level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured the company derived no revenue during nine months periods ended september   and    stockbased compensation   the company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and nonemployees in capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs the company accounts for sharebased payments under the guidance as set forth in the sharebased payment topic of the fasb accounting standards codification which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees officers directors and consultants including employee stock options based on estimated fair values the company estimates the fair value of sharebased payment awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using an optionpricing model and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the required service period in the companys statements of operations the company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to nonemployees in accordance with the authoritative guidance where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a the date at which a performance commitment is reached or b the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete stockbased compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised as necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates            the fair value of the company’s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the stock options or warrants and future dividends compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the blackscholesmerton option pricing model and based on actual experience the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods   income taxes   the company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain the company’s policy is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense   net income loss per common share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued using the treasury stock method potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive   there were no potentially outstanding dilutive common shares for the reporting period ended september   and     recently issued accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with

reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by
