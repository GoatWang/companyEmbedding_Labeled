generation there are many ways to generate leads online each has its own formula that needs to be perfected in order to find the balance between quantity and quality the online lead generation methods used by our company include but are not limited to proprietary lead portals pay per click advertising email advertising and website banners offline lead generation using a combination of a predictive dialer call center solution and an overseas outsourced call center solution our company is able to generate custom live transfer leads for our customers  we utilize this method of lead generation in situations where we are confident that a high volume of live leads can be generated and sold for a profit revenue model and distribution methods of the products or services our revenue model is based on customer development  we either purchase leads from accredited brokers or locate leads based on the methods described above and then resell those leads to our customers through our automated

foregoing we had a net loss of  for the nine month period ended september   this compares with net income for the nine month period ended september   of   the reason for our net loss during the nine months ended september   and our net income for the nine months ended september   is due to our decreased revenue during the period in its audited financial statements as of december   the company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the companys current financial position our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our ability to generate revenues liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash or cash equivalents of  as of december   we had cash or cash equivalents of  we believe that with our existing cash flows we have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months due to the fact that we believe our revenue will increase throughout the year  we believe that the amount of revenue we are generating will allow us to meet our operating requirements during the next twelve months  if our revenue is not sufficient to allow us to meet our cash requirements during the next twelve months the company may need to raise additional funds through the sale of its equity securities  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business net cash provided by operating activities was  for the nine month period ended september   this compares to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the nine month period ended september   this change is due to a decrease in accounts receivable and a net loss versus net income during

months          cash flows used in financing activities was  for the nine month period ended september   which compares to cash flows used in financing activities of  for the nine month period ended september   the change in cash flows related to financing activities is due to the fact that we had decreased amounts used for repayment of notes payable as well as  in proceeds received from a

or locate leads based on the methods described above and then resell those leads to our customers through our automated system  the leads must meet the stringent criteria of our system  the leads are vetted through our fraud filters in order to ensure quality we are currently focusing our attention on the auto insurance market but expect to expand to other industries in the very near future nexus enterprise solutions inc nexus is redefining the current prospect and lead generation and acquisition industry by developing an information exchange service which allows sellers and buyers of leads and other information assets to operate in an optimized transparent and efficient way to transact deals in a more efficient manner than what is experienced in todays markets and systems  this is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which enable enhanced business intelligence and management thereby empowering stakeholders on both sides of the transaction to make wellinformed and meaningful connections with each other our company generates revenue through its lead generation services which are comprised of the lead generation methods described above and are accessed by our customers through our automated system the cost of developing an automated system such as ours is prohibitive for a majority of companies we fulfill a need by allowing these companies to use our technology forms landing pages etc for a fee we currently are back logged with the amount of companies looking to buy and sell leads to us our carriers and agencies in return we get compensated when we sell a lead by charging our customers a fee for each lead purchased the company will identify and address additional target markets for its services other than the insurance and financial

the material weaknesses defined below i    inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and ii  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes managements remediation plan we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting  during the period covered by this quarterly report on form q we

efforts set out in i is largely dependent upon our company generating the necessary revenue to cover the costs of implementing the changes required  if we are unsuccessful in securing such funds remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner  because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues if any within our company have been detected  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
