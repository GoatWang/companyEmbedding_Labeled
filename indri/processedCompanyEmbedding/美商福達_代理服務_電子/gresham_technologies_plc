technologies plc said monday it has won a significant contract for its clareti transaction control product with an unnamed canadian banking groupgresham said the contract is worth gbp million over its initial fiveyear term with the software providing ongoing data integrity assurance for regulatory reporting additional licence and services revenue is expected as the customer makes further use of the technology this is the third new ctc customer win in north america this year and follows on from our first us tier  bank win in late  said chief executive ian manocha the pace of change in the us  canadian financial markets is accelerating and participants are finding themselves constrained by their data processing infrastructure this leaves them with a myriad of potential control gaps and an inability to keep up with complex regulatory reporting demands we continue to invest in the north american market to capitalise on this opportunity added manocha shares in gresham technologies were up
