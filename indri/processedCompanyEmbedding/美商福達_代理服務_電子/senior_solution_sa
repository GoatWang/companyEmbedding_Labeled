learn how and when to remove this template message learn how and when to remove this template message a solution architect in information technology is a practitioner of solution architecture typically part of the solution development team the solution architect translates requirements created by functional analysts into the architecture for that solution and describing it through architecture and design artifacts the rest of the development team then uses those artifacts to implement the solution the solution architects process typically involves selecting the most appropriate technology for the problem overview of the roleedit an individual performing the role of a solution architect focuses on converting requirements into the architecture and design that ultimately constitute the blueprint for the solution in that process the solution architect usually relies on design patterns from their previous engagements published reference architectures and on guidance from enterprise architecture in their efforts solution architects balance architectural concerns of the projects with the concerns of the enterprise the solution architect is often the development team leader as such they are often expected to provide motivation and guidance to the entire development team during the systems development life cycle the solution architect must ensure buyin from the development team so that the team is motivated to match the detailed design of the solution to the higherlevel architecture solution architects play an important role in ensuring that the solution architecture aligns with the roadmaps established by the enterprise architecture and that it adheres to the enterprise architecture principles solution architects are both a consumer and contributor to enterprise architecture collateral often the patterns and guidance solution architects develop becomes reusable in a broader enterprise architecture context solution architects vs enterprise architectsedit solution architects in large organizations often act as the bridge between architecture and applications architecture an enterprise architects deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architects but not always the main distinction between the two lies in their different goals the enterprise architect is primarily employed to design plan and govern strategic and crossorganisational rationalization or optimization of an enterprises services processes or components the solution architect primarily helps programmers and project managers in the design planning and governance of projects of any kind a solution architect may have a reporting line to an enterprise architect but the influence the enterprise architect team has on solution architects depends on an organisations policies and management structure so the extent to which a solution architects work derives from an enterprise architects road maps vary from  to  percent where the solution architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery for example an enterprise may employ a solution architect on a feasibility study or to prepare a solution vision or solution outline for an invitation to tender a supplier may employ a solution architect at bid time before any implementation project is costed or resourced both may employ a solution architect to govern an implementation project or play a leading role within it referencesedit  a b c breaking down software development roles an internetcom developer ebook  jupitermedia corp

decisionmaking —safe leanagile principle    product and solution management the product management role has content authority for the program backlog they are responsible for identifying customer needs prioritizing features and developing the program vision and roadmap in a similar manner solution management has the content authority for the solution backlog they work with customers to understand their needs create the solution vision and roadmap define requirements and guide work through the solution kanban leanagile enterprises focus on delivering the right solutions to customers with the highest quality in the shortest lead times this requires people with clear content authority to take responsibility for continuously defining prioritizing and validating requirements working closely with development in short integrated learning cycles they bring the voice of the customer to the developers and the voice of development to the customer in accordance with principle  – decentralized decisionmaking safe prescribes a content authority chain that extends through three levels solution management is responsible for guiding the solutions that constitute the solution product management is responsible for program vision and backlog and finally product owners make fast local content decisions on behalf of the agile team this article describes the important roles that product managers and solutions managers play in safe while the roles are similar in most respects they operate at different levels of the solution and manage different concerns details product management and solution management are the main content authority for the program and solution backlogs respectively they create the vision and  work with customers to understand their needs define requirements and guide work through the solution and program kanbans they prioritize work using wsjf schedule feature and capabilities for release using the roadmap validate customer response and provide fast feedback a leanagile approach to content management what safe describes as content has traditionally been represented by a marketing requirements document mrd product requirements document and system and software requirements specifications srs in waterfall development these specifications were typically done up front with an expectation that all the requirements could be established in advance of solution development however it didn’t work out all that well that way and the move to a leanagile approach is driven in large part by that result we now understand that assumptions about requirements design and architecture all need to be validated through actual development testing and experimentation  and that teams must be open to emerging knowledge that can be quickly fed back into the solution in safe continuous exploration is the process used to continually explore market and user needs and defining a vision roadmap and set of features and capabilities that address those needs as we see in solution intent some of the requirements of the solution are likely to be well understood and fixed from the beginning while others are variable and can only be understood during the development process managing this new approach is the primary responsibility of product and solution management in the lean enterprise these responsibilities must be fulfilled in a far more agile manner as is illustrated in table   responsibility traditional agile understand customer need upfront and discontinuous constant interaction with the customer who is part of the value stream other techniques include customer visits gemba walks elicitation eg such as interviews and surveys brainstorming trade studies market research document requirements fully elaborated in documents handed off highlevel vision constant product and solution backlog refinement and informal facetoface communication with agile teams schedule created in hardcommitted roadmaps and milestones at the beginning continuous nearterm roadmapping prioritize requirements not at all or perhaps onetime only often in requirements document form reprioritized at every pi boundary via wsjf constant scope triage validate requirements not applicable qa responsibility primary role involved with iteration and pi system demos acceptance criteria included fitness for purpose understood manage delivery schedule typically one time fixed well in advance released frequently whenever there is enough value manage change change avoided—weekly change control meetings change embraced adjusted at pi and iteration boundaries table  changes in product and solution management behavior in a leanagile enterprise responsibilities of product management the following section describes the primary responsibilities of the product manager in the context of a single agile release train for larger multipleart solution trains additional responsibilities are necessary those are described in later sections understand customer needs and validate solutions product management is the internal voice of the customer for the art and works with customers as well as product owners to constantly understand and communicate their needs and participate in validation of the proposed solutions understand and support portfolio work every art lives in the context of a portfolio so product management has a responsibility to understand the budget parameters for the upcoming fiscal period understand how strategic themes influence the strategic direction and work with epic owners to develop the business case for epics that affect their art develop and communicate the program vision and roadmap product management continuously develops and communicates the vision to the development teams and defines the features of the system in collaboration with system and solution architectengineering they also define and maintain the nonfunctional requirements nfrs to help ensure that the solution meets relevant standards and other system quality requirements they are responsible for the roadmap which illustrates at a high level how features are intended to be implemented over time manage and prioritize the flow of work product management manages the flow of work though the program kanban and into the program backlog product management is responsible for making sure that there are enough ready features in the backlog at all times to be ready they develop feature acceptance criteria that can be used to establish that the feature meets its definition of done dod and since judicious selection and sequencing of features is the key economic driver for each art the backlog is reprioritized with wsjf prior to each pi planning session participate in pi planning during each pi planning session product management presents the vision which highlights the proposed features of the solution along with any relevant upcoming milestones they also typically participate as business owners for the train with the responsibility of approving pi objectives and establishing business value define releases and program increments owning the ‘what’ means that product management is largely responsible for release definition as well including new features architecture and allocations for technical debt this is accomplished through a series of program increments and releases whose definition and business objectives are also determined by product management product management works with release management where applicable to decide when enough value has been accrued to warrant a release to the customer work with system architectengineering to understand enabler work while product management is not expected to drive technological decisions they are expected to understand the scope of the upcoming enabler work and to work with system and solution architectengineering to assist with decisionmaking and sequencing of the key technological infrastructures that will host the new business functionality this can often best be accomplished by establishing a capacity allocation as described in program backlog participate in demos and inspect and adapt product management is an active participant in biweekly system demos including the aggregate one at the end of the pi they are also involved in assessment of metrics including evaluation of
