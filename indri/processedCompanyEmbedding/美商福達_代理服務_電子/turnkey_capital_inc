we need additional capital to fund our planned operations the company does not have cash reserves available to meet its basic operational requirements and will be dependent upon the sale of its common

be aware that there are various risks you should consider carefully these risk factors together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected risks related to our business we have limited sales and financial history and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future we had limited revenue in  we may never become profitable we expect our expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we seek to start operations it is difficult to accurately forecast turnkeys revenues and operating results and they could fluctuate in the future at times these fluctuations may be significant we will depend on the services of our executives we depend on the services of our executive officers director and outside contractors to date we have not entered into any employment agreements with our executives the loss of the services of any of our executives could materially harm our business in addition we do not presently maintain a keyman life insurance policy on any of our officers or directors    risks related to the company general economic conditions industry cycles financial business and other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control may affect our future performance general economic conditions industry cycles financial business and other factors may affect our operations if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future we may among other things be required to take one or more of the following actions · seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets · refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness · sell selected assets · reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or · discontinue operations in addition any financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms which may prevent us from future expansion and growth in new markets and thus negatively affect our business and financial condition risks related to our common stock the market for our common stock is extremely limited and sporadic our common stock is quoted on the otcqb tier of the otc markets under the symbol tkci the market for our common stock is extremely limited and sporadic trading in stock quoted on the otc markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects this volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance moreover the otc market is not a stock exchange and trading of securities in the otc markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange such as nasdaq or the nyse mkt accordingly stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares the tradability of our common stock is limited under the penny stock regulations which may cause the holders of our common stock difficulty should they wish to sell the shares because the quoted price of our common stock is less than  per share and we do not meet certain other exemptions our common stock is considered a penny stock and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of rule g under the securities exchange act of  under this rule brokerdealers who recommend lowpriced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements the brokerdealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written consent prior to the transaction sec regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a penny stock including the delivery prior to any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks these requirements severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because few broker or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities and this limited liquidity will make it more difficult for an investor to sell his shares of our common stock in the secondary market should the investor wish to liquidate the investment in addition to the applicability of the penny stock rules other risks associated with trading in penny stocks could also be price fluctuations and the lack of a liquid market our board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us our articles of incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock as a result our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common stock    the ability of our principal stockholders including our ceo to control our business may limit or eliminate minority stockholders ability to influence corporate affairs the principal holders of our common stock including tbg and our ceo have voting control because of their stock ownership they are in a position to significantly influence membership of our board of directors as well as all other matters requiring stockholder approval the interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders with respect to the issuance of shares business transactions with or sales to other companies selection of other officers and directors and other business decisions the minority stockholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal stockholders this level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal stockholders may institute or undertake transactions policies or programs that result in losses may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and  or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share because we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures our stockholders have limited protection against interested director transactions conflicts of interest and similar matters the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as the rules enacted by the sec the stock exchanges including the new york stock exchange nyse mkt and the nasdaq stock market require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance these measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities that are listed on those exchanges our common stock is quoted in the over the counter market and we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with voluntary compliance we have not yet adopted these measures we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees as a result directors have the ability among other things to determine their own level of compensation until we comply with such corporate governance measures regardless of whether such compliance is required the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions conflicts of interest if any and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations as a result thereof   item b  unresolved staff comments   none item   properties the companys corporate

rights superior to those receiving the distribution except as set forth above there are no restrictions that currently materially limit our ability to pay dividends or which we reasonably believe are likely to limit materially the future payment of dividends on common stock    penny stock   our common stock trades at less than  per share and is therefore subject to the securities and exchange commissions penny stock rules penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the brokerdealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our securities which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to resell our common stock securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans none

stop computerit and accounting services we cannot accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully implement our business plan the actual cost and time required to achieve profitability may vary significantly depending on among other things the ability to acquire entertainment train operations on favorable terms the health of our targeted real estate markets the cost of developing acquiring and operating rental properties the availability of qualified personnel and marketing and other costs associated with the planned operations because of this uncertainty even if financing is available to us we may secure insufficient funding to effectuate our business plan as of december   we had negative working capital of  and cash of  based upon current and near term anticipated level of operations and expenditures we believe that cash on hand is not sufficient to enable us to continue operations for the next twelve months management recognizes that in order for us to meet our capital requirements and continue to operate additional financing will be necessary we expect to raise additional funds through private or public equity investment in order to expand the range and scope of our business operations we will seek access to private or public equity but there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate positive cash flow it is unlikely that we will be able to continue as a going concern the financial statements do

december   because of our operating losses we did not generate positive operating cash flows as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  cash on hand of  and negative working capital of  as a result we have significant shortterm cash needs these needs historically have been satisfied through proceeds from the sales of our securities and related party advances we are expecting to reduce the need for such short term financing as we build our revenues by growing our business see plan of operating and funding below in order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due we will be required to raise capital from other sources there is no assurance however that we will be successful in these efforts cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared

expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through further related party advances and further issuances of securities until our business activities can generate positive cash flow our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business we have minimal working capital nor do we have lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements generally we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments and related party advances in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet shortterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations going concern as a result of our net loss from operations net cash used in operations and deficit accumulated as of december   our ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt  our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to the ability of the company to generate profits from operations andor obtaining the necessary funding from outside sources  managements plan to address the companys ability to continue as a going concern includes i obtaining funding from private placement sources ii obtaining additional funding from the sale of the companys securities and iii obtaining loans from shareholders as necessary iv acquiring existing entertainment trains to generate cash flow from operations  although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary funding and acquisitions to allow the company to remain a going concern and to pursue its acquisition strategy through the methods discussed above there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful contractual obligations none offbalance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain note a of the notes to financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements certain of these significant accounting policies require us to make critical accounting estimates as defined below a critical accounting estimate is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations specifically critical accounting estimates have the following attributes · we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and · different estimates we could reasonably have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations    estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances  these estimates may change as new events occur as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes  these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations our most critical accounting estimates include · the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which impact our provision for taxes below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved    income taxes provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current period and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes first the tax position is evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the companys utilization of us federal net operating losses will be limited in accordance to section  rules as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes

organization and description of business turnkey capital inc formerly train travel holdings inc the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on september   inception from inception in  through december  our business operations were limited primarily to the development of a business plan to provide consulting services to commercial growers of coffee in el salvador the completion of private placements for the offer and sale of our common stock discussing the offers of consulting services with potential customers and the signing of the service agreement with finca la esmeralda a private elsalvadorian company we discontinued our coffee business on january   commencing january   our business plan changed to the acquisition and operation of entertainment train companies as well as managing and providing consulting services to entertainment train companies since january  our management has spent all of its time and effort on developing our business plan including identifying specific entertainment railroad acquisition targets engaging in discussions with these potential targets to ascertain the potential level of interest negotiating general terms with targets and undertaking early stage due diligence of potential targets as a result we entered into nonbinding letters of intent with two acquisition candidates and subsequently performed initial stage due diligence in one case the railroad was in such disrepair we determined the acquisition was not feasible at the price being sought by the target in another case we determined the price was too high based on our due diligence and could not reach an agreement with the potential seller we also entered into a series of agreements to operate a dinner train in missouri which were subsequently unwound in light of the forgoing our management has looked to potential new lines of business in addition to pursuing our current line of business on july   the company completed a share exchange agreement the agreement with turnkey home buyers usa inc a florida corporation turnkey tbg holdings corporation tbg each of the turnkey shareholders and train travel holdings inc a florida

common stock and  of the fully diluted common stock as a result of their ownership of the outstanding preferred stock due to the common control of turnkey and the company pursuant to asc

management team has been mentoring real estate investors for over  years turnkeys singlefamily rental home division developed an acquisition platform that is capable of acquiring large numbers of properties across many acquisition channels in multiple markets when identifying desirable markets the company focused on steady population growth strong rental demand and a desirable level of distressed sales of homes that can be acquired below replacement cost providing for attractive potential rental yields and capital appreciation more specifically the company looked to acquire singlefamily homes in select submarkets that are appealing to middle income families based on its disciplined market selection criteria such as aboveaverage median household incomes wellregarded

accounting standards codification asc no  consolidation asc  accounting estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates  cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes fair value measurement the company measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date the company utilizes a threetier hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level  valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access the company has no assets or liabilities valued with level  inputs level  valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities the company has no assets or liabilities valued with level  inputs level  valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities the company has no assets or liabilities valued with level  inputs fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents accounts payable accrued liabilities and related party advances approximate their fair value because of the shortterm nature of these instruments and their liquidity management is of the opinion that the company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments income taxes the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date revenue recognition we recognize revenue when services are performed in our rom subsidiary we anticipate earning income from the operations of residential real estate properties

obligations had been satisfied and collection was reasonably assured real estate owned and heldforsale real estate owned shown net of accumulated depreciation and impairment charges is comprised of real property acquired for cash or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt real estate acquired is recorded at its estimated fair value at the time of acquisition we allocate the purchase price of our operating properties to land and building and to any other identified intangible assets or liabilities we finalize our purchase price allocation on these assets within one year of the acquisition date real estate assets are depreciated using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives ordinary repairs and maintenance which are not reimbursed by the tenants are expensed as incurred major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life  our properties are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable we recognize impairment if the undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets measurement of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the asset in the evaluation of a property for impairment many factors are considered including estimated current and expected operating cash flows from the property during the projected holding period costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset expected capitalization rates projected stabilized net operating income selling costs and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in the ordinary course of business impairment charges may be necessary in the event discount rates capitalization rates leaseup periods future economic conditions and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property real estate is classified as heldforsale when management commits to a plan of sale the asset is available for immediate sale there is an active program to locate a buyer and it is probable the sale will be completed within one year real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued on an individual asset basis at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell we recognize sales of real estate properties upon closing payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits gain on real estate sold is recognized

per share the computation of basic earnings per share eps is based on the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period including shares of common stock that are issuable at the end of the reporting period the computation of diluted eps is based on the number of basic weightedaverage shares outstanding plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method the computation of diluted net income per share does not assume conversion exercise or contingent issuance of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share therefore when calculating eps if the company experienced a loss there is no inclusion of dilutive securities as their inclusion in the eps calculation is antidilutive furthermore options and warrants will have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options or warrants they are in the money following is the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december

that the information is gathered and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer principal executive officer and chief financial officer principal financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure we carried out an evaluation as required by paragraph b of rule a and d of the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our president chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our financial disclosures controls and procedures as defined in rules a € and d € under the exchange act as of december   a material weakness can be defined as an insufficiently of internal controls that may result in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement will not be prevented detected or corrected in a companys financial statements based upon that evaluation our president chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective based on the following deficiencies · weakness in accounting and finance personnel  we have a small accounting staff and we do not have the robust employee resources and expertise needed to meet complex and intricate gaap and sec reporting requirements of a us public company  additionally numerous adjustments and proposed adjustments have been noted by our auditors  this is deemed by management to be a material weakness in preparing financial statements · we have written accounting policies and control procedures but we do not have sufficient staff to implement the related controls  management had determined that this lack of the implementation of segregation of duties as required by our written procedures represents a material weakness in our internal records · internal control has at its core a basic tenant segregation of duties  due to our limited size and economic constraints the company is not able to segregate for control purposes carious asset controls and recording duties and function to different employees  this lack of segregation of duties had been evaluated by management and has been deemed to be a material control deficiency the company has determined that the above internal control weaknesses and deficiencies could result in a reasonable possibility for interim financial statements that a
