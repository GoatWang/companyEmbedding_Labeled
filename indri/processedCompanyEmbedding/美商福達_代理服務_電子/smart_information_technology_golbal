global marketing  what is global marketing global marketing explore the strategy of global marketing only a few generations ago it took months to ship products to a market in another country and doing so was such a difficult undertaking that only huge trading companies were able to take the risk then developments in transportation technology made it possible for people and products to move much more quickly and the first push towards globalization began more recently information technology—and particularly the internet—has shrunk the world even further a business might have partners and employees half a world away and consumers can get products from those locations in a matter of days global marketing guide in this article what is global marketing who employs global marketing what kinds of customers does global marketing reach how is a global marketing campaign developed what career titles work with global marketing strategies how can a marketing school help you in this field related find schools offering marketing programs what is global marketing global marketing is more than simply selling a product internationally rather it includes the whole process of planning producing placing and promoting a company’s products in a worldwide market large businesses often have offices in the foreign countries they market to but with the expansion of the internet even small companies can reach customers throughout the world see also international marketing even if a company chooses not to expand globally it may well face domestic competition from foreign companies that are this competition has made it nearly a necessity for most businesses to establish an international presence who employs global marketing global marketing is particularly important for products that have universal demand such as food and automobiles thus a beverage company is likely to be in more markets than say a wooden toy company but even a wooden toy company may find niche markets in diverse corners of the world however even today most companies are focused on the domestic market which is the largest economy in the world with only one percent of us companies invested in exporting nevertheless the value of us exports continues to increase amounting to some  trillion in  some individual examples of global marketing include top  biggest global companies excluding oil and energy walmart toyota volkswagen japan post holdings glencore international commodities ing financial services general motors samsung electronics daimler general electric source fortune magazine cocacola started selling internationally back in  and is now present in more than  countries in order to keep a consistent brand coke tastes the same in every region although outside of the united states the recipe uses sugar instead of highfructose corn syrup but the size shape and labeling of the bottle are changed to match the norms in each country while the company formerly used a standardized advertising approach it has changed to adapt advertising messages to local culture additionally it adjusts its product lineup to fit local tastes including a number of additional beverage brands mcdonald’s makes certain that a big mac tastes the same in every country but it also varies items on its menu according to local tastes customers in mexico can order a green chili cheeseburger customers in korea get to eat bulgogi burgers and customers in many arab countries can enjoy the mcarabia a grilled kofta sandwich on pita bread starbucks also adjusts their menu to fit local tastes in hong kong for example they sell dragon dumplings and as a global buyer of coffee the company has long had a reputation for engaging local cultures according to their needs in japan kentucky fried chicken has managed to associate their product with christmas and every year japanese line up around the block to get their kfc chicken on that day for a nonamerican example of global marketing consider ahava which started out as a tourist stand on the dead sea selling bottles of mud and salt from the renowned body of water from this inauspicious start they developed a line of cosmetics and after partnering with an american company that already has a global distribution network their cosmetics are being sold in highend department stores throughout the world what kinds of customers does global marketing reach since global marketing involves a variety of different products and opportunities it’s impossible to identify a single customer profile a global company must be prepared to develop multiple profiles for each of the different regions it trades in the united states’ biggest trading partners are canada mexico china and the european union but international trade by no means ends there depending on the product customers can be reached nearly anywhere in the world in order to do so global companies may rely on local distribution networks but as they grow in particular markets they may establish their own networks companies attempting to enter new markets tend to start with heavily populated urban centers before moving out to surrounding regions particular attention needs to be paid to the growing international online market which vastly increases businesses’ access to customers worldwide — if they can speak the language jp morgan in a report for the department of commerce estimated that only  percent of online shoppers speak english nonetheless in korea  percent of those with internet access shop online in germany and japan  percent thus companies who wish to break into those markets need to not only create a good product and do what works stateside they also need to immerse themselves in the language and culture of the international market they wish to break into see also ecommerce marketing how is a global marketing campaign developed when marketing products globally companies must recognize that a marketing mix that works in the domestic market may not have the same success in another market differences in local competition may require a different pricing strategy local infrastructure may affect how products are produced andor shipped in some cases it may be more profitable to produce things locally in others it may be cheaper to ship them in from across the globe the marketing mix in global marketing product — should the product stay the same in each market or does it need to be adjusted to fit local tastes price — is a new pricing strategy required to deal with variations in local competition walmart for example discovered that several retailers in germany already occupied their lowprice niche placement — how do customers in the locality make their purchases promotion — can your message reach across cultures are any unexpected responses due to cultural patterns partnerships with local businesses may be an important step in expanding into one market while in another market such partnerships might dilute the brand see also local marketing the savvy global marketer must consider all these aspects of marketing in addition to the task of communicating crossculturally when promoting a product or brand globally a company must make decisions regarding tradeoffs between standard and local messages a single message is cheaper to produce and maintains the consistency of the brand but it may not perform well in some regions due to differences in cultural values or expectations a global company must carefully research the various markets and prepare to make adjustments to its product and messaging wherever required sometimes this requires changing a name for example the chevy nova didn’t sell well in spain as “no va” in spanish means “no go” sometimes it even involves changing the packaging in america gerber baby food has a cute baby on the label to represent the brand but in some countries shoppers expect the picture to represent the contents of the jar and were appalled by the image individual marketers working with global campaigns should strive to learn the language of the market they’re assigned to both for the purpose of managing business relationships with local companies and in order to verify translation efforts for example how do you evaluate the work of someone who has translated your company website is it a meaningful translation or just full of buzz words additionally marketers should personally visit their target markets and spend time in them—even moving to them for a time here they can develop local contacts as well as gain a deeper understanding about how business is conducted in the area in japan for example it is not enough just to speak japanese you must also conduct business the japanese way learn what is valued culturally—and what is offensive developing and respecting the local business talent is also critical to global marketing if you have an office in hong kong for example you want to make full use of talented hong kong chinese professionals in your marketing advertising and distribution many companies have lost opportunities and alienated allies by having the attitude that as americans they automatically knew better than their foreign partners what career titles work with global marketing strategies global marketing managers global marketing managers direct a company’s strategy and interests abroad and may be posted
