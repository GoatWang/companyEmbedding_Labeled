in each pan and avoid coating the inner sides of the pie pans  put the pie pans into the preheated oven wear gloves to protect your hands  bake the rocket fuel for  minutes  remove the pie pans from the oven allow the rocket fuel to cool to approximately  degrees fahrenheit  degrees celsius so it can be safely handled  remove the rocket fuel from the pans use a wooden stirrer or spoon to remove the fuel from the pans  knead the finished product together while it is still warm be sure to wear gloves the rocket fuel may not readily stick together so you may need to apply strong pressure to it

finished product doing so will create a bomb ready to go off warnings watch closely while the mixture is cooking so that it does not boil over or overflow some flakes of the finished product may fall while the fuel is being removed from the pie pans or formed into shapes these flakes are flammable gather up the flakes and knead them back into the finished product do not throw them into the trash as they are combustible no one should interfere with the rocket fuel making process witnesses should stay clear and pets should not be allowed in the area the finished rocket fuel is unlikely to ignite due to shock or friction but will readily ignite when exposed to open flame there should be no open flames anywhere near the mixture at any time during the process except for the burner used to
