qsidental newsletter a copy of the qsi annual report name email close iso  quality systems iso  consultant homefaqsresourcesservicesabout ustestimonialscontact us diy pack how you can get certified with a simple and practical iso  kit that wont break the bank more what is a quality system  its the system that an organisation uses to manage the quality of their services or products  quality management systems are only one type of management system other examples include financial management systems safety management systems and environmental management systems   the official definition of a quality system from iso the international organization for standardization is the management system used to direct and control an organization with regard to quality  but thats a bit of a mouthful and not overly clear as with many of their definitions   think of it as the system that your company uses to plan create develop make andor deliver your services or products   for a service business its the system you use to provide those services  if you sell or distribute products that other people buildmakecreate then its the system you use to get store sell and deliver or install them and if you make or manufacture widgets its whatever system you use to make them or have them made for you   a quality management system consists of various elements iso  groups them into these into  categories management  planning goals  objectives reviewing progress resources  people tools equipment etc services or products realisation  whatever is involved in creating or delivering them and lastly the monitor measurement  checking  the allimportant feedback loop so you see that the scope of a quality management system extends beyond just what you do to make the service or product itself  it includes how you manage your organisation planning setting goals reviewing progress and results make sure people are competent for their work and the right resources are available plant equipment it tools etc check and analyse results to see what happened and why identify failures or problems systematically and fix them improve all these elements work together in the system with two main overall aims producing services or goods of consistent quality which meet all applicable requirements increasing customer satisfaction you probably already have a quality system do you run a business now have you been doing it for a year or more still in business andor growing  if you answer yes to these questions then you do already have a quality system it wont be an iso  quality system yet but you have some kind of quality management system in place and probably already have some kind of qc in place perhaps also some qa but to reach iso  level youll need to meet all the mandatory
