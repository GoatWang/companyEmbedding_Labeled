life events come up paid paternity leave amount of pto is above industry standard benefits are ridiculously good casual dress autonomy as a developerwith product owner approvali overall really enjoyed my time at ipeople the company has a great vibe to it and everyone is friendly i got the vibe that most people were there because they really enjoyed the company one of the things i liked is that developers have a lot of autonomy in shaping the product if you have and idea you can take it to the product owner and if they agree you can code it into the productthe company regularly stocks the kitchen with snacks sodas fresh fruit etc they also have pizza on most wednesdays this was a huge perk and a sign that the company wanted to go above and beyond to keep employees happythe company is very flexible and understanding when family events come up they will work with you and give you time off as needed for doctors appointments etcthey are pretty much the only company that offers paid paternity leave in addition to your already given pto this is a big deal my son was born during my time a ipeople and the company was really accommodating about me taking time off and happily welcomed me backthe amount of time off with this company is great you get your standard couple weeks off then on top of that the company pays employees to take time off during thanksgiving and christmas they did change this for  to make it so you chose either holiday instead of both but this was actually one of the major things that made me accept my offerdress is casual youll see most people wearing jeans shorts flip flops etc pretty much anything goesadvice to those considering interface people if youre on the fence and here because your are considering interviewing or joining ipeople do it its a great company it does have flaws but ive overall liked working herecons leadership sometimes feels disorganized at times it feels like we ship software without proper qa the normal downsides of working for a small companywearing many hats etcone of the things i struggled with was the fact that there wasnt a barrier between leaderships decision making and the development teams some people like this but it took away from development time leadership would include developers into decision making meetings where it felt like they already had their mind made up the better solution would be that leadership makes these decisions and then relays that through the product owner scrum masters etc developers should only be included in meetings where they are a technical resource not business decision meetings some people may actually like that they are part of the day to day business but i just wanted to codei wish we had a legit qa person some teams had a qa person but they also had other duties our team unfortunately did not have a qa person the expectation is that developers qa their own stuff before committing and unit tests were being written which is true we did that but a dedicated qa would catch so many things that we just dont think to tryadvice to managementembrace the agilescrum process and fully understand what continuous deployment means dont spend every sprint review focusing on what the product doesnt haveseparation of concerns doest just apply to software itself it applies to employees let developers be developers not qa not delivery not support etckeep
