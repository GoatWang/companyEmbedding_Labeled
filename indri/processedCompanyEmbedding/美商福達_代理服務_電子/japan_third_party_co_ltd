holdings co ltd  home  csr  thirdparty opinion masatoshi tamamura professor faculty of policy management keio university orientation of this thirdparty opinion and points to note this thirdparty opinion was written based on the author’s interviews with relevant parties inside and outside the company his field research on project g in iwate prefecture and aomori prefecture conducted in june and august  as well as assessment of the yamato group corporate social responsibility report   the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  covers the period of fiscal  from april  to march  including information about activities before or after fiscal  the report is further published in both an abridged highlights version booklet and full online report version website this thirdparty opinion covers both formats in writing this thirdparty opinion the author also referred to the yamato group’s past corporate social responsibility reports published on its website in order to review the company’s pdca cycle and check trends in its approach to csr the environmental report for fiscal  to fiscal  the environmental sustainability report for fiscal  and the corporate social responsibility report for fiscal  onward this thirdparty opinion examines the yamato group’s “approach to csr system for defining and implementing corporate stancemateriality” and “csr report objectivity and ease of understanding” as described in the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  using an independent perspective from the yamato group based on the author’s expertise in turn this thirdparty opinion provides the author’s views broken down by areas of excellence and areas in need of future improvement  approach to csr corporate attitude contents of implementation defining matters of weight system areas of excellence the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  states “based on its corporate philosophy csr represents the very essence of management” the company’s fundamental approach underpinning its corporate philosophy is indicated as the company precepts established in  that contain the company’s founding spirit in particular the first precept states “we ‘all’ represent the company” the company’s website explains that employees identify themselves as an integral part of the yamato group and that the company highly values this spirit where corporate management represents a combination of the strengths of each and every employee employees who individually have contact with society maintain a stance closely imbued by the precept “we ‘all’ represent the company” management policy dictates that employees play an integral role in the company’s corporate social responsibilities which can be viewed as a strength i believe in actuality the yamato group’s employees have developed and established various services to address social issues based directly on customer feedback and their experience on the frontlines and as a result the company itself fulfills its corporate social responsibilities as a company that forms an important piece of social infrastructure as a widely known example i would like to cite taqbin a small parcel delivery service empire established by the company forty years ago so that consumers could know when a parcel would be picked up or delivered this was followed by a number of services that address difficulties in society such as taqbin collect a payment on delivery service essential to the spread of online and mail order shopping cool taqbin for delivering fresh produce and time period delivery designating a time when a parcel will be delivered the yamato group is also implementing project g government which seeks to address social issues through close partnerships with local governments and organizations as a means to furthering the use of yamato group solutions the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  explains that up to june  a total of  projects have been considered with  of these projects now being implemented as actual services project g is seeking to build a collaborative social system that utilizes the strengths of all stakeholders involved including local governments and organizations as a means of the yamato group creating shared value csv the number of these projects and services continues to increase with each passing year employees with a keen sense of the issues through their experience on the frontlines and with customers are establishing collaborative mechanisms with various players based on their strong sense of motivation and providing the yamato group’s logistics technology information technology and financial technology as a platform which results in collaborative projects with local governments and organizations as a result the yamato group is making forward progress with solving difficult to address social issues having a positive impact on society in every corner of japan project g has focused mainly on initiatives with local governments in regional areas of japan but as covered in the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  the lifestyle support service was launched in april  with the collaboration of the yamato group urban renaissance agency and the city of tama as a project focused on urban areas additionally in fiscal  through its international cool taqbin service the yamato group is using its robust international network alongside local governments such as aomori prefecture to help connect restaurants outside of japan with local japanese producers creating a new innovation only possible by the yamato group in addition to its watch over services for the elderly and lifestyle support shopping support etc consolidated cargo disaster reconstruction assistance tourism promotion support and regional revitalization assistance now the yamato group has added living support in urban areas and international business development support to the mix this demonstrates that the yamato group is implementing more focused and complex solutions i believe the yamato group is well on its way to fulfilling its goal of becoming “a company most loved and trusted by society” as “asia’s no  solution provider in distribution and lifestyle support” by the year  when it will celebrate its th anniversary as noted at the beginning of the  report this is because project g is addressing social issues through collaboration with various players as a company that forms an important piece of social infrastructure and thanks to its style of focusing on the contributions of each and every employee who maintain direct contacts with society areas in need of future improvement yamato holdings is working to expand its delivery business grow its nondelivery business and reinforce its overseas expansion all under the longterm management plan “dantotsu management plan ” as a result the social responsibilities expected of it have grown larger i praise yamato holdings for its efforts to clarify materiality within its csr initiatives based on a review and understanding of the impacts of its corporate philosophy and resulting expectations of stakeholders given this assumption every year yamato holdings is expected to check the themes for csr improvements as well as to focus on considering its approaches to csr together with its overseas expansion and putting these continual improvements into practice additionally i anticipated that yamato holdings can increase the number of its strengths by establishing a mechanism across the entire value chain that can more clearly verify how each and every employee who form part of the precept “we ‘all’ represent the company” should be involved in csr and csv this is likely already being put into practice but by sharing greater details about its implementation and future policies i believe the company’s stance will become clearer project g is a way of promoting the yamato group’s philosophy since its origin which makes its acceleration establishment and advancement important i believe approaches to project g can be categorized as follows project g  enable elements platforms maintained by the company to be provided to society project g  establish mechanisms for responding to the needs of society project g  establish collaborative models with various players to create shared value as indicated in the feature articles section of the report i believe that the project g  model has become main format across the yamato group through its trial and error approach on the frontlines as a result mechanisms are being created that create new innovation in society and that advance solutions to social issues going forward i expect these level  projects to be promoted further across japan to raise the bar higher the domain of social issues addressed by project g however cannot necessarily be identified beforehand in terms of how issues should be addressed and in some cases a trial and error approach is needed to elucidate the fundamental essence of issues these projects also face the challenge of meeting the needs of social system or social program design and reform the approach in such situations should be to facilitate trial and error approaches among yamato employees on the frontlines tackling the issue or to advance a more collaborative model to establish a system for designing and building mechanisms collaboratively that address specific programs it will be important for project g to be expanded to every corner of japan to encourage greater mutual learning and interaction also when providing an established model to another community trial and error in each individual location will become important i expect the yamato group to establish such a system for promoting and encouraging these types of efforts the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  print and website versions provides commentary on the uniqueness of project g through the feature article and other sections indicating its role and value to the yamato group at the same time though it is rather difficult to grasp the situation of the countless projects being implemented across japan the overall impression of this nationwide project g is quite appealing which by itself should lead to new collaboration i believe the yamato group needs to consider nationwide collaboration and building a system to support such collaboration the yamato group engages in the delivery bizlogistics home convenience ebusiness financial autoworks and many other businesses several project g projects are already being implemented that leverage such collective strengths of the yamato group but efforts should be made moving forward to further advance such projects and heighten connectivity with its businesses to increase the effectiveness i expect the yamato group to consider approaches with potential from various perspectives in either case i would like to see the yamato group clarify and publish issues faced from the further promotion and spread of project g and the status of any improvements on a fiscal year basis  csr report objectivity and ease of understanding areas of excellence the yamato group corporate social responsibility report  features an abridged highlights version print and a full online report version website currently the print version is shortened with more detailed and exhaustive commentary reserved for the online version while current trends and data of note appear in the print version the format delivery and utilization methods of a csr report needs to be tailored to the viewpoints and strategies of each individual company the print version in paper form with comprehensive and exhaustive information as has been the format until now has been attractive but because many of the yamato group’s products and services such as taqbin are used by the general public making a print version easy to distribute and convenient to browse it is important to modify how information is delivered based on the perspective of emphasizing stakeholder engagement and i expect the yamato group to explore its future style and design of reporting based on how the report is actually utilized the online version uses the internet to foster communication by making the yamato group’s stance toward csr and csr initiatives more easily understood through videos and other formats unique to the internet links are also provided to previous feature articles to encourage greater understanding the yamato group is also focusing the attention of stakeholders by offering more details content within each year’s feature articles section generally for its csr report the yamato group has put a system in place for stable communication by enhancing content and improving explainability by combining the report into a print and online version i expect the yamato group to further advance its communication with stakeholders using this platform areas in need of future improvement i commend the fact that explanations use data but i would like the future directions and issues to be elucidated by providing information that captures annual changes as well as relative data i also noticed a gap in the presence and comprehensiveness of data based on the matter being discussed for example in the field of safety in most cases the achieved results outcome and impacts were indicated using data which indicates thorough efforts are being made with safety an important topic of concern for yamato holdings for the environment and society too information is provided quantitatively to every extent possible and i noticed information about outputs and qualitative explanations although there are domains where definitions and quantification of results is difficult yamato holdings needs to supplemental explanations about the benefits provided to society in these cases and to detail annual changes or gaps so as to indicate advancements even if qualitative in nature yamato holdings should also appeal information disclosures and numerical data compliant with the latest trends in esg investment and impact investing investor relations and csr however have different aims and goals so yamato holdings will need to closely examine relationships and policies instead of completely integrating both as for the impacts provided by project g which forms yamato holdings’ csv i expect there to be kpi for each individual project so i would like yamato holdings to establish a scope for which it can disclose this information and then indicate the current situation and progress made overall which will further enhane the effectiveness of these efforts online information can be revised and distributed quite easily yamato holdings already shares information about awards agreements and events through the csr news section by more strategically sharing the status of csr implementation and the situation after each event and agreement visitors to the website will be able to have a greater sense of how the yamato group’s csr is continually in flux as for approaches to csr reporting i would like yamato holdings to share more detailed information on its annual improvements and updates to show what policies are used to make these annual improvements continuosly i would first like to thank mr tamamura for his very valuable feedback and suggestions regarding the yamato groups csr activity reporting this report focuses on specific case studies in the areas of safety the environment and society along with relevant data ahead of  our th anniversary feature articles this year highlight our watchover initiative for the elderly and the lifestyle support service in our aspirations to become a company most loved and trusted by society i am very honored to to hear mr tamamura to say “the yamato group is making forward progress with solving complex social issues having a positive impact on society in every corner of japan” with regard to these initiatives going forward we will strive to make the report more accessible and easier to understand for all stakeholders by providing a clear direction with regards to the yamato group’s csr initiatives as well as progress based on past data the efforts of all of our employees in japan and abroad including sales drivers on the front lines are the driving force behind the yamato group’s growth and the positive reputation our csr initiatives have earned we stand commmited to giving back to local communities collectively as a group of companies while also emphasizing our culture and philosophy when it comes to ensuring our employees have pride in their work and answering the question of what they can do to make a difference for customers in their community tomoki otani yamato
