the online etymology dictionary the word infrastructure has been used in english since  and in french since  originally meaning the installations that form the basis for any operation or system the word was imported from french where it means subgrade the native material underneath a constructed pavement or railway the word is a combination of the latin prefix infra meaning below and structure the military use of the term achieved currency in the united states after the formation of nato in the s and by  was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense definitionsedit a  us national research council panel adopted the term public works infrastructure referring to  both specific functional modes – highways streets roads and bridges mass transit airports and airways water supply and water resources wastewater management solidwaste treatment and disposal electric power generation and transmission telecommunications and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise a comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities but also the operating procedures management practices and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses safe disposal of societys waste products provision of energy where it is needed and transmission of information within and between communities the oecd also classifies communications as a part of infrastructure the american society of civil engineers has not defined the term though issuing a us infrastructure report card every  years as of update they grade  categories namely aviation bridges dams drinking water energy hazardous waste inland waterways levees parks  recreation ports rail roads schools solid waste transit and wastewater hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industrial nationcitation needed soft infrastructure may refer to the institutions which are required to maintain an economy like health and cultural and social standards of a country such as the financial system the education system the health care system the system of government and law enforcement as well as emergency services the term critical infrastructure distinguishes those infrastructure elements that if significantly damaged or destroyed would cause serious disruption of a system or organization storm flood or earthquake damage leading to loss of certain transportation routes in a city for example bridges crossing a river that would make it impossible for people to evacuate and for emergency services to operate would be deemed critical infrastructure similarly an online booking system might be critical infrastructure for an airline these elements of infrastructure are the focus of recovery efforts in the aftermath of natural disasterscitation needed related conceptsedit the term infrastructure may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts land improvement and land development are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land and are owned and operated by the land owner for example an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements not infrastructure service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements not infrastructure the term public works includes governmentowned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings such as schools and court houses public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public services public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government ownership and financingedit main article infrastructure and economics it has been suggested that infrastructure and economics be merged into this section discuss proposed since march  infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies such as sole public utility or railway companies generally most roads major ports and airports water distribution systems and sewage networks are publicly owned whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately ownedcitation needed publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes tolls or metered user fees whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user feescitation needed major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of longterm bondscitation needed government owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in publicprivate partnerships in addition to in the public sector as of update in the united states for example public spending on infrastructure has varied between  and  of gdp since  many financial institutions invest in infrastructure in keynesian economics the word infrastructure was exclusively used to describe public assets that facilitate production but not private assets of the same purpose in postkeynesian times the word has grown in popularity and has been applied with increasing generality to suggest the internal framework discernible in any technology system or business organisationcitation needed uses of the termedit engineering and constructionedit engineers generally limit the term infrastructure to describe fixed assets that are in the form of a large network in other words hard infrastructurecitation needed efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assetscitation needed one such definition from  defined infrastructure as the network of assets where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components civil defense and economic developmentedit see also civil defense by country civil defense planners and developmental economists generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure including public services such as schools and hospitals emergency services such as police and fire fighting and basic financial services the notion of infrastructurebased development combining longterm infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with public private partnerships has proven popular among asian notably singaporean and chinese mainland european and latin american economists militaryedit military strategists use the term infrastructure to refer to all building and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces whether they are stationed in bases being deployed or engaged in operations for example barracks headquarters airfields communications facilities stores of military equipment port installations and maintenance stations urbanedit urban or municipal infrastructure refers to hard infrastructure systems generally owned and operated by municipalities such as streets water distribution and sewers it may also include some of the facilities associated with soft infrastructure such as parks public pools schools hospitals and libraries green infrastructureedit green infrastructure or bluegreen infrastructure is a concept that highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about land use planning in particular there is an emphasis on the life support functions provided by a network of natural ecosystems with an emphasis on interconnectivity to support longterm sustainability examples include clean water and healthy soils as well as the more anthropocentric functions such as recreation and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities the concept can be extended to apply to the management of stormwater runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems or engineered systems that mimic natural systems to treat polluted runoff marxismedit in marxism the term infrastructure is sometimes used as a synonym for base in the dialectic synthetic pair base and superstructure however the marxist notion of base is broader than the nonmarxist use of the term infrastructure and some soft infrastructure such as laws governance regulations and standards would be considered by marxists to be part of the superstructure not the base communicationsedit the term infrastructure may refer to informal and formal channels of communication political and social networks or beliefs held by members of particular groups as well as information technology software development tools still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves whether it is a city a nation a corporation or a collection of people with common interests examples include it infrastructure research infrastructure terrorist infrastructure employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructurecitation needed in the developing worldedit according to researchers at the overseas development institute the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the millennium development goals mdgs infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive especially in such areas as landlocked rural and sparsely populated countries in africa it has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of africas improved growth performance between  and  and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty the returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant with on average thirty to forty percent returns for telecommunications ict investments over forty percent for electricity generation and eighty percent for roads regional differencesedit the demand for infrastructure both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested there are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in asia the infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in asiapacific around us billion and what is needed us billion is around us billion every year in latin america three percent of gdp around us billion would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand yet in  for example only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately us billion in africa in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the mdgs by  would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of gdp or around us billion a year in fragile states over thirtyseven percent of gdp would be required sources of fundingedit the source of financing varies significantly across sectors some sectors are dominated by government spending others by overseas development aid oda and yet others by private investors in subsaharan africa governments spend around us billion out of a total of us billion in irrigation governments represent almost all spending in transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending in ict and water supply and sanitation the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure overall between them aid the private sector and nonoecd financiers exceed government spending the private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure though the majority is focused on ict infrastructure investments external financing increased in the s decade and in africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from us billion in  to us billion in  china in particular has emerged as an important

the coming years declining economic growth rates will spill over into the construction sector while high public debt will limit the governments ability to provide the same level of fiscal support for infrastructure projects as in the past forecast  industry developments the construction industry in china will grow by  in  and an annual average of  through  as activity in the sector slows in line with the overall economy the th fiveyear plan will provide support to the infrastructure sector over the next two years especially in the transport power and water segments the construction industrys share of gdp will slowly decline from  in  to  in  as the government attempts to shift chinas economy toward a consumptionled growth model concerns of overcapacity in steel and cement production as well as the supply of residential and commercial real estate will dampen investment interest across the industry private capital is expected to play a growing role in chinas infrastructure industry

infrastructure share loading the player what is infrastructure infrastructure is the basic physical systems of a business or nation transportation communication sewage water and electric systems are all examples of infrastructure these systems tend to be highcost investments however they are vital to a countrys economic development and prosperity projects related to infrastructure improvements may be funded publicly privately or through publicprivate partnerships breaking down infrastructure applicable to large and smallscale organizational frameworks infrastructure can include a variety of systems and structures as long as there are physical components required for example the electrical grid across a city state or country is infrastructure based on the equipment involved and the intent to provide a service to the areas it supports similarly the physical cabling and components making up the data network of a company operating within a specific location are also infrastructure for the business in question as they are necessary to support business operationsit infrastructuremany technical systems are often referred to as infrastructure such as networking equipment and servers due to the critical function they provide within certain business environments without the information technology it infrastructure many businesses struggle to share and move data in a way that promotes efficiency within the workplace if it infrastructure fails many business functions cannot be performedinfrastructure categoriesalong with the aforementioned sectors infrastructure includes waste disposal services such as garbage pickup and local dumps certain administrative functions often covered through various government agencies are also considered part of the infrastructure educational and health care facilities may also be included along with certain research and development functions and necessary training facilitiesprivate investment in public infrastructuresometimes private companies choose to invest in a countrys infrastructure development as part of a business expansion effort for example an energy company might build pipelines and railways in a country where it wants to refine petroleum this investment can benefit both the company and the countryfor example in  skyway concession company llc scc entered into a year lease with the city of chicago for the operation and maintenance of the chicago skyway bridge as part of the agreement scc retains all rights to the toll and concession revenues generated by bridge while the city benefits from a  billion cash infusion and is no longer responsible for maintaining the bridgeindividuals may also choose to fund improvements to certain pieces of public infrastructure for example an individual may fund improvements to hospitals schools or local law enforcement effortsinfrastructure as an asset classinfrastructure is also an asset class that tends to be less volatile than equities over the long term and generally provides a higher yield as a result some companies and individuals like to invest in infrastructure funds for the defensive characteristics such as funds involved in transportation or

development or property development is a business process encompassing activities that range from the renovation and release of existing buildings to the purchase of raw land and the sale of developed land or parcels to others real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities converting ideas from paper to real property real estate development is different from construction although many developers also manage the construction process developers buy land finance real estate deals build or have builders build projects create imagine control and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end developers usually take the greatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estate—and receive the greatest rewards typically developers purchase a tract of land determine the marketing of the property develop the building program and design obtain the necessary public approval and financing build the structures and rent out manage and ultimately sell it sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process for example some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price alternatively a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process

include many services from architecture to engineering at the other end of the spectrum a development company might consist of one principal and a few staff who hire or contract with other companies and professionals for each service as needed assembling a team of professionals to address the environmental economic private physical and political issues inherent in a complex development project is critical a developers success depends on the ability to coordinate and lead the completion of a series of interrelated activities efficiently and at the appropriate time development process requires skills of many professionals architects landscape architects civil engineers and site planners to address project design market consultants to determine demand and a projects economics attorneys to handle agreements and government approvals environmental consultants and soils engineers to analyze a sites physical limitations and environmental impacts surveyors and title companies to provide legal descriptions of a property and lenders to provide financing the general contractor of the project hires subcontractors to put the architectural plans into action land developmentedit further information land development purchasing unused land for a potential development is sometimes called speculative development subdivision of land is the principal mechanism by which communities are developed technically subdivision describes the legal and physical steps a developer must take to convert raw land into developed land subdivision is a vital part of a communitys growth determining its appearance the mix of its land uses and its infrastructure including roads drainage systems water sewerage and public utilities in general land development is the riskiest but most profitable technique as it is so dependent on the public sector for approvals and infrastructure and because it involves a long investment period with no positive cash flow after subdivision is complete the developer usually markets the land to a home builder or other end user for such uses as a warehouse or shopping center in any case use of spatial intelligence tools mitigate the risk of these developers by modeling the population trends and demographic makeup of the sort of customers a home builder or retailer would like to have surrounding their new development see alsoedit construction

rose fulbright globalknowledge publications infrastructure development in nigeria publication  november  the potential the hurdles conclusion the potential nigeria has one of the most promising pipelines of infrastructure ppp projects in africa with a rapidly growing population and expected growth rates of at least  per cent over the next two years as forecast by the imf in may  the need to develop the country’s infrastructure is paramount to allow the economy to continue to develop unchecked accordingly nigeria is the focus of a great deal of attention from the international infrastructure sector currently as a result of its infrastructure gap and the commitment of federal and state governments to fill this gapunreliability of power infrastructure has no doubt been a factor in sluggish development in certain parts of the economy particular in process plant related industries however as a number of newlyfinanced ipps come on line in the next few years assisted by nigeria’s power privatisation initiative the increasing stability of power infrastructure and increased exposure of international and local investors as well as development finance institutions dfis and export credit agencies ecas to the nigerian market should assist the process of developing nigeria’s anticipated pipeline of infrastructure projectslagos state as the economic powerhouse of the country is leading the way in this regard with a population of over  million and growing by a further half million every year lagos has published a clear point plan to improve key aspects of its public infrastructure and avoid the city grinding to a haltits longerterm plan includes a number of improvements which are expected tominimise transport bottlenecks such as the recently completed ikoyilekki bridge and the anticipated fourth mainland bridgeimprove transport links to population centres and new industrial zones such as the lekkiepe expresswayimprove general economic development such as the creation of a master plan for the development of the lekki peninsula east of lagos including to date the establishment of two free trade zonescreate additional transport modes such as the lagos metro blue line in construction and red line route secured as well as the new lekkiepe international airport currently in procurementthe importance of the lekki peninsula as an axis for growth is underlined by the proposed greenfield deep sea lekki port where financing is currently being put in place this estimated  billion project about km east of the existing lagos ports apapa tincan island and kirikiri is being constructed within a free trade zone and is expected to provide an additional  million twentyfoot equivalent unit teu capacity into the nigerian container terminal market offering a quicker and lesscongested route to market for goods and accommodating largercapacity ships and using stateoftheart facilities the project is being led by the singaporebased tolaram group to complement its existing operations in nigeria with major coinvestments being made at both state level by lagos state and federal level through the nigerian ports authority and also supported by international container terminal services inc of philippines as the proposed operatorthe development of public infrastructure is occurring in tandem with a huge expansion in private sector developments in particular there are accelerating signs of growth in the property development market in nigeria continuing urbanisation an emerging middle class and a shortfall in high quality office space for international and domestic companies are key drivers for the wave of real estate developments such as retail malls business parks and office spacedevelopments such as the ikeja city mall and palms shopping mall in lagos state and polo park in enugu state are at the forefront of the expanding retail market with other developments such as the osapa convenience centre on the lekkiepe express way in lagos following in the tailwind there is no shortage of companies looking to take long leaseholds of units with the likes of shoprite game and pick n pay leading the expansion across africa office space is also developing at a pace with the wings office towers on victoria island and heritage place in the ikoyi district of lagos being two standout grade a offices under developmentthe success of ambitious infrastructure projects such as lekki port would likely increase investors’ appetite to expand their operations and capture the anticipated growth the economist reported in september  that shoprite’s goods were taking  days to reach market in nigeria with port congestion in lagos being a major contributor to this delay the expansion of port capacity will therefore assist those seeking to expand their business routes into and out of nigeria and have substantial positive macroeconomic effect the hurdles investment in these projects is of course not without its risks whilst some marketrisk private sector projects have already successfully closed in nigeria in recent years without any government support such as the nigerianled main one telecommunications cable between nigeria ghana and portugal and telecoms towers developments led principally by ihs and helios for those projects with a key public sector delivery component a number of key aspects will need to be in place to ensure swift closure of projects and to allow the pipeline of projects to reach its potentialgovernmental support supporting infrastructure to the project site whether by way of new roads or capacity upgrades to existing roads and junctions can be a key area where government policy or undertakings can provide comfort to a greenfield project it may be difficult to obtain fixed commitments for this as government departments will be reluctant to commit to major expenditure on their own part until there is some certainty as to the required traffic without infrastructure support however it may be more difficult to finance the project on some projects the success of the project may be dependent on the delivery of essential government services and it would be wise to structure this type of support with key servicelevel deliverables that the concessionaire and lenders can rely oncredit support the size and nature of the project may mean that additional government comfort is required to support the obligations of the relevant state agencies entering into any longterm concession contracts federal government support will not by itself allow a project to reach investmentgrade status dfis will therefore continue to play an important part during this phase of infrastructure development and in addition to mainstays such as african development bank and ifc other institutions such as european investment bank and islamic development bank are also gearing up to provide significant finance to nigerian projects additional credit support arrangements such as political risk insurance pri cover and eca coverage will also play a necessary part of the funding mix for the project although this too will add to the complexity of the projectsexit strategy a critical issue for lenders and other investors will be the level of government underpinning for their investment in a termination scenario particularly on a concessionaire default in nigeria’s current state of ppp development the level of necessary support is likely to remain extremely high not all project eventualities can be foreseen and circumstances may arise where the project needs to be terminated or otherwise handed back to the government this is a very topical issue given lagos state’s recent announcement that it had bought out  per cent of the equity in lekki concession company ltd the concessionaire on the lekkiepe expressway ppp since  effectively returning the project back into state government control one of the other major concession projects in the region the murtala mohammed ii domestic airport terminal concession being operated by bicourtney limited has also been the subject of very public court battles against the federal government to enforce the concessionaire’s exclusivity rights at the airport although bicourtney most recently succeeded in court in restraining the federal government this episode suggests that investors may need to be prepared to go to some lengths to protect their economic interests which should either be dealt with through appropriate dispute resolution structures or otherwise factored into the risk profile for the projectrobust contract structures even with the above arrangements in place the robustness of the project contract structures such as epc and om contracts can have a large role to play in ensuring the bankability of the project there are recent examples on nigerian projects of subcontractors taking an enhanced role in providing protection for the concessionaire in certain project distress situations for the benefit of the lenders the lenders may also expect project throughputs to be guaranteed to particular levels or for these to be demonstrated by the concessionaire obtaining a sufficient level of longterm usage contracts conclusion nigeria is now so strategically important that it cannot be ignored by investors and increasing international interest is being matched by increased commitment by dfis nigerian infrastructure ppps to date have had a rocky start but the market outlook still remains promising to those prepared to work hard and find an appropriate balance of risks and opportunity that will allow their project to stand the test of time sector infrastructure mining and commodities practice infrastructure top stay up to date subscribe tweet contacts
