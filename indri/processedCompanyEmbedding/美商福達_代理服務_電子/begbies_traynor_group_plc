administrators trustees agents for business sales acquisitions mergers also provide highly covert detailed intelligence  data and information services to amongst others solicitors here is an extremely profound mission statement of theirs click they stop at nothing not even criminal acts you can read here about a case in question btgred fag alert received such instructions from harold g walker solicitors hugh storry deans as part of btgred flag alert criminal practices and stopping at nothing click here they stole on multiple occasions an adversaries consumersdata subject highly sensitive confidential personal credit files data and information from the online data bases of equifax and experian by committing multiple fraudulent deceptions on equifax and experian btgred flag alert were able to steal the consumerdata subjects highly sensitive confidential personal credit files data  and information by simply telling lies and confirming in the online affirmative declarations to equifax and experian that they btgred flag alert held the consumersdata subjects consent to obtain this in reading btgs correspondence they make numerous deflective statements to try and cover up their criminal activity such as in the second paragraph of their letter of the th july  and in their letter of the rd august  and many more as can be read in the correspondence read here the truth is that neither btgred flag alert harold g walker nor anyone else held any such consent neither did they hold consent by way of a court order and neither had they made any applications to the data controllers of equifax and experian for a section  exemption to obtain the consumerdata subjects highly sensitive confidential personal credit files data  and information btgred flag alert simply did what they state in their mission statements and “stopped at nothing” and just stole the credit files and data of the consumerdata subject by the criminal act of fraudulently deceiving equifax and experian in their online application by btgred flag alert confirming that they held the consumersdata subjects consent which they did not have  read here extracts from equifax and experian correspondence on this  it is entirely probable that btg could have been involved for many years in this pattern  practice scheme of serial criminal activities of covertly stealing consumersdata subjects highly sensitive confidential personal credit files data and information from equifax and experian the five file footprints left throughout april  on the consumersdata subjects credit files held by equifax and experian shows the name accessing their online data bases as btg intelligence ltd a name that was the predecessor name to btg global risk partners ltd interestingly this company number 9 was originally named fact finder detective bureau ltd read here   the fact that these criminal and illegal acts are i heinous breaches of consumersdata subjects right to privacy ii heinous breaches of the consumersdata subjects  rights under the data protection act  iii trespass on the consumersdata subjects sensitive confidential personal data and credit files iv criminal fraud by deception v theft of a consumersdata subjects sensitive confidential credit files and information vi possible conspiracy vii a criminal offence contrary to section  of the data protection act does  not in anyway trouble btgred flag alert these types of serial heinous criminal activities are normally associated with career criminals not a public company on the london stock exchange  john humphrey is btgs group head of risk and compliance and the data protection officer apparently john humphrey has selective knowledge of compliance matters the data protection act and criminality this selective knowledge of compliance matters the data protection act and criminality is surprising given that john humphrey is a solicitor regulated by the sra with sra number  red flag alerts kevin hooker is a member of the association of british investigators as also is mike wright  who was the head of btg global risk partners ltd during the time of the criminal events as reported here     note john humphrey did not unsurprisingly accept the offer made in the final paragraph of consumers letter dec   to join in a conference call to the ico it is highly probable that consumersdata subjects who knowingly or unknowingly have been the subject of btgsred flag alert attention may have their cases investigated by authorities for the illegal and criminal accessing and obtaining of their confidential sensitive personal data credit files and iontrnformation from the online data bases of the credit reference agencies such activities are as a minimum criminal offences under section  of
