city are vertical characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services and the peripheries are generally developed with two to fourstory buildings  although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis compared to other global cities such as the island cities of new york city and hong kong however são paulo is considered a lowrise building city its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories and the average residential building is twenty nevertheless it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings emporis buildings besides possessing what was considered until  the tallest skyscraper of the country the mirante do vale also known as palácio zarzur kogan with  meters of height and  floors such tissue heterogeneity however is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents drug trafficking street vending and prostitution which encouraged the creation of new socioeconomic centralities the characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the th century with the relocation of industries to other cities or states several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas the constant change of the landscape of são paulo due to the technological changes of its buildings has been a striking feature of the city pointed out by scholars in a period of a century between the middle of  and  the city of são paulo was practically demolished and rebuilt at least three times these three periods are characterized by the typical constructive processes of their times urban planningedit changes in urban fabrics in the region of pacaembu neighborhood side by side vertical areas and low houses the city view from altino arantes building vale do anhangabaú in downtown são paulo has a history of actions projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of antonio da silva prado baron duprat washington and luis francisco prestes maia however in general the city was formed during the th century growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl urban growth in são paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the th century according to urban historians since the late th century and until the s são paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing from the s to the s são paulo followed a model of centerperiphery social segregation in which the upper and middleclasses occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious selfbuilt housing in the periphery and from the s onward new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security thus são paulo differs considerably from other brazilian cities such as belo horizonte and goiânia whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan or a city like brasília whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction the effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes in são paulo until the mids the plans were based on the idea of demolish and rebuild including former mayor prestes maia são paulos road plan known as the avenues plan or saturnino de britos plan for the tietê river the plan of the avenues was implemented during the s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts this plan included renewing the commercial city center leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods  the plan also led to the expansion of bus services which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system this contributed to the outwards expansion of são paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of selfbuilt singlefamily houses in  the urban development plan proposed the basic plan for integrated development of são paulo under the administration of figueiredo ferraz the main result was zoning laws it lasted until  when the basic plan was replaced by the current master plan that zoning adopted in  designated z areas residential areas designed for elites and z a mixed zone lacking clear definitions about their characteristics zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation after the s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved driving land prices up the poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase their lot and build their house and were forced to look for a housing alternative as a result favelas and precarious tenements cortiços appeared these housing types were often located closer to the center of the city favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized often dangerous or unsanitary and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city favelas went back into the urban perimeter occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization—alongside polluted rivers railways or between bridges by   of são paulo’s population lived in favelas compared to  in  today
