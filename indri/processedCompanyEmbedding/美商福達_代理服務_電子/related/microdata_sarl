references  external links historyedit early yearsedit the company was founded as cmc or computer machinery company limited on  september  by ray parry they were originally distributors and subsequently manufacturers of key to disk computer systems made by the usbased computer machinery corporation the cmc key to disk systems were used by companies and government departments for data capture in  cmc developed a bitslice based intelligent terminal—the p—which it used both as a front end processor to the key to disk systems and as a terminal in its own right it then evolved the cmc p into the p—a true frontend processor which it used to implement a new data capture system call sovereign this was used in manufacturing companies such as rollsroyce plc british steel corporation and various government departments including providing data capture for the dhss at newcastle upon tyne it later evolved into the m system based on intelprocessorbased systems in  cmc merged with microdata corporation a californiabased computer company whose released reality operating and database environment product cmc was also distributing the companies continued to use separate trading names in their respective regions until  the reality name was given to microdatas computer system and the operating system—a version of the pick operating system at the time microdata owned rights to the pick operating system in parallel with dick pick – who had developed it with microdata cmc leasing limited the official trading name then changed its name to microdata uk limited aka muk the company then started uk manufacture of the reality range of computer systems in its manufacturing factory in maxted road hemel hempstead microdata was purchased by mcdonnell douglas corporation in  and the company was rebranded as mcdonnell douglas information systems limited mdis the company introduced the m called sequoia in us which offered dynamic performance using soft loaded firmware and processor performance keys using the same hardware components to minimise sparing and maximise cost effectiveness although mb memory sold for  gbp in those days a new manufacturing and office complex was built in boundary way hemel hempstead work started virtually as soon as the building opened to double its size so they became known as phase  and  internally but maylands park externally the company then produced the uk designed spirit processor which was launched as a lowerend reality product as the m later the company developed the series  aka pegasus successor to the sequoia using a worldwide development team spanning the two engineering facilities in hemel hempstead uk and irvine california in  the second new building known as marylands park south was completed at boundary way to accommodate the thousand staff then at the head office location at the time the company was thought to have one of the largest company car fleets in the uk hertzcitation needed sedit  was the last year mdis made a computer system from scratch which meant the end of uk manufacturing for the company it continued its hardware and systems integration work at maylands park north it could do this because it had produced realityx an open platform reality environment internally known for a time as cora this was the result of several years of development taking the reality operating system ros and reengineering into a unix application capable of running on nonmdis computers realityx provided not only end userapplication compatibility but also provided it at the developer assembler level the same source code was used for realityx and the original reality implementations realityx allowed the reality operating environment and applications developed for reality to continue to be sold and maintained under the seriesx name initially mdis used unix systems from encore computer then from motorola computer systems and data general—all using mk risc processors and unixsystem v later they moved to run on solarisbased systems from sun microsystems the open approach eventually led to a microsoft windows platform in  and continued feature enhancements that are still being developed as of update as a corollary to this operating environment mdis acquired and developed its proiv fourth generation language gl which was used worldwide by companies including fujitsu a variant was
