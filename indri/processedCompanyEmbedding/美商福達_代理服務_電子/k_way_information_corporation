brand is a name term design symbol or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer brands are used in business marketing and advertising initially livestock branding was adopted to differentiate one person’s cattle from anothers by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot branding iron if a person would steal the animals anyone could detect the symbol and deduce the actual owner however the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into branding is a set of marketing and communication methods that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers the key components that form a brands toolbox include a brand’s identity brand communication such as by logos and trademarks brand awareness brand loyalty and various branding brand management strategies brand equity is the measurable totality of a brands worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components as markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty with side effects like reduced price sensitivity a brand is in essence a promise to its customers of they can expect from their products as well as emotional benefits when a customer is familiar with a brand or favours it incomparably to its competitors this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the st century and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of product differentiation in accounting a brand defined as an intangible asset is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value and brand valuation is an important management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand and allows marketing investment to be managed eg prioritized across a portfolio of brands to maximize shareholder value although only acquired brands appear on a companys balance sheet the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value the word ‘brand’ is often used as a metonym referring to the company that is strongly identified with a

scandavian term “brandr” meaning to burn it is a reference to the practice of using branding irons to burn a mark into the hides of livestock and may also refer to the practice of craftsmen engraving brand names into products tools or personal belongings the oldest generic brand in continuous use in india since the vedic period ca  bce to  bce is the herbal paste known as chyawanprash consumed for its purported health benefits and attributed to a revered rishi or seer named chyawan this product was developed at dhosi hill an extinct volcano in northern india roman glassmakers branded their works with ennion being the most prominent the italians used brands in the form of watermarks on paper in the th century blind stamps hallmarks and silvermakers marks are all types of brand although connected with the history of trademarks and including earlier examples which could be deemed protobrands such as the marketing puns of the vesuvinum wine jars found at pompeii brands in the field of massmarketing originated in the th century with the advent of packaged goods industrialization moved the production of many household items such as soap from local communities to centralized factories when shipping their items the factories would literally brand their logo or insignia on the barrels used extending the meaning of brand to that of a trademark bass  company the british brewery claims their redtriangle brand as the worlds first trademark tate  lyle of lyles golden syrup makes a similar claim having been recognized by guinness world records as britains oldest brand with its greenandgold packaging having remained almost unchanged since  another example comes from antiche fornaci giorgi in italy which has stamped or carved its bricks as found in saint peters basilica in the vatican city with the same protologo since  cattlebranding has been used since ancient egypt the term maverick originally meaning an unbranded calf came from a texas pioneer rancher sam maverick whose neglected cattle often got loose and were rounded up by his neighbors use of the word maverick spread among cowboys and came to apply to unbranded calves found wandering alone factories established during the industrial revolution introduced massproduced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market  to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods it quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar local products the packagedgoods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the nonlocal product pears soap campbells soup soft drink cocacola juicy fruit chewing gum aunt jemima pancake mix and quaker oats oatmeal were among the first products to be branded in an effort to increase the consumers familiarity with their merits other brands which date from that era such as uncle bens rice and kelloggs breakfast cereal furnish illustrations of the trend around  james walter thompson published a house ad explaining trademark advertising this was an early commercial explanation of what we now know as branding companies soon adopted slogans mascots and jingles that began to appear on radio and early television by the s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers were developing relationships with their brands in a socialpsychologicalanthropological sense manufacturers quickly learned to build their brands identity and personality such as youthfulness fun or luxury this began the practice we now know as branding today where the consumers buy the brand instead of the product this trend continued to the s and is now quantified in concepts such as brand value and brand equity naomi klein has described this development as brand equity mania in  for example philip morris purchased kraft for six times what the company was worth on paper it was feltby whom that what they really purchased was its brand name april   or marlboro friday is often considered the death of the brand – the day philip morris declared that they were cutting the price of marlboro cigarettes by  in order to compete with bargain cigarettes marlboro cigarettes were notedby whom at the time for their heavy advertising campaigns and wellnuanced brand image in response to the announcement wall street stocks nosedived for a large number of branded companies heinz cocacola quaker oats pepsico tide and lysol many thought the event signalled the beginning of a trend towards brand blindness klein  questioning the power of brand value conceptsedit effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product but of other products associated with that brandcitation needed if a customer loves pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company  such as chocolatechip cookies for example brand development often the task of a design team takes time to produce brand is the personality that identifies a product service or company name term sign symbol or design or combination of them and how it relates to key constituencies customers staff partners investors etccitation needed some peoplewho distinguish the psychological aspect brand associations like thoughts feelings perceptions images experiences beliefs attitudes and so on that become linked to the brand of a brand from the experiential aspect the experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is knownby whom as the brand experience the brand experience is a brands action perceived by a personcitation needed the psychological aspect sometimes referred to as the brand image is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product with a service or with the companyies providing themcitation needed people engaged in branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or uniquecitation needed a brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an advertising theme as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the marketplaceclarification needed the art of creating and maintaining a brand is called brand management orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called brand orientation brand orientation develops in response to market intelligencecitation needed careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant to a target audience brands should be seenby whom as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price – they represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer a widely known brand is saidby whom to have brand recognition when brand recognition builds up to a point where a brand enjoys a critical mass of positive sentiment in the marketplace it is said to have achieved brand franchise brand recognition is most successful when people can state a brand without being explicitly exposed to the companys name but rather through visual signifiers like logos slogans and colors for example disney successfully branded its particular script font originally created for walt disneys signature logo which it used in the logo for gocom visual identity example created by przemek kowal consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or servicescitation needed as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic see also brand promise from the perspective of brand owners branded products or services can command higher prices where two products resemble each other but one of the products has no associated branding such as a generic storebranded product potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner corporate brand identityedit brand identity is the embodiment behind a corporations reason for existencecitation needed simply the brand identity is a set of individual components such as a name a design a set of imagery a slogan a vision etc which set the brand aside from others in order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity it must have an indepth understanding of its target market competitors and the surrounding business environment brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity the core identity reflects consistent longterm associations with the brand whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif according to kotler et al  a brands identity may deliver four levels of meaning attributes benefits values personality a brands attributes are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated for example a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness however a brands attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product these attributes must be communicated through benefits which are more emotional translations if a brands attribute is being environmentally friendly customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand aside from attributes and benefits a brands identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of values if a company is seen to symbolise specific values it will in turn attract customers who also believe in these valuescitation needed for example nikes brand represents the value of a just do it attitudecitation needed thuscitation needed this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value even more extensive than its perceived values is a brands personality quite literally one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person this form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining longlasting relationships with consumers as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand  collectively all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors brand awarenessedit brand awareness involves a customers ability to recall andor recognise brands logos and branded advertising brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from competing brands and thus the brand helps customers understand which brand satisfies their needs thus the brand offers the customer a shortcut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a category brand awareness is a key step in the customers purchase decision process since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing that is customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brands identity and of its communication methods successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness as this can oftenquantify be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions various forms of brand awareness can be identified each form reflects a different stage in a customers cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance most companies aim for topofmind topofmind awareness occurs when a brand pops into a consumers mind when asked to name brands in a product category for example when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue the common answer kleenex will represent a topofmind brand unaided awareness also known as brand recall or spontaneous awareness refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category aided awareness also known as brand recognition occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide strategic awareness occurs when a brand is not only topofmind to consumers but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market the distinctions that set a product apart from the competition isare also knownby whom as the unique selling point or usp brand recognition is the initial phase of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being preexposed to the brand when customers experience brand recognition they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue for example when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand heshe may remember being introduced to the brand before this would be classifiedby whom as brand recognition as the customer can retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand once given a cue often this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a lowinvolvement purchasing decision unlike brand recognition brand recall is not triggered by a visual or verbal cue instead brand recall requires that the consumers correctly retrieve the brand from memory rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need consumers are faced with a need first and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need this level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumers memory to enable unassisted remembrance thus brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding touchpoints have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers marketingmix modeling can help marketing leaders optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales managing brands for value creation will often involve applying marketingmix modeling techniques in conjunction with brand valuationcitation needed brand elementsedit brands

purchase experience stages brand communicationedit although brand identity is regardedby whom as the most fundamental asset to a brands equity the worth of a brands identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication integrated marketing communications imc relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its stakeholders  five key components comprise imc advertising sales promotions direct marketing personal selling public relations the effectiveness of a brands communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brands intended message through its imc although imc is a broad strategic concept the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointedby whom to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers one can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps firstly a sourcesender wishes to convey a message to a receiver this source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand after the encoding stage the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel in imc channels may include media elements such as advertising public relations sales promotions etc it is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation finally the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render often a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market which is caused by …unplanned static or distortion during the communication process the final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message which is received by the original sender as feedback when a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message therefore a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively …affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived  in order for brands to effectively communicate to customers marketers must …consider all touch points or sources of contact that a customer has with the brandpage needed touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model where a message travels from the sender to the receiver any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand  whether watching a television advertisement hearing about a brand through word of mouth or even noticing a branded license plate  defines a touch point according to dalen et al  every touch point has the …potential to add positive  or suppress negative  associations to the brands equity  thus a brands imc should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market one methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion for example if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers senses as well as memory another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with customer experience as suggested figure  certain touch points link with a specific stage in customerbrandinvolvement for example a brand may recognise that advertising touch points are most effective during the prepurchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers overall a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using imc branding communications through touch points brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the business world and refers to how businesses transmit their brand messages characteristics and attributes to their consumers one method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves electronic wordof mouth ewom ewom is a relatively newwhen approach identifiedby whom to communicate with consumers one popular method of ewom involves social networking sites snss such as twitter a study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site twitter research further found that the more consumers retweeted and communicated with a brand the more they trusted the brand this suggests that a company could look to employ a socialmedia campaign to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages mckee  also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognising the brand in  riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood one way a company can do this involves choosing a product or services brand name as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter it is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood it has also been foundby whom that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multisensory information one article suggests that other senses apart

metric of brand trust it is a result of action behavior communication and attitude of an entity with the most trust results emerging from its action component action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand the primary experience carrying primary audiences however the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand the all important secondary audience brand parityedit brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent this means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand when brand parity operates quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist expanding role of brandedit branding was meant to make identifying and differentiating a product easier while also providing the benefit of letting the name sell a second rate product over time brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise for the product certainly but eventually also for the company behind the brand today brand

the product brands exactly how the company name relates to product and services names is known as brand architecture decisions about company names and product names and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations in this case a strong brand name or company name is made the vehicle for a range of products for example mercedesbenz or black  decker or a range of subsidiary brands such as cadbury dairy milk cadbury flake or cadbury fingers in the uk individual brandingedit main article individual branding each brand has a separate name such as sevenup koolaid or nivea sun beiersdorf which may compete against other brands from the same company for example persil omo surf and lynx are all owned by unilever challenger brandsedit main article challenger brand

conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry multiproduct branding strategyedit multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class when the companys trade name is used multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding family branding or umbrella branding examples of companies that use corporate branding are microsoft samsung apple and sony as the companys brand name is identical to their trade name other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include virgin and church  dwight virgin a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines hot air balloons telecommunication to healthcare church  dwight a manufacturer of household products displays the arm  hammer family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages it capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name consequently the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible product line extensionedit main article product line extension product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name an example of this is the campbell soup company predominately a producer of canned soups they utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions they have over  soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular campbell soup condensed chunky freshbrewed organic and soup on the go this approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products therefore increasing the level of brand awareness although line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the companys line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors subbrandingedit main article subbranding subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies subbranding merges a corporate family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings it can alter a brands identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand examples of successful subbranding can be seen through gatorade and porsche gatorade a manufacturer of sportthemed food and beverages effectively introduced gatorade g a lowcalorie line of gatorade drinks likewise porsche a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lowerend line porsche boxster and higherend line porsche carrera brand extensionedit main article brand extension brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension nevertheless brand extension has its disadvantages there is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers examples of brand extension can be seen through kimberlyclark and honda kimberlyclark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the huggies brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies the success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the  million in annual sales generated globally similarly honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles power equipment engines robots aircraft and bikes cobrandingedit main article cobranding cobranding is a variation of brand extension it is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers cobranding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class an example of a cobranding success is whitakers working with lewis road creamery to create a cobranded beverage called lewis road creamery and whittakers chocolate milk this product was a huge success in the new zealand market with it going viral multibranding strategyedit multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on pricequality segments procter  gamble pg a multinational consumer goods company that offers over  brands each suited for different consumer needs for instance head  shoulders that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo oralb which offers interdental products vicks which offers cough and cold products and downy which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners other examples include cocacola nestlé kelloggs and mars this approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising this is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions multibranding strategy has many advantages there is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment although certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits for example unilever the worlds thirdlargest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over  brands to centre their attention onto  brands with sales of over  billion euros unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands fighting brandsedit main article fighter brands the main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands for example qantas australias largest flag carrier airline introduced jetstar to go headtohead against the lowcost carrier virgin australia formerly known as virgin blue jetstar is an australian lowcost airline for budget conscious travellers but it receives many negative reviews due to this the launching of jetstar allowed qantas to rival virgin australia without the criticism being affiliated with qantas because of the distinct brand name private branding strategyedit private branding is also known as reseller branding private labelling store brands or own brands have increased in popularity private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers the pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting in australia their leading supermarket chains both woolworths and coles are saturated with store brands or private labels for example in the united states paragon trade brands ralcorp holdings and rayovac are major suppliers of diapers grocery products and private label alkaline batteries correspondingly costco walmart radioshack sears and kroger are large retailers that have their own brand names similarly macys a midrange chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores from brands such as first impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing hotel collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses and tasso elba which supply european inspired menswear they use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets mixed branding strategyedit mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own names and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market for example elizabeth arden inc a major american cosmetics and fragrance company uses mixed branding strategy the company sells its elizabeth arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at walmart with the skin simple brand name companies such as whirlpool del monte and dial produce private brands of home appliances pet foods and soap correspondingly other examples of mixed branding strategy include michelin epson microsoft gillette and toyota michelin one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed sears an american retail chain to place their brand name on the tires microsoft a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity gillette catered to females with gillette for women which has now become known as venus the launch of venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry similarly toyota an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding in the us toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down but toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end expensive market segment thus they created lexus the luxury vehicle division of premium cars attitude branding and iconic brandsedit attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling which is not necessarily connected with the product or consumption of the product at all marketing labeled as attitude branding include that of nike starbucks the body shop safeway and apple inc in the  book no logo naomi klein describes attitude branding as a fetish strategy schaefer and kuehlwein analyzed brands such as apple ben  jerrys or chanel describing them as ueberbrands  brands that are able to gain and retain meaning beyond the material a great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience whether its the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness or the affirmation that the cup of coffee youre drinking really matters – howard schultz president ceo and chairman of starbucks the color letter font and style of the cocacola and diet cocacola logos in english were copied into matching hebrew logos to maintain brand identity in israel iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumers selfexpression and personal identity brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be identity brands some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them iconic brands examples are apple nike and harleydavidson many iconic brands include almost rituallike behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products there are four key elements to creating iconic brands holt  necessary conditions – the performance of the product must at least be acceptable preferably with a reputation of having good quality mythmaking – a meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders these must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted cultural contradictions – some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society in other words a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were the cultural brand management process – actively engaging in the mythmaking process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon schaefer and kuehlwein propose the following ueberbranding principles they derived them from studying successful modern prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price alone in the minds of consumers mission incomparable  having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond making money setting rules that follow this purpose  even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of consumer is always bossright longing versus belonging  playing with the opposing desires of people for inclusion on the one hand and exclusivity on the other unselling – first and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation rather than to sell through arguments from myth to meaning  leveraging the power of myth  ueberstories that have fascinated and guided humans forever behold  making product and associated brand rituals reflect the essence of the brand mission and myth making it the center of attention while keeping it fresh living the dream  living the brand mission as an organization and through its actions thus radiating the brand myth from the inside out consistently and through all brand manifestations  for nothing is as volatile than a dream growth without end  avoiding to be perceived as omnipresent diluting brand appeal instead growing with gravitas by leveraging scarcityhigh prices sideways expansion and other means nobrand brandingedit recently a number of companies have successfully pursued nobrand strategies by creating packaging that imitates generic brand simplicity examples include the japanese company muji which means no label in english from  – mujirushi ryohin – literally no brand quality goods and the florida company noad sunscreen although there is a distinct muji brand muji products are not branded this nobrand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and mujis success is attributed to the wordofmouth a simple shopping experience and the antibrand movement no brand branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name tapa amarilla or yellow cap in venezuela during the s is another good example of nobrand strategy it was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company derived brandsedit in this case the supplier of a key component used by a number of suppliers of the endproduct may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right the most frequently quoted example is intel which positions itself in the pc market with the slogan and sticker intel inside brand extension and brand dilutionedit the existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products for example many fashion and designer companies extended brands into fragrances shoes and accessories home textile home decor luggage sun glasses furniture hotels etc mars extended its brand to ice cream caterpillar to shoes and watches michelin to a restaurant guide adidas and puma to personal hygiene dunlop extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes golf balls tennis racquets and adhesives frequently the product is no different from what else is on the market except a brand name marking brand is product identity there is a difference between brand extension and line extension a line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class with new varieties or flavors or sizes when cocacola launched diet coke and cherry coke they stayed within the originating product category nonalcoholic carbonated beverages procter  gamble pg did likewise extending its strong lines such as fairy soap into neighboring products fairy liquid and fairy automatic within the same category dish washing detergents the risk of overextension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment product area or quality price or cachetcitation needed social media brandsedit in the better mousetrap brand invention in a media democracy  author and brand strategist simon pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form because they focus not on themselves but on their users in so doing social media brands are arguably more charismatic in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism we wear our physical brands like badges to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are they allow us to be to hold a mirror up to ourselves and it is clear we like what we see  multibrandsedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed february  learn how and when to remove this template message alternatively in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand and often with identical product characteristics simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands the rationale is that having  out of  brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having  out of  even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one in its most extreme manifestation a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first in order to preempt others entering the market this strategy is widely known as multibrand strategy individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products of differing quality to be sold without confusing the consumers perception of what business the company is in or diluting higher quality products once again procter  gamble is a leading exponent of this philosophy running as many as ten detergent brands in the us market this also increases the total number of facings it receives on supermarket shelves sara lee on the other hand uses it to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from sara lee cakes through kiwi polishes to leggs pantyhose in the hotel business marriott uses the name fairfield inns for its budget chain and choice hotels uses rodeway for its own cheaper hotels cannibalization is a particular problem of a multibrand strategy approach in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns this may be acceptable indeed to be expected if there is a net gain overall alternatively it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market the new product being one stage in this process private labelsedit private label brands also called own brands or store brands have become popular where the retailer has a particularly strong identity such as marks  spencer in the uk clothing sector this own brand may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded designer private labels a relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels designerprivate labels involve a collaborative contract between a wellknown fashion designer and a retailer both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget for retail outlets these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic in australia for example the department store myer now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including jayson brundson karen walker leona edmiston wayne cooper fleur wood and ‘l’ for lisa ho another upmarket department store david jones currently offers ‘collette’ for leading australian designer collette dinnigan and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands target has teamed up with danii minogue to produce her “petites’ range specsavers has joined up with sydney designer alex

that it circulated in popular culture dbi targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands the purpose of dbis is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities the term stems from the combination of the german words doppel double and gänger walker doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values through a form of parody and are typically unflattering in nature due to the ability of doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to reposition the brand in a way that defuses the criticism examples include joe chemo campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects version of the cocacola logo crafted to protest their sponsorship of the  fifa world cup in qatar and associated human rights abuses see citation for original reddit thread featuring the image parody of the pepsi logo as an obese man to highlight

city and later acquired by johnson  johnson ky jellys original stated purpose was as a surgical lubricant and it was often chosen by doctors because of its natural base the product is now more widely used as a sexual lubricant it does not react with latex condoms or silicone rubberbased sex toys while ky has a thick consistency and a tendency to dry out during use it can be reactivated by the addition of saliva or more water ky jelly does not contain a spermicide a formulation with nonoxynol was available but johnson  johnson removed it from the market after finding that it could facilitate hiv spread propertiesedit unlike petroleumbased lubricants ky is generally biologically inert and contains no color or perfume additives the lubricant is extremely popular because it does not stain and is easily cleaned up ky jelly has been available over the counter in the united states since  compositionedit ky ng uses glycerin and hydroxyethyl cellulose as the lubricant with

documentaries such as the terror takes shape found on the dvd and bluray editions of john carpenters the thing ky jelly has also found use in the horrormovie industry by special effects technicians

fivegallon pails of ky jelly in order to slime up the dogmonster for the infamous kennel scene from the thing copious amounts of ky jelly were also used to simulate saliva and to give the eponymous alien of the  film an overall slimy appearance as well as the blood of the eponymous predator of the  film which was mixed with chemiluminescence fluid from green glowsticks ky jelly was used for the
