historyedit the inspiration for the burgeoning business process now known as plm came from american motors corporation amc the automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors in  according to françois castaing vice president for product engineering and development lacking the massive budgets of general motors ford and foreign competitors … amc placed rd emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products particularly jeeps after introducing its compact jeep cherokee xj the vehicle that launched the modern sport utility vehicle suv market amc began development of a new model that later came out as the jeep grand cherokee the first part in its quest for faster product development was computeraided design cad software system that make engineers more productive the second part in this effort was the new communication system that allowed conflicts to be resolved faster as well as reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database the product data management was so effective that after amc was purchased by chrysler the system was expanded throughout the enterprise connecting everyone involved in designing and building products while an early adopter of plm technology chrysler was able to become the auto industrys lowestcost producer recording development costs that were half of the industry average by the mids during  rockwell international developed initial concepts of pdm and plm for the bb bomber program the system called engineering data system eds was augmented to interface with computervision and cadam systems to track part configurations and lifecycle of components and assemblies computervison later released implementing only the pdm aspects as the lifecycle model was specific to rockwell and aerospace needs formsedit plm systems help organizations in coping with the increasing complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets product lifecycle management plm should be distinguished from product lifecycle management marketing plcm plm describes the engineering aspect of a product from managing descriptions and properties of a product through its development and useful life whereas plcm refers to the commercial management of life of a product in the business market with respect to costs and sales measures product lifecycle management can be considered one of the four cornerstones of a manufacturing corporations information technology structure all companies need to manage communications and information with their customers crmcustomer relationship management their suppliers and fulfillment scmsupply chain their resources within the enterprise erpenterprise resource planning and their product planning and development plm one form of plm is called peoplecentric plm while traditional plm tools have been deployed only on release or during the release phase peoplecentric plm targets the design phase as of  ict development eufunded promise project – has allowed plm to extend beyond traditional plm and integrate sensor data and real time lifecycle event data into plm as well as allowing this information to be made available to different players in the total lifecycle of an individual product closing the information loop this has resulted in the extension of plm into closedloop lifecycle management clm benefitsedit documented benefits of product lifecycle management include reduced time to market increase full price sales improved product quality and reliability reduced prototyping costs more accurate and timely request for quote generation ability to quickly identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions savings through the reuse of original data a framework for product optimization reduced waste savings through the complete integration of engineering workflows documentation that can assist in proving compliance for rohs or title  cfr part  ability to provide contract manufacturers with access to a centralized product record seasonal fluctuation management improved forecasting to reduce material costs maximize supply chain collaboration areas of plmedit within plm there are five primary areas systems engineering se is focused on meeting all requirements primarily meeting customer needs and coordinating the systems design process by involving all relevant disciplines an important aspect for life cycle management is a subset within systems engineering called reliability engineering product and portfolio m² ppm is focused on managing resource allocation tracking progress plan for new product development projects that are in process or in a holding status portfolio management is a tool that assists management in tracking progress on new products and making tradeoff decisions when allocating scarce resources product design cax is the process of creating a new product to be sold by a business to its customers manufacturing process management mpm is a collection of technologies and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured product data management pdmis focused on capturing and maintaining information on products andor services through their development and useful life change management is an important part of pdmplm note while application software is not required for plm processes the business complexity and rate of change requires organizations execute as rapidly as possible introduction to development processedit the core of plm product lifecycle management is in the creation and central management of all product data and the technology used to access this information and knowledge plm as a discipline emerged from tools such as cad cam and pdm but can be viewed as the integration of these tools with methods people and the processes through all stages of a product’s life it is not just about software technology but is also a business strategy product lifecycle management for simplicity the stages described are shown in a traditional sequential engineering workflow the exact order of event and tasks will vary according to the product and industry in question but the main processes are conceive specification concept design design detailed design validation and analysis simulation tool design realise plan manufacturing manufacture buildassemble test quality control service sell and deliver use maintain and support dispose the major key point events are order idea kickoff design freeze launch the reality is however more complex people and departments cannot perform their tasks in isolation and one activity cannot simply finish and the next activity start design is an iterative process often designs need to be modified due to manufacturing constraints or conflicting requirements whether a customer order fits into the time line depends on the industry type and whether the products are for example built to order engineered to order or assembled to order phases of product lifecycle and corresponding technologiesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march  learn how and when to remove this template message many software solutions have been developed to organize and integrate the different phases of a product’s lifecycle plm should not be seen as a single software product but a collection of software tools and working methods integrated together to address either single stages of the lifecycle or connect different tasks or manage the whole process some software providers cover the whole plm range while others single niche application some applications can span many fields of plm with different modules within the same data model an overview of the fields within plm is covered here it should be noted however that the simple classifications do not always fit exactly many areas overlap and many software products cover more than one area or do not fit easily into one category it should also not be forgotten that one of the main goals of plm is to collect knowledge that can be reused for other projects and to coordinate simultaneous concurrent development of many products it is about business processes people and methods as much as software application solutions although plm is mainly associated with engineering tasks it also involves marketing activities such as product portfolio management ppm particularly with regards to new product development npd there are several lifecycle models in industry to consider but most are rather similar what follows below is one possible lifecycle model while it emphasizes hardwareoriented products similar phases would describe any form of product or service including nontechnical or softwarebased products phase  conceiveedit imagine specify plan innovateedit the first stage is the definition of the product requirements based on customer company market and regulatory bodies’ viewpoints from this specification the products major technical parameters can be defined in parallel the initial concept design work is performed defining the aesthetics of the product together with its main functional aspects many different media are used for these processes from pencil and paper to clay models to d caid computeraided industrial design software in some concepts the investment of resources into research or analysisofoptions may be included in the conception phase – eg bringing the technology to a level of maturity sufficient to move to the next phase however lifecycle engineering is iterative it is always possible that something doesnt work well in any phase enough to back up into a prior phase – perhaps all the way back to conception or research there are many examples to draw from phase  designedit describe define develop test analyze and validateedit this is where the detailed design and development of the product’s form starts progressing to prototype testing through pilot release to full product launch it can also involve redesign and ramp for improvement to existing products as well as planned obsolescence the main tool used for design and development is cad this can be simple d drawing  drafting or d parametric feature based solidsurface modeling such software includes technology such as hybrid modeling reverse engineering kbe knowledgebased engineering ndt nondestructive testing and assembly construction this step covers many engineering disciplines including mechanical electrical electronic software embedded and domainspecific such as architectural aerospace automotive  along with the actual creation of geometry there is the analysis of the components and product assemblies simulation validation and optimization tasks are carried out using cae computeraided engineering software either integrated in the cad package or standalone these are used to perform tasks such as stress analysis fea finite element analysis kinematics computational fluid dynamics cfd and mechanical event simulation mes caq computeraided quality is used for tasks such as dimensional tolerance engineering analysis another task performed at this stage is the sourcing of bought out components possibly with the aid of procurement systems phase  realizeedit manufacture make build procure produce sell and deliveredit once the design of the product’s components is complete the method of manufacturing is defined this includes cad tasks such as tool design including creation of cnc machining instructions for the product’s parts as well as creation of specific tools to manufacture those parts using integrated or separate cam computeraided manufacturing software this will also involve analysis tools for process simulation of operations such as casting molding and diepress forming once the manufacturing method has been identified cpm comes into play this involves cape computer aided production engineering or capcapp computer aided production planning tools for carrying out factory plant and facility layout and production simulation eg pressline simulation industrial ergonomics as well as tool selection management once components are manufactured their geometrical form and size can be checked against the original cad data with the use of computeraided inspection equipment and software parallel to the engineering tasks sales product configuration and marketing documentation work take place this could include transferring engineering data geometry and part list data to a web based sales configurator and other desktop publishing systems phase  serviceedit use operate maintain support sustain phaseout retire recycle and disposaledit the final phase of the lifecycle involves managing inservice information this can include providing customers and service engineers with the support and information required for repair and maintenance as well as waste management or recycling this can involve the use of tools such as maintenance repair and operations management mro software there is an endoflife to every product whether it be disposal or destruction of material objects or information this needs to be carefully considered since it may be legislated and hence not free from ramifications all phases product lifecycleedit communicate manage and collaborateedit none of the above phases should be considered as isolated in reality a project does not run sequentially or separated from other product development projects with information flowing between different people and systems a major part of plm is the coordination and management of product definition data this includes managing engineering changes and release status of components configuration product variations document management planning project resources as well as timescale and risk assessment for these tasks data of graphical textual and meta nature — such as product bills of materials boms — needs to be managed at the engineering departments level this is the domain of product data management pdm software or at the corporate level enterprise data management edm software such rigid level distinctions may not be consistently used however it is typical to see two or more data management systems within an organization these systems may also be linked to other corporate systems such as scm crm and erp associated with these system are project management systems for projectprogram planning this central role is covered by numerous collaborative product development tools which run throughout the whole lifecycle and across organizations this requires many technology tools in the areas of conferencing data sharing and data translation this specialised field is referred to as product visualization which includes technologies such as dmu digital mockup immersive virtual digital prototyping virtual reality and photorealistic imaging user skillsedit the broad array of solutions that make up the tools used within a plm solutionset eg cad cam cax were initially used by dedicated practitioners who invested time and effort to gain the required skills designers and engineers worked wonders with cad systems manufacturing engineers became highly skilled cam users while analysts administrators and managers fully mastered their support technologies however achieving the full advantages of plm requires the participation of many people of various skills from throughout an extended enterprise each requiring the ability to access and operate on the inputs and output of other participants despite the increased ease of use of plm tools crosstraining all personnel on the entire plm toolset has not proven to be practical now however advances are being made to address ease of use for all participants within the plm arena one such advance is the availability of role specific user interfaces through tailorable user interfaces uis the commands that are presented to users are appropriate to their function and expertise these techniques include concurrent engineering workflow industrial design bottom–up design top–down design bothendsagainstthemiddle design frontloading design workflow design in context modular design npd new product development dfss design for six sigma dfma design for manufacture  assembly digital simulation engineering requirementdriven design specificationmanaged validation configuration management concurrent engineering workflowedit concurrent engineering british english simultaneous engineering is a workflow that instead of working sequentially through stages carries out a number of tasks in parallel for example starting tool design as soon as the detailed design has started and before the detailed designs of the product are finished or starting on detail design solid models before the concept design surfaces models are complete although this does not necessarily reduce the amount of manpower required for a project as more changes are required due to the incomplete and changing information it does drastically reduce lead times and thus time to market featurebased cad systems have for many years allowed the simultaneous work on d solid model and the d drawing by means of two separate files with the drawing looking at the data in the model when the model changes the drawing will associatively update some cad packages also allow associative copying of geometry between files this allows for example the copying of a part design into the files used by the tooling designer the manufacturing engineer can then start work on tools before the final design freeze when a design changes size or shape the tool geometry will then update concurrent engineering also has the added benefit of providing better and more immediate communication between departments reducing the chance of costly late design changes it adopts a problem prevention method as compared to the problem solving and redesigning method of traditional sequential engineering bottom–up designedit bottom–up design cadcentric occurs where the definition of d models of a product starts with the construction of individual components these are then virtually brought together in subassemblies of more than one level until the full product is digitally defined this is sometimes known as the review structure which shows what the product will look like the bom contains all of the physical solid components of a product from a cad system it may also but not always contain other bulk items required for the final product but which in spite of having definite physical mass and volume are not usually associated with cad geometry such as paint glue oil adhesive tape and other materials bottom–up design tends to focus on the capabilities of available realworld physical technology implementing those solutions which this technology is most suited to when these bottom–up solutions have realworld value bottom–up design can be much more efficient than top–down design the risk of bottom–up design is that it very efficiently provides solutions to lowvalue problems the focus of bottom–up design is what can we most efficiently do with this technology rather than the focus of top–down which is what is the most valuable thing to do top–down designedit top–down design is focused on highlevel functional requirements with relatively less focus on existing implementation technology a top level spec is repeatedly decomposed into lower level structures and specifications until the physical implementation layer is reached the risk of a top–down design is that it may not take advantage of more efficient applications of current physical technology due to excessive layers of lowerlevel abstraction due to following an abstraction path which does not efficiently fit available components eg separately specifying sensing processing and wireless communications elements even though a suitable component that combines these may be available the positive value of top–down design is that it preserves a focus on the optimum solution requirements a partcentric top–down design may eliminate some of the risks of top–down design this starts with a layout model often a simple d sketch defining basic sizes and some major defining parameters which may include some industrial design elements geometry from this is associatively copied down to the next level which represents different subsystems of the product the geometry in the subsystems is then used to define more detail in levels below depending on the complexity of the product a number of levels of this assembly are created until the basic definition of components can be identified such as position and principal dimensions this information is then associatively copied to component files in these files the components are detailed this is where the classic bottom–up assembly starts the top–down assembly is sometime known as a control structure if a single file is used to define the layout and parameters for the review structure it is often known as a skeleton file defense engineering traditionally develops the product structure from the top down the system engineering process prescribes a functional decomposition of requirements and then physical allocation of product structure to the functions this top down approach would normally have lower levels of the product structure developed from cad data as a bottom–up structure or design bothendsagainstthemiddle designedit bothendsagainstthemiddle beatm design is a design process that endeavors to combine the best features of top–down design and bottom–up design into one process a beatm design process flow may begin with an emergent technology which suggests solutions which may have value or it may begin with a top–down view of an important problem which needs a solution in either case the key attribute of beatm design methodology is to immediately focus at both ends of the design process flow a top–down view of the solution requirements and a bottom–up view of the available technology which may offer promise of an efficient solution the beatm design process proceeds from both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the top–down requirements and bottom–up efficient implementation in this fashion beatm has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies indeed some of the best success stories from either top–down or bottom–up have been successful because of an intuitive yet unconscious use of the beatm methodology when employed consciously beatm offers even more powerful advantages front loading design and workflowedit front loading is taking top–down design to the next stage the complete control structure and review structure as well as downstream data such as drawings tooling development and cam models are constructed before the product has been defined or a project kickoff has been authorized these assemblies of files constitute a template from which a family of products can be constructed when the decision has been made to go with a new product the parameters of the product are entered into the template model and all the associated data is updated obviously predefined associative models will not be able to predict all possibilities and will require additional work the main principle is that a lot of the experimentalinvestigative work has already been completed a lot of knowledge is built into these templates to be reused on new products this does require additional resources up front but can drastically reduce the time between project kickoff and launch such methods do however require organizational changes as considerable engineering efforts are moved into offline development departments it can be seen as an analogy to creating a concept car to test new technology for future products but in this case the work is directly used for the next product generation design in contextedit individual components cannot be constructed in isolation cad and caid models of components are created within the context of some or all of the other components within the product being developed this is achieved using assembly modelling techniques geometry of other components can be seen and referenced within the cad tool being used the other referenced components may or may not have been created using the same cad tool with their geometry being translated from other collaborative product development cpd formats some assembly checking such as dmu is also carried out using product visualization software product and process lifecycle management pplmedit product and process lifecycle management pplm is an alternate genre of plm in which the process by which the product is made is just as important as the product itself typically this is the life sciences and advanced specialty chemicals markets the process behind the manufacture of a given compound is a key element of the regulatory filing for a new drug application as such pplm seeks to manage information around the development of the process in a similar fashion that baseline plm talks about managing information around development of the product one variant of pplm implementations are process development execution systems pdes they typically implement the whole development cycle of hightech manufacturing technology developments from initial conception through development and into manufacture pdes integrate people with different backgrounds from potentially different legal entities data information and knowledge and business processes market sizeedit total spending on plm software and services was estimated in  to be above  billion a year market growth estimates are in the area of  there are several plm vendors in the market but the primary players include dassault systemes siemens oracle product dossier ptc and aras innovator pyramid of production systemsedit pyramid of production systems according to malakooti  there are five longterm objectives that should be considered in production systems cost which can be measured in terms of monetary units and usually consists of fixed and variable cost productivity which can be measured in terms of the number of products produced during a period of time quality which can be measured in terms of customer satisfaction levels for example flexibility which can be considered the ability of the system to produce a variety of products for example sustainability which can be measured in terms ecological soundness ie biological and environmental impacts of a production system the relation between these five objects can be presented as pyramid with its tip associated with the lowest cost highest productivity highest quality most flexibility and greatest sustainability the points inside of this pyramid are associated with different combinations of five criteria the tip of the pyramid represents an ideal but likely highly unfeasible system whereas the base of the pyramid represents the worst system possible see

introduction growth maturity decline examples new product development plm software guide product life cycle stages as consumers we buy millions of products every year and just like us these products have a life cycle older longestablished products eventually become less popular while in contrast the demand for new more modern goods usually increases quite rapidly after they are launched because most companies understand the different product life cycle stages and that the products they sell all have a limited lifespan the majority of them will invest heavily in new product development in order to make sure that their businesses continue to grow product life cycle stages explained the product life cycle has  very clearly defined stages each with its own characteristics that mean different things for business that are trying to manage the life cycle of their particular products introduction stage – this stage of the cycle could be the most expensive for a company launching a new product the size of the market for the product is small which means sales are low although they will be increasing on the other hand the cost of things like research and development consumer testing and the marketing needed to launch the product can be very high especially if it’s a competitive sector growth stage – the growth stage is typically characterized by a strong growth in sales and profits and because the company can start to benefit from economies of scale in production the profit margins as well as the overall amount of profit will increase this makes it possible for businesses to invest more money in the promotional activity to maximize the potential of this growth stage maturity stage – during the maturity stage the product is established and the aim for the manufacturer is now to maintain the market share they have built up this is probably the most competitive time for most products and businesses need to invest wisely in any marketing they undertake they also need to consider any product modifications or improvements to the production process which might give them a competitive advantage decline stage – eventually the market for a product will start to shrink and this is what’s known as the decline stage this shrinkage could be due to the market becoming saturated ie all the customers who will buy the product have already purchased it or because the consumers are switching to a different type of product while this decline may be inevitable it may still be possible for companies to make some profit by switching to lessexpensive production methods and cheaper markets   product life cycle examples it’s possible to provide examples of various products to illustrate the different stages of the product life cycle more clearly

for the global competitive marketscitation needed product life cycleedit the concept of product life cycle plc concerns the life of a product in the market with respect to businesscommercial costs and sales measures the product life cycle proceeds through multiple phases involves many professional disciplines and requires many skills tools and processes plc management makes the following three assumptionscitation needed products have a limited life and thus every product has a life cycle product sales pass through distinct stages each posing different challenges opportunities and problems to the seller products require different marketing financing manufacturing purchasing and human resource strategies in each life cycle stage once the product is designed and put into the market the offering should be managed efficiently for the buyers to get value from it before entering into any market complete analysis is carried out by the industry for both external and internal factors including the laws and regulations environment economics cultural values and market needs product life cycle is guanine concept and this term ‘product life cycle’ is associated with every product that exists however due to a limited shelf life the product has to expire from the business perspective as a good business the product needs to be sold before it finishes its life in terms of profitability expiry may jolt the overall profitability of the business therefore there are few strategies which are practiced to ensure that the product is sold within the defined period of maturity extending the product life cycleedit extending the product life cycle by improving sales this can be done through advertising its purpose is to get additional audience and potential customers exploring and expanding to new markets by conducting market research and offering the product or some adapted form of it to new markets it is possible to get more customers price reduction many customers are attracted by price cuts and discount tags adding new features adding value to the product catches the attention of many buyers packaging new attractive useful or ecofriendly packaging influence the target customers changing customer consumption habits promoting new trends of consumption can increase the number of customers special promotions raising interest by offering jackpot and other offers heightening interest many of the following things attract many customers who match certain profiles ecofriendly production processes good work conditions funding the efforts of nonprofit organizations cancer cure antiwar efforts refugees gltbi environment and animal protection etc and the like something important to notice is that all these techniques rely on advertising to become known advertising needs the others to target other potential customers and not the same over and over again characteristics of plc stagesedit there are the following major product life cycle stages stage characteristics  market introduction stage this is the stage in which the product has been introduced first time in the market and the sales of the product starts to grow slowly and gradually and the profit received from the product is nominal and nonattained the market for the product is not competitive initially and also the company spends initially on the advertisement and uses various other tools for promotion in order to motivate and produce awareness among the consumers therefore generating discerning demands for particular brand the products start to gain distribution as the product is initially new in the market and in this stage the quality of the product is not assured and the price of the product will also be determined as low or high costs are very high slow sales volumes to start little or no competition demand has to be created customers have to be prompted to try the product makes little money at this stage  growth stage in the growth stage the product is present already in the market and the consumers of the products are habitual of the product and also there is quick growth in the product sales as more new and new customers are using and trying and are becoming aware of the product the customers are becoming satisfied from the product and they bought it again and again the ratio of the product repetition for the trial procurement risen and also at this level the competitors have started to overflow the market with more appealing and attractive inventions this helps in creating increased competition in the market and also results in decreasing the product price costs reduced due to economies of scale sales volume increases significantly profitability begins to rise public awareness increases competition begins to increase with a few new players in establishing market increased competition leads to price decreases  maturity stage in maturity stage the cost of the product has been decreased because of the increased volume of the product and the product started to experience the curve effects also more and more competitors have seen to be leaving the market in this way very few buyers have been left for the product and this results in less sales of the product the decline of the product and cost of attaining new buyers in this level is more as compare to the resulted profit the brand or the product differentiation via rebating and discounts in price supports in recalling the outlet distribution also there is a decline in the entire cost of marketing through enhancing the distribution and promotional efficiency with switching brand and segmentation costs are decreased as a result of production volumes increasing and experience curve effects sales volume peaks and market saturation is reached increase in competitors entering the market prices tend to drop due to the proliferation of competing products brand differentiation and feature diversification is emphasized to maintain or increase market share industrial profits go down  saturation and decline stage in this stage the profit as well as the sales of the product has started to decline because of the deletion of the product from the market the market for the product in this stage started to show negative rate of growth and corroding cash flows the product at this stage may be kept but there should be less adverts costs become counteroptimal sales volume decline prices profitability diminish profit becomes more a challenge of productiondistribution efficiency than increased sales note product termination is usually not the end of the business cycle only the end of a single entrant within the larger scope of an ongoing business program identifying plc stagesedit identifying the stage of a product is an art more than a science but its possible to find patterns in some of the general product features at each stage identifying product stages when the product is in transition is very difficultcitation needed identifying features stages introduction growth maturity decline sales low high high low investment cost very high high lower than intro stage low low competition low or no competition high very high very high profit low

product life cycle plc the product life cycle plclessonexerciseanswerthe product life cycle plc is based upon the biological life cycle for example a seed is planted introduction it begins to sprout growth it shoots out leaves and puts down roots as it becomes an adult maturity after a long period as an adult the plant begins to shrink and die out declinedecline at this point there is a downturn in the market for example more innovative products are introduced or consumer tastes have changed there is intense pricecutting and many more products are withdrawn from the market profits can be improved by reducing marketing spend and cost cutting problems with product life cyclein reality very few products follow such a prescriptive cycle the length of each stage varies enormously the decisions of marketers can change the stage for example from maturity to decline by pricecutting not all products go through each stage some go from introduction to decline it is not easy to tell which stage the product is in remember that plc is like all other tools use it to inform your gut feelinganother marketing tool for evaluating product is the three levels of a productin theory it’s the same for a product after a period of development it is introduced or launched into the market it gains more and more customers as it grows eventually the market stabilises and the product becomes mature then after a period of time the product is overtaken by development and the introduction of superior competitors it goes into decline and is eventually withdrawnthe product life cycle plc is

few competitors a skimming price strategy is employed limited numbers of product are available in few channels of distributiongrowthcompetitors are attracted into the market with very similar offerings products become more profitable and companies form alliances joint ventures and take each other over advertising spend is high and focuses upon building brand market share tends to stabilisematuritythose products that survive the earlier stages tend to spend longest in this phase sales grow at a decreasing rate and then stabilise producers attempt to differentiate products and brands are key to this price wars and intense competition occur at this point the market reaches saturation producers begin to leave the market due to poor margins promotion becomes more widespread
