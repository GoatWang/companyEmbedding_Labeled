oteacademy  hellas sat  annual financial report   message from the chairman annual report athens may   my fellow shareholders for our company  was a year of great challenges and of great accomplishments economic conditions remained difficult in many regions of the world and were particularly dire in southeast europe where ote conducts all of its business in our home market greece which still accounts for the bulk of our revenues the economy shrank by more than  its fifth straight year of decline the decline in consumer spending was even steeper with unemployment rate currently reaching  of the population and nearly  of all young people while salary cuts and tax increases hit the disposable income of those who still had a job in romania where we derive another significant portion of our sales gdp and consumer spending failed to grow last year and similar trends were observed in our other markets bulgaria and albania while telecommunications services have tended to be somewhat more resilient than overall consumption the industry s revenues in our region suffered from a series of severe rate cuts mandated by the regulatory authorities in all the markets in which ote units are active in greece mobile termination rates were reduced by  over the course of the year taking a significant toll on the industry s combined revenues and profits tariff reductions of comparable magnitudes impacted our international operations against this unfavorable economic and regulatory backdrop ote did a remarkable job on a number of fronts we continued to provide our customers with solutions that are always innovative and reliable and are also competitive in regulated fixed line whenever we have control over their pricing we intensified our costcutting efforts to mitigate the impact of severe revenue drops on our profitability we considerably strengthened our finances and we continued to invest wisely and selectively ensuring that the countries in which we operate benefit from the technological infrastructure they require to rebound and return to growth i would like to expand a little on our achievements in each of these areas building innovative solutions around our customers our aim in the past few years has been to rebuild our customers experience of ote products and services from the ground up to put the customer at the center of all we offer we achieved new major milestones in customercentricity in a complete redesign of all our interactions with the public has been implemented in greek fixed line ranging from new retail shop formats to new statements that emphasize userfriendliness the reorganization of our call centers now accessible through a single number has accelerated response time and fault repairs at the same time we have continued to make headway on the product front in romania as well as in greece richer content notably in sports events has resulted in robust growth in tv subscriber number boosted by the launch of our successful greek satellite tv offering authorized by the greek regulator for the first time to narrow the pricing gap for doubleplay packages against our competition we regained momentum in adsl and were able once again to contribute to the overall growth of the greek broadband market a positive trend that we hope to continue fostering with the rollout of our highspeed vdsl offer launched towards the end of the year in mobile our leadership in cellular data strengthens our market positions in all our countries notably in the postpaid segments of the markets we believe that our technological edge is and will remain instrumental in this highly competitive business all in all we are satisfied that our customers in all our markets appreciate the difference ote makes to their lives and that this advantage will increasingly fuel our resilience and eventually our growth in the coming years adapting our cost base our customercentric initiatives are key in mitigating the influence of economic and regulatory factors on our top line but they cannot reverse the erosion of our revenues and we need to work as intensively on the adaptation of our cost structure to this changing environment throughout the year we pursued with determination the streamlining of our organization and the rationalization of our cost base as i have noted in the past the considerable efforts we are making to rein in operating expenses can only have a meaningful impact if we are able to reduce our largest source of costs payroll and benefits in  in record time we were able to launch and complete a major voluntary exit scheme in the greek fixed line initially intending to attract  employees it was eventually adopted by more than  of our people who left before the end of the year this translates into a net saving of approximately mn on an annualized basis and i want to emphasize that the cost of this programme was borne exclusively by ote with no participation from the greek state and no demand on its pension funds all told we estimate that we have taken about mn of annual costs out of the group over the past two years we are proud of these achievements which have enabled us to add a full percentage point to our ebitda margin in the full year  strengthening our financial structure another key priority for the year was to get our financial structure in order and put ourselves in a position to meet our debt obligations of the coming year while continue to fund our investments for the future during the year and in early  we completed the sale of our stakes in telecom serbia and hellassat respectively generating proceeds of over mn in the second half of  we have completely reshaped our debt profile through a series of loan extensions borrowings at subsidiary level bond repurchases and exchanges this indepth restructuring of our debt enabled us in early february  to raise a mn issue of fixed rate notes in the international markets the issue was considerably oversubscribed an important sign of investor confidence in the work we have done to consolidate ote s finances in the difficult past years thanks to our continued strong cash generation we ended the year with net debt of less than bn a drop of nearly bn from the end of our cash position at year end was close to bn enabling us to face with confidence our investing and refinancing needs of the coming year investing for the future ours and that of the nations we serve throughout the year we have pursued a selective but comprehensive programme of investments in updating our infrastructure and ensuring that the customers we serve have access to bestinclass technologies slightly more than onetenth of our  revenues were reinvested in capital expenditures and this does not include the significant investments we had to make to renew and expand our mobile spectrum licenses in certain countries in these tough markets the continued implementation of this strategy and our management discipline enabled us to deliver a strong financial performance during the year total revenues dropped by slightly over  to bn despite the severity of termination rate cuts and macroeconomics in the countries where we operate our stringent costreduction programmes resulted in a full one percent increase in our pro forma ebitda margin to  our net income was quadrupled and we continued to generate considerable cash flow roughly unchanged during the year at over bn despite lower sales special reference is due to the strong results of our international subsidiaries which have delivered above expectations adding value to the group despite the highly volatile environment they face in romania romtelecom achieved consistent operating and financial performance successfully implemented costreduction initiatives that resulted in an ebitda increase and significantly boosted the number of its broadband and tv customers cosmote romania continued to enhance its operating efficiency achieving a solid ebitda margin while increasing the number of business customers capitalizing on targeted offers and synergies with romtelecom in the bb segment in the extremely competitive and overcrowded albanian market amc managed to increase its customer base and posted a  growth of mobile data revenues for the year last but not least i have to point out globul s solid performance under the tough bulgarian market conditions a performance which has attracted the attention of international investors in april  the group announced the signing of an agreement to sell globul and germanos telecom bulgaria ad to the norwegian operator telenor mobile communications as for an enterprise value of mn in  we do not expect to see material improvement in our operating conditions or the trends that have affected greece for the past years we estimate that the industryspecific obstacles and regulatory pressures will continue our revenues and profits will once again record the hits of mandatory tariff reductions implemented in the past year as well as of potential new rounds intense competitive pressure is certain to eat into our revenue base in fixed and mobile facing these factors we are confident that the continued implementation of our strategy the operating momentum we have built and are continuing to foster the dedication of all of our people and our unflinching financial discipline will enable us once again to achieve a solid performance michael tsamaz chairman and ceo of ote sa view more similar documents x net debt ebitda  strong investments
