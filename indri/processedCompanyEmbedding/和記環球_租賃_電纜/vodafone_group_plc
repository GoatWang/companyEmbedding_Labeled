success strategy the transformation to one platform   since  the evo program has encouraged vodafone to pursue best practices in every aspect of what it does using sap erp and associated applications as the single integrated platform for their business vodafone has been able to pinpoint where they spend money share data across the organization and implement mobile solutions to improve productivity planning ahead…   to stay at the top you must always think two steps ahead the challenge achieving internal and external excellence the focus on best practices prompts vodafone to continually seek areas for improvement including coping with the complexity of the data in the market monthend closing is a critical process that also happens to be highly visible the availability of financial information is critical to managers who need it to respond to changing business conditions timely information supports timely decision making so vodafone set the goal of reducing their monthend closing process   another goal of vodafone group is to maximize savings while minimizing risk this requires visibility into spending that helps proactively identify savings opportunities and control supplier risk another goal of vodafone group is to maximize savings while minimizing risk this requires visibility into spending that helps proactively identify savings opportunities and control supplier risk another goal of vodafone group is to maximize savings while minimizing risk this requires visibility into spending that helps proactively identify savings opportunities and control supplier risk   customer churn is another key issue vodafone sought to address since there is no single characteristic that can identify a customer who is likely to change mobile providers vodafone netherlands wanted to figure out a way to make the most of their scarce analytics resources and apply findings to minimize customer turnover automation with full control and accuracy   the biggest benefit…   the complexity of the data in the market enter sap trusted partner and preferred supplier the largest it transformation in vodafone’s history began in  when accenture and sap collaborated to deliver a single platform for finance hr and supply chain across  operating companies over the years this has meant addressing considerable challenges of scale and complexity as vodafone’s global delivery partner accenture has worked side by side with vodafone to design and deliver the overall solution in all locations several years ago vodafone embarked on a journey of three key global implementations erp  to standardize and globalize core processes business intelligence ° understanding of procurement expenditures negotiate better prices and service with suppliers mobility to empower employees with access to core systems via mobile devices   accenture has focused on maximizing the reuse of assets making best use of and optimizing vodafone’s mix of offshore and specialist resources and deploying a comprehensive suite of tools to achieve high levels of automation by adopting an industrialized approach accenture was able to drive major cost savings and realize the value that vodafone had set for the program handling the heavy lifting behind the scenes   constant support throughout the full implementation process enter sap the sap experience technology and experience to accelerate business sap accenture and vodafone have worked closely to deliver meaningful results as part of the evo program the sap hana implementation was completed within one monthend closing period sap spend performance management software has delivered comprehensive reporting and process functionality to power smarter purchasing decisions throughout vodafone group    vodafone engaged sap maxattention™ services to analyze the underlying technical platform identify ways to improve stability and performance and improve the system with the recommendation s made by sap maxattention vodafone then implemented all critical improvements resulting in a highly stable efficient overall system using this tool like a black box…   innovation control center better business closing books and opening opportunities monthend closing has been improved at vodafone through a combination of system and process improvements after implementing sap hana vodafone cut an entire day out of their closing process   vodafone had been using sap business warehouse in the data flow but using the reporting application for operations was a timeconsuming process of iterative extracttransformload etl database cycles now that they run live with sap hana vodafone can analyze large amounts of data in local memory eliminating the need for multiple etls vodafone is able to integrate spending data with other key information and keep it within a secure loop of sourcing and spend management that helps identify risks such as singlesupplier dependencies while helping control spending through accurate information and performance targets analyzing exactly how money is getting spent   for instance the telecommunications company is profiling winter sports enthusiasts to identify who may be interested in a mobile roaming product that makes it easy for them to use their phones in the mountains speed ease of use and scalability to add more and more data   full data set of their customers leads to increased profitability better business benefits higher speed lower cost satisfied workers happier customers   to run live like this means a  reduction in process times and vodafone can save approximately € in labor costs over the next four years sap spend performance management is helping vodafone optimize their spending strategies with features including whatif simulations which can help the company set and manage higher goals for spend under management closing the knowledge gap   with sap hana margin assurance vodafone now has a granular view of customer profitability with less personnel dedicated to the task showing exactly how much spend to allocate for each special offer and discount enabling vodafone to identify tens of millions of previously unidentified revenue leakage in the moment data the ability to understand granular customer profitability specifically which customers are profitable or unprofitable and why is a gamechanger for our industry — thomas holtmanns vodafone director finance operations central europe and global process owner margin assurance better business run simple time on their hands is money in the bank now in production the new monthend close process is giving vodafone greater flexibility than ever data extract transform and load cycles are  times faster ending the dreaded hour days that workers faced during the old process employees are now free to contribute at higher levels resulting in higher job satisfaction and greater business innovation data analysts and business decision makers are also more productive because they have the information they need much sooner modeling that would have taken weeks to produce by a team of statisticians can now be completed in only two days by one or two experienced analysts at vodafone netherlands the analysis can also be presented in formats that can direct the actions of marketers such as when to contact customers with a certain message and when not to overcontact customers   as a result vodafone was the winner for digital trailblazer for the sap hana innovation award in  by harnessing the power of big data and the internet of things to run live for breakthrough results more and more quantity created a step change in quality journey ahead promoting the internal success story vodafone is now refining its monthend closing process for example they have introduced a set of preliminary reports using the sap hana data these reports can provide advance notice of approximate results allowing stakeholders to prepare accordingly for final results   in addition vodafone has several potential plans for broadening the applicability of sap hana to their business needs in business functions outside finance meanwhile sap spend performance management continues to help vodafone

affected market telecommunications no me parties vodafone group plc vodafone is a mobile network operator mno in the uk it operates at both the network wholesale and service provider retail level of the mobile communications sector project telecom plc project telecom is an independent service provider isp of mobile telecommunication services in the uk project telecoms turnover for the year ended  december  was £ million transaction vodafone is seeking to acquire the entire share capital of project telecom for £ million jurisdiction as a result of this transaction vodafone and project telecom will cease to be distinct the uk turnover of project telecom exceeds £ million so that the turnover test in section b of the enterprise act  the act is satisfied a relevant merger situation will be created relevant market the parties overlap in the provision of mobile communication services at retail level to personal and corporate users vodafone as an mno also supplies mobile communication services at the wholesale level to isps such as project telecom product market on the demandside due to the way in which airtime is sold it is likely that the supply of mobile telecommunications services to retail and wholesale customers should be considered separately retail customers personal and corporate users would not in the event of a price increase by all retail suppliers including tied service providers tsps be able to buy directly from an mno project telecom buys wholesale airtime for resale to mainly corporate but also personal customers vodafone through its tsps provides mobile telecommunication services to both corporate and personal customers of vodafones  million network customers  million –  million see note  are serviced through isps like project telecom the specific characteristics of mobile telephony mean that customers do not consider land line telephony to be a viable substitute on the supplyside it appears likely that suppliers of mobile telecommunication services to personal customers could quickly and easily switch to provide services to business customers they would have to bid for contracts that are put out to tender by corporate customers and may have to develop additional services such as conference calling the parties submit that the range of services offered to corporate and personal customers is similar geographic market oftel maintains that the geographic scope of the market for wholesale mobile telecommunication services is the uk because of a uniform pricing policy and a lack of demand and supply side substitutability from markets outside the uk it is likely that for similar reasons at the retail level the geographic scope is also national for the purposes of analysing the competitive constraints on the parties pre and postmerger the appropriate frame of reference will be taken to be the supply of mobile telecommunication services at the retail level in the uk horizontal issues postmerger at the retail level vodafone would have a  per cent see note  market share increment  per cent see note  by subscriber numbers or  per cent see note  increment of  per cent by retail revenues if vodafones acquisition of singlepoint is completed this would increase vodafones share of supply by a further  per cent see note  by subscriber numbers postmerger the parties will face competition from other mnos as well as a larger number of isps barriers to entry third parties had mixed views about the costs of entry at retail level recently there has been a number of firms entering and exiting the market bt and tesco have recently entered into partnership agreements with tmobile and o respectively to provide mobile services to personal consumers as a result of this new entry and continued growth of existing isps oftel believes that the removal of the requirement on vodafone and o to sell on a nondiscriminatory basis to isps has not created a barrier to entry otfel has found that while personal customers face some barriers to switching related to number portability and handset unlocking they have been reduced over time vodafones customer churn is around  per cent per annum buyer power personal customers are unlikely to have any negotiating strength one third party thought that corporate customers may have some buyer power as they purchase services through a competitive tendering process and have a number of providers from which to choose vertical issues vodafone is active as an mno at the wholesale level and as a tsp at the retail level its share of supply at the wholesale level was  per cent by volume of call minutes and  per cent by value for the period april   march  oftel considers that no mno or group of mno has significant market power it is therefore highly unlikely that it can leverage its position in the supply of wholesale airtime to influence the supply of airtime to retail customers isps can switch between mnos although orange does not currently supply any isps moreover the transaction results in such a small increment to vodafones share of supply at the retail level even if vodafone did possess some market power at the wholesale level the transaction is unlikely to increase the possibility of foreclosure at the retail level third party views a number of isps are concerned about the transaction but these related more to wider sectoral issues in particular the removal of the requirement on vodafone and o to sell on a nondiscriminatory basis to isps mnos and customers are generally not concerned oftel is unconcerned about the merger because the increment to market share is small and it does not view the decline in the number of isps as a concern as there is strong retail competition between the tsps assessment the appropriate frame of reference is taken to be the supply of mobile telecommunications services at the retail level in the uk postmerger the parties will have a combined market share of  per cent see note  increment  per cent see note  based on subscriber numbers or  per cent see note  increment  per cent based on retail revenues the merged entity will continue face competition from around  other isps and the other mnos entry barriers do not appear to be insurmountable as there have been a number of recent new entrants given that oftel has concluded that vodafone either singly or as part of a group does not have significant market power and the increment to its share of supply of retail services is small the transaction does not appear to raise any vertical competition concerns decision this merger will therefore not be referred to the competition commission under section  of the act notes figures replaced by a range at the request of vodafone document information published

interest in mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of orange the uk mobile operator chris gent would later say mannesmanns move into the uk broke a gentlemans agreement not to compete in

turnover includes £ million from discontinued operations criticismsedit uk uncut protestors outside a vodafone shop in liverpool tax avoidanceedit in september  an investigation by private eye magazine revealed certain details of vodafones tax avoidance activities it was reported that vodafone routed the acquisition of mannesmann through a luxembourg subsidiary set up to avoid paying tax on the deal and continued to place its profits in luxembourg following a long legal struggle with hmrc during which a senior hmrc official john connors switched sides to become head of tax at vodafone it was eventually agreed that vodafone would pay £ billion related to the acquisition based on vodafones accounts experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £ billion the news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests beginning in october  and ongoing as of april  outside vodafone shops across the uk organised under the banner of uk uncut the first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores including the flagship oxford street branch in  private eye magazine and the bureau of investigative journalism alleged that vodafones swiss branches were run by a single parttime bookkeeper the report claimed hardly any business was done from there indicating that the main purpose of the zug office was tax avoidance the report claimed the money was borrowed from the swiss branch of the luxembourg company allowing it to take advantage of luxembourgs laws which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax and swiss laws which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies according to the expose this would have otherwise generated a british tax bill on a little over £ billion it said vodafone publishes a single combined set of accounts for its luxembourg subsidiaries and their swiss branches for the one company profits worth £ billion were taxed at less than  in  and the profits are likely to have been attributed to switzerland in its response to these allegations vodafone has said the swiss branch has not been involved in vodafones global financing for a number of years it is therefore irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements vodafone was also assessed a us billion tax over its acquisition of hutchison whampoas indian assets in  a demand that it contests in january
