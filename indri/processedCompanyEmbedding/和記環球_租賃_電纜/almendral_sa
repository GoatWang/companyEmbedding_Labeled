the etiology of endometriosis is complex and remains largely unknown the progression of endometriosis is estrogendependent however estrogen rarely exerts direct growth effect but often mediates through peptide growth factors fibroblast growth factor fgf is reported as an estromedin in normal endometrium and acts as a mitogen for uterine endometrial stromal cells it indicates fgf is one of the potential candidates involving in the etiology of endometriosis nevertheless cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of fgf expression are mostly unknown previous study shows that concentration of prostaglandin pg e in peritoneal cavity is elevated due to aberrant expression of cyclooxygenase cox in endometriotic tissue and peritoneal macrophage since pge is a potent inducer for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein star and aromatase two genes that control estrogen biosynthesis it is reasonable to hypothesize that pge might act through estrogen to regulate fgf therefore this study aims to examine action of pge on fgf gene expression two hypotheses will be tested first fgf is autonomously expressed by ectopic endometriotic stromal cell due to aberrant expression of estrogen second pge may stimulate fgf gene expression possibly through increasing estrogen production in ectopic endometriotic stromal cells results reveal that fgf and its high affinity receptors fgf receptor iiic fgfriiic and fgf receptor iiic fgfriiic are effectively expressed by ectopic endometriotic tissues in addition expression of fgf in ectopic endometriotic stromal cell is inhibited by treatment with ici  an estrogen receptor antagonist and hydroxyandrostenedione an aromatase inhibitor indicating it is likely regulated by estrogen in an autocrine manner concordantly with these results proliferation of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells is inhibited by treatment with ici and is reversed by exogenous addition of recombinant fgf moreover pge can induce ectopic endometriotic stromal cells proliferation in a fgfdependent manner further study reveals that pgeinduced fgf expression is independent of estrogen i find that pge induces fgf expression through the ep receptor activated protein kinase c pkc signaling pathway activation of pkc leads to phosphorylation of erk and the transcription factor elk thereby promoting transcription of fgf two elk cisbinding sites locating at  and  of human fgf promoter are identified to be crucial for mediating pge actions these data demonstrate for the first time that pge can directly induce fgf expression via a novel signaling pathway involving ep pkc and a member of ets domaincontaining transcription factor superfamily taken together results from my current study demonstrate that pge can induce fgf expression thus endometriotic stromal cell proliferation through direct and indirect pathways the direct pathway is carried out via ep signaling while indirect one is mediated via induction of estrogen biosynthesis pge may cause overexpression of star and aromatase result in aberrant production of estrogen it serves as primary source for induction of fgf and its high affinity receptors via an autocrine mechanism when systemic estrogen is low estrogeninduced expression of fgf may increase the chance for ectopic endometriotic lesions to survive and growth involving longterm maintenance of endometriosis in a sense my findings provide a new thinking direction of reevaluating effects of pge estrogen and peptide growth factors on the etiology of endometriosis and a molecular framework for

focuses on the noise problem associated with a vehicle’s exhaust pipe a pulsated flow with weak pulsating blast waves from a vehicle engine is discharged out of the vehicle’s exhaust pipe the discharged pulsated flow and the induced shockvortex interactions that result in radiated noise are numerically investigated by the axisymmetric eulernavierstokes solver with the parallel computational technology the numerical method used is a fifthorder weighted essentially nonoscillation scheme of jiang and shu for spatial discretization and a fourthorder nontvd rungekutta method for time integration in order to effectively reduce the radiated noise due to shockvortex interactions near the pipe exit the pipe shape near the exit is redesigned by using a smoothed curved expanding shape near the pipe exit instead of the traditional straight shape the detailed flow field downstream of the pipe and its sound pressure level are studied when the flow field has become a quasisteady state the major propagation direction of sound wave for the straightpipe case is found in the ° direction which is different from the ° direction for the curvedpipe case moreover noise produced by the straight and curvedshape pipe with periodic pulsating blast waves are analyzed and compared the periodic pulsating wave is obtained by fitting the measured pressure data from a motorcycle exhaust pipe at an engine speed of rpm at an idle condition it is found that the periodic pulsating waves can greatly influence the downstream flow and sound fields such as the vortex–ring size vortexcenter vorticity and sound pressure level spl in consideration of the frequency response of the human ear the ascale spl method is applied to analyze sound pressure level experimental and simulated sound pressure levels are computed and compared the results of sound pressure levels for experiment and simulation show that their absolute error in the maximum aweighting spl is dba for the curvedpipe case and dba for the straightpipe case moreover their absolute error in the minimum aweighting spl is dba for the curvedpipe case and dba for the straightpipe case it is proved that the partially curved

in the steelmaking process for effective use of this bfg it is significant to develop the technology of firing bfg individually without the support fuel such as natural gas ng and heavy oil however as compared with the fuel of bfg in combination with coke oven gas cog or ng bfg is low in calorie because of high rate of inert gas such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide owing to this special fuel condition many technical problems such as slow burning velocity and flame stability remain to be solved in using bfg individually as the fuel for hot gas stoves and boilers the combustion characteristics of firing bfg individually or in combination with cog or ng including fuel gas volume flow rate air volume flow rate adiabatic flame temperature flue gas composition and thermal efficiency were analyzed results show that under the operating conditions of stoichiometry and without preheat at the same heat release rate the fuel gas volume flow rate of firing bfg individually is greater than that of firing bfg with support fuel the smaller air volume flow rate the lower adiabatic flame temperature and the lower thermal efficiency of the former are found for the former as compared with the latter however the volume flow rate of flue gas for the former is greater than the latter because it contains a large amount of inert gases in the flue gas additionally the combustion characteristics of firing bfg individually or in combination with cog or ng were also discussed under the operating conditions of adding ten percent excess air andor mw preheat moreover the synthesis of carbon nanotubes cnts on a catalytic nickel substrate in counterflow diffusion flames was investigated experimentally the effects of sampling positions gas temperature distributions and the concentration of nickel nitrate on the synthesis of cnts were examined curved and entangled tubular multiwalled cnts are harvested which have both typical straight tubular and bamboolike structures besides curved cnts helically coiled tubular cnts are also synthesized because of the flame surface with high temperature the metal catalyst can easily react with the unsaturated free radical in the flame zone to form the carbonmetal alloy whereas the metal catalyst can lose its activity and obtain the soot in the position away from the flame surface in which the gas temperature is low in the same radial position the variation of the yield of cnts is from no cnts to agglomeration and then no cnts this is because the sample position moves along a vertical line from the flame surface to the upper burner corresponding to the concentration of unsaturated free radical from rare to dense and then rare using a ninocoated substrate has advantages over uncoated ni substrates which can increase the length and the quantity of cnts   i  iv  v  xiv 、                                   、                 、                    、  、  、  、

been maturely applied in construction art cosmetology and ic manufacture during the past few years ancient monuments in taiwan have been reserved and restored intenselyhowever the restoration of surface and component always costs a great deal and takes a lot of time in projects of the former tainan city government and taipei guest house sand blast has been tried to remove the paint of the wall but the paint of the timber part was still removed by traditional methods such as“paint stripping medicinal preparation”“shaved off”“heating”thus i wonder if we can apply sand blast on timber paint removal to improve the power and efficiency first of all i collected and coordinated related documents secondly i interviewed specialists then i experimented according to specialists’ opinions the object of study was surface of local juniper components the method was focused on wet sand blast the variables were blast frequency blast pressure and blast degree while blast distance and blast displacement speed were set as constants for checking i expected to get the ideal data suitable for timber paint removal and improve traditional timeconsuming methods the blast frequency was set from  to  times the blast pressure was set as kgfcm  kgfcm and  kgfcm respectively the blast degree o  o  o  o respectively the distance was fixed in cm while displacement speed in cmsec according to above planning i completed  tests the outcome is described as below  blast pressure：kgfcm was the best one the result of kgfcm was not good and kgfcm brought about serious erosion  blast degree： o was the best one the results in order were  o  o  o o  blast frequency：  and  times made the perfect while  time was not good enough and  times caused serious erosion  blast distance and displacement speed flexible according to actual need the removed thickness by sand blast in this study was thinner than which by other traditional methods this fact implies that sand blast causes slighter damage on timber than traditional methods do thus sand blast is feasible on timber paint removal besides it can be applied on both separable and inseparable components reducing the difficulties of original highplace operation sand blast method can also remove paint step by step with adjusting above variables to keep to the original and minimize the pollution        ……………………………………  ………………………………

previous studies demonstrated that fgf was a steroidregulated mitogen and survival factor for nerve cells prostatic cells and lung mesenchymal cells besides fgf could modulate gonadotropin stimulated steroid secretion in gonadal steroidogenic cells during embryogenesis fgfknockout mice exhibited maletofemale sex reversal and seminiferous tubles hypoplasia in testis these results indicated the critical role of fgf on steroidogenesis our previous results demonstrated that fgf increased the star expression and testosterone production by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor iiic fgfriiic and activating through rasmapk pik and pka signaling pathways in immature mouse leydig cells however the molecular mechanism on transcriptional level of star gene expression in fgfstimulated testosterone production remains unclear thus the aim of this study is to investigate the steroidogenic effects by fgf whether go through activating campdependent transcription factors to regulate the specific element of star promoter in the present study ma mouse leydig tumor cell line was used to investigate the molecular mechanism results show that progesterone production was increased by fgf in addition four type fgf receptors iiib iiic iiib and iiic were expressed in ma mouse leydig tumor cells using immunoblotting assays fgf could also increase star protein expression furthermore ma mouse leydig tumor cells were transiently transfected with plasmid containing luciferase gene with ’flanking kb star    promoter segments which illustrated that fgf did not regulate star promoter activity however fgf might activate phosphorylation of erk  map kinases pathway taken together these data indicated that fgf might go through mekerk signaling pathway to increase progesterone production rather than activate star promoter activity in ma cells   i iii v vi ix x   a b radioimmunoassay ria c dsdspage  western blotting e total rna  f reverse transcriptionpolymerse chain reaction rtpcr gdna

state of alkali activator to initiate a reaction and produce a material with cementitious property due to the differences between the raw material and the manufacture process the hardened mechanism and hydrates differ from those of portland cement entirely in recent years this kind of material is considered to be fabulous performance for instance high compressive strength corrosion resistance permeation resistance durability etc are much better than portland cement in this study the industrial waste such as granulated blast furnace slag and fly ash were investigated as basic ingredient of alkaliactivated cementitious materials according to different mixture of materials we fix the water and solid ratio to discuss the experiment results and make the analysis from material mechanics properties compressive strength test to internal microstructure completely scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the end products of alkaliactivated cementitious materials geopolymer gel

simple and easy technique to quantitatively measure the adhesion force between cells and substrate to utilize cytodetachment technique to make comparison that cells adhesion strength we select the calcium phosphorus bioceramics and commercially titanium as substrate to make comparison the aim of this study was to develop a dynamic technique to quantitatively measure the adhesive force between cells and substrata the study is divided into four parts partι to determine the influence of discharge rf power level on the properties of the deposited cap films on titanium substrates the structure and chemical composition were investigated with alphastep thickness scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and xray diffraction xrd the results showed that assputtered cap coatings were amorphous and °c heattreated cap coatings were crystalline part ⅱ titanium alloy disks are prepared by wet grinding by grit silicon carbide paper  and wet grinding to  then polishing by alo powder to the surface roughness with ra values of  and  micrometer respectively part ⅲ the measurement of cell adhesion force on bioceramics will be compared with dynamic applied forced and cytodetachment technique the results showed that cell adhesion force on polish caph more strength than polish cap and polish cap that the same the cytodetachment however the cell adhesion force on  more strength than  caph and  cap that different to cytodetachment part ⅳ to evaluate the cells morphology in different conditions cells displayed well spreading on caph coating than noncoated titanium and cap the cell attachment area and cell adhesion force is being connected on polish group however rougher  group not consistent tendency therefore the dynamic technique utilize to smooth

acquisition of an angiogenic phenotype angiogenic switch is essential for cervical carcinogenesis the angiogenic switch is balanced by the angiogenic activators and inhibitors thrombospondin tsp is an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor with multiple functional domains and interacting receptors our study was firstly aimed to examine the spatial and temporal relationship of tsp expression in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix and its precursor lesions and to correlate its expression with tumor angiogenesis our results indicate the disruption of tsp fence the expression of tsp in basal epithelia and the switch to angiogenic phenotype occurred concordantly during the transition from low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion lsil into high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion hsil this concordance suggests that tsp play a role in the regulation of angiogenic switch during cervical carcinogenesis we conclude that the onset of angiogenesis is an early event in cervical carcinogenesis due in part to the downregulation of tsp by the dysplastic epithelium stroma reaction also called stromagenesis is a host reaction of stroma cells that when induced in cancer produces a progressive and permissive mesenchymal microenvironment thereby supporting tumor progress in addition to the wellknown angiogenesis inhibitor tsp has been shown to exert different biological functions on various stromal cell types eg fibroblasts therefore we hypothesized that tsp may play a role in stroma reaction characterized by fibroblast activation we firstly tried to elucidate the correlation between the tsp expression and the overexpression of stroma markers in human cervical lesions secondly we tried to elucidate whether tsp can exhibit its antitumor effects through the angioinhibitory effects and the ability to inhibit tumor stroma reaction in scid mice xenotransplant model thirdly we tried to elucidate whether tsp can change the stroma reaction by inhibiting the migration and invasive ability of myofibroblast activated fibroblasts from invading tumor cell cluster our results revealed first immunohistochemistry staining of human clinical specimens showed the disappearance of tsp coincided with the emergence of the overexpression of two stromal markers αsma and desmin in a stepwise pattern second transfection of siha cervical cancer cells with a plasmid expressing the tsp protein exhibited antiangiogenic activity in vitro and resulted in reduced tumor growth in scid mice which was accompanied by a decrease in tumor vascularization and lower expressions of αsma and desmin than those in the vector controls third transfection with tsp and purified tsp added to niht cells did not alter the protein levels of αsma and desmin which was increased by transforming growth factor β tgfβ a potent fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation factor but significantly inhibited matrix metalloprotease mmp activity the increased migration ability and the invasive ability into tumor cluster of tgfβtreatedniht cells were dosedependently inhibited by tsp in contrast ectopic tsp expression in siha cells has little effect on the invasive ability of the niht cells together these data demonstrate that tsp possesses a novel role to reduce the expression of stromal markers in both human clinical specimens and an in vivo tumor model the inhibitory ability of tsp to reverse stroma reaction could be partly attributed to the blockage of myofibroblasts from invading cancer by targeting the tumorstroma

safety of humans and electrical equipment an ideal grounding system should provide nearzero ground resistance in practice however ground resistance is not near zero ground potential should rise when the fault current flows into the ground system the grounding system thus should ensure that ground potential rise that occurs due to fault current will not cause electric shock or equipment damage therefore the lower ground resistance demands the better nevertheless in some areas with high soil resistivity such as in gravel sandy soil or rocky regions it may not be possible to obtain low ground resistance so the addition of a ground resistance reduction agent may be one of most suitable measures first this dissertation proposes using granulated blast furnace slag and basic oxygen furnace slag as the main materials in a ground resistance reduction agent adding different proportions of water cement and salt resistivity and clot strength of ground resistance reduction agent are considered in the quest to find an effective combination the effectiveness of the identified combination in reducing ground resistance is experimentally verified then this research discusses quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used for ground rod and derives optimum quantity of ground resistance reduction agent needed to reduce ground resistance by the same amount ground resistance decreases with increasing quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used however ground resistance reduction effect will display the saturation phenomenon when the quantity of ground resistance reduction agent used increases to a certain level additional quantities of ground resistance reduction agent should be avoided in saturated areas in order to maximize its efficient use finally this dissertation proposes a method for calculating the position and magnitude of maximum step voltage for buried ground rod with insulation lead simulation results show that ground resistance earth surface voltage and step voltage decrease as depth of buried ground rod increases ground resistance earth surface voltage and step voltage in driven ground method exceed those of buried ground rod with the insulation lead therefore this dissertation suggests that grounding should be achieved by the use of buried ground rods with insulation lead results of this research not only provide a valuable method for decreasing ground resistance but also increase the safety of grounding  contents i list of tables v list of figures vii list of symbols xi chapter  introduction   motivation

 ce as urbs parva sed loco munita a small city but fortified by location roman general marcus fulvius nobilior fought a battle near the city in  bce against a confederation of celtic tribes including the vaccaei vettones and celtiberi defeating them and capturing a king called hilermus at that time toletum was a city of the carpetani tribe and part of the region of carpetania it was incorporated into the roman empire as a civitas stipendiaria that is a tributary city of noncitizens it later achieved the status of municipium by flavian times with this status city officials even of carpetani origin obtained roman citizenship for public service and the forms of roman law and politics were increasingly adopted at approximately this time were constructed in toletum a roman circus city walls public baths and a municipal water supply and storage system the roman circus in toledo was one of the largest in hispania at  metres  feet long and  metres  feet wide with a track dimension of  metres  feet long and  metres  feet wide chariot races were held on special holidays and were also commissioned by private citizens to celebrate career achievements a fragmentary stone inscription records circus games paid for by a citizen of unknown name to celebrate his achieving the sevirate a kind of priesthood conferring high status archaeologists have also identified portions of a special seat of the sort used by the city elites to attend circus games called a sella curulis the circus could hold up to  spectators during roman times toledo was never a provincial capital nor a conventus iuridicus it started to gain importance in late antiquity there are indications that large private houses domus within the city walls were enlarged while several large villas were built north of the city through the third and fourth centuries games were held in the circus into the late fourth and early fifth centuries ce also an indication of active city life and ongoing patronage by wealthy elites a church council was held in toledo in the year  to discuss the conflict with priscillianism a second council of toledo was held in  the visigothic king theudis was in toledo in  where he promulgated a law this is strong though not certain evidence that toledo was the chief residence for theudis king athanagild died in toledo probably in  although theudis and athangild based themselves in toledo toledo was not yet the capital city of the iberian peninsula as theudis and athangilds power was limited in extent the suevi ruling galicia and local elites dominating lusitania betica and cantabria this changed with liuvigild leovigild who brought the peninsula under his control the visigoths ruled from toledo until the moors conquered the iberian peninsula in the early years of th century – today the historic center contains basements passages wells baths and ancient water pipes that since roman times have been used in the city visigothic toledoedit the city of toledo as depicted in the codex vigilanus in  a series of church councils was held in toledo under the visigoths a synod of arian bishops was held in  to discuss theological reconciliation with nicene christianity liuvigilds successor reccared hosted the third council of toledo at which the visigothic kings abandoned arianism and reconciled with the existing hispanoroman episcopate a synod held in  transferred the metropolitanate of the old province of carthaginensis from cartagena to toledo at that time cartagena was ruled by the byzantines and this move ensured a closer relation between the bishops of spain and the visigothic kings king sisebut forced jews in the visigothic kingdom to convert to christianity this act was criticized and efforts were made to reverse it at the fourth council of toledo in  the fifth and sixth councils of toledo placed church sanctions on anyone who would challenge the visigothic kings the seventh council of toledo instituted a requirement that all bishops in the area of a royal city that is of toledo must reside for one month per year in toledo this was a stage in the elevation of toledo as the primatial see of the whole church of the visgothic kingdom in addition the seventh council declared that any clergy fleeing the kingdom assisting conspirators against the king or aiding conspirators would be excommunicated and no one should remove this sentence the ban on lifing these sentences of excommunication was lifted at the eighth council of toledo in  at which for the first time decisions were signed by palace officials as well as bishops the eighth council of toledo took measures that enhanced toledos significance as the center of royal power in the iberian peninsula the council declared that the election of a new king following the death of the old one should only take place in the royal city or wherever the old king died in practice this handed the power to choose kings to only such palace officials and military commanders who were in regular attendance on the king the decision also took kingmaking power away from the bishops who would be in their own sees and would not have time to come together to attend the royal election the decision did allow the bishop of toledo alone among bishops to be involved in decisions concerning the royal visigothic succession the ninth and tenth councils were held in rapid succession in  and  when reccesuinth died in  at his villa in gerticos his successor wamba was elected on the spot then went to toledo to be anointed king by the bishop of toledo according to the procedures laid out in prior church councils in  wamba defeated a rebel duke named paul and held his victory parade in toledo the parade included ritual humiliation and scalping of the defeated paul wamba carried out renovation works in toledo in  marking these with inscriptions above the city gates that are no longer extant but were recorded in the eighth century the eleventh council of toledo was held in  under king wamba wamba weakened the power of the bishop of toledo by creating a new bishopric outside toledo at the church of saints peter and paul this was one of the main churches of toledo and was the church where wamba was anointed king and the church from which visigothic kings departed for war after special ceremonies in which they were presented with a relic of the true cross by creating a new bishopric there wamba removed power over royal succession from the bishop of toledo and granted it to the new bishop the twelfth council of toledo was held in  after wambas removal from office convinced that he was dying wamba had accepted a state of penitence that according to the decision of a previous church council made him inelegible to remain king the twelfth council led by newly installed bishop julian confirmed the validity of wambas removal from office and his succession by ervig the twelfth council eliminated the new bishopric that wamba had created and returned the powers over succession to the bishop of toledo the twelfth council of toledo approved  laws against the jews julian of toledo despite a jewish origin was strongly antisemitic as reflected in his writings and activities the leading jews of toledo were assembled in the church of saint mary on january   where the new laws were read out to them the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth councils of toledo were held in   and  the thirteenth council restored property and legal rights to those who had rebelled against king wamba in  the thirteenth council also approved laws protecting the kings family after the kings death in  ervig took the penitent state before dying and the kingship passed to egica who was anointed king in toledo on november  in  the fifteenth council lifted the ban on taking property from the families of former kings whereupon egica was able to plunder ervigs family properties in the late seventh century toledo became a main center of literacy and writing in the iberian peninsula toledos development as a center of learning was influenced by isidore of seville an author and advocate of literacy who attended several church councils in toledo king chindasuinth had a royal library in toledo and at least one count called laurentius had a private library sometime before  chindasuinth sent the bishop of zaragoza taio to rome to obtain books that were not available in toledo taio obtained at least parts of pope gregorys moralia the library also contained a copy of a hexameron by dracontius which chindasuinth liked so much that he commissioned eugenius ii to revise it by adding a new part dealing with the seventh day of creation chindasuinth issued laws that were gathered together in a book called liber iudiciorum by his successor reccesuinth in  this book was revised twice widely copied and was an important influence on medieval spanish law three bishops of toledo wrote works that were widely copied and disseminated in western europe and parts of which survive to this day eugenius ii ildefonsus and julian in intellectual terms the leading spanish churchmen of the seventh century had no equals before the appearance of bede in  the sixteenth council of toledo condemned sisebert julians successor as bishop of toledo for having rebelled against king egica in alliance with liuvigoto the widow of king ervig a rebel king called suniefred seized power in toledo briefly at about this time whether or not siseberts and suniefreds rebellions were the same or separate is unknown suniefred is known only from having minted coins in toledo during what should have been egicas reign the seventeenth council of toledo was held in  the eighteenth council of toledo the last one took place shortly after egicas death around  or  by the end of the seventh century the bishop of toledo was the leader of the spanish bishops a situation unusual in europe the metropolitan bishops of toledo had achieved by the last quarter of the seventh century an authority and a primacy that was unique in western europe not even the pope could count on such support from neighbouring metropolitans toledo had been matched by no other city in western europe outside italy as the governmental and symbolic center of a powerful monarchy toledo had emerged from relative obscurity to become the permanent governmental centre of the visigothic monarchy a true capital whose only equivalent in western europe was to be lombard pavia when wittiza died around  ruderic became visigothic king in toledo but the kingdom was split as a rival king achila ruled tarraconensis and narbonensis meanwhile arabic and berber troops under musa ibn nusayr had conquered tangiers and ceuta between  and  and commenced raids into the visigothic kingdom in  ruderic led an army to confront the raiders he was defeated and killed in battle apparently after being betrayed by visigothic nobles who wished to replace him as king and did not consider the arabs and berbers a serious threat the commander of the invading forces was tariq bin ziyad a luwata berber freedman in the service of governor musa it is possible that a king called oppa ruled in toledo between ruderics death and the fall of toledo tariq seizing the opportunity presented by the death of ruderic and the internal divisions of the visigothic nobles captured toledo in  or  governor musa disembarked in cádiz and proceeded to toledo where he executed numerous visigothic nobles thus destroying much of the visigothic power structure collins suggests that the visigothic emphasis on toledo as the center of royal ceremony became a weakness since the king was chosen in or around toledo by nobles based in toledo and had to be anointed king by the bishop of toledo in a church in toledo when tariq captured toledo and executed the visigothic nobles having already killed the king there was no way for the visigoths to select a legitimate king toledo under arab ruleedit soon after the conquest musa and tariq returned to damascus the arab center of administration was placed first in seville then moved to cordoba with most of the rest of the iberian peninsula toledo was ruled from cordoba by the governor of alandalus under the ultimate notional command of the umayyad caliph in damascus arab conquerors had often replaced former capital cities with new ones to mark the change in political power and they did so here toledo suffered a period of profound decline throughout much of the earlier centuries of arab dominance in the peninsula the invaders were ethnically diverse and available evidence suggests that in the area of toledo berber settlement predominated over arab in  the berbers in alandalus rebelled against the arab omeyyad governors they took control of the north and marched south laying siege to toledo after a siege of one month the berber troops were defeated outside toledo by troops sent from cordoba by the governor abd almalik ibn katan and commanded by the governors son however while ibn katans troops were engaged with the berbers his arab allies betrayed and killed him and took over cordoba after the arabs first leader talama ibn salama died yusuf alfihri became ruler of alandalus the omeyyad dynasty in damascus collapsed and yusuf ruled independently with the support of his syrian arab forces the qays arab commander assumayl was made governor of toledo under yusuf around  there is evidence that toledo retained its importance as a literary and ecclesiastical center into the middle s in the chronicle of  the life of saint ildefonsus by cixila and ecclesiastical letters sent from toledo the eighth century bishop of toledo cixila wrote a life of saint ildefonsus of toledo probably before  this life of ildefonsus emphasized two episodes in the life of the bishop of toledo in the first episode the covering of the tomb of saint leocadia levitated while ildefonsus was saying mass with king reccesuinth present in the second episode mary appears to ildefonsus and reccesuinth these episodes are said to have resulted from ildefonsus devotion to saint leocadia patroness saint of toledo collins suggests that cixilas life of ildefonsus helped maintain ildefonsus appeal and helped the church in toledo to retain some of its authority among christian churches in the iberian peninsula an archdeacon in toledo called evantius who was active around  and died in  wrote a letter to address the existence of judaizing tendencies among the christians of zaragoza specifically the belief that there are unclean forms of meat and the literal interpretation of deuteronomic law a deacon and cantor from toledo called peter wrote a second letter to seville in about the year  to explain that they were celebrating easter and a september liturgical fast incorrectly again confusing them with jewish feasts celebrated at the same time these letters show that some of the primacy of the church of toledo within the iberian peninsula still existed in the s not only were its clerics still well enough equipped in intellectual terms to provide authoritative guidance on a wide range of ecclesiastical discipline and doctrine but this was also actively sought there is a strong possibility that the chronicle of  was written in toledo though scholars have also proposed cordoba and guadix based on the information available to the chronicler the chronicler showed awareness of the historia gothorum the etymologiae and the chronicle of isidore of seville the work of braulio of zaragoza the acts of the councils of toledo de perpetua virginitate by ildefonsus and de comprobatione sextae aetatis and historia wambae by julian of toledo all works that would have existed in the visigothic libraries of seventh century toledo and whose existence together makes more sense in a toledan context than in any other in  abd arrahman a descendant of the fallen omeyyad caliphs came to alandalus and initiated a revolt against yusuf he defeated yusuf and forced him to reside in cordoba but yusuf broke the agreement and raised a berber army to fight abd arrahman in this conflict toledo was held against abd arrahman by yusufs cousin hisham ibn urwa yusuf attempted to march on seville but was defeated and instead attempted to reach his cousin in toledo he was either killed on his way to toledo or he reached toledo and held out there for as many as two or three years before being betrayed and killed by his own people whether or not yusuf himself held out in toledo hisham ibn urwa did hold power in toledo for several years resisting the authority of abd arrahman in  hisham is reported as again being in rebellion in toledo against abd arrahman abd arrahman failed to take toledo by force and instead signed a treaty allowing hisham to remain in control of toledo but giving one of his sons as hostage to abd arrahman hisham continued to defy abd arrahman who had hishams son executed and the head catapulted over the city walls into toledo abd arrahman attacked toledo in  winning only when some of hishams own people betrayed him and turned him over to abd arrahman and his freedman badr ibn alathir states that towards the end of abd arrahmans reign a governor of toledo raided in force into the kingdom of asturias during the reign of mauregatus though the asturian chronicles do not record the event under the umayyad emirate of cordoba toledo was the centre of numerous insurrections dating from  to  twenty years after the rebellion of hisham ibn urwa the last of yusufs sons abu alaswad ibn yusuf rebelled in toledo in  after the suppression of ibn yusufs revolt abd arrahmans oldest son sulayman was made governor of toledo however abd arrahman designated as his successor a younger son hisham on hishams accession to the emirate in  sulayman refused to make the oath of allegiance at the mosque as succession custom would have dictated and thus declared himself in rebellion he was joined in toledo by his brother abdallah hisham laid siege to toledo while abdallah held toledo against hisham sulayman escaped and attempted to find support elsewhere but was unsuccessful in  abdallah submitted and hisham took control of toledo the following year sulayman gave up the fight and went into exile hishams son alhakam was governor of toledo from  to  when he succeeded his father as emir in cordoba after alhakams accession and departure a poet resident in toledo named girbib ibnabdallah wrote verses against the omeyyads helping to inspire a revolt in toledo against the new emir in  chroniclers disagree as to the leader of this revolt though ibn hayyan states that it was led by ibn hamir alhakam sent amrus ibn yusuf to fight the rebellion amrus took control of the berber troops in talavera from there amrus negotiated with a faction inside toledo called the banu mahsa promising to make them governors if they would betray ibn hamir the banu mahsa brought ibn hamirs head to amrus at talavera but instead of making them governors amrus executed them amrus now persuaded the remaining factions in toledo to submit to him once he entered toledo he invited the leaders to a celebratory feast as they entered amrus fortress the guests were beheaded one by one and their bodies thrown in a specially dug ditch the massacre was thus called the day of the ditch amrus soldiers killed about  people that day amrus was governor of toledo until  in  bishop elipandus of toledo wrote a letter condemning the teaching of a certain migetius in his letter elipandus asserted that christ had adopted his humanity a position that came to be known as adoptionism two asturian bishops beatus and eterius bishop of osma wrote a treatise condemning elipandus views pope hadrian wrote a letter between  and  in which he condemned migetius but also the terminology used by elipandus the frankish court of charlemagne also condemned adoptionism at the synod of frankfurt in  although ramon abadals y de vinyals argued that this controversy represented an ideological assertion of independence by the asturian church against the moslemruled church of toledo collins believes this argument applies eleventh century ideology to the eighth century and is anachronistic however collins notes that the controversy and the alliances formed during it between asturias and the franks broke the old unity of the spanish church the influence of the bishops of toledo would be much more limited until the eleventh century by the end of the s the omeyyads had created three frontier districts stretching out from the southern core of their iberian territories these were called the lower march altagr aladna central march altagr alawsat and upper march altagr alala toledo became the administrative center of the central march while merida became the center of the lower march and zaragoza of the upper march following the death of abd alrahman ii a new revolt broke out in toledo the omeyyad governor was held hostage in order to secure the return of toledan hostages held in córdoba toledo now engaged in an intercity feud with the nearby city of calatrava la vieja toledan soldiers attacked calatrava destroyed the walls and massacred or expelled many inhabitants of calatrava in  soldiers from cordoba came to restore the walls and protect calatrava from toledo the new emir muhammad i sent a second army to attack the toledans but was defeated toledo now made an alliance with king ordoño i of asturias the toledans and asturians were defeated at the battle of guadacelete with sources claiming  toledan and asturian soldiers were killed and their heads sent back to cordoba for display throughout alandalus despite this defeat toledo did not surrender to cordoba the omeyyads reinforced nearby fortresses with cavalry forces to try to contain the toledans toledans attacked talavera in  but were again defeated in  emir muhammad i personally led an expedition against toledo and destroyed a bridge but was unable to take the city in  muhammad i negotiated a truce with toledo toledo became virtually independent for twenty years though locked in conflict with neighboring cities muhammad i recovered control of toledo in  when he successfully besieged the city and forced it to submit azulejo in sevilles plaza de españa despicting the conquest of toledo in  the banu qasi gained nominal control of the city until  and in  abdarrahman iii captured the city following an extensive siege according to the chronicle of alfonso iii musa ibn musa of the banu qasi had partly by war and partly by strategy made himself master of zaragoza tudela huesca and toledo he had installed his son lupus lubb as governor of toledo king ordoño i of asturias fought a series of battles with musa ibn musa according to the chronicle musa ibn musa allied with his brotherinlaw garcia identified as garcia iñiquez king of pamplona ordoño defeated musas forces at the battle of monte laturce musa died of injuries and his son lubb submitted to ordoños authority in  or  for the duration of ordoños reign up to  thus according to the chronicle of alfonso iii toledo was ruled by the asturian kings however arabic sources do not confirm these campaigns instead stating that musa ibn musa was killed in a failed attack on guadalajara and that andalusi forces repeatedly defeated asturian forces in the area of alava from  to  by the s the omeyyads had regained control over toledo in  almundhir led an expedition against asturias of which one of the main components was a force from toledo one source portrays this raid as an attack by the king of toledo but other sources portray it as an omeyyad raid involving substantial toledan forces the forces from toledo were defeated by alfonso iii of asturias at the battle of polvoraria spanish chronicles state that twelve to thirteen thousand in the toledo army were killed in the battle collins states that these figures are totally unreliable but demonstrate that asturian chroniclers thought of this as an important and decisive battle in s and s the governors of toledo were in rebellion against the umayyad regime in cordoba led by abd alrahman iii in  abd alrahman iii having now adopted the title of caliph attacked toledo the governor of toledo asked for help from king ramiro ii of leon but ramiro was preocuppied with a civil war against his brother alfonso iv and was unable to help in  abd alrahman iii conquered toledo reestablishing control of altagr alawsat the central march of the omeyyad state in  one of the last umayyad caliphs muhammad ii almahdi fled to toledo after being expelled from cordoba by berber forces backing the rival claimant sulayman almahdi and his saqaliba general wadih formed an alliance with the count of barcelona and his brother the count of urgell these catalans joined with wadih and almahdi in toledo in  and marched on cordoba the combination of wadihs army and the catalans defeated the berbers in a battle outside cordoba in  after the fall of the omeyyad caliphate in the early th century toledo became an independent taifa kingdom the population of toledo at this time was about  thousand including a jewish population estimated at  thousand the mozarab community had its own christian bishop and after the christian conquest of toledo the city was a destination for mozarab immigration from the muslim south the taifa of toledo was centered on the tajo river the border with the taifa of badajoz was on the tajo between talavera de la reina and coria north the border was the sierra de guadarrama northeast toledo lands stretched past guadalajara to medinaceli southeast was the border with the taifa of valencia in la mancha between cuenca and albacete south were the borders with badajoz around the mountains of toledo in  fernando i of leon and castile attacked the taifa of toledo he conquered talamanca de jarama and besieged alcala de henares to secure fernandos withdrawal king almamun of toledo agreed to pay an annual tribute or parias to fernando three years later in  almamun invaded the taifa of valencia through la mancha successfully conquering it toledo controlled the taifa of valencia until almamuns death in  after the death of fernando i in  the kingdom of leon and castilla was divided in three the kingdoms of galicia leon and castilla the parias that had been paid by toledo to fernando i were assigned to the kingdom of león which was inherited by alfonso vi however in  alfonsos older brother sancho ii invaded leon and defeated his younger brother alfonso vi was allowed to go into exile with almamun in toledo alfonso vi was in exile in toledo approximately from june to october  but after sancho ii was killed later in the same year alfonso left toledo and returned to leon some sources state that almamun forced alfonso to swear support for almamun and his heirs before allowing him to leave in  alfonso vi campaigned against the taifa of granada with the assistance of almamun of toledo alfonso received troops from almamun in addition to the parias payment facilitating his military campaigns the campaign was successful and granada was forced to begin parias payments to alfonso vi after this almamun proceeded to attack cordoba which was then under the control of his enemy almutamid taifa king of sevilla he conquered cordoba in january  the parias of toledo to alfonso vi in the s amounted to approximately  thousand gold dinars this money contributed strongly to alfonso vis ability to project military strength throughout the iberian peninsula in  almamun of toledo was killed in the city of cordoba which he had conquered only the year before the taifa king of sevilla took the opportunity to reconquer cordoba and seize other territory on the borderlands between the taifas of sevilla and toledo almamun was succeeded by his son alqadir the last taifa king of toledo possibly keeping an earlier promise to almamun alfonso vi at first supported the succession of alqadir the taifa of valencia which had been conquered by almamun revolted against alqadir and ceased parias payments to toledo taking advantage of alqadirs weakness almutamid of sevilla took lands in la mancha from the taifa of toledo and from there conquered the taifas of valencia and denia in  after this alqadir lost popularity in toledo there was a revolt against him and he was forced to flee the city and appeal to alfonso vi for help the rebels invited the king of badajoz almutawakkil to rule toledo the king of badajoz occupied toledo in  but alfonso vi sent forces to help alqadir recover toledo alfonso captured the fortress town of coria which controlled a pass from castilian lands into the lands of the taifa of badajoz since alfonso now threatened him through coria almutawakkil withdrew from toledo and alqadir was able to return to toledo as the price of his help alfonso obtained the right to station two garrisons of his soldiers on the lands of toledo at alqadirs expense a second revolt against alqadir took place in  this time alqadir defeated the rebels in toledo chased them to madrid and defeated them there it was about this time at the latest that alfonso vi decided to seize toledo for himself though some authors have argued that the plan to conquer toledo existed by  in  alfonso vi campaigned against almutamid bringing his forces right up against sevilla and reaching the city of tarifa with the intention of dissuading almutamid from any resistance against the coming seizure of toledo in  alfonso set siege to toledo preventing the city from being supplied and also preventing agricultural work in the area over the winter of  to  the siege was maintained while the king spent the winter north in leon and sahagun in spring  alfonso personally rejoined the siege with new forces the city soon fell and alfonso made his triumphant entry to the city on may   toledo experienced a period known as la convivencia ie the coexistence of jews christians and muslims under islamic arab rule toledo was called ṭulayṭulah after the fall of the caliphate toledo was the capital city of one of the richest taifas of alandalus its population was overwhelmingly muladi and because of its central location in the iberian peninsula toledo took a central position in the struggles between the muslim and christian rulers of northern spain the conquest of toledo by alfonso vi of castile in  marked the first time a major city in alandalus was captured by christian forces it served to sharpen the religious aspect of the christian reconquest medieval toledo after the reconquestedit toledo in the th century view of toledo by resident el greco c  on may   alfonso vi of castile took toledo and

centre was established in which books in arabic or hebrew would be translated into castilian by muslim and jewish scholars and from castilian into latin by castilian scholars thus letting longlost

dwindle until the late th century when it became the capital of the autonomous community of castile–la mancha nevertheless the economic decline of the city helped to preserve its cultural and
