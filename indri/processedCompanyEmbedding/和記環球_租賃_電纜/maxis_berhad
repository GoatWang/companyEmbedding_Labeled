to outline the who what where when why and how this report was commissioned to examine why maxis has an opportunity to produce their own bran smart phone since none of all telecommunication company has the same strategy yet and a way to recommend ways of increasing sales and revenue who is the company targeting of course we separate the market according to different market segmentation so we will target most on teenagers and low income market which are under demographic segmentation what product is the company selling the company is selling its own brand smartphone instead of sub selling other manufacturer’s smartphone they decided to produce a smartphone of their own name first entry of their own produce may have dominated the market where is the company doing the promotion the company are going to promote their product according to demographic segmentation which is more focusing on teenager where university and colleges around malaysia furthermore they also are setting up booth in a mall where teenagers used to hang around when is the product launched and releasing the product is releasing at end of year  and will be launched at the same time why is the company come out with this idea it is because as said at the beginning of this proposal first entry of the market will lead to market domination plus there also will be more opportunity for the company to success and lastly how this product is going to success there is few steps for how the product is going to success firstly show it to potential buyers next is determine the correct price and third is to compare the product with other product on the market and lastly is to take the product to a trade show a sixth way to test market a product or service is take it to a trade show there are  trade shows per annum all over the country sophisticated buyers go to trade shows and they will tell you rapidly whether or not you have a winner  company overview  historybackground maxis communication berhad is the leading telecommunications service provider that started in the year  maxis communication berhad is the son company of usaha tegas group holding berhad majority stake of the company  owned by malaysian tycoon tatparanandam ananda krishnan richest man in malaysia maxis have possession of  market share of telecommunication industry which converts to  million of users out of  million of population of malaysia since the commencement of commercial operations maxis provide varieties of mobile telecommunication products and services such as broadband international roaming mms and so on they started with the phone number starting with the prefix  later they purchased timecel which is another mobile services provider and that is when they started offering phone number starting with prefix of  in  they introduce the prepaid service as competitors such as digi celcom telecommunication which offer lower prices and lots of offers and promotion this forced maxis to sell their prepaid starter pack as low as rm in addition the company also operates in international gateway services its geographical operations spread across malaysia indonesia and india in maxis achieves prestigious from the public the readers of the wall street journal asia have rated maxis as malaysia’s most admired company in the wall street journal asia  survey in   vision the vision of maxis to bring the future to our customers’ lives and businesses in a manner that is simple personalized and enriching by efﬁciently and creatively harnessing leadingedge technologies and delivering a brand of service experience that is reliable and enchanting besides that there are several visions have been pronounced by maxis which is to be the communications company every customer prefers above all others to be the organization every employee aspires to work for where they can maximize their full potential to be the corporation every shareholder seeks to invest in to be the partner every shareholder seeks to invest in to be recognized domestically and internationally by everyone within and across all industries to be the success story every malaysian can be proud of this is what we at maxis strive for every single day it might seem a tall order but at maxis we believe in setting high goals and standards by pushing the limits and breaking new ground we will become the company we aspire to be  mission the mission of maxis is today  malaysia’s leading mobile communications service provider tomorrow  the nation’s premier integrated communications service provider  objectives the objectives of maxis is connected to mainstream information and communications technology ict development enabling an empowering these connected communities bring about socioeconomic development for those communities in the various sectors such as agriculture education health and business amongst others  market opportunity  maxis’s smartphone after a long term discussion we believe that one of the opportunity of maxis is to produce their own brand smartphone after a series of research we found out that among the competitors of maxis nobody had joined this market so we do believe that smartphone will be a good opportunity for maxis since maxis provide smartphones services they can make some promotion for example discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone service package nowadays telecommunication industry expands rapidly due to change of customer behavior and preference more and more people tend to use smartphone and tablet online instead of netbook and notebook because smartphone are easier to carry compare to notebook by providing the new technology g maxis will have more advantage by competing with other competitors now is a new generation of smartphone internet service in market g it is a fourth generation of smartphone communications standards it can provide you to online anytime and anywhere you want so why don’t maxis provide their own smartphones by focusing on making it become a complementary product we do believe that maxis have the opportunity to earn more income in the market according to the malaysia budget  there are good news to malaysia sme and younger generation firstly the announcements of oneoff smartphone rm rebate to individual age  to  with a monthly income of under rm  within the rebate rmmil will be allocated for this initiative targeted to benefit  million youths nationwide this will increase smartphone sales in future and also use of smartphone online services although this will cause short term drop of sales before the implementation of the rebate as consumer will stop to buy smartphone until  but it will not affect the sales in the long run smartphones have become a necessity for us to connect network learn and do work it should be a market opportunity for maxis to provide better package of smart phone online services before a coming boost up smart phone sales according to google malaysia communications and public relation department head zeffri yusof by signed up for the google malaysia  get malaysian business online gmbo program can get more smes to use internet as a marketing platform to their products he says that there are currently more than mil malaysian internet users who regularly search for products and services via online but there are not much local sme products that could be found on the world wide web by showing the research that we find we once again make sure that by providing maxis own mobile phone it has a great potential to boost up their sales and lead up from the other competitors  market growth opportunity in  we have reached another level on technology era from the newest research we found that one quarter  of teens  to  indicate that their phone is a smartphone while  have a regular cell phone or not sure what kind of phone they have and another  of teens do not have a cell phone at all from here we can see the potential of create a new phone by maxis smartphone ownership is highest among older teens as  of teens ages  have a smartphone compared with just  of youth ages  the data suggest a cell phone ownership evolution by age however overall sales of mobiles phones fell  in the quarter as consumers held out of forthcoming devices according to analyst firm gartner demand slowed further in the second quarter of  the challenging economic environment and users postponing upgrades to take advantage of highprofile device launches and promotions available later in the year slowed demand across markets demand of feature phones continued to decline significantly weakening the overall mobile phone market as the result we found we know that most of the teenagers are using smartphone now so if maxis do really can provide their own product it will be the best opportunity to over pass their competitor and boost up the sales  target market nowadays most people have mobile phones and many have smartphones due to the technology innovations telecommunication industry had launched smartphones instead of mobile phone with the existing of smartphone people do not have to bring their laptop or sit in front of the desktop to do their tasks since smartphones have combined multiple computing capabilities maxis decide to focus on teenagers market from the newest research we found that one quarter  of teens from  to  years old is using smartphone while  have a regular cell phone or not sure what kind of phone they have and another  of teens do not have a cell phone from here we can see that there have a number of teenagers prefer to use smartphone however most of the application of smartphone will function only when connecting with internet smartphones is very useful for teenagers’ todays for example student’s text book is become more expensive especially for the students of university and college so they like to download ebook through the smartphone to get the information instead of buying books besides that teenagers need to keep up with their friends or colleagues by using smartphone with the social networking sites facebook they can keep in touch and chat with their friends or have a discussion on facebook via the smartphone wherever they are so maxis will launch a package by given discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package this package will more focus on another  of teens that do not have a cell phone and for the  of teens whose maybe want to change their cell phone to smartphone by using this package teenagers can have a smartphone and use it online everywhere or do their work with no worry for the network connection apart from that maxis also decide to focus on low income market in recent years the importance of emerging markets and increase of competition among companies are pushing most of the companies to serve the low income group according to the malaysia budget  individual age between  and  and earning under rm  can purchase smartphone with the rm  government rebate this rebate is given a chance to those low income people who have not own a smartphone on the same time maxis will launch some packages with phone by given discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package this can increase the sale of smartphone in future and also the people use of smartphone online services discount and the price of the package are set affordable by all level income customers especially for low income customers for easily get attraction from them by using this package they can enjoy the online services with affordable price in conclusion maxis will more focus on teenagers and low income markets which are under demographic segmentation with the constant technological innovation almost everything can be done by using a smartphone and it is become more importance in our daily life so maxis brand’s smartphone can be a good opportunity for them to boost up their sales  marketing mix strategies  product strategies before maxis announce the smartphone they produced we will analyze the market needs which needed to fulfill this is because maxis have to fulfill the market needs to confirm the sales of the smartphone that we had produced normally customer will purchase the smartphone according to their needs and budget in this case maxis have to produce the smartphone to fulfill different level needs for example maxis can produce the smartphone with high performance specification to fulfill the users who need smart phone to play games maxis also can produce the smart phone for the business usage user this kind of smartphone will more focus on battery life time and office use function other than that maxis also can choose to cooperate with smartphone manufacture to produce the phone with lower cost telecommunication providers from other country also use this strategy to produce the smartphone with lower cost for example att from us had cooperated with samsung to produce a special edition of galaxy s for their sales usages maxis also can try to do so to reduce the cost of produce the smartphone besides that maxis also can cooperate with those artist or designer to produce some special edition phone in case of this the sales of the smartphone will be increased because of the artist or designer reputation for example mobile phone manufacture from south korea lg had cooperated with girls’ generation a famous female artist group from south korea to promote their smartphone few years ago celcom also cooperate with leehom wang a chinese artist from taiwan to promote their product maxis also find produce the smartphones that fully utilize the service that they provided nowadays smartphone in the market mostly cannot fully utilize the technology that had introduced in this case maxis can produce the smartphone which can fully use the technology in the market by this maxis can fix the smartphone place in the market for example nokia lumia  and htc one xl are the phones which can fully utilize the technology which is the g lte so maxis can try to cooperate with these smartphone manufactures to produce the smart phone which have this specification packaging of a product also is an important issue for the product marketing in case of this maxis can package the phone with some special design for example china mobile phone manufacture xiaomi they had packaged smartphone that they produced with a strong packing which can withstand kg of weight even it built with ecofriendly materials with this kind of packaging smartphone purchaser can have more confident to purchase online without worrying damages of product during transportation was done  pricing strategy even that the product strategy is very important pricing strategy of the product also very important for the new smartphone that maxis will produce as above there had mentioned that smartphone will produce to fulfill the different level needs maxis also have to price the smart phone according to the market that the smartphone have to face maxis can choose the price leadership strategy as the pricing strategy price leadership strategy is an observation made of oligopolistic business behavior in which one company usually the dominant competitor among several leads the way in determining prices the others soon following the context is a state of limited competition in which a market is shared by a small number of producers or sellers in case of this maxis can price the smartphone produced in different price of other phone manufacture’ phone other than that maxis also can apply the bundle pricing strategy as the pricing strategy as we know maxis is the telecommunication provider in the market they also provided the internet service for user in case of this maxis can bundle the smartphone that they produced with the talk and internet plan that they launched by this users can purchase the smartphone and the talk and internet plan at the same time product line pricing strategy also can be applied as the pricing strategy in maxis maxis can price the smartphone according to the market that the smartphone focused with for example smartphone for entry level user should be priced at the low price which allowed for the users who wish to entry and try the smart phone loyalty of customer also can be a point to price the product for the customer who had used the service long term can provide discount for them maxis one club is the best example of this maxis can price the smart phone that produced into this club with a cheaper price and as rewards for the loyal customer psychology pricing strategy can be introduced in this case normally purchaser only will purchase product that they felt cheaper and worth for it in case of this maxis can price the phone with the price that can make user or purchaser felt that the phone is cheaper than other competitors for example a smartphone that having market price of rm maxis can price it as rm or rm that can make consumer feel cheaper even that actually maxis do not have any loss in the case  place strategy in an increasingly competitive and complex communication industry the pace of technological innovation is such that no single company can survive if it operates alone and maxis has long recognized the need to work with a range of different partners locally and globally to broaden our range of offerings and to enhance capabilities as the preferred communications solution provider thus it is also can be a platform for maxis to establish smartphone not only inside the country but also to the other country the strong distribution channels that work with maxis are zyxel communication corporation m sdn bhd advanced broadband communication sdn bhd techscience consultants  services sdn bhd all of them we already know they were also a company that provide a solution for communication for example zxxel is providing the architecture of making a modem to the telekom malaysia tm so maxis have found this is an opportunity to distribute the new smartphone to this company in addition because this is a new innovation by maxis they can see a potential that is created by them so they tend to expand their product globally it is possible because they already have strong partners and alliances including outside the country it should not be a problem for them another chances that maxis have is by the used of internet as their marketing platform here they can place not only the smartphone but including the other entire product under their company by doing so people can neglect all the suspicious information about the product because each features about maxis’s product is briefly showed a series of research found that there are currently  million malaysian internet users who regularly search for products and service via online this is from area inside the country but can we figure out what will happen if people from other country which is also as the internet users who regularly seeking for products and service this is sure to make profitable for maxis besides the headquarters which is main office of particular area can distribute these products in addition they also can pace the product to all the other offices which belong to their area this is to make sure their product will be separated and expanded regularly from researched we’ve found most of the smartphone users were highest among older teens which is  of teens ages  –  have a smartphone thus we look up this thing as a big opportunity for established our new product smartphone to the teenagers maxis including whole the organization are work together on looking a place which is the most popular place for teens go we already identified the potential places and we suggest placing the product on carnival universities colleges around malaysia for example ‘jom heboh carnival’ is a place that many people go especially teenagers and we also can focus on mall or supermarket where teenagers used to hang around we can explain and describe briefly about the product and hope they will show an interested on our product  promotion strategy promotion is the business of communicating with customers it will provide information that will assist them in making decisions to purchase a product or service the pace and creativity of some promotional activities are almost alien to normal business activities maxis provide a variety of mobile communication products and services they offer prepaid calls plans monthly subscription plans international roaming mms wap residential fixed line services and broadband internet plans all these have been done great fully and they just do a stunning work maxis comes these entire product with make some promotion therefore the same method will be used to the new smartphone this is because we found out that among the competitors of maxis nobody had joined this kind of market so we believe that smartphone will be a good chance for maxis since maxis provide mobile services they can make some promotion as example they can give discount on smartphone if customers purchase their mobile service package another method that can be used is advertising maxis can make an agreement with the advertising sources like printing media  television  radio are effective ways to entice customers and make them aware of the brand’s existence in addition  billboards  hoarding  banners installed intelligently at strategic locations like heavy traffic areas  crossings  railway stations  bus stands attract the passing individuals towards our product beside taglines also increase the recall value of the product among the customers word of mouth is the most important method in our promotion strategy we do believe that one satisfied customer brings ten more customers along with him whereas dissatisfied customer takes away ten more customers that’s the importance of word mouth positive word of mouth goes a long way in promoting our product among customers another method that can be implemented is sponsorship the meaning is in this case maxis have to pay an organization to use their brand and logo this organization usually has a high profile so that maxis know that their product and brand will be seen by a large audience most common use of sponsorship is with sporting events but seem that it is not suitable for maxis maybe they can use sponsorship with celebrity awards events or any musical events as the events will attract wide audience around our country the next method is selling put simply selling is the exchange of goods or services for an agreed of money there have several stages that can be implement but maxis take only the suitable for the goodness of their company they can use presentation and demonstration approach here presenting and demonstrating the features and benefits of their product which is smartphone in order to convince the prospect that people want or need can be satisfied the handling objections

berhad for the smartphones from the years  to  in the year  maxis had sold  million units of the smartphones maxis have  of sales volume which has a lower volume of their sales this is because maxis is just launch the smartphones in the market since maxis brand smartphones is unknown to the public maxis will use some promotions to stress information about the features of the smartphones for examples maxis use media advertising such as newspaper television radio and billboards advertising to reach audiences in different ways besides that maxis also implement sponsorship to attract wide audience sometimes the smartphones may discover some technical problems and get financial loss at the beginning as maxis need to spend money on advertising in the year  maxis had sold  million units of smartphones and the sales volume of the smartphones will increase rapidly to  the sales volume has increase  compare to year  as the promotions are effectively reaches to the audiences this will attract new customers to make purchases and some customer may make repurchases besides that maxis offer some sales promotion such as give discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package this can encourage hesitant customers to try their product and will boost up the sales in the year  the forecast sales volume of the smartphones will increase to  which has increase  compare

smartphones besides that maxis will focus on improve the quality and services of the product or redesign the product to maintain the sales volume of smartphones  marketing budget the graph shows the marketing expense budget of maxis berhad for the smartphones from the years  to  in the year  maxis will have a higher marketing expense budget which cost rm million since the smartphones is first launch by the maxis it needs more costs to enter a new market to promote customers awareness maxis has use advertising such as newspaper television radio billboards hoarding or banners advertising other than that maxis had implemented sponsorship to attract wide audiences this will cost a very high cost in marketing a product in the year  the marketing expense budget has decrease to the amount of rm million they do not need to spend more marketing costs than previous year as most of the customer already aware of the new product launch by the maxis through the promotion however maxis still need to offer some sales promotion to attract the hesitant customers to try their products in the year  there have a decrease to the amount of rm  million maxis already create customer’s loyalty and

are a lot of uncertainties that may influence the organizations performance marketing environment is one of the important factors that able impacts on the organization besides that the marketing environment has several forces that able to influence the maxis bhd company which is social forces economical forces competitor forces technological forces and regulatory forces  social forces the social forces of the environment include the demographic characteristics of the population and its values changes in these forces can have dramatic impact on marketing strategy the demographics of malaysia are represented by multiple ethnic groups that exist in the country the population on  is more than million and  million malaysian live in east malaysia and  million live in peninsular malaysia if there are any changes of these demographic it will affect the marketing strategy by maxis bhd a population can also be described using characteristics such as age gender ethnicity income and occupation how these characteristic affect the marketing strategy maxis bhd is a company that selling mobile communication services in malaysia thus the characteristic such as age ethnicity income and also occupation are important to use to determine the targeted group of customer for example maxis bhd will basically base on the different group of customer to selling the different plan of mobile communication services to the customer in addition  to  ages normally the persons who under this ranges of ages is a students so maxis bhd forms a students packages in order to attract the customers in case there are business man who more than  ages and above company will form a different plan in order to suit the needs of the customers normally the students package will more cheap than the others plan such as business man packages the current student packages is free sending messages have a great discount and lowcost calling charges which is  cents per minutes but for the nonstudent packages it will not have such welfare basically for nonstudent packages will more focus on the higher rate of charges  economy forces malaysia is the rapidly development economy country in the southeast asian it has be category as the middleincome country malaysia is the third largest economy country in the southeast asia the geographic of malaysia has separately into two parts which is the peninsular malaysia and malaysian borneo in malaysia the land is rich in the natural resource and raw material in early ear the major of malaysia economy are developing in the agriculture mining and forestry sector in year  malaysia has developed into a multisector economy from the producer of raw material the economy has contributed by other sector such like medical technology industry and service sector besides the strait of malacca which is the international ship route increase the volume of international trade and manufacturing sector still remain the most influence the entire of malaysia economy growth according to service statistics information and communication technology in year  the value added generated by the telecommunication service is amounted to rm billion comparing with the computer and other related activities the value added generated is amounted to rm billion this shows that the telecommunication service sectors are more contributed to the malaysia economy there has potential market in the telecommunication service sector beside that malaysia financial year  state that the agriculture sector has contributed  percentages to malaysia gdp industrial sector stand for  percentages and the rest is service sector was  percentages however malaysian economy was growth slow in the year  it is because of the gross investment was fixed it is one of the element that influence the gdp according to the malaysia mobile cellular telephone data graphs in year  there are  population of mobile cellular telephone subscriber in year  there are  population of mobile cellular telephone in malaysia comparing the year  and year  there is increase  population of mobile cellular telephone subscriber there are more malaysian using the mobile cellular telephone in their life and it become a necessary tools for communication the telecommunication companies play an important role to provide the quality service to the every customer in the market  competitors malaysia has come out with a competition law which this act was passed by parliament in may  and publicly announces in june  it will be enforced on st january  besides this act is to provide a comprehensive competition law at the national level which cuts across all economic sectors and it apply to all commercial activities in malaysia and outside malaysia that will influence competition in malaysia market main provision of competition act  is section  and section  section  is to prohibition against anti competitive agreement which prohibition against any horizontal or vertical agreement which has the object or effect of significantly preventing restricting or distorting competition in malaysia besides section  is prohibition against abuse of dominant position which dominant position means a situation in where one or more enterprises possess such significant power in a market to adjust prices or outputs or trading terms without effective constraint from competitors or potential competitors for section  prohibitions normally is for price fixing market allocation bid ringing agreement exclusive dealing and tiein arrangement however for section  it is to prohibition abuse toward price discrimination excessive pricing and predatory pricing  intertype competition intertype competitions define as competitions among firms in different type of businesses but which both firms selling the same product as we know that maxis berhad offered the iphone subscription plans to consumers and the company sells its iphone to the customers with its own packagerefer appendices  furthermore the apple company is the manufacturer for the iphone apple company also offers its iphone to mobile shops thus mobile shops are directly competed with maxis berhad and both of them are from different industry it means that the relationship between the maxis bhd and mobile shop are intertype competition basically the customers will buy for maxis bhd company rather than the other mobile shop the reason is because of the successful for the promotion package that setting by the maxis berhad company  intratype competition intratype competition defines as competition among firms in the same type of business example competition between maxis and digi which both of them is from the same business field that selling the same product which is mobile communication maxis and digi operating in the same business field which provide mobile communication services to customers digi targeted on teenagers by providing a entertainment service for this group consumers such as provide free internet connection with no cost for digi consumers to view facebook everyday by using stated link besides maxis doesnt provide this kind of opportunity for their consumers because most properly they target on those working populations maxis promoting family plans package that charges low cost for family member who using the same network to encourage family member sign up the package to save their costrefer appendices  otherwise digi has come out with a package that is once we have send message more than rm  each day the continue cost will be free as consumers message to the same network it only charge rm  each day if consumers fulfil the package condition  technological forces maxis berhad internet communication should improve their maxis broadband by upgrade their internet connection speed even though maxis broadband is convenience because we can online and bring to anywhere but during peak season the internet connection will down and it cause a lot consumers complain about this matter thus if maxis berhad can improve their internet connection it will bring a lot opportunity for their firm before maxis berhad provide g function customers just can use mobile phone to communicate with each others but today maxis berhad has provide g function that allow consumers to communicate and look at each other by using mobile phone and it also can use as videoconferencing for companies meeting maxis berhad also pronounce that their company is going to launch g function soon to keep improving their technologies to meet with modern times  regulatory forces maxis marketing practices and business decisions are significantly influenced by the regulatory forces in malaysia so maxis has some restriction in conducting its business in order to adapt to this regulatory environment maxis has followed all the laws that are stated and adjusted its activities in conducting business maxis bhd is not a dominating company in the telecommunication industry in malaysia malaysians competition act  has contained forbiddance of anticompetitive behaviour and prohibition of the misuse of a dominated market position in order to protect competition so the business competition is fair and encouraged in malaysia however it also has been shaped a heavily competition environment thus maxis is always striving to be efficient and innovative in its practices besides that it also always improves its research and development of new services and techniques in order to compete with its competitors and create the best value to the customers in addition maxis is also governed by the productrelated legislation which attempts to protect both company and consumer the patent law and the copyright law provides maxis the right to keep out other from producing using or selling that violate the patented creation and the exclusive right of its own work example the slogans and the advertisements of maxis are the copyright of the maxis so only maxis can use it and customers are easily to identify maxis when they see the particular advertisements and slogans maxis is not allowed to infringe others rights as well due to the consumer labelling and consumerism act in malaysia maxis is required to list out all the terms and conditions of all its products and services when it promotes to the customers maxis and its customers are also protected by the trademarks act that ensure the consumers are purchasing the true product and guarantees the company has the exclusive right to the word name and symbol so the word maxis and its symbol will appear on its every product in order to make customers to recognize and identify it from other company no others can use the word maxis in their products to boot there is no fixing price allowed in malaysia in fact whatever price of talking rate sms charge and even the monthly charge of broadband provided by maxis are different with other same industry company this situation proves that there is no anticompetitive behaviour in this field the competition is very fair and healthy among the several companies so price discount is used by maxis in order to compete with other for example you will get cheaper talking charge if you talk more maxis bhd has made many exclusive dealings as its marketing practices this distribution action is allowed in malaysia for example the maxis shops only sell the maxis packages broadband and related products and services also maxis is not engaging in the deceptive or misleading advertising which is illegal maxis advertisement is always correspond to the true of what it intended to let customers know maxis also attempt to police itself by participating in the mcmc the malaysian communications and multimedia commission designates access forum  segmentation maxis berhad company is using multiple products and multiple markets segments to segments the markets thus maxis berhad company tries to design the several different packages of product in order to satisfy the different type of users need and wants basically it has numbers of variables that can be used to segment consumer markets such as demographic psychographic and behavior  demographic several segmentation variables which are age gender ethnicity income and occupation is used by maxis berhad in implementing its market segmentation age in fact maxis berhad tries to segment the market based on the age of the people below  and above  the potential customer is below  ages normally is student on the other hand the consumer who is older than  ages basically is the working adult the working adults basically have a greater usage in the mobile services thus normally the package for  ages and above will enjoy more welfare compare to the others package gender both female and male in the malaysia are the maxis berhad potential customers businessman need to make the call to do business connect with clients and make order women like to use phone to have a long chat with friends generation different generations have the different needs and wants baby boomers desire more stable and reliable products and services but its not all of them have a hand phone generation x are more concerning about the quality for example the coverage of the maxis berhad services the generations y are more interested in the innovation price and convenient o products and services income maxis berhad services are usually suitable for all income groups of consumer but the medium and high income groups are dominant of because maxis berhad chargers higher rate than its competitors  psychographic segmentation maxis berhad also apply psychographic segmentation to identify the potential consumers lifestyle in malaysia telecommunication market involving their attitudes opinion and value maxis berhad realize that malaysian are very relying on the telecommunication to deal with business social activities and have fun especially when their social group is bigger the communications become more important most of malaysian believes that telecommunication is necessary at any place and anytime especially for the businessmen so the quality and the coverage of the services are very important for maxis to survive in this market so maxis have been building a strong value and making the malaysian to believe that maxis is a company provides a better quality services and have huge coverage in malaysia  behavioralistic segmentation benefit sought maxis berhad discovered that the importance of product benefit to the potential consumer its not just providing the mobile phone telecommunication and access internet service to every maxis subscriber nowadays multiple product features are necessary to compete with other substitute products the customers will look on how product benefits will maximize their demand not just fulfill the basic need beside that the customer also concern on the quality security and service of product usage rate maxis berhad has examined the usage rate of group customer in the market how much the customers spend in a specific period based on the usage rate the customer has divides into the heavy medium or light usage category the customers who have spent over rm per month were under heavy usage category for medium usage category customers were having spent between rm to below rm per month lastly the customers who spend below rm per month were considering as light usage category other than that maxis bhd found that the usage rate ratio will different in some specific period especially in festival period such like valentines day happy new year and christmas day the usage rage will extreme higher than nonfestival day  targeting because of the maxis berhads telecommunication services are offered all around the country so the services are being targeted all the potential customers wherever in malaysia no matter with rural and urban areas maxis berhad uses product differentiation to target different group of the customers different group of customers may have different needs and wants different plans and services are offered to reach the different group of customers from the age segments which are below  and above  maxis berhad is using different plans to target these  groups of potential customers both male and female have the different intention to use the telecommunication services for the customers age below  maxis berhad targets this group by offering the prepaid plan to them this group of customers usually use phone to have entertainment communicate with friends and enjoy the social life they are usually not necessary to make the call in whatever situation they just use the telecommunication service to have entertainment and lack dealing with important case but they use it constantly hence this kind of target customers are usually student they required the cheaper and entertained services they usually will make the call or sms when their prepaid account still have credit and when all amount in their prepaid account has been spent they will either top up the account or just left it zero because it is not very important to them for whether can make the call so the prepaid plan which is cheaper and convenient is suited o target this group the potential customers whose age above  are probably working adults and willing to pay more expensive amount to receive a better service because of maxis berhad charges a higher price but provides good quality services to the customers this group of customers usually emphasise the quality of telecommunication service because it is so important in their career they need to use the phone to stay connection with their client make order and discuss the important issues so maxis berhad targets this segment by promoting the products and services in a way that emphasized in good quality for example the principal line service is used to serve the customers who use phone in their job have a global lookout and travel widely for work so this group of customers need a stable service which has excellent coverage and enable them to call wherever they are easily for example the businessmen those always need to communicate with their clients suppliers partners and other besides that people tend to stay connection with the people they love and concern with the telecommunication service is becoming important in the people social activities so maxis berhad also targets the customers who use the telecommunication service to maintain their relationship with other people for example the supplementary line which is provided by maxis berhad is used to target the group who emphasized in kinship this kind of service is offered to the people who always communicate with their family members and hisher beloved one with a specific amount of free talking time and free sms between the customer and family members the users of this kind of service usually are the people who study or work at place that far away from their family members so this plan can benefit them so much other than that couples in sweet love are also suited in using this plan to keep the sweetness with beloved one  positioning product positioning is important for every organization to create a good image in consumers mind for target market of its product reputation and brand maxis have use two types of positioning which is

berhad has a great understanding toward the environmental factors which can affect its business so the company is implementing its marketing strategies and conducting its business in a way that consistent with the environment factors besides that the company always prepares to make changes and improvement in order to meet the environmental changes for example it always makes its product to

excellent marketing strategies to gain the market share even though there are some limitation weve found on maxis berhad but we can conclude that maxis berhad is a successful company which has the leading position in malaysia  recommendations after we analyzed the factors affect the maxis marketing environment the segmentation and marketing mix weve found that there are some maxis weaknesses in the certain part which have to implement or adjust in order to improve the maxis bhd there are some recommendations that can lead maxis bhd to be more successful  innovation of new product g the latest mobile internet service with voice has been launched by ytl communications sdn bhd by comparing with other companies g package rate it offers the lowest rate in the malaysia market besides the speed coverage and benefit are advanced than g maxis bhd has to be awareness on the changing of competitor environment understands the strength and weaknesses of competitors maxis bhd has to create the new product that can compete with the strong competitor it also need to come out with the new idea of product to attract the buyer even though it might spend a lot of time and involve highly cost of research and development to create a new product but the return of huge profits are able to cover all the costs involved and to boot the maxis market share  improve the quality of the products and services weve discovered that the maxis berhad has received some complaints from the customers about its g service even though the quality of maxis service has been deemed to excellent in malaysia but the g service is yet to be enough stable to reached the customers expectation the g service of maxis often drops to edge and sometimes is very slow and even has no connection so we strongly recommend maxis to put more effort in developing the more stable and qualified g service to the customers other than that the g available place should be expanded in order to get more customers who stay at rural areas because nowadays the g is very important customers tend connect to internet wherever and whenever by using the g service so the stability of g will be the important criteria for customers in choosing the telecommunication service with a better g service and wider coverage maxis will have the competence to compete with the strong competitors for example p wimax is a competitor of maxis who offers cheaper packages  innovation in advertisement maxis bhd should expand the advertisement in other fields rather than only focus on the advertisement in the soccer games because not all the people are interested in football game the company should make its advertisement in a popular style in order to adapt to majority customers taste for example badminton is another popular game in the malaysia and maxis could apply the star effect advertisement strategy to advertise its products and services dato lee chong wei who is a popular badminton player in malaysia could be considered by maxis to make him become the spokesperson of the maxis berhad through his reputation maxis could obtain more subscribers besides that if the popular actors and singers could be a part in the maxis advertisement the younger customers could be attracted to subscribe the maxis service  involve in more social activities nowadays the reputation of a company is become more and more important in conducting business customers are concerning about the reputation of the company and not only the quality of products and services so we recommend maxis should involve more in the social activities and make the company has a good image for example the company could be a part in the environmental protection program to show that the company is concerning about our earth besides that to build higher reputation maxis berhad has to reinforce the link between the organization and public relation  improve the customer service customer service plays an important role in the business especially in the telecommunication industry with good customer service its able to retain the existing customers and attract more potential customers to subscribe the maxis services weve found that although the distribution of the maxis outlet is very wide and available in many places but not all the maxis outlet is able to provide the sufficient customer service for example some of the maxis centre is only able to let customer make the payment and deal with some small case and customers need to travel to urban areas to get further services for example the small maxis firm is unable to help the customer if the customer has loss his simcard and want and get back the number he might need to go to the maxis centre in order to get this service we recommend maxis to make the maxis centre t become onestop service in order to facilitate the customers and make them to be more satisfied with the maxis service  utilize pricing strategy to gain market share we know that maxis berhad is the first choice of telecommunication service of malaysian but many people subscribed digi berhad service as well this is because the digi offers extremely low price services compared to maxis so in order to gain more market share maxis berhad has to utilize the pricing strategy first maxis could make customer to feel that the price it charges is not very expensive effective pricing strategies are needed to be applied to deal with this matter maxis berhad could use more the psychological pricing strategy to give an emotion to customers that the price charges is reasonable for example the monthly subscription package of the new iphone maxis berhad offers the package with more expensive price compared to the digi berhad to deal with this maxis could lower down the monthly subscription fee but make the payment period longer this will be no different to the company but do make the customers have an emotion that is cheaper request removal if you are the original writer of this essay and no
