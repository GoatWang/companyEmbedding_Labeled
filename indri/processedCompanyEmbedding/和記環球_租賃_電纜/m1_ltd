creatop m m  consensus software awards m by bg™ from bowen  groves pty ltd product description m by bg™ is an enterprise resource planning erp software system designed for small to medium manufacturers including job shops custom and mixed mode manufacturers and make to order manufacturers m by bg™ provides total integration and automation from quoting through invoicing and unlike other systems m allows the manufacturer to simply and easily customize the system to suit their unique business processes maintaining their competitive edge developed for microsoft sql server and with a microsoft outlook look and feel m is an intuitive and user friendly system packed with innovative and powerful tools at the heart of the systems architecture is the concept of seamlessness  the ability to drag point and click from module to module without awkward transition points or file conversion m is a modular system so a manufacturer only has to purchase the modules that suit their business right now and as they grow they can add new features and functionality when they are required m has even been designed for the smallest organization where one person can do all tasks no departmenatlised task orientation and yet the design still is suited to medium and larger sized companies m is capable of handling true small to medium operations ms range of advanced productivity tools graphs calendars explorers wizards drill downs power search shortcuts and smart screen technology provides management intelligence data at a click of a button and the automation of tasks to increase user efficiency m design studio even lets you add new fields customise any input form and report giving companies the ability to make the system work for their business without changing any of their business processes m has been designed so there is no long and drawnout expensive implementation cycle the implementation tools coupled with the intuitive and familiar look and feel mean a company can be live and enjoying the benefits of the system within weeks sample screen shots figure   pie chart figure  organisation explorer  figure  drill down report                  click above

standards identified potential markets success in home or export markets  contact for more information geoff groves  ceo innovation the innovation in the functionality of m is what stands the system apart from the other products on the market today bowen  groves have focused the design of the system on delivering a system where the user can be more efficient and productive and this is achieved by focusing the depth of functionality on the simplest tasks whereas other systems take the most amount of time for simple and routine functions smart screen technology – the traditional design for systems is to operate in a resolution of x pixels and function with multiple screens m is designed to operate in a resolution of x pixels and automatically condenses the screen to only display to a user those fields that they actually require to carryout the operation no need like other systems to tab through the useless fields that are not required to be entered m will not display the sections that you don’t require based on the function that you are performing for example if you are creating a purchase order you have two types either a job purchase or an inventory purchase when you create the inventory purchase you don’t need the fields that link to the job so m will collapse that section of the data and the user will only see the fields that are required for an inventory purchase m smart screens can even be customised through m design studio so this technology can even be defined by the user based on their unique requirements this intelligent automation of expanding and collapsing fields based on a users operational requirements means ease of use and efficient operation navigation innovation  unlike other systems where a user needs to search for relevant data m has been designed with a state of the art navigation tree so every possible piece of data a user would require can be selected from the tree without having to search and open dozens of windows for example call up an organisation and you can now view contacts locations attachments leads quotes sales orders jobs pricing aging accounts and more search power  most systems allow you to search on one or two criterias not m you can have as many filters as you like no double entry  wizards have been designed throughout the system to pull data through so enter a quote to a prospect once and you can pull that data with the click of a button into a sales order job shipment and invoice integration  m integrates with everyday word processing spreadsheet and email functions so m will create follow up and appointments in your email or fax quotes directly from your pc you can even mail merge design studio  the most significant and innovative feature of m is that you can design m to suit your business unlike other systems where you fit the system this means a companies competitive advantage in their unique processes can be maintained m design studio allows a user to make the software work for them you can add new fields change any input form including moving objects around you can customize any report and all of this is maintained with every new upgrade hundreds more innovations have been added to m to make the system user friendly and efficient including such things as advanced productivity tools such as calendars wizards graphs drill down reports explorers approvals  warnings start page

groves and m are understanding customer requirements listening to customers industry knowledge technical knowledge support and professionalism an erp system is simply not just about innovative design it is the package of innovative design strength in ongoing development coupled with excellence in support and professional services ms ongoing development is driven by the customer all customers are encouraged to contribute their ideas for enhancements via direct communication with the support team at the annual user conference or the m user group we receive over  enhancement requests per quarter these are real ideas for new features and new functionality in september  m version  was released and this included three new modules and over  additional enhancements to various modules these are all the result of listening and responding to the customers the support system bowen  groves have put in place is absolutely world class it is designed for enquiries to be handled quickly and efficiently support is provided in three ways telephone modem dialin or internet bgsupportnet telephone support is provided via a toll free telephone hotline there is no automated phone system that places a customer in a queue a real person answers the call and can respond directly  of calls are solved within  minutes all calls received are logged and after a call is closed a fax or email is automatically sent to the caller to ensure that they are satisfied that the call is closed and it requests the caller to rate their satisfaction level in the past three months we took  calls and our average service rating was  out of  the bgsupportnet is an interactive support system where a customer can log on to the internet review open and closed calls support contracts log on new calls or

launched in april of  at national manufacturers week and in  ½ years we now have more than  customers spanning five countries whilst m was launched in australia first the design of the system was developed to suit the international marketplace with specific focus on meeting the needs of the usacanada and uk small to medium manufacturers in october of  m was launched in the usa and now accounts for more than  of our customers   in total ms development was focused on meeting the needs of small to medium manufacturers as well as meeting their future needs as they grow unlike our many competitors in the small to medium segment they are solely focused on meeting a small companies immediate needs but dont have the functionality to support their growth and thus as they grow they will have to change their erp system or add additional systems that are not integrated m provides the opportunity to add functionality that is fully integrated to the system at any time for example a manufacturer may just wish to start of with basic production and financials but later have the need for crm advanced production including revision control and serial numbering payroll point of sale or even internet based tracking and shopping m is truly a global product that has potential beyond just australia and the usa every country has small to medium jobshops and custom and mixed mode

up designing an interior wall that would rep⋯⋯lace the strength needed to carry the weight of the house above as the original foundation wall was failing once the new wood framed structural wall was in place and the house was again on solid footing we were able to focus on the water issue instead of a patch and quick fix the client agreed to excavate the perimeter of the foundation down to the weeping tile and install a waterproofing membrane we back filled with washed rock to facilitate drainage and topped the exterior system with layers of landscape fabric clay and black dirt allowing them to replant some of the shrubs along the side of the house inside once we knew it would be a dry space again the insulation and drywall was reinstalled   m construction ltd  finishing   。 ·  ·
