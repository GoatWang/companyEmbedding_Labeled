futures bright – the futures orange was dropped after many years by its ceo tom alexander in a bid to save its ailing fortunes from july  to  i am became the main slogan shortened from i am who i am because of everyone however subsidiary slogans will were used to describe the companys products and services for example i am more focus less fuzz was used to describe the samsung soul handsetcitation needed controversiesedit expansion to northern irelandedit in  orange faced difficulties when expanding into the northern ireland region of the united kingdom at the time oranges slogan was the futures bright the futures orange but to mention orange in such a context could be seen to refer to the orange order a controversial protestant loyalist organisation active in the region this could be offensive to the irish catholic population due to the ongoing sectarian violence between the two groups but only if they chose to take a slogan in such a way data protectionedit in  orange was found to be in breach of the data protection act  by the information commissioners office ico after complaints from customers about the use of their personal information orange has since agreed to reinforce the requirements of the act the company was also criticised in the press for its handling of personal data following complaints of orange customer data being used by independent mobile sales companies in the practice of slamming orange denied any involvement attempted price increasesedit in august  orange attempted to increase the cost of its services to customers already under contract users were informed that legally they were allowed to cancel their contract as this was a breach of contract orange reverted their decision and the price hikes did not go ahead in december  orange sent a text to its customer base to notify them that they were increasing monthly contract fees by just below rpi rates they imposed a  increase coming into effect on  january it was identified that the clause that supposedly allowed orange to increase by inflation midcontract clause  was flawed as it referenced a statistical office which no longer exists specifically orange referenced the all items index of retail prices published by the central statistical office in the monthly digest of statistics the complete terms and conditions are available here  and here orange maintain that their inaccurate wording in previous contracts was legally binding but chose to settle all known court cases brought against them on this issue two years later following its merger with tmobile the combined companies again signalled their intention to increase the agreed tariffs of existing pay monthly customers clause  has now changed to disallow the customer from cancelling their contract if we give you written notice to increase the charges as a percentage by an amount equal to or less than the percentage increase in the all items index of retail prices or any other statistical measure of inflation published by any government body authorised to publish measures of inflation from time to time and published on a date as close as reasonably possible before the date on which we send you written
