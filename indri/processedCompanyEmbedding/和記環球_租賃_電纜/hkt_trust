ratio can give a sense of the efficiency of a companys operating cycle or its ability to turn its product into cash companies that have trouble getting paid on their receivables or have long inventory turnover can run into liquidity problems because they are unable to alleviate their obligations because business operations differ in each industry it is always more useful to compare companies within the same industry acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry and are generally between  and  for healthy businesses the higher the current ratio the more capable the company is of paying its obligations a ratio under  suggests that the company would be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due at that point while this shows the company is not in good financial health it does not necessarily mean that it will go bankrupt  as there are many ways to access financing  but it is definitely not a good sign if all other things were equal a creditor who is expecting to be paid in the next  months would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio because a high current ratio means that the company is more likely to meet its liabilities which fall due in the next  months related terms total current assets total current liabilities quick ratio headlines no headline home  about   jobs   advertise    site map    term of use    privacy policy     rss
