the year end the contingent consideration of £m was paid with no further amounts due dividends paid during the year ended  march  absorbed £m of cash  £m this increase over the prior period arises

shareholdings in the company following the exercise of share options  pursuant to the stock exchange announcement during december  these funds were used by the company to make strategic purchases of its own shares there was a decrease to cash and cash equivalents during the year of £m this arises from a net reduction in the drawn element of the barclays revolving credit facility across the year to reduce interest charges  the company will continue to apply its treasury management policies to minimise the cost of finance whilst retaining flexibility to meet its growth strategies capital expenditure the company operates an asset light strategy and has low capital requirements therefore expenditure on fixed assets is low at  of revenue   business combinations  the strategy of the

longterm performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results liquidity risk the company seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably external funding facilities are managed to ensure that both shortterm and longerterm funding is available to provide shortterm flexibility whilst providing sufficient funding to the companys forecast working capital requirements credit risk the company extends credit to customers of various durations depending on customer creditworthiness and industry custom and practice for the product or service in the event that a customer proves unable to meet payments when they fall due the company will suffer adverse consequences to manage this the company continually monitors credit terms to ensure that no single customer is granted credit inappropriate to its credit risk additionally  of our customer receipts are by monthly direct debit the risk is further reduced by the customer base being spread across all industry and service sectors the top ten customers account for approximately  of revenues competitor risk the company operates in a highly competitive market with rapidly changing product and pricing innovations we are subject to the threat of our competitors launching new products in our markets including updating product lines before we make corresponding updates and development to our own product range this could render our products and services outofdate and could result in loss of market share to reduce this risk we undertake new product development and maintain strong supplier relationships to ensure that we have products at various stages of the life cycle competitor risk also manifests itself in price pressures which are usually experienced in more mature markets this results not only in downward pressure on our gross margins but also in the risk that our products are not considered to represent value for money the company therefore monitors market prices on an ongoing basis acquisition integration execution the company has set out that its strategy includes the acquisition of businesses where they are earnings enhancing the board acknowledges that there is a risk of operational disturbance in the course of integrating the acquired businesses with existing operations the

date which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities with the next financial year are discussed below key sources of estimation and uncertainty are ·      measuring the fair value of customer bases on acquisition ·      subsequent impairment of customer bases and ·      receivables   impairment of intangible assets the company determines whether intangible assets are impaired on at least an annual basis this requires an estimation of the value in use of the cashgenerating units to which the intangible value is allocated estimating a value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cashgenerating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows the main estimates used to measure the fair value of the customer bases on acquisition and to conduct the impairment review are ·      the churn rate turnover of customers ·      discount rate and ·      gross margins churn rates ranging between  and  are based upon actual historical churn rates of the revenue stream for each customer base the discount rate of  used to discount the cash flows is based upon the companys weighted average cost of capital wacc which is the recommended discount rate suggested by international financial reporting standards and is a calculated figure using actual input variables where available and applying estimates for those which are not such as the equity market premium gross margins of  are based upon actual margins achieved in previous years the actual outcomes have been materially equivalent the calculations are sensitive to any movement in the discount rate margin or churn rate and would therefore result in an impairment charge to the income statement a  change to the discount rate gross margin and churn rate would result in additional impairment charges of £nil £nil and £
