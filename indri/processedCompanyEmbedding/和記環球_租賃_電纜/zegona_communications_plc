company was launched via an ipo in march  with the objective of acquiring businesses in the european tmt sector with a buyfixsell strategy to deliver shareholder returns through fundamental business improvements our first acquisition was the purchase of telecable the leading telecommunications operator in the asturias region of spain zegona acquired telecable for eur million in august  our first full year of ownership has confirmed our view that telecable is a compelling investment driven by the companys market leading position and strong cash generation coupled with attractive dynamics in the spanish telecoms market and a recovery in the spanish economy during  zegona has continued to work closely with the telecable management team to further develop the business and the services it provides building on the early work done in  we have implemented a number of key strategic initiatives including  driving growth in consumer revenue with broadband speed upgrades and innovative tv services  enhancing the mobile experience for all customers by doubling data allowances and expanding the wifisfera wifi service  renewing the focus on business clients with a comprehensive change in management and product portfolio  delivering capex productivity improvements focused on sales distribution network maintenance and home installations beyond telecable we continue to see many attractive investment opportunities in asturias nationally in spain and across the broader european tmt landscape it is zegonas view that the market environment to execute our core buyfixsell strategy has never been better we are seeing a steady increase in the number of new opportunities and are confident that additional acquisitions satisfying our disciplined financial criteria will be identified telecable  performance telecables results in  were in line with our expectations and represent a strong performance across our key financial metrics of revenue and cash flow telecables total revenue for the year was eur million which represents  growth compared to  this revenue growth was driven by an impressive performance in the consumer mobile and business sectors with year on year growth of  and  respectively across the broader consumer sector performance was solid with  growth compared to  to counter the competitive nature in this sector the focus has been on upselling products and enhancing the overall value proposition to drive growth in customer lifetime value ebitda for the year was eur million which represents  growth compared to  because increases in revenue were broadly offset by the combined impact of three factors  the first year of a substantial investment in premium football content that we expect will generate returns in future years  higher mobile access costs from our legacy mobile access agreement that we expect will be substantially reduced when telecable transitions to its new agreement in the first half of  and  effective management of other costs such as handsets networks operations and headcount that delivered a  saving across these categories capex for the year decreased by  to eur million this was driven by strong cost control and a focus on effective capital expenditure key capex productivity improvements included increased online sales lower network costs and development of customer selfhelp and selfinstall programmes the combination of higher ebitda and lower capex delivered cash flow generation of eur million  growth compared to   audited results for telecable for the twelve months ended  december  consumer telecables consumer business generated revenue of eur million in  a  increase compared to  the growth in telecables high value quadplay customers and improved consumer arpu  growth from eur per month in  to a full year record of eur per month in  were important drivers of this revenue performance these increases more than offset the impact of a reduction in total customers resulting from short term promotional activity from other operators who have invested in deploying ftth in asturias in recent years this deployment now appears to be largely complete arpu growth was driven by a eur per month price increase for fixedline and bundled products in january  and a second price increase of eur per month in september these price increases were supported by improvements in the consumer proposition including doubling mobile data allowances doubling the minimum broadband speed to  mbps launching a highend  mbps broadband service and expanding the premium content available to telecable customers including significant investments in la liga and champions league football consumer mobile consumer mobile is a key area of growth for telecable consumer mobile revenue increased to eur million in  up  compared to  this significant increase was driven by a  growth in the number of postpaid lines offset by a  reduction in postpaid arpu resulting from lower outofallowance charges mobile penetration within telecables fixed consumer customers increased to  and quadplay penetration reached a record high of  during  in addition telecable continues to expand its wifisfera wifi service resulting in k connected customers at the end of  up  compared to  continuing these positive trends is an important part of zegonas strategy for telecable as we drive increased convergence across our customer base we expect consumer mobile to continue its strong growth given telecables still relatively low mobile penetration and the transformational effect of telecables new mobile access agreement this agreement will allow us to offer substantially improved converged customer propositions including g data services at a much lower cost than in  when it becomes effective in the first half of  business zegona places a high priority on growing telecables soho and enterprise businesses business revenue increased to eur million in  representing growth of  compared to  this revenue growth was driven by arpu growth of  and a  increase in the number of business customers rgu growth was  as each customer subscribed to more products on average the investment we are making in premium football content is supporting our business segment growth in particular in bars and restaurants we believe there is significant potential to grow business revenue  given telecables relatively low market share in asturias of only   capex in  capex was eur million compared to eur million in  while capex as a percentage of revenue in  was  which compares favourably with  in  this is a trend we expect to continue while telecable continues to make significant investments in its business to drive topline growth it has also succeeded in making substantial improvements in its capex productivity focusing more effectively on those higher priority developments which drive sustained business growth capex in  included customer premise equipment and installation costs of eur million sales commission costs of eur million and network and it costs of eur million other capex including ott wifisfera and oneoff projects was eur million  includes consumer mobile  arpu average revenue per user expressed as a monetary amount per month business and consumer arpu is fixed and mobile revenue adjusted revenue as defined in the section on nongaap measures in appendix h divided by the number of customers and divided by twelve postpaid arpu includes all postpaid mobile revenues also adjusted revenue as defined in the section on nongaap measures in appendix h divided by the number of customers and divided by twelve  includes business mobile  small office home office  market share in business broadband net debt telecables net debt was eur million as at  december  consisting of a eur million senior credit facility and eur million other debt offset by a cash balance of eur million this compares favourably with  where net debt was eur million zegona held an additional eur million of cash reducing zegonas total net debt to eur million as at  december  telecables senior credit facility is nonamortising with a bullet repayment due in august  telecable also has a eur million revolving credit facility which has never been drawn moodys credit rating telecables debt was assigned a b corporate family rating cfr by moodys in january  which was reviewed and reconfirmed in february  this rating continues to be in line with or better than many far larger european cable operators and is the highest rating of any european tmt company of telecables size moodys indepth review as part of its rating process confirmed the underlying strength of telecables business  telecable  outlook building on the financial performance and business improvements delivered during  zegona continues to have great confidence in telecables prospects telecable posted robust growth in both revenue and cash flow during  this performance was driven by a number of underlying factors that we expect will continue through  these include  robust spanish economy the spanish economy grew strongly in  with gdp increasing by   this was well ahead of the euro area average of  growth is expected to continue at a dynamic pace with forecasts projecting growth of  in   sustained industry price repair all major telecoms operators in spain began to increase consumer prices in  and price increases have continued through  and into  telecable successfully increased consumer prices twice during  and again in february  this was executed through our moreformore strategy whereby an enhanced product is offered for a slightly higher price  product and service enhancements telecable offers high quality products that have been continually enhanced since acquisition improvements delivered during  include increasing the minimum broadband speed to mbps doubling mobile data allowances offering the broadest suite of premium football content in the spanish market developing a k set top box and improving ott offerings these improvements have helped telecable to deliver record high arpu and increase the number of products supplied per customer in   innovative new mobile access agreement during  telecable signed an

financial statements  general information the consolidated financial statements of zegona communications plc the company or the parent and its subsidiaries collectively the group for the year ended  december  were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on  april  the company is incorporated in england and wales and domiciled in the united kingdom it is a public limited company with company number  and has its registered office at  buckingham street london wcn ef  significant accounting policies a basis of preparation the company was incorporated on  january  the consolidated financial statements represent the year ended  december  and have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and ifrs interpretations committee ifric interpretations as adopted by the european union and with those parts of the companies act  as applicable to companies reporting under ifrs the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with ifrs under the historical cost convention and are presented in euros the functional currency of the company is british pounds sterling the directors have chosen to present the consolidated financial statements of the group in euros as the companys operational subsidiary telecable de asturias sa has a functional and presentational currency of euros all values are rounded to the nearest thousand eur except when otherwise indicated b revenue and expenses revenue and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis ie when the actual flow of the goods and services they represent occurs regardless of when the resulting monetary or financial flow arises revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received less any discounts and taxes revenue revenue from sales of handsets is recognised when the group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods neither continuing managerial involvement nor effective control is maintained over the handsets and they do not form part of a bundled contract in the second half of  in the majority of cases this transfer occurred when handsets were delivered to distributors by our logistics operator previously no logistics operator was used to manage the distribution of handsets to distributors where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that have value to the customer on a stand alone basis the total contract consideration is allocated between those separate elements based on the amounts payable by customers under the terms of the contract where handsets are sold as part of a bundled contract any discounts allowed are recognised immediately with the remaining revenue recognised over the life of the contract as was the case in the majority of cases in the first half of  revenue associated with the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date provided that the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably the stage of completion is determined by the proportion of the minimum contract life that has been fulfilled group revenue is generated from the provision of services in connection with landline phones television broadband internet data and mobile phones for residential and corporate customers chiefly as bundled sales and also from phone interconnection services to other operators the group assesses its revenue agreements in line with specific criteria to determine whether it acts as principal or agent the group concluded that it acts as principal in all its revenue agreements traffic revenue both landline and mobile is recognised in the period during which it is earned regular monthly charges for services are taken to results on a straightline basis in the period during which the service was provided variable consumption revenue is recognised in the period during which it is earned and revenue from flatrate consumption is recognised in the period covered by the rate concerned interconnection revenue is recognised in the period during which phone traffic is generated  segmental analysis for management purposes the group is organised into two segments the telecable group which represents the activity of the telecable business in spain and a central costs segment which represents costs incurred by all zegona group entities supporting the corporate activities of the group the results of each segment are reported to the board which is considered to be the chief operating decision maker the codm the information presented to the board does not include a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities of each segment and as such this information has not been presented the codm considers an adjusted earnings measure adjusted ebitda as the principal measure of profitability of zegona which is considered to represent the segment result in accordance with ifrs  whilst service revenue can be further divided into different revenue streams the key metrics are headline revenue and ebitda which are kpis discussed by zegona management and reported to investors ebitda is not disaggregated further and is reported internally and externally on a full telecable basis therefore the directors consider the telecable results to represent one segment further information on reportable segments is set out below adjustments telecable

there are no major customers on which reliance is placed zegona uses adjusted ebitda in conjunction with other gaap and nongaap financial measures to assess its operating performance zegona believes it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted ebitda as a performance measure because it enhances the comparability of profit across businesses it is commonly used as the key metric for valuing tmt businesses in mergers and acquisition transactions and it is used by management for planning reporting and incentive purposes ebitda is operating profit excluding depreciation of property plant and equipment ppe and amortization of intangible assets as defined in our financial statements adjusted ebitda is ebitda excluding  impairment losses and losses on disposal of assets  long term management incentive compensation and share based payment expenses incentive costs  significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the group

indicators of impairment no such indicators were identified as at  december   impairment of goodwill and other assets with indefintite useful lives goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single telecable cgu which is also an operating and reportable segment for impairment testing the group performed its annual impairment review in december  the group considers all key performance indicators reported to management when reviewing for indicators of impairment in  there has been a reduction in the number of telecable customers but this has been offset by increases in prices and improvements in product mix such that telecable has been able to improve its core financial metrics compared to  there are therefore no indicators of impairment of goodwill ias  requires that an annual impairment review be conducted regardless of whether there are any indicators of impairment the recoverable amount of the telecable cgu has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets and forecasts approved by the board and senior management covering a five year period the projected cash flows have been updated to exclude the impact of any expansionary capital expenditure the pretax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is  and the cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a  growth rate this growth rate is in line with the longterm average growth rate for the spanish telecommunications industry as a result of the analysis there is substantial headroom and management did not identify any impairment key assumptions used in value in use calculations the value in use calculation for the telecable gcu is most sensitive to the following assumptions  rates used as direct inputs to the value in use calculation o discount rates o growth rates used to extrapolate cash forecasts beyond the forecast period  assumptions and conditions impacting of forecast cash flows o revenue growth over the forecast period as impacted by general economic conditions o revenue growth over the forecast period as impacted by the actions of competitors o cost and availability of football offerings rates used as direct inputs discount rates  discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to the cgu taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates the discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the group and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc takes into account both debt and equity the cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by investors the cost of debt is based on the interestbearing borrowings the group is obliged to service specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors the beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data adjustments to the discount rate are made to factor in the specific amount and timing of the future tax flows in order to reflect a pretax discount rate a rise in the pretax discount rate to  ie  would result in the headroom reducing to eur million a rise in the pretax discount rate to  ie  would result in the headroom reducing to zero growth rate estimates  the growth

cash flows revenue growth over the forecast period as impacted by general economic conditions  revenues in the cash flow projections are based on managements assessment of future revenues in normal economic conditions management acknowledges that revenue growth would be impacted in the event of a downturn in the general spanish economy to assess the impact on the calculated value in use revenues have been reforecast using various progressively more severe economic environments in all but the most extremely pessimistic forecasts no impairment is identified whilst the likelihood of the most pessimistic forecast is considered very remote revenue growth over the forecast period as impacted by actions of competitors  management have considered the impact of actions by competitors on forecast revenues for each reasonably plausible forecast no impairment has been identified cost and availability of key premium content  premium content are a significant part of the forecast cash flows management have considered both the impact of increasing costs of obtaining premium content rights with no corresponding increase in revenues and a scenario where broadcasting rights are not renewed the effect of reforecasting cash flows under these scenarios does not result in any impairment being identified  inventories inventories are chiefly composed of mobile handsets sim cards and

the total of all telecables tv customers at that date telecable believes the correct number is the number of customers with set top boxes able to receive premium content which total approximately  throughout the period telecable has engaged extensively with stakeholders including the cnmc rights holders and other operators and in the course of these discussions has reached an agreement that a correction should be made and is confident that the cnmc will issue an amended report in due course under the regulatory framework covering the distribution of certain premium content established by the cnmc the number of pay tv customers is used to allocate the cost of this content amongst all operators in spain as agreed in discussions with parties subject to the cost sharing agreement amending these statistics would result in amounts currently allocated and billed to telecable being allocated and billed to other operators the amended basis  some participants have already made payments on this amended basis in line with the above discussions in reporting the costs of this content in its financial statements telecable has assumed that the statistics will be corrected in accordance with the discussions held no additional liability was recorded in the financial statements as at  december  to ensure continuity of service in the period before the expected reallocation is made since  january  telecable has paid approximately eur million in excess of the amount it owes on the amended basis which is the amount that is expected to be reallocated to those operators who have not yet made payments on the amended basis in line with the agreement these payments have been recorded as an amount receivable from the rights holder since telecable expects to recover them following the issuance of an amended report by the cnmc and a reallocation of amounts to other operators by the rights holder telecable believes it is highly probable that the cnmc will issue an amended report and amounts will be reallocated to other operators by the rights holder with the eur million paid since  january  will be recovered if the cnmc does not issue an amended report telecable has estimated that this eur million would be the maximum possible obligation  post balance sheet events there have been no material post balance sheet events that would require disclosure or adjustment to these financial statements other than the payment of the second interim dividend in lieu of a final dividend for  which was declared on  february  and paid on  march  at a rate of p per share totaling gbp h nongaap measures certain discussions and analyses set out in this announcement include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap such as ifrs this information along with comparable gaap measurements is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring operating performance ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities management uses these financial measures along with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in evaluating operating performance and value creation nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with gaap nongaap financial measures as reported may not be comparable with similarly titled amounts reported by other companies in the following sections we set out our definitions of the following nongaap measures and provide reconciliations to relevant gaap measures  adjusted revenue  ebitda and adjusted ebitda  capex  adjusted cash flow zegona believes that in order to provide users of this report with a meaningful understanding of telecables performance the full year of  should be compared with the full year of  in addition to a reconciliation to the nearest gaap equivalent for the full year  we also provide the same reconciliation for the relevant measures for the performance of the telecable business both for the full year as discussed in this document and the amounts for the postacquisition period that were reported in our annual report for  adjusted revenue adjusted revenue is statutory revenue after adjusting for certain items that together in the opinion of zegona result in a more meaningful understanding of underlying performance that properly reflects those items that are within the control of the business  interconnection and portability revenues these are required to be included within revenue under ifrs with an offsetting cost recorded within cost of sales however they are not within the control of the business interconnection rates are set by the relevant regulatory body and revenues earned are ultimately a function of the level of inbound and outbound activity on telecables networks compared to other networks  certain marketing campaign related revenues these are included within other income under ifrs however they are within the control of the business a reconciliation of adjusted revenue to the closest equivalent gaap measure statutory revenue is provided below   telecable    eurm pre  full year acquisition group consolidated     adjusted

and adjusted ebitda zegona uses adjusted ebitda in conjunction with other gaap and nongaap financial measures to assess its operating performance zegona believes it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted ebitda as a performance measure because it enhances the comparability of profit across businesses it is commonly used as the key metric for valuing tmt businesses in mergers and acquisition transactions and it is used by management for planning reporting and incentive purposes ebitda is operating profit excluding depreciation of property plant and equipment ppe and amortisation of intangible assets as defined in our financial statements adjusted ebitda is ebitda excluding  impairment losses and losses on the disposal of assets loss on disposal of ppe  long term management incentive compensation and share based payment expenses incentive costs  significant items that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the group significant project costs as disclosed in note  of the  annual report these are typically identifiable costs incurred in the course of mergers and acquisition transactions because adjusted ebitda does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance it has inherent limitations as a performance measure to compensate for these limitations we present adjusted ebitda in conjunction with other gaap and nongaap performance measures adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a gaap measure of operating performance a reconciliation of

considered to be a good proxy for cash capital expenditure during the year zegona believes it is both useful and necessary to report capex as it is a key metric used in valuing tmt businesses and in
