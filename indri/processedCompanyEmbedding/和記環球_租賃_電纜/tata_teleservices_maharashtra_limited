nov   harrasing for non payment i had taken an internet connection from tata tele services in october  i had chosen a limited usage plan of monthly rental of rs  and my credit limit was set on rs  as it was my new connection after using it for few days i got a call from the representative of tata saying that i have crossed my usage limit and current bill is around rs  hence kindly make the payment at your earliest to continue the service smoothly i immediately told them to make a note that its your mistake that neither you have not informed me when i reached at my credit limit nor you have discontinued the connection as soon as i crossed my limit then i asked tata representative to define me the meaning of credit limit because if my credit limit is  rs then where were you so far and waiting for my billing meter to reach so high because i was in a state of mind that my usage are under my credit limit then he agreed and said all right you pay rs  which is your limit and allow me to put you in a unlimited usage plan then i agreed but in the next month nothing was changed neither my plan nor my unpaid outstandings finally they disconnected the connection despite of solving the issue and stopped communicating after few weeks some other representative called me and said sir your bill is outstanding so kindly pay at your earliest then i explained him that i dont have outstanding dues its a issue which was left unsolved by ur some other representative then this representative asked me to provide the details of the issue and assured me to solve this issue with the help of his seniors but after that he never came back to discuss the issue same way after couple of weeks some other representative called me up saying sir your bill is outstanding and please pay i explained him again the same way like i did to the earlier representative since then so many representative have called me to make the payment and i have given my time to them n told them the same issue to be solved but non of them have tried to sort out this issue and never called back today i got a call from no  saying he is an advocate from tees hazari court and calling me to either pay my outstanding dues of tata tele or be ready to face the legal action which will cause me lots of money and i will have to comer there to attend the hearing in tees hazari court i tried to put my side to him but he didnt listen to me at all and said are you going to pay your bill or not else be ready for the legal action i request you to take this complaint for not resolving the issue since so long
