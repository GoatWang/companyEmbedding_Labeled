dec   at pm while comcasts nasdaqcmcsa universal pictures had a record year at the box office with three films  minions furious  and jurassic world all topping  billion in global box office the film studio was also responsible for the companys single worst product of  thats impressive from a company that saw its nbc network deliver wesley snipes in the player its also notable that universal which also had hits with pitch perfect  train wreck straight outta compton and more put out a movie that failed as badly as by the sea did that clunker despite starring angelina jolie and brad pitt managed just  million in global box office while earning a fairly wretched  on rotten tomatoes by the sea as poorly received as it was was not comcasts worst product of the year though the offending winner did come from universal it was a movie and its existence and execution were truly outrageous its a remake of whatremaking a cartoon thatran for a few years in the late s and was never a hit seems like an odd choice but thats exactly what universal did with jem and the holograms of course instead of even roughly using the plot from the original show which featured a hologramcreating computer turning a mildmannered business owner into the very glam singer jem the movie simply borrowed the character name that alienated whatever fan base there may have been for the mostly forgotten character source universal still with a budget that was estimated to be around  million according to imdb it seemed as if universal was taking very little risk here but in addition to being one of the worst reviewed movies of the year scoring a dreadful  on the tomatometer which compiles reviews from approved critics jem managed to lose money even as it was made for just  million the film earned only  million in global box office according to boxofficemojocom add in advertising and marketing costs  and there was a decent push for the movie in the united states  and the lowbudget film racked up some decent losses patrick dunn who reviewed the film for the detroit news giving it a generous d sums up everything wrong with the movie in his review jem attempts to update a property thats been defunct and essentially forgotten since the late s he wrote hardcore fans wont find much of the jem they loved under the movies achingly hip millennial trappings while young newcomers will be left wondering what a robot has to do with a rock band this was a movie that pleased nobody while the money it lost is essentially a rounding error for the film studio it still shows that even in a hitfilled year its possible to deliver films that both critics and audiences despise putting it in perspectivethe fact that were even talking about jem as comcasts worst product of  shows you what a great year the company had it did have a few disappointments such as the underperforming ted  and nbcs ratings failure the player but the companys dreadful film wasnt nearly as big a bomb as a movie such as walt disneys nysedis tomorrowland that summer dud not only cost nearly  million to make which was about the same as its global boxoffice take but it will also lose the mouse house  million to  million according to cinemablend the film which was supposed to kick off a franchise arguably also tarnishes the tomorrowland section of the disney theme parks though its possible the film came and went so fast that few people noticed comcast and universal certainly failed with jem and the holograms delivering a lousy movie that lost money but compared with what happened to disney it was a minor hiccup a lesson learnedperhaps the failure of jem and the holograms will prevent other illfated cinematic reboots of barely known cartoons if this debacle saves the world from jabberjaw the motion picture grape ape the movie or magilla gorilla unleashed then this lousy product will have done the world a service comcast and its entertainment brands had a very good year jem was a failure but that does not in any way take away from its record year at the box office if there can be good failures this was one it was not a disneystyle overreach it was a modestly budgeted film that simply didnt connect thats the best kind of failure you can have in the movie industry daniel kline has no position in any stocks mentioned he would actually watch a grape ape movie the motley fool owns shares of and

companys toptier franchise films were its best products in  daniel b kline tmfdankline dec   at pm while comcast nasdaqcmcsa had its problems in  its universal pictures segment had an unprecedented year specifically with franchise films its not that other segments of the business struggled cable was strong despite cordcutting fears and even nbc put up strong numbers but more than any new cable or internet product or even any of nbcs new hit shows comcasts best product in  was clearly its blockbuster franchise movies  this was a year when the company not only had hits but it also produced films that either created or reinvigorated franchises that makes movies including jurassic world minions furious  and  shades of grey more important than any other product the company created its not just about their value this year but their value moving forward these films aside from grey are practically annuities that will pay off not just in future box office receipts but also in toys themepark rides video games and more how good a year was itthough disneys nysedis star wars the force awakens could help its parent studio make a late push universal looks to have locked up the united states boxoffice crown for  with nearly  billion in ticket sales as of dec  according to boxofficemojocom that gives it  of the market well ahead of disneys buena vista label which trails with about  billion or  and the company didnt just do well in the united states it also had three films  minions jurassic world and furious   that earned more than  billion each globally the first time any studio has ever done that the company claimed in a press release with a quarter left to go in the year that left comcasts movie studio with a  increase in revenue to  billion compared with  billion in  operating cash flow also increased  to  billion compared with  million in the first nine months of  it was a big year but the reason its movies were comcasts best products in  is more due to what they will produce than what theyve made so far source universal its a banner year for franchisesin addition to minions jurassic world furious  and  shades of grey universal also had sequelworthy hits with pitch perfect  and maybe even amy schumers train wreck in addition to simply continuing the series with new movies most of these films will also pay off with rides at the companys theme parks and licensed products specifically the companys three billiondollar hits all lend themselves well to brand expansion minions and the fast  furious franchise have already been adapted as themepark rides as has the earlier jurassic park film renewed interest in these franchises should drive more people to the companys theme parks in  and beyond none of this was guaranteedat the beginning of the year it was easy to make a case that any or even all of these films would fail minions was a spinoff from the popular despicable me series and dreamworks animation struggled with its attempt to spin off penguins of madagascar from its madagascar series jurassic world was also a risk because it was essentially a reboot and furious  was not only the seventh film in the series but its production was also rocked by the death of star paul walker pitch perfect  was also a risk because the first one was not that big a hit and grey was a wild card because of its racy subject matter the fact that all of these movies hit massively was an unprecedented success and more than made up for stumbles such as ted  and the illfated jem and the holograms reboot this will be a tough year for universal and comcast to repeat but owning so many established franchises takes a lot of the guess work out of its film division these are now franchises that can be penciled in to its release slate every couple of years thats a formula disney has used to make its film business a sure thing and its one universal has done well to copy daniel kline has no position in any stocks mentioned he is not familiar with
