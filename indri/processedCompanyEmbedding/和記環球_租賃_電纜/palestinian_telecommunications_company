world bank report  february  question of palestine home  permalink  about unispal  search follow unispal rss twitter source world bank february  the world bank group telecommunication sector note in the palestinian territories missed opportunity for economic development note for the palestinian ministry of telecommunications and informationtechnology  taptasbb  executive summary the telecommunications sector assessment note in the palestinian territories is a knowledge product prepared by the world bank in response to a specific request from the palestinian ministry of telecommunications and information technology mtit to assess the performance of the telecommunications sector identify specific issues and make recommendations for further development and reform main findings the oslo framework the reference agreement between the israeli and palestinian counterparts to support economic development and stability in key economic sectors has failed to deliver its promise of an independent telecommunications sector in the palestinian territories according to the principles of the oslo agreement israel recognizes that the palestinian side has the right to build and operate separate and independent communication systems and infrastructures including telecommunication networks a television network and a radio network several resolutions of the international telecommunications union confirm the right of the palestinian people to have access to an independent telecommunications network the principles of the oslo agreement with respect to the telecom sector remain valid however its provisions are not applied this is presenting enormous challenges for palestinian telecom operators a clear detriment to the palestinian consumer a fiscal loss for the palestinian authority and an overall delay for sector development the joint technical committee jtc under oslo intended to be a regular technical nonpolitical platform to address bilateral issues has shown inadequate and ineffective performance and progress since  on bilateral issues has been limited • the lack of spectrum is a significant constraint to the development of the industry in late november  an agreement for a limited release of frequencies to palestinian operators to launch g services has been signed if implemented the agreement would finally allow palestinian operators to introduce mobile broadband using g about eight years after their initial request the agreement would still place the palestinian operators at a competitive disadvantage as israeli operators have g and g capabilities and are able to attract higher value customers as the mena region is moving towards g the recent agreement on the release of frequencies can hardly be celebrated as a success— although it does represent a first step forward combined with other restrictions the delay in mobile broadband negatively affects internet development • the second mobile operator wataniya cannot fully play its competitive role for the mobile market its operations in the west bank suffered a twoyear delay due to israeli restrictions on releasing the spectrum the situation for gaza consumers is worse as wataniya still cannot start its operations due to restrictions on accessing spectrum and importing civil material • the presence of widespread unauthorized activity by israeli operators in the west bank with mobile broadband capabilities israeli operators have g capabilities since  and g since  has the effect of creating unfair competition at the expense of palestinian operators which cannot even deliver g services depending on sources israeli operators may currently capture up to  of the west bank market in volume — ie number of subscribers the israeli market share in value — ie measured by the total sales — is even higher as israeli operators capture high valueadded palestinian customers by providing g and g other constraints have a negative impact on sector performance including i restrictions on the import of equipment for telecom and ict companies ii restriction of movement of goods and people within area c that impedes the deployment and maintenance of infrastructure and iii the requirement by israel that palestinian operators go through an israeliregistered company to access international links some domestic regulatory and competition issues persist chief among them the strengthening of the regulatory framework with — ideally —the creation of an independent regulatory agency they still present an important reason in addition to unilateral and bilateral issues for inadequate sector performance however some achievements are substantial when compared with other countries in mena that have yet to introduce similar reforms and compared to the situation in  • with the issue of a second mobile license to operator wataniya the authorities have introduced a mobilefocused competitor enjoying de jure rights on equal footing with incumbent operator paltel paltel and wataniya are robust companies with deep knowhow in the sector technology proficiency excellent commercial skills and solid investors these companies are essential assets for the economic development of the palestinian territories if unilateral and bilateral constraints are alleviated chief among them the release by israeli operators of spectrum for g and g and the lifting of israeli restrictions on the import of equipment for wataniya in gaza they could make a substantial contribution to the development of the palestinian territories • the palestinian authorities allow facilitiesbased isps wherein a local isp can acquire a broadband license and become a broadband operator as a result local entrepreneurs can acquire rights and directly invest in the development of broadband infrastructure at access level this has been a factor of success for the development of broadband in other emerging regions especially in eastern europe few countries in mena have adopted this liberal approach which is the norm in europe and other regions this achievement is noteworthy • palestinian isps with a broadband license can use alternative infrastructure built by nontelecommunications operators in accordance to the law and relevant regulations for example the fiber optics infrastructure of jdeco a jerusalem utility company is used by at least one isp jdeco may be willing to lease infrastructure to other operators • mtit has also introduced competition in the volp and wifi markets by introducing new licenses for the introduction of competition through the award of mobile and broadband licenses to be successful for the palestinian territories the overall domestic regulatory framework needs to be strengthened despite the achievements mentioned above there is still the critical need to issue regulations to tackle the dominant position of paltel in selected segments and of unauthorized israeli operators there is an active and pressing debate on the need of a new law and on the introduction of an independent regulator the introduction of an independent regulatory authority reflects good international practice and should be considered as a priority regardless of the timing of the creation of an independent regulator however the regulatory framework is lacking a minimum regulatory package of key regulations that support competition in in advanced markets for example the regulatory framework should be strengthened through a package of regulations to address dominance and potential anticompetitive risks such as i limited access to essential infrastructures in the fixed broadband market ii onnet  offnet price differentiation in the mobile market and iii fixed and mobile crosssubsidizing there are specific additional issues of regulatory and institutional uncertainty in gaza preventing the development of the telecom sector • any company applying for a telecom license in the west bank must go again through a whole new licensing process in gaza this generates inefficiencies and costs • several counterparts mentioned that gaza authorities are levying tax on telecom companies while the principle of taxing telecom companies can be legitimate any fiscal revenues should be managed directly by the pa or by a dedicated fund such as a universal service access fund • mtit does not have control over the palestinian national internet naming authority pnina —and more specifically over the pnina servers — which is located in gaza is the official domain registry for the palestinian country code topleveldomain ps while the absence of mtit control over pnina does not currently prevent palestinian companies to register and operate a website mtit should have control over this authority the impact of unilateral and bilateral issues as well as domestic issues on the performance of the telecommunications sector is compelling • the price of fixed and mobile services is still high and mobile data is particularly expensive especially compared with the offers of unauthorized israeli operators • a highlevel possibly conservative estimation of the foregone value due to lasting effects of unilateral and bilateral issues as well as domestic issues is provided based on a benchmarking with peer markets the total revenue loss for the palestinian mobile sector during the last three years  ranges from us  to  million the revenue loss directly attributable to the absence of g is between us  and  million and the total  value added tax fiscal loss for the palestinian authority is between us  and us  million the direct impact represents up to  of the gdp over the last three years figure  total revenue loss over the last three years  for palestinian mobile operators due to the absence of g and other bilateral and domestic issues source world bank calculation in short compared to the  situation assessed in the world bank telecommunications sector note world bank  there has been very limited progress on the bilateral side and noticeable progress on the domestic side on the bilateral side spectrum issues emerged as the most important bottleneck for the sector in the context of an industry that has strongly evolved towards the use of radio resources for data communications the creation of an independent regulator remains the most important domestic priority but in some areas sector liberalization liberal licensing regime the authorities have taken positive steps that most countries in the region have still to embrace most of the issues identified in the current note were already mentioned one way or another in  and a highlevel assessment of the progress achieved during the last  years is provided in the table below table  highlevel summary of progress and stagnation since  recommendations on bilateral issues revive the jtc platform to address bilateral issues specific areas of focus include a comprehensive and longterm agreement on spectrum beyond the current agreement on g and including g spectrum as well as spectrum for network backhauling and other wireless broadband access technologies ensuring the palestinian operators the right to develop independent facilitiesbased networks and if they wish accessing shared passive infrastructure facilities review the mechanisms for the functioning of the jtc to ensure greater trust efficiency and openness some suggestions to explore include • a commitment to meet on a scheduled and regular basis whatever the political context on both sides • the inclusion of a trusted and independent third party with legal and technical expertise to review requests and proposals from both side and provide suggestions where relevant • the commitment to i not disclose sensitive or preliminary proposal and information ii and conversely to publish public reports and updates on the work and progress of the jtc release g and g spectrum competition in the mobile market has been the driver of mobile market growth and innovation in all markets including in distressed post conflict environments and releasing additional spectrum would provide benefits to palestinian residential and corporate endusers leaving a mobilemonopoly market structure in gaza is unhealthy for competition and gaza consumers the absence of gg spectrum assigned to palestinian operators is also hurting palestinian consumers the israeli authorities have provided a proposal to allocate dedicated spectrum to the palestinian operators as well as spectrumon a shared principle on the mhz band a full allocation of spectrum resources beyond the g spectrum should be negotiated lift israeli constraints on the layout of microwave links and the import of civil and telecom material —particularly in gaza some options include • streamlining the administrative procedure for security clearance with stable objective transparent and nondiscriminatory criteria to be fulfilled • palestinian telecom and ict companies providing all the needed clearance forms and proofs • israeli authorities monitoring the use of civil and telecom material— particularly in gaza — with the possible involvement of a trusted thirdparty performing a detailed audit on a regular basis to ensure all security concerns are dealt with mitigate the effect of unauthorized telecom activity the issue of unauthorized israeli telecom activity in the west bank has been present through the implementation of the oslo agreement two measures can address this issue • palestinian operators should be able to access similar resources as israeli operators in order to be on the same competition ground this includes accessing sufficient spectrum to deploy independent g and glte systems which can be shared with israeli operators on a voluntary basis this is a top priority for action • an ideal cooperation between israeli and palestinian authorities would limit the coverage of israeli operators in the west bank this includes the review of telecom equipment deployed eg microcells with a smaller coverage radius can limit the coverage compared to macrocells however the track record especially of the jtc suggests skepticism as to the reach of a solution to limit coverage recommendations on domestic regulatory and competition issues create an independent regulator the creation of an independent regulator ptra is the top domestic priority with the setting up of a regulatory framework in line with international best practices the regulatory framework shall ensure an objective transparent and nondiscriminatory approach with the industry supported by openness and public consultations implement the telecom law the note also urges that palestinian counterparts to implement the existing law without delay or introduce amendments to ensure it is consistent with global best practices resolve several legal and institutional issues affecting the sector with a minimum regulatory package including • the monitoring of the market with the institution of an ict observatory • the introduction and enhancement of regulatory tools such as market observatory market definition identification of significant market power smp remedies definition and enforcements monitoring and sanctions • the enforcement of reference interconnection offers rios to provide a more dynamic transparent nondiscriminatory and cost oriented wholesale market • the assistance in the settingup of an ex post competition department or authority to complement the ex ante regulatory approach to monitor and approve potential mergers and prevent potential anticompetitive behaviors enhance capacity and skills the legitimacy and efficiency of mtit and the tobecreated ptra must be supported by the continuing recruitment of skilled workers to keep up with market developments and complex regulatory tools this remains a challenge as the labor market is small and the salaries in the public sector are lower than in the private sector   cf the following itu resolutions resolutions  and  from the plenipotentiary conference pp resolution  from the world telecommunication development conference wtdc resolution  from the world radio communication conference wrc  this has also impacted wataniyas business plan which has an open claim against the palestinian authority asking for part of its license proceeds to be waived given the limited deployment of its operations compared to the rights under its license  additional fiscal revenues are not estimated in this note such as corporate taxes  although the economic impact is marginal palestinian operators should also limit their signal reach
