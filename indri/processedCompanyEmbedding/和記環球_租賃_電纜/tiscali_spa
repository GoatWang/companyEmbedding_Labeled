emails hi bazer   have you set your email client to leave a copy of your emails on the server if you dont then when you access your emails through your email client it will download the emails to your pc and remove them from the server clearing the inbox in webmail   chris  likes reply bazer wizz kid mark as new bookmark subscribe subscribe to rss feed highlight print email to a friend report

from your posts that one of the email applications you are using is microsoft outlook try using the following settings for outgoing email account type imap accountserver smtptalktalknetport encryption tlsauthentication usernamepassword in response to ocechris question have you set your email client to leave a copy of your emails on the server you said yes of course that seems to indicate you are using a pop type account if so then emails sent using an email application are only saved locally and not on the server in order to synchronize all mail folders you should use an imap type account

suggest dont work only port  using a pop server  fyi you can synchronise mail with a pop server always has worked in the past  and all emails i wanted to keep on the tiscali server from   other people are having problems just that talktalk want admit there is a problem  likes reply nigel wise owl mark as new bookmark subscribe subscribe to rss feed highlight print email to a friend report

been selected sent emails are not uploaded to the server downloaded from the server or synchronized yes the settings that i posted only work for an imap type account i have edited the post to clarify that for anyone looking at it it appears that i missed it out when i copied from my post here httpcommunitytalktalkcouktmyemailemailmphighlighttruem  i have tested the settings for imap using
