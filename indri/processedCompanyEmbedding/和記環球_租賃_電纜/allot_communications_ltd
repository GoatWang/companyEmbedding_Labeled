involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks described below together with the financial and other information contained in this annual report before deciding to invest in our ordinary shares if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition and results of operations would suffer in this case the trading price of our ordinary shares would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment the risks described below are not the only ones we face additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations risks relating to our business we have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future in  we had a net loss of  million we have had a history of net losses in all prior fiscal years since our inception other than in  and  our net losses in  were a result of an increase in the company’s costs due to the last two acquisitions and due to the decrease in the company’s revenues our net losses in  were a result of expenses related to the settlement of approximately  million in grants from office of the chief scientist of the ministry of economy formerly the ministry of industry trade and labor or the office of the chief scientist our net losses in  were caused or exacerbated by losses resulting from our realized losses and impairment charges related to auctionrate securities which we have subsequently sold we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may incur losses in the future if we do not generate sufficient revenues we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in our market who offer or may in the future offer competing technologies          we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive sector of the networking technology market with large incumbent companies having significant market share and established relationships with service providers we face significant competition from router and switch infrastructure companies such as cisco systems inc telefonaktiebolager lm erricson and huawei technologies co ltd which integrate functionalities into their platforms addressing some of the problems that our products address our competitors have also identified the potential market opportunity offered by the largest service providers referred to as tier  operators and we therefore face intense competition in this portion of our market our principal competitors in the field of standalone intelligent policy enforcement and traffic management products enabled by dpi technology are sandvine inc and procera networks inc we also face competition from companies that offer partial or alternative solutions addressing limited aspects of the challenges facing broadband providers such as network monitoring or security        our competitors may announce new products services or enhancements that better meet the needs of customers or changing industry requirements or may offer alternative methods to achieve customer objectives one of our direct competitors cisco systems is substantially larger than we are and has significantly greater financial sales and marketing technical manufacturing and other resources as the mobile dpi market has grown new competitors have entered and may continue to enter the market the entry of new competitors into our market for example f networks and acquisitions of our existing competitors by companies with significant resources and established relationships with our potential customers could result in increased competition and harm to our business increased competition may cause price reductions reduced gross margins and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operations we depend on one or more significant customers and the loss of any such significant customer could harm our results of operations the loss of any significant customer or a significant decrease in business from any such customer could harm our results of operations and financial condition in addition revenues from individual customers may fluctuate from time to time based on the timing and the terms under which further orders are received and the duration of the delivery and implementation of such orders we derived  and  of our total revenues in  and  respectively from one global tier  mobile operator group in  we derived  of our total revenues from three tier  mobile and fixed operators the revenues derived from each of these three operators were higher than  from our total revenues industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results our market may be subject to industry consolidation as companies attempt to maintain or strengthen their positions in an evolving industry are unable to continue their operations or are acquired for example some of our current and potential competitors have made or have been reported as considering making acquisitions or have announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide many of the same services that we provide to both the service provider and enterprise markets we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations demand for our products may be impacted by government regulation of the telecommunications industry service providers are subject to government regulation in a number of jurisdictions in which we sell our products there are several proposals in the united states europe and elsewhere for regulating service providers’ ability to prioritize applications in their networks advocates for regulating this industry claim that collecting premium fees from certain “preferred” applications would distort the market for internet applications in favor of larger and betterfunded content providers they also claim that this would impact end  users who already purchased broadband access only to experience response times that differ based on content provider opponents believe that content providers who support bandwidthintensive applications should be required to pay service providers a premium in order to support further network investments in august  the united states federal communications commission the “fcc” issued a ruling prohibiting comcast the secondlargest broadband provider in the united states from delaying certain peertopeer traffic on its network comcast filed an appeal of the ruling in september   in april  a federal appeals court ruled that under current law the fcc had limited power over web traffic  in december  the fcc adopted rules which would give it regulatory power over internet service providers in order to prevent them from blocking or unreasonably discriminating against web content services or applications in  verizon and other broadband companies challenged the fcc’s rules in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in january  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit overturned the fcc’s antiblocking and antidiscrimination rules saying the agency overreached in barring broadband providers from slowing or blocking selected web traffic  despite this decision demand from service providers for the traffic management and subscriber management features of our products could be adversely affected if regulations prohibit or limit service providers from managing traffic on their networks a decrease in demand for these features could adversely impact sales of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operations        demand for our valueadded products such as video caching and optimization and parental control may be lower than anticipated our valueadded products offer customers additional tools to increase the efficiency of their networks or help them derive additional revenues from their end customers with our acquisition of ortiva wireless inc “ortiva” and oversi networks ltd “oversi” in  we enhanced our valueadded products by introducing video caching products and optimization products among other valueadded products the industry and market for such services is still developing we cannot provide any assurance that demand for such products will continue or grow or that we will be able to generate revenues from such sales at the levels we anticipate or at all any inability to sell or maintain our valueadded products may lead to commercial disputes with our customers and to lengthy implementation processes and increased spending on technical solutions all of which may negatively impact our results of operations our revenues and business will be harmed if we do not keep pace with changes in broadband applications and with advances in technology  including through significant investment we will need to invest heavily in the continued development of our technology in order to keep pace with rapid changes in applications and increased broadband network speeds and with our competitors’ efforts to advance their technology our ability to develop and deliver effective product offerings depends on many factors including identifying our customers’ needs technical implementation of new services and integration of our valueadded products with our customers’ existing network infrastructure while we will continue to introduce innovative valueadded products we cannot provide any assurance that any new products we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have with our existing products designers of broadband applications that our products identify and manage are using increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection and management by network operators even if our products successfully identify a particular application it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between different types of traffic belonging to a single application accordingly we face significant challenges in ensuring that we identify new applications and new versions of current applications as they are introduced without impacting network performance especially as networks become faster this challenge is increased as we seek to expand sales of our products in new geographic territories because the applications vary from country to country and region to region our business and revenues will be adversely affected if we fail to address our customers’ needs in particular geographic markets or if we fail to develop enhancements to our products in order to keep pace with advances in technology the network equipment market is subject to rapid technological progress and to compete  we need to achieve widespread market acceptance the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards to compete we need to achieve widespread market acceptance developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for and sales of our products and could cause our products to become obsolete which may result in inventory write downs alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the technology on which we have based our product architecture we can give no assurance that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technology or devices will not supplant our technology and products        we need to increase the functionality of our products and offer additional features and value  added products in order to maintain or increase our profitability the market in which we operate is highly competitive and unless we continue to enhance the functionality of our products and add additional features our competitiveness may be harmed and the average sale prices for our products may decrease decreases in sale prices generally result from the introduction by competitors of competing products and from the commoditization and increasing popularity of dpi technology to counter this trend we endeavor to enhance our products by offering higher system speeds additional features and value  added products such as additional security  video functions and support for additional applications and enhanced reporting tools we may also need to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs at a rate equal to or greater than the rate at which selling prices decline if we are unable to reduce costs or offer increased functionally and features our profitability may be adversely affected sales of our products to large service providers can involve a lengthy sales cycle which may impact the timing of our revenues and result in us expending significant resources without making any sales our sales cycles to large service providers including carriers mobile operators and cable operators are generally lengthy because these endcustomers consider our products to be capital equipment and undertake significant testing to assess the performance of our products within their networks furthermore many of our product and service arrangements with our customers provide that the final acceptance of a product or service may be specified by the customer in such instances we do not recognize the revenue until all acceptance criteria have been met as a result we often invest significant time from initial contact with a large service provider until it decides to incorporate our products in its network and we may not be able to recognize the revenue from a customer until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied we may also expend significant resources in attempting to persuade large service providers to incorporate our products into their networks without success even after deciding to purchase our products the initial network deployment of our products by a large service provider may last up to one year we have also experienced longer sales cycles as a result of the global economic downturn and uncertainty particularly in europe if a competitor succeeds in convincing a large service provider to adopt that competitor’s product it may be difficult for us to displace the competitor because of the cost time effort and perceived risk to network stability involved in changing solutions as a result we may incur significant expenses without generating any sales which could adversely affect our profitability the complexity and scope of the solutions and services we provide to larger service providers is increasing larger projects entail greater operational risk and an increased chance of failure the complexity and scope of the solutions and services we provide to larger service providers is increasing the larger and more complex such projects are the greater the operational risks associated with them these risks include failure to fully integrate our products into the service provider’s network or with thirdparty products our dependence on subcontractors and partners and on effective cooperation with thirdparty vendors for the successful and timely completion of such projects if we encounter any of these risks we may incur higher costs in order to complete the project and may be subject to contractual penalties resulting in lower profitability in addition the project may demand more of our management’s time than was originally planned and our reputation may be adversely impacted we depend on third parties to market sell install and provide initial technical support for our products for a material portion of our business we depend on third  party channel partners such as distributors resellers oems and system integrators to market and sell a material portion of our products to endcustomers in  approximately  of our revenues were derived from channel partners  our channel partners are also responsible for installing our products and providing initial customer support for them as a result we depend on the ability of our channel partners to successfully market and sell our products to these endcustomers we also depend on our ability to maintain our relationships with existing channel partners and to develop relationships with new channel partners in key markets we cannot assure you that our channel partners will market our products effectively receive and fulfill customer orders for our products on a timely basis or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales marketing and technical support in addition any failure by our channel partners to provide adequate initial support to endcustomers could result in customer dissatisfaction with us or our products which could result in a loss of customers harm our reputation and delay or limit market acceptance of our products our products are complex and it takes time for a new channel partner to gain experience in the operation and installation of these products therefore it may take a period of time before a new channel partner can successfully market sell and support our products if an existing channel partner ceases to sell our products additionally our agreements with channel partners are generally not exclusive and our channel partners may market and sell products that compete with our products our agreements with our distributors and resellers are usually for an initial oneyear term and following the expiration of this term can be terminated by either party we can give no assurance that these agreements will remain in effect and any termination of one or more of the agreements may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations        we are subject to certain regulatory regimes that may affect the way that we conduct business internationally and our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our reputation and result in penalties and increased costs we are subject to a complex system of laws and regulations related to international trade including economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations  it is our policy not to make direct or indirect prohibited sales of our products including into countries sanctioned under laws to which we are subject and to contractually limit the territories into which our channel partners may sell our products  nevertheless several years ago one of our channel partners sold certain of our products designed for the enterprise market outside of its contractually designated territory including into a sanctioned country and we subsequently determined that our contract management protocol for authorizing channel partner sales was not adequately followed in that instance we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and may be subject to similar worldwide antibribery laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business  some of the countries in which we operate have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our compliance and training programs we cannot be certain that our procedures will be sufficient to ensure consistent compliance with all applicable international trade and anticorruption laws or that our employees or channel partners will strictly follow all policies and requirements to which we subject them  any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government scrutiny investigation debarment and civil and criminal penalties which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and reputation we are dependent on our traffic management systems and network management application suites for the substantial majority of our revenues in the past three years we increased sales of our service gateway platforms and our network management application suite however sales of our netenforcer traffic management system and netxplorer network management system continued to account for a significant portion of our revenues in  and  while we currently expect that these systems will continue to account for a considerable portion of our revenues in the immediate future the growth rate of sales from these systems has declined from  in  to  in  if we are unable to increase these sales our business will suffer in addition service providers may choose embedded or integrated solutions using routers and switches from larger networking vendors over a standalone solutions we offer any factor adversely affecting our ability to sell or the pricing of or demand for our netenforcer traffic management system and netxplorer network management system would severely harm our ability to generate revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business        we integrate various thirdparty solutions into our products and may integrate or offer additional thirdparty solutions in the future if we lose the right to use such solutions our sales could be disrupted and we would have to spend additional capital to replace such components we integrate various thirdparty solutions into our products and may integrate or offer additional thirdparty solutions in the future sales of our products could be disrupted if such third  party solutions were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms in either case we would be required to spend additional capital to either redesign our products to function with alternate third  party solutions or develop substitute components ourselves we might  as a result  be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings which could have a material adverse effect on our business our products are highly technical and any undetected software or hardware errors in our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results our products are complex and are incorporated into broadband networks  which are a major source of revenue for service providers and support critical applications for subscribers and enterprises due to the highly technical nature of our products and variations among customers’ network environments we may not detect product defects until our products have been fully deployed in our customers’ networks regardless of whether warranty coverage exists for a product we may be required to dedicate significant technical resources to repair any defects if we encounter significant product problems we could experience among other things loss of major customers cancellation of product orders increased costs delay in recognizing revenues and damage to our reputation we could also face claims for product liability tort or breach of warranty defending a lawsuit regardless of its merit is costly and may divert management’s attention in addition if our business liability insurance is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all our financial condition could be harmed demand for our products depends in part on the rate of adoption of bandwidthintensive broadband applications such as internet video and online video gaming applications and the impact multiple applications may have on network speed  our products are used by service providers and enterprises to monitor and manage bandwidthintensive applications that cause congestion in broadband networks and impact the quality of experience of users demand for our products is driven particularly by growth in applications which are highly sensitive to network delays and therefore require efficient network management such as voice over ip voip internet video and television and online video gaming applications if the rapid growth in the adoption of voip and in the popularity of internet video and online video gaming applications does not continue the demand for our products may be adversely impacted we currently depend on a single subcontractor to manufacture and provide hardware warranty support for our service gateway platforms netenforcer traffic management systems and video optimization platforms if this subcontractor experiences delays disruptions quality control problems or a loss in capacity it could materially and adversely affect our operating results we currently depend on a single subcontractor flextronics israel ltd a subsidiary of flextronics a global electronics manufacturing services company to manufacture assemble test package and provide hardware warranty support for our service gateway platforms netenforcer traffic management systems and video optimization platforms in addition our agreement with flextronics israel requires it to procure and store key components for our products at its facilities if flextronics israel experiences delays disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products or if we fail to effectively manage our relationship with flextronics israel product shipments may be delayed and our ability to deliver products to customers could be materially and adversely affected flextronics israel may terminate our agreement at any time during the term upon   days prior notice we expect that it would take approximately six months to transition the manufacturing of our products to an alternate manufacturer and our inventory of completed products may not be sufficient for us to continue delivering products to our customers on a timely basis during any such transition period therefore the loss of flextronics israel could adversely affect our sales and operating results and harm our reputation        certain hardware components for our products come from single or limited sources and we could lose sales if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements we obtain certain hardware components used in our products from single or limited sources although these are offtheshelf items because our systems have been designed to incorporate these specific components any change to these components due to an interruption in supply or our inability to obtain such components on a timely basis would require engineering changes to our products before substitute components could be incorporated such changes could be costly and result in lost sales particularly to the central processing unit for our service gateway platforms our netenforcer ac ac ac ac and the video optimization platforms vdc the agreements with our suppliers do not contain any minimum supply commitments if we or our contract manufacturer fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required our business could be harmed our suppliers also sell products to our competitors and may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of singlesource or limitedsourced components or to develop alternative sources for components or products would harm our ability to maintain and expand our business we may expand our business or enhance our technology through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses this could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition part of our strategy is to selectively pursue partnerships and acquisitions in  we acquired the business of esphion a developer of video optimization and protection solutions for telecommunications operators and internet service providers which increased the scope of our product offerings in  we acquired ortiva a developer of solutions for mobile and internet networks and oversi a developer of products and systems for caching internet content  the negotiation of acquisitions investments or joint ventures as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses or technologies could divert our management’s time and resources as of the end of  we consolidated the operations of ortiva and oversi with ours and they no longer operate on a standalone basis acquired businesses technologies or joint ventures may not be successfully integrated with our products and operations and we may not realize the intended benefits of these acquisitions we may also incur future losses from any acquisition investment or joint venture in addition acquisitions could result in · substantial cash expenditures   · potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities   · the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities   · a decrease in our profit margins and   · amortization of intangibles and potential impairment of goodwill   if acquisitions disrupt our operations or result in significant expenditures or liabilities our business operating results or financial conditions may suffer        if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees we may not be able to timely develop sell or support our products our success depends in large part on the continued contribution of our research and development sales and marketing and managerial personnel if our business continues to grow we will need to hire additional qualified research and development sales and marketing and managerial personnel to succeed the process of hiring training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is a lengthy and expensive one the market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills sales skills and understanding of our products and technology this is particularly true in israel where competition for qualified personnel is intense our failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could cause our revenues to decline and impair our ability to meet our research and development and sales objectives we may not be able to enforce employees’ covenants not to compete under the current laws of some jurisdictions in which we operate and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees it is our practice to have our employees sign appropriate noncompete agreements when permitted under applicable law these agreements prohibit our employees who cease working for us from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period of time the enforceability of noncompete clauses in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may be limited under the current laws of some jurisdictions in which we operate we may be unable to enforce these agreements and it may thereby be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from gaining the expertise our former employees gained while working for us if we are unable to successfully protect the intellectual property embodied in our technology our business could be harmed significantly knowhow relating to networking protocols building carriergrade systems and identifying applications is an important aspect of our intellectual property to protect our knowhow we customarily require our employees distributors resellers software testers and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or agree to confidentiality undertakings when their relationship with us begins typically our employment contracts also include the following clauses assignment of intellectual property rights for all inventions developed by employees and nondisclosure of all confidential information we cannot provide any assurance that the terms of these agreements are being observed and will be observed in the future because our product designs and software are stored electronically and thus are highly portable we attempt to reduce the portability of our designs and software by physically protecting our servers through the use of closed networks which prevent external access to our servers we cannot be certain however that such protection will adequately deter individuals or groups from wrongfully accessing our technology monitoring unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information will be sufficient in addition to protect our intellectual property we may become involved in litigation which could result in substantial expenses divert the attention of management cause significant delays materially disrupt the conduct of our business or adversely affect our revenue financial condition and results of operations  as of december   we had a limited patent portfolio we had seven issued us patents and several pending patent applications while we plan to protect our intellectual property with among other things patent protection there can be no assurance that · current or future us or foreign patents applications will be approved   · our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third  parties          · we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we or our competitors operate   · the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or   · others will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us   the failure to obtain patents inability to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology or the invalidation of our patents may weaken our competitive position and may adversely affect our revenues we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties that regardless of merit could result in litigation and our business operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected there can be no assurance that we will not receive communications from third parties asserting that our products and other intellectual property infringe or may infringe their proprietary rights we are not currently subject to any proceedings for infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and are not aware of any parties that intend to pursue such claims against us any such claim regardless of merit could result in litigation which could result in substantial expenses divert the attention of management cause significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of our business as a consequence of such claims we could be required to pay substantial damage awards develop noninfringing technology enter into royaltybearing licensing agreements stop selling our products or rebrand our products if it appears necessary we may seek to license intellectual property that we are alleged to infringe such licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights subject us to significant liabilities require us to seek licenses from others and otherwise negatively affect our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology our business operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we use certain “open source” software tools that may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims the assertion of which could impair our product development plans interfere with our ability to support our clients or require us to pay licensing fees certain of our products contain open source code and we may use more open source code in the future open source code is code that is covered by a license agreement that permits the user to liberally copy modify and distribute the software without cost provided that users and modifiers abide by certain licensing requirements the original developers of the open source code provide no warranties on such code as a result of our use of open source software we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source code and we may incur expenses in defending claims that we did not abide by the open source code license if we are not successful in defending against such claims we may be subject to monetary damages or be required to remove the open source code from our products such events could disrupt our operations and the sales of our products which would negatively impact our revenues and cash flow in addition under certain conditions the use of open source code to create derivative code may obligate us to make the resulting derivative code available to others at no cost if we are required to publicly disclose the source code for such derivative products or to license our derivative products that use an open source license our previously proprietary software products would be available to others including our customers and competitors without charge we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions that we do not intend the use of such open source code however may ultimately subject some of our products to unintended conditions so that we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts        unfavorable global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results the  and  crisis in the financial and credit markets in the united states europe and asia led to a global economic slowdown that is ongoing with economies in those territories continuing to show significant weakness and there is continuing economic uncertainty if the economies of any part of the world remain uncertain or further deteriorate many enterprises telecommunication carriers and service providers may significantly reduce or postpone capital investments  this could result in reductions in the sales of our products or services  longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition as a result of the most recent downturn in the european economies we have experienced longer sales cycles than in the past we continuously monitor market trends and intend to take such steps as we deem appropriate to adjust our operations because a substantial portion of our operating expenses consist of salaries we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses in line with any reduction in revenues or may elect not to do so for business reasons we will need to continue to generate increased revenues and manage our costs to maintain profitability although a certain recovery has occurred in the us economy if global economic and market conditions do not improve or continue to remain uncertain this may increase our inventories decrease our revenues result in additional pressure on the price of our products prolong payment terms or increase the risk of our incurrence of bad debts such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow from operations our international operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates our revenues are generated primarily in us dollars and a major portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars as a result we consider the us dollar to be our functional currency other significant portions of our expenses are denominated in shekels and to a lesser extent in euros and other currencies our shekeldenominated expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in shekels in  the shekel continued to fluctuate against the us dollar and appreciated by approximately  against the us dollar if the us dollar weakens against the shekel or other currencies we are exposed to there will be a negative impact on our results of operations we use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on balance sheet accounts and forecast cash flows we may not purchase derivative instruments adequately to insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks the volatility in the foreign currency markets may make hedging our foreign currency exposures challenging in addition because a portion of our revenue is not earned in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies in which such revenue is earned may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we wish to maintain the us dollardenominated value of our products in nonus markets devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the us dollar could cause our customers to cancel or decrease orders or default on payment compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals may disrupt our operations result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects in august  under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals regardless of their actual country of origin in their products metals such as tantalum tin gold and tungsten may be present in our products as component parts we will be required to implement procedures to investigate whether any conflict minerals that are used in our products originated from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries and if we determine that we are subject to the new disclosure rules make the required disclosures with the sec no later than by may   there will be costs associated with these investigations and the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of the raw materials used in our products also we may face potential reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all conflict minerals used in our component parts or if we are unable to replace any conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries with acceptable alternatives we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements customers may choose an alternative service provider these changes could also have an adverse impact in our ability to market our products        risks related to our ordinary shares                                                                            the share price of our ordinary shares has been and may continue to be volatile our quarterly financial performance is likely to vary in the future and may not meet our expectations or the expectations of analysts or investors which may lead to additional volatility in our share price the market price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and could fluctuate substantially due to many factors including but not limited to · announcements or introductions of technological innovations  new products product enhancements or pricing policies by us or our competitors   · winning or losing contracts with service providers   · disputes or other developments with respect to our or our competitors’ intellectual property rights   · announcements of strategic partnerships joint ventures or other agreements by us or our competitors   · recruitment or departure of key personnel   · regulatory developments in the markets in which we sell our products   · our sale of ordinary shares or other securities in the future   · changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets or   · market conditions in our industry the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole   share price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our ordinary shares is too low the lack of a trading market may result in the loss of research coverage by securities analysts moreover we cannot assure you that any securities analysts will initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our ordinary shares if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the price of our ordinary shares would likely decline securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of a us  company because we have elected to use certain exemptions available to foreign private issuers from certain nasdaq corporate governance requirements as a foreign private issuer we are permitted under nasdaq marketplace rule a to follow israeli corporate governance practices instead of the nasdaq stock market requirements that apply to us  companies as a condition to following israeli corporate governance practices we must disclose which requirements we are not following and describe the equivalent israeli law requirement we must also provide nasdaq with a letter from our israeli outside counsel certifying that our corporate governance practices are not prohibited by israeli law as a result of these exemptions our shareholders do not have the same protections as are afforded to shareholders of a us  company we may also in the future choose to follow israeli law and practices in lieu of other requirements of nasdaq rule         our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company we relied on the market capitalization method to determine the fair market value of our assets for the taxable year ended december    based on certain estimates of our gross income and gross assets the nature of our business and the anticipated amount of goodwill which is determined in large part by the price of our stock we believe that we were not a pfic for our taxable year ended december   and do not expect to become a pfic for our taxable year ending december   a nonus company will generally be characterized as a pfic for any taxable year in which  or more of its gross income is passive income or in which  or more of the average value of its gross assets produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income if we are characterized as a pfic our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences including having gains realized on the sale of our ordinary shares treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains income and having potentially punitive interest charges apply to the proceeds of share sales similar rules apply to distributions that are “excess distributions” the tests for determining pfic status are applied annually and it is difficult to make accurate predictions of our future income assets activities and market capitalization including fluctuations in the price of our ordinary shares which are relevant to this determination accordingly there can be no assurance that we will not become a pfic in  or in subsequent years if the price of our ordinary shares declines we may be more vulnerable to an unsolicited or hostile acquisition bid we do not have a controlling shareholder notwithstanding provisions of our articles of association and israeli law a decline in the price of our ordinary shares may result in us becoming subject to an unsolicited or hostile acquisition bid in the event that such a bid is publicly disclosed it may result in increased speculation regarding our company and volatility in our share price even if our board of directors decides not to pursue a transaction if our board of directors does pursue a transaction there can be no assurance that it will be consummated successfully or that the price paid will represent a premium above the original price paid for our shares by all of our shareholders risks relating to our location in israel conditions in israel could adversely affect our business we are incorporated under israeli law and our principal offices research and development division and manufacturing facilities are located in israel  accordingly political economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our business since the state of israel was established in  a number of armed conflicts have occurred between israel and its arab neighbors although israel has entered into various agreements with egypt jordan and the palestinian authority there has been an increase in unrest and terrorist activity which began in september  and continued with varying levels of severity into  an armed conflict between israel and hamas in the gaza strip occurred in november  and is ongoing these conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of israel including most recently central israel and negatively affected business conditions in israel any armed conflicts terrorist activities or political instability in the region may limit materially our ability to obtain raw materials from these countries or sell our products to companies in these countries any hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could adversely affect our operations and product development and manufacturing cause our revenues to decrease and adversely affect the share price of publicly traded companies having operations in israel such as us        our operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service as of december   we employed  people of whom  were based in israel some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty in the israel defense forces depending on their age and position in the army additionally they may be called to active reserve duty at any time under emergency circumstances for extended periods of time our operations could be disrupted by the absence of one or more of our executive officers or key employees for a significant period due to military service and any significant disruption in our operations could harm our business the full impact on our workforce or business if some of our executive officers and employees are called upon to perform military service especially in times of national emergency is difficult to predict additionally the absence of a significant number of employees at our manufacturing subcontractor flextronix as a result of military service obligations may disrupt their operations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely deliver products to customers may be materially adversely affected the tax benefits that are available to us require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future which would increase our costs and taxes our investment program in equipment at our facility in hodhasharon israel has been granted approved enterprise status and we are therefore eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments  referred to as the investments law we expect to utilize these tax benefits after we utilize our net operating loss carry forwards as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards for israeli tax purposes amounted to approximately  million including losses related to our acquisition of oversi the operations of which were merged with ours in  to remain eligible for these tax benefits we must continue to meet certain conditions stipulated in the investments law and its regulations and the criteria set forth in the specific certificate of approval including among other conditions that the approved enterprise be operated over a sevenyear period and that at least  of our investment in fixed assets of the approved enterprise be funded by additional paidup ordinary share capital if we do not meet these requirements the tax benefits would be canceled and we could be required to refund any tax benefits and investment grants that we received in the past  further in the future these tax benefits may be reduced or discontinued if these tax benefits are cancelled our israeli taxable income would be subject to regular israeli corporate tax rates the standard corporate tax rate for israeli companies in  and in  was  of their taxable income and will increase to  in  and going forward effective january   the investment law was amended under the amended investment law the criteria for receiving tax benefits were revised under the transition provisions of the new legislation a company may decide to irrevocably implement the new amendment while waiving benefits provided under the current law or to remain subject to the current law  in the future we may not be eligible to receive additional tax benefits under this law  our company did not file a request to apply the new benefits under the  amendment we intend to apply for benefits under the  amendment beginning in  the termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase our tax liability which would reduce our profits  additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel through acquisitions for example our expanded activities might not be eligible for inclusion in future israeli tax benefit programs  finally in the event of a distribution of a dividend from the abovementioned taxexempt income in addition to withholding tax at the following rates i israeli resident corporation –  ii israeli resident individual –  in  and  as of  iii nonisraeli resident   in  and  as of  subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty we will be subject to tax at the corporate tax rate applicable to our approved enterprise’s and beneficiary enterprise’s income on the amount distributed in accordance with the effective corporate tax rate which would have been applied had we not enjoyed the exemption see “item  additional information—taxation—israeli tax considerations and government programs”          no assurance can be given that we will be eligible to receive additional tax benefits under the investments law in the future  the termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase our tax liability in the future which would reduce our profits or increase our losses additionally if we increase our activities outside of israel for example by future acquisitions our increased activities may not be eligible for inclusion in israeli tax benefit programs the government grants we have received for research and development expenditures require us to satisfy specified conditions and restrict our ability to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of israel  if we fail to comply with these conditions or such restrictions we may be required to refund grants previously received together with interest and penalties and may be subject to criminal charges we have received grants from the office of the chief scientist for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures in israel pursuant to the provisions of the encouragement of industrial research and development law  referred to as the research and development law in the future we may not receive grants or we may receive significantly smaller grants from the office of the chief scientist and our failure to receive grants in the future could adversely affect our profitability in  and  we received and accrued from the office of the chief scientist royaltybearing grants totaling  million and  million representing  and  respectively of our gross research and development expenditures in these periods in december  we agreed to prepay approximately  million of contingent royalties to the office of the chief scientist and thereby eliminated all future royalty obligations related to grants received through  we recorded this prepayment as a liability in  and paid it on august  in  we received and accrued nonroyaltybearing grants totaling  million from the office of the chief scientist representing  of our gross research and development expenditures during the year in  we qualified to participate in two nonroyaltybearing research and development programs funded by the office of the chief scientist to develop generic technology relevant to the development of our products such programs are approved pursuant to special provisions of the research and development law we were eligible to receive grants constituting between  and  of certain research and development expenses relating to these programs one of the programs are members of programs approved for companies with large research and development activities and another members of a magnet consortiums although the grants under these programs are not required to be repaid by way of royalties the restrictions of the research and development law described below apply to these programs the provisions of the research and development law and the terms of the office of the chief scientist grants prohibit us from transferring manufacturing products which we originally planned to manufacture in israel outside of israel if they incorporate technologies funded by the office of the chief scientist and from transferring intellectual property rights in technologies developed using these grants without special approvals from the office of the chief scientist even if we receive approval to manufacture our products outside of israel we may be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties which may be up to  of the grant amount plus interest depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of israel this restriction may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangements for those products or technologies knowhow developed under an approved research and development program may not be transferred to any third  parties except in certain circumstances and subject to prior approval similarly even if we receive approval to transfer intellectual property rights in technologies developed using these grants we may be required to repay a multiple of the original grants to the office of the chief scientist in addition if we fail to comply with any of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the research and development law or by the specific terms under which we received the grants we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties and may be subject to criminal charges        it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us our officers and directors in israel or the united states or to assert us securities laws claims in israel or serve process on our officers and directors we are incorporated in israel the majority of our executive officers and directors are not residents of the united states and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states therefore it may be difficult for an investor or any other person or entity to enforce a us court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws against us or any of these persons in a us or israeli court or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states additionally it may be difficult for an investor or any other person or entity to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of us securities laws on the grounds that israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim even if an israeli court agrees to hear a claim it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim if us law is found to be applicable the content of applicable us law must be proved as a fact which can be a timeconsuming and costly process certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law there is little binding case law in israel addressing the matters described above provisions of israeli law and our articles of association may delay prevent or make undesirable an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets our articles of association contain certain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control including a classified board of directors in addition israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions these provisions of israeli law could delay or prevent a change in control and may make it more difficult for thirdparties to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders and may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future furthermore israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions undesirable to us or to some of our shareholders see “item  additional information—memorandum and articles of association—acquisitions under israeli law” and “—antitakeover measures” it

carrierclass products and solutions in addition we have developed significant industry knowhow and expertise through our experience designing and implementing use cases with our diverse customer base   beginning from the proposal stage of a new project through the testing acceptance and implementation of our products we collaborate closely with our customers and other industry participants to create innovative solutions to create the digital lifestyle ecosystems our customers require industry background the rapid proliferation of broadband networks in recent years has been largely driven by demand from users for faster and more reliable access to the internet and by the proliferation in the number and complexity of broadband applications as well as the proliferation of mobile smartphones tablets and other internetconnected devices        rising network operational costs due to the rapid adoption of broadband applications advances in broadband access such as the introduction of longterm evolution or lte technology combined with the advanced data capabilities of enduser devices such as smartphones and tablets have promoted a growing number of applications and content delivered over broadband networks the vast majority of these applications run overthetop ott of the network which means they are not originated controlled or charged by the network operator the use of ott applications such as streaming video peertopeer pp voice over ip voip social networks interactive gaming and online content requires large and increasing amounts of bandwidth moreover many of these applications are highly sensitive to network delays caused by congestion in response to these challenges service providers have been forced to invest heavily in network infrastructure upgrades and customer support services in order to maintain the quality of experience for subscribers rising data traffic in mobile networks the mobile data market continues to grow rapidly fueled by the proliferation of smartphones and tablets mobileenabled laptops that use mobile modems or tethered smartphones to connect to the internet on average the data traffic generated by an internet user with a smartphone is multiple times that of an internet user without a smartphone the cost of increasing the bandwidth in mobile networks is significantly higher than that in wireline networks as a result mobile operators are experiencing economic and infrastructure challenges in meeting the rising tide of data traffic over their networks in addition as capacity increases in mobile networks smartphone users are likely to have increased expectations with respect to speed and performance it is becoming increasingly apparent that unmanaged g and glte mobile networks will not be able to cope with the rising tide of data traffic without implementing intelligent bandwidth management solutions moreover network providers may need to develop new pricing models if they are not able to monetize the ott traffic carried by their networks   service providers demand the ability to offer services that can be monetized at different rates some service providers still offer flatrate broadband access regardless of the type of applications and data used by subscribers these operators provide the same level of service to all subscribers and do not guarantee access quality regardless of a subscriber’s willingness to pay for premium services and network performance however with the increasing amount of data used the flatrate pricing model may not be profitable especially for mobile broadband operators unless they can charge subscribers high rates as a result both mobile and fixed operators have begun to offer service plans based on gigabytes of data used however this pricing model is also subject to competition from other service providers offering lower rates contributing to downward pricing pressure and high subscriber turnover rates to address these issues and increase the average revenue per user arpu a significantly increased number of service providers have begun to offer premium differentiated services such as improved quality for voip and internet video offpeak usage incentives and parental control over access to content among others by offering such tiered services and charging subscribers according to the value of these services as well as based on the gigabyte usage service providers can capitalize on the revenue opportunities enabled by ott internet applications to offer premium services and to guarantee highquality delivery of content and user experience service providers need enhanced visibility into and control of network traffic including visibility into the type of applications used on the network and levels of traffic generated by different subscribers        the challenge of elevating the role of fixed and mobile broadband networks in the evolving digital lifestyle consumers recognize the importance of the devices they use to access the internet and choose the internet content and services they use based on quality however the network that connects them to the internet is not as “visible” and is therefore not as highly valued even though it plays a critical role in the service chain in order to generate revenue through various pricing models and encourage consumers and content providers to seek higher quality network services service providers are seeking to elevate the role of network connectivity and services to do so service providers must be able to identify and leverage the business intelligence in their data networks and capitalize on the network traffic that they generate the ability to identify distinguish and prioritize different applications plays a major role in intelligent management of network resources and service delivery allowing service providers to optimize bandwidth utilization and reduce operational costs while maintaining high quality of service for tiered and premium services application designers are employing increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection by network operators who desire to manage network use traditional network infrastructure devices such as routers and switches do not generally have sufficient computing resources or the required algorithms to distinguish between different and rapidly evolving applications enterprise demand for visibility and delivery of missioncritical applications and services in the cloud the proliferation of network applications bring your own device byod and cloud computing presents significant challenges for enterprises that operate data centers widearea networks virtual private networks vpn and internet connectivity for organizations of all sizes enterprises depend on network infrastructure to ensure the delivery of businesscritical applications to an increasingly mobile and often global workforce and as such face may of the same issues as service providers at the same time internet access has introduced a wide variety of recreational and nonbusiness applications to enterprise networks resulting in network congestion and negatively impacting employee productivity as a result there is an increasing need for enterprises to be able to monitor and control the traffic on their business networks network security threats as reliance on the internet has grown service providers and subscribers have become increasingly vulnerable to a wide range of security threats including denial of service dos attacks spambots and malware these attacks are designed to flood the network with traffic that consumes all the available bandwidth and hinder the ability to provide high quality broadband access to subscribers or to prevent enterprises from using missioncritical applications these threats also compromise network and data integrity we believe service providers and enterprises must protect against such attacks by detecting and neutralizing malicious traffic at very early stages before such threats can compromise network integrity and services integrated solutions our integrated broadband solutions allow mobile fixed and enterprise operators to elevate their

service providers cable operators private networks data centers governments and enterprises we derive a significant and growing portion of our revenue from direct sales to large mobile and fixedline service providers we generate the remainder of our revenue through a select and welldeveloped network of channel partners generally consisting of distributors resellers original equipment manufacturers “oems” and system integrators  in  we derived  of our revenues from europe  from the united states  from asia and oceania  from the middle east and africa and  from the americas excluding the united states channel partners we market and sell our products to endcustomers both by direct sales and through channel partners which include distributors resellers oems and system integrators a significant portion of our sales occur through our channel partners in  approximately  of our revenues were derived from channel partners our channel partners generally purchase our products from us upon receiving orders from endcustomers and are responsible for installing and providing initial customer support for our products our channel partners are located around the world and address most major markets our channel partners target a range of endusers including carriers alternative carriers cable operators private networks data centers and enterprises in a wide range of industries including government financial institutions and education our agreements with channel partners that are distributors or resellers are generally nonexclusive for an initial term of one year and automatically renew for successive oneyear terms unless terminated after the first year such agreements may typically be terminated by either party upon ninety days prior notice          we offer support to our channel partners this support includes the generation of leads through marketing events seminars and webbased leads and incentive programs as well as technical and sales training sales and marketing our product sales and deployment cycle varies based on the intended use by the endcustomer the sales cycle for initial network deployment may generally last between twelve and eighteen months for large and medium service providers six to twelve months for small service providers and one to six months for enterprises followon orders and additional deployment of our products usually require shorter cycles large and medium service providers generally take longer to plan the integration of our solutions into their existing networks and to set goals for the implementation of the technology we focus our marketing efforts on product positioning increasing brand awareness communicating product advantages and generating qualified leads for our sales organization we rely on a variety of marketing communications channels including our website trade shows industry research and professional publications the press and special events to gain wider market exposure we have organized our worldwide sales efforts into the following three territories north and south america europe the middle east and africa and asia and oceania we have regional offices in the united states israel france united kingdom singapore japan new zealand and china and a regional presence in germany italy spain mexico brazil india hong kong south korea south africa and australia as of december

  the expenditures associated with the technical support staff are allocated in our statements of operations between sale and marketing expenses and cost of goods sold based on the roles of and tasks performed by personnel as of december   our technical staff consisted of  employees research and development our research and development activities take place primarily in israel as of december    of our employees were engaged primarily in research and development we devote a significant amount of our resources towards research and development to introduce and continuously enhance products to support our growth strategy we have assembled a core team of experienced engineers many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline and have technical degrees from top universities and experience working for leading israeli networking companies these engineers are involved in advancing our core technologies as well as in applying these core technologies to our product development activities our research and development efforts have benefited from royaltybearing grants from the office of the chief scientist the state of israel does not own any proprietary rights in technology developed with the office of the chief scientist funding and there is no restriction related to the office of the chief scientist on the export of products manufactured using technology developed with office of the chief scientist funding other limitations on export apply under applicable law for a description of restrictions on the transfer of the technology and with respect to manufacturing rights please see “item  key information—risk factors—the government grants we have received for research and development expenditures require us to satisfy specified conditions and restrict our ability to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of israel if we fail to comply with these conditions or such restrictions we may be required to refund grants previously received together with interest and penalties and may be subject to criminal charges” manufacturing we subcontract the manufacture and repair of our service gateway platforms and our netenforcer traffic management systems to flextronics israel ltd a subsidiary of flextronics a global electronics manufacturing services company this strategy enables us to reduce our fixed costs focus on our core research and development competencies and provide flexibility in meeting market demand flextronics israel is contractually obligated to provide us with manufacturing services based on agreed specifications including manufacturing assembling testing packaging and procuring the raw materials for our devices we are not required to provide any minimum orders our agreement with flextronics israel is automatically renewed annually for additional oneyear terms flextronics israel may terminate our agreement with them at any time during the term upon  days prior notice we retain the right to procure independently any of the components used in our products flextronics israel has a us affiliate to which it can with the prior consent of the office of the chief scientist transfer manufacturing of our products if necessary in which event we may be required to pay increased royalties to the office of the chief scientist we expect that it would take approximately six months to transition manufacturing of our products to an alternate manufacturer we design and develop internally a number of the key components for our products including printed circuit boards and software some of the hardware components of our products are obtained from single or limited sources since our products have been designed to incorporate these specific components any change in these components due to an interruption in supply or our inability to obtain such components on a timely basis would require engineering changes to our products before we could incorporate substitute components in particular we purchase the central processing unit for our service gateway platforms and for our netenforcer products from netlogic microsystems inc now part of broadcom corporation we carry approximately three to six months of inventory of key components we also work closely with our suppliers to monitor the endoflife of the product cycle for integral components and believe that in the event that they announce end of life we will be able to increase our inventory to allow enough time for replacing such components the agreements with our suppliers do not contain any minimum purchase or supply commitments product testing and quality assurance is performed by our contract manufacturer using tests and automated testing equipment and according to controlled test documentation we specify we also use inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products        competition we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive sector of the networking technology market we face significant competition from router and switch infrastructure companies such as cisco systems inc telefonaktiebolager lm erricson and huawei technologies co ltd that integrate functionalities into their platforms addressing some of the problems that our products address our competitors have also identified the potential market opportunity offered by the largest service providers referred to as tier  operators and we therefore expect intense competition in this portion of our market in the future our principal competitors in the field of dpi technology are sandvine inc and procera networks inc we also face competition from companies that offer partial or alternative solutions addressing limited aspects of the challenges facing broadband providers such as network monitoring or security we compete on the basis of product performance such as speed and number of applications identified ease of use and installation and customer support price is also an important although not the principal basis on which we compete see “item  key information—risk factors—we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies in our market who offer or may in the future offer competing technologies” intellectual property our intellectual property rights are very important to our business we believe that the complexity of our products and the knowhow incorporated in them makes it difficult to copy them or replicate their features we rely on a combination of confidentiality and other protective clauses in our agreements copyright and trade secrets to protect our knowhow we also restrict access to our servers physically and through closed networks since our product designs and software are stored electronically and thus are highly portable we customarily require our employees customers distributors resellers software testers technology partners and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or agree to confidentiality undertakings when their relationship with us begins typically our employment contracts also include the following clauses assignment of intellectual property rights for all inventions developed by employees nondisclosure of all confidential information and noncompete clauses which generally restrict the employee for six months following termination of employment the enforceability of noncompete clauses in certain jurisdictions in which we operate may be limited see “item  key information—risk factors—we may not be able to enforce employees’ covenants not to compete under the current laws of some jurisdictions in which we operate and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees” because our product designs and software are stored electronically and thus are highly portable we attempt to reduce the portability of our designs and software by physically protecting our servers through the use of closed networks which prevent external access to our servers the communications equipment industry is characterized by constant product changes resulting from new technological developments performance improvements and lower hardware costs we believe that our future growth depends to a large extent on our ability to be an innovator in the development and application of hardware and software technology as we develop the next generation products we intend to pursue patent protection for our core technologies in the telecommunications segment we plan to seek patent protection in our largest markets and our competitors’ markets for example in the united states and europe as we continue to move into markets such as japan korea and china we will evaluate how best to protect our technologies in those markets we intend to vigorously prosecute and defend the rights of our intellectual property        as of december   we had two us patents and four pending patent applications in the united states we expect to formalize our evaluation process for determining which inventions to protect by patents or other means we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of

of revenues consists primarily of costs of materials manufacturing services and overhead warehousing product testing and royalties paid primarily to the office of the chief scientist until the end of  when the obligation to royalties to ocs ended due to the repayment to ocs our services’ cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for our customer support staff as well as the royalty payments mentioned above we expect cost of revenues to increase as a result of an increase in our product and service revenues an increase in sales of our higher end products primarily our service gateway platforms to large customers that we expect will require additional personnel hiring and other operational expenditures related to such sales  such increases may be partially offset by increased sales of our network management application suites as their related cost of revenues is generally lower in addition we are no longer obligated to make royalty payments to the office of the chief scientist as we reached a settlement with them in december  the balance of the liability related to the grants received from the office of chief scientist was approximately  million which was recorded as cost of revenues for the year ended december   in  our gross margin increased as a result of the elimination of royalty payments to the office of the chief scientist with respect to grants received through  operating expenses research and development   our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs costs for

exchange gains or losses gains or losses resulting from the sale of marketable securities and bank fees in  we had  million financial income net compared to  million financial income net in  the change is primarily attributed to a decrease in our interest income which derived from lower interest rates received for our shortterm bank deposits during  and from the increase in the amortization of our marketable securities’ premium during  in addition financial and other income expenses net may fluctuate due to foreign currency exchange gains or losses as well as interest rate changes see “—factors affecting our performance” approved enterprise our facilities in hodhasharon israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the encouragement of capital investments law  and enjoy certain tax benefits under this program we expect to utilize these tax benefits after we utilize our net operating loss carry forwards as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards for israeli tax purposes totaled approximately  million which includes losses related to our acquisition of oversi as a result of our acquisition of oversi we offset operating losses in israel against taxable income annually with a limitation of up to  of the total accumulated loss but no more than  of our taxable income income derived from other sources other than through our “approved enterprise” status during the benefit period will be subject to the regular corporate tax rate government grants our research and development efforts have been financed in part through grants from the office of the chief scientist under our approved plans in accordance with the research and development law through december   we had received approval for and recorded in our books grants totaling  million from the office of the chief scientist including  million attributed to netreality products because the netreality products were discontinued and will no longer be sold the  million was cancelled and we are not obligated to repay this amount under israeli law and the approved plans royalties on the revenues derived from sales of all of our products are payable to the israeli government generally at the rate of  during the first three years and  beginning in the fourth year up to the amount of the received grants as adjusted for fluctuation in the us dollarshekel exchange rate the amounts received after january   bear interest at the twelvemonth libor as at the beginning of the year in which a grant is approved our obligation to pay these royalties is contingent upon actual sales of our products and no payment is required if no sales are made  in december  we recorded a liability of  million due to a settlement with the office of the chief scientist representing the full balance of the contingent liability related to grants received this settlement was paid in  upon making this payment we have eliminated all royalty obligations related to our anticipated revenues and did not incur the expense associated with future interest payments related to such obligations      factors affecting our performance our business financial position and results of operations as well as the periodtoperiod comparability of our financial results are significantly affected by a number of factors some of which are beyond our control including customer concentration we derived  of our total revenues in  from three global tier  mobile and fixed operator groups while we have some visibility into the likely scope of the customers’ projects our relationships are conducted solely on a purchase order basis and we do not have any commitment for future purchase orders from these customers the loss of any of such significant customers could harm our results of operations and financial condition size of endcustomers and sales cycles   we have a global diversified endcustomer base consisting primarily of service providers and enterprises the deployment of our products by small and midsize enterprises and service providers can be completed relatively quickly with a limited number of netenforcer andor service gateway systems compared to the number required by large service providers in  we have increased the portion of our sales to large service providers large service providers take longer to plan the integration of our solutions into their existing networks and to set goals for the implementation of the technology sales to large service providers are therefore more complicated as they involve a relatively larger number of network elements and solutions as well as netenforcer andor service gateway systems we are seeking to achieve further significant customer wins in the large service provider market that would positively impact our future performance the longer sales cycles associated with the increased sales to large service providers of our platforms may increase the unpredictability of the timing of our sales and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate if a significant customer delays its purchasing decision andor defers an order furthermore longer sales cycles may result in delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory to the time that we generate revenue from related product sales average selling prices   our performance is affected by the selling prices of our products we price our products based on several factors including manufacturing costs the stage of the product’s life cycle competition technical complexity of the product discounts given to channel partners in certain territories customization and other special considerations in connection with larger projects we typically are able to charge the highest price for a product when it is first introduced to the market we expect that the average selling prices for our products will decrease over the product’s life cycle as our competitors introduce new products and dpi technology becomes more standardized in order to maintain or increase our current prices we expect that we will need to enhance the functionality of our existing products by offering higher system speeds additional valueadded products and features such as additional security functions supporting additional applications and providing enhanced reporting tools we also from time to time introduce enhanced products typically higherend models that include new architecture and design and new capabilities such enhanced products typically increase our average selling price to further offset such declines we sell maintenance and support programs for our products and as our customer base and number of field installations grow our related service revenues are expected to increase          cost of revenues and cost reductions    our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was  for   for   excluding the impact of the  million expenses related to settlement of office of chief scientist grants and  for  our products use offtheshelf components and typically the prices of such components decline over time however the introduction and sale of new or enhanced products and services may result in an increase in our cost of revenues we make a continuous effort to identify cheaper components of comparable performance and quality we also seek improvements in engineering and manufacturing efficiency that will reduce costs our products incorporate features that require the payment of royalties to third parties in addition new products usually have higher costs during the initial introduction period we generally expect such costs to decline as the product matures and sales volume increases the introduction of new products may also involve a significant decrease in demand for older products such a decrease may result in a devaluation or writeoff of such older products and their respective components in  we recorded a writeoff of   million of inventory to our cost of revenues for products and components the growth of our customer base is usually coupled with increased service revenues primarily resulting from increased maintenance and support in addition the growth of our installed base with large service providers may result in increased demand for professional services such as training and installation services an increase in demand for such services may require us to hire additional personnel and incur other expenditures however these additional expenses handled efficiently may be utilized to further support the growth of our customer base and increase service revenues currency exposure a majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in the us dollar however a significant portion of the expenses associated with our global operations including personnel and facilitiesrelated expenses are incurred in currencies other than the us dollar this is the case primarily in israel and to a lesser extent in other countries in europe and asia consequently a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies will increase the dollar cost of our operations in these countries a relative decrease in the value of the us dollar would be partially offset to the extent that we generate revenues in such currencies in order to partially mitigate this exposure we have decided in the past and may decide from time to time in the future to enter into hedging transactions we may discontinue hedging activities at any time as such decisions involve substantial judgment and assessments primarily regarding future trends in foreign exchange markets which are very volatile as well as our future level and timing of cash flows of these currencies we cannot provide any assurance that such hedging transactions will not affect our results of operations when they are realized see note  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information interest rate exposure we have a significant amount of cash that is currently invested primarily in interest bearing vehicles such as bank time deposits and available for sale marketable securities these investments expose us to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations   critical accounting policies and estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations in applying these critical accounting policies our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates those estimates are based on our historical experience the terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in our industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate with respect to our policies on revenue recognition and warranty costs our historical experience is based principally on our operations since we commenced selling our products in  our estimates are primarily guided by observing the following critical accounting policies · revenue recognition          · provision for returns   · warranty costs   · allowance for doubtful accounts   · accounting for stockbased compensation   · inventories   · marketable securities   · impairment of goodwill and long lived assets   · income taxes and   · contingencies   because each of the accounting policies listed above requires the exercise of certain judgments and the use of estimates actual results may differ from our estimations and as a result would increase or decrease our future revenues and net income revenue recognition  we generate revenues mainly from selling its products along with related maintenance and support services at times these arrangements may also include professional services such as installation services or training the company generally sells its products through resellers distributors oems and system integrators all of whom are considered endusers revenues from product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer no significant performance obligations remain payment for products is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer we do not recognize the revenue until all acceptance criteria have been met maintenance and support related revenues included in multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the applicable maintenance and support agreement other services are recognized upon the completion of installation or when the service is provided in instances where the services provided in a multiple element arrangement are considered essential to the functionality of the product and payment of the product is contingent upon performance of the services the sales of the products and services would be considered one unit of accounting deferred revenues are classified as short and long term based on their contractual term and recognized as revenues at the time the respective elements are provided revenues arrangements with multiple deliverables are allocated using the relative selling price method the company determines the best estimated selling price “besp” in multiple elements arrangements as follows for the products the company determine the “besp” based on management’s estimated selling price “esp” by reviewing historical transactions and considering multiple other factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting and competition as of january   the company changed its pricing policy in respect of the sale of maintenance and support in new multiple element arrangements for the maintenance and support under the new pricing policy the company determined the esp for the year ended december   in multipleelement arrangements based on reviewing historical transactions and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting and competition for the years ended december   and december   for maintenance and support the company determined the selling price based on vsoe of the price charged based on standalone sales renewals of such elements using a consistent percentage of the companys product price lists in the same territories        deferred revenues are classified as short and longterm based on their contractual term and recognized as revenues at the time the respective elements are provided we provide a provision for product returns and stock rotation based on its experience with historical sales returns stock rotations and other known factors such provisions amounted to  million and  million as of december   and  respectively warranty costs  we typically grant a oneyear hardware and three months software warranty on all of our products or oneyear hardware and software extended warranty to customers which purchase annual maintenance and support and record a provision for warranty at the time the product’s revenue is recognized we estimate the liability of possible warranty claims based on our historical experience we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranty arrangements and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized we periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary allowance for doubtful accounts  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable on a specific basis we estimate this allowance based on our judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables we primarily base this judgment on an analysis of significant outstanding invoices the age of the receivables our historical collection experience and current economic trends in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected accounting for stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification no  “compensation  stock compensation” “asc no ” that requires companies to estimate the fair value of equitybased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations we recognize compensation expense for the value of its awards granted based on the straightline method over the requisite service period of each of the awards net of estimated forfeitures asc no  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of the grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in connection with the grant of options we recorded total stockbased compensation expense of  million in   million in  and  million in  in   million  million  million and  million of our stockbased compensation expense resulted from cost of revenue research and development expenses net sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses respectively based on the department in which the recipient of the option grant was employed as of december   we had an aggregate of  million of deferred unrecognized stockbased compensation remaining to be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of  years inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value inventory writeoffs are provided to cover risks arising from slowmoving items technological obsolescence excess inventory and discontinued products inventory writeoff provision as of december    and  totaled  million  million and  million respectively        marketable securities  we account for our investments in marketable securities using accounting standards codification no  “investments – debt and equity securities” “asc no ”   we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date we classify all of our investments in marketable securities as available for sale available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” in shareholders’ equity realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity such amortization together with interest and dividends on securities are included in financial income net if any as of december   we held available for sale marketable securities of  million as of december   the unrealized loss recorded to other comprehensive income was  million                  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses under accounting standards codification no  “intangiblesgoodwill and other” “asc no ” goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill at december  of each year or more often as applicable we operate in one operating segment and this segment comprises only reporting unit the provisions of asc no  require that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill at the level of the reporting units in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required to be performed if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference we believe that our business activity and management structure meet the criterion of being a single reporting unit for accounting purposes we performed an annual impairment analysis as of december   and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit was less than the fair value of the reporting unit fair value is determined using market capitalization during the years ended   and  no impairment losses were recorded property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc no  “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets as of december   no impairment losses have been identified        intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses the useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives some of the acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits realized this accounting policy results in accelerated amortization of such customer relationships and backlog as compared to the straightline method all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis during   and  no impairment losses were recorded income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification no  “income taxes” “asc no ” asc no  prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse we provide a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in israel we have accumulated operating loss carry forwards of approximately  million and  capital losses of approximately  million for tax purposes as of december   which may be carried forward and offset against taxable capital gains in the future for an indefinite period in the united states the accumulated losses for us federal income tax return purposes were approximately  million as of december   which expire between  and  in france we had approximately  million in net operating loss carry forwards as of december   which may be carried forward and offset against taxable capital gains in the future for an indefinite period we believe that because of our history of losses and uncertainty with respect to future taxable income it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets regarding the loss carry forwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future and therefore a valuation allowance was provided to reduce deferred tax assets to their realizable value the valuation allowance for the year ended december   was  million asc no  contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that on an evaluation of the technical merits the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income tax contingencies  from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies if any which would impact our results of operations is made after considered analysis of each individual action together with our legal advisors the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances and estimations a change in the required reserves would impact our results of operations in the period the change is made          results of

revenues products   product revenues decreased by  million or  to  million in  from  million in the decrease is derived by the fact that a portion of our sales are made to customers in countries in europe which have been impacted by the economic downturn and led our customers to minimize their investments in capital expenditure activities in  and to a lesser degree in  and  sales of our highend products primarily the allot service gateway platforms and value added products increase in  such as allot service protector and allot proactive analytics services   services revenues increased by  million or  to  million in  from  million in  the increase in service revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base in  and also the growth of our professional services

of received and accrued grants from the office of the chief scientist increased by  million or  to  million in  from  million in  grants received from the office of the chief scientist totaled  million in  compared to  million in  the decrease in grants received is due the fact that from  the company is qualified to participate in an approved program with the ocs for companies with large

smaller than the royalty bearing grants the company received in previous years sales and marketing   sales and marketing expenses increased by  million or  to  million in  from  million in  this

transferred to the acquirer by operation of law notwithstanding the above if the shareholders who do not accept the offer hold less than  of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class the offer will nonetheless be accepted however a shareholder that had its shares so transferred may within six months from the date of acceptance of the tender offer petition

accepting shareholder may not petition the court for fair value but such condition will not be valid unless all of the information required under the companies law was provided prior to the acceptance date the description above regarding a full tender offer also applies with certain limitations when a full tender offer for the purchase of all of the company’s securities is accepted   special tender offer the companies law provides subject to certain exceptions that an acquisition of shares of a public israeli company must be made by means of a “special tender offer” if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of at least  of the voting rights in the company this rule does not apply if there is already another holder of at least  of the voting rights in the company similarly the companies law provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of more than  of the voting rights in the company and there is no other shareholder of the company who holds more than  of the voting rights in the company the special tender offer may be consummated subject to certain majority requirements set forth in the companies law and provided further that at least  of the voting rights attached to the company’s outstanding shares will be acquired by the party making the offer        merger the companies law permits merger transactions between two israeli companies if approved by each party’s board of directors and a certain percentage of each party’s shareholders following the approval of the board of directors of each of the merging companies the boards must jointly prepare a merger proposal for submission to the israeli registrar of companies under the companies law if the approval of a general meeting of the shareholders is required merger transactions may be approved by the holders of a simple majority of our shares present in person by proxy or by written ballot at a general meeting of the shareholders and voting on the transaction in determining whether the required majority has approved the merger if shares of the company are held by the other party to the merger by any person holding at least  of the voting rights or  of the means of appointing directors or the general manager of the other party to the merger then a vote against the merger by holders of the majority of the shares present and voting excluding shares held by the other party or by such person or any person or entity acting on behalf of related to or controlled by either of them is sufficient to reject the merger transaction in certain circumstances a court may still approve the merger upon the request of holders of at least  of the voting rights of a company if the court holds that the merger is fair and reasonable taking into account the value of the parties to the merger and the consideration offered to the shareholders   the companies law provides for certain requirements and procedures that each of the merging companies is to fulfill in addition a merger may not be completed unless at least fifty days have passed from the date that a proposal for approval of the merger was filed with the israeli registrar of companies and thirty days from the date that shareholder approval of both merging companies was obtained antitakeover measures   undesignated preferred shares   the companies law allows us to create and issue shares having rights different from those attached to our ordinary shares including shares providing certain preferred or additional rights with respect to voting distributions or other matters and shares having preemptive rights we do not have any authorized or issued shares other than ordinary shares in the future if we do create and issue a class of shares other than ordinary shares such class of shares depending on the specific rights that may be attached to them may delay or prevent a takeover or otherwise prevent our shareholders from realizing a potential premium over the market value of their ordinary shares the authorization of a new class of shares will require an amendment to our articles of association which requires the prior approval of a simple majority of our shares represented and voted at a general meeting in addition we undertook towards the tase that as long as our shares are registered for trading with the tase we will not issue or authorize shares of any class other than the class currently registered with the tase unless such issuance is in accordance with certain provisions of the israeli securities law determining that a company registering its shares for trade on the tase may not have more than one class of shares for a period of one year following registration with the tase and following such period the company is permitted to issue preferred shares if the preference of those shares is limited to a preference in the distribution

e            taxation israeli tax considerations and government programs the following is a general discussion only and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations it is not intended and should not be construed as legal or professional tax advice and should not be relied upon for tax planning purposes in addition this discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to purchasers of our ordinary shares in light of their particular circumstances or certain types of purchasers of our ordinary shares subject to special tax treatment examples of this kind of investor include residents of israel and traders in securities who are subject to special tax regimes not covered in this discussion each individualentity should consult its own tax or legal advisor as to the israeli tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares to the extent that part of the discussion is based on new tax legislation which has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation we cannot assure that the tax authorities or the courts will accept the views expressed in this section the following summary describes the current tax structure applicable to companies in israel with special reference to its effect on us the following also contains a discussion of the material israeli tax consequences to holders of our ordinary shares        general corporate tax structure in israel   israeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax in  and  the corporate tax rates were of their taxable income the corporate tax rate for  is  however the effective tax rate payable by a company that derives income from an approved enterprise a preferred enterprise or a beneficiary enterprise as discussed below may be considerably less capital gains derived by an israeli company are generally subject to the prevailing corporate tax rate tax benefits and grants for research and development israeli tax law allows under certain conditions a tax deduction for expenditures including capital expenditures for the year in which they are incurred expenditures are deemed related to scientific research and development projects if   · the expenditures are approved by the relevant israeli government ministry determined by the field of research   · the research and development must be for the promotion of the company and   · the research and development is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction the amount of such deductible expenses is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants for the finance of such scientific research and development projects no deduction under these research and development deduction rules is allowed if such deduction is related to an expense invested in an asset depreciable under the general depreciation rules of the income tax ordinance  expenditures not so approved are deductible in equal amounts over three years   from time to time we may apply the office of the chief scientist for approval to allow a tax deduction for all research and development expenses during the year incurred there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted law for the encouragement of industry taxes  the law for the encouragement of industry taxes  generally referred to as the industry encouragement law provides several tax benefits for industrial companies we believe that we currently qualify as an “industrial company” within the meaning of the industry encouragement law the industry encouragement law defines “industrial company” as a company resident in israel of which  or more of its income in any tax year other than of income from defense loans capital gains interest and dividend is derived from an “industrial enterprise” owned by it an “industrial enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial production activity the following corporate tax benefits among others are available to industrial companies   · amortization of the cost of purchased knowhow and patents and of rights to use a patent and knowhow which are used for the development or advancement of the company over an eightyear period   · under specified conditions an election to file consolidated tax returns with additional related israeli industrial companies and   · expenses related to a public offering in israel and in recognized stock markets outside israel are deductible in equal amounts over three years          under certain tax laws and regulations an “industrial enterprise” may be eligible for special depreciation rates for machinery equipment and buildings these rates differ based on various factors including the date the operations begin and the number of work shifts an “industrial company” owning an approved enterprise may choose between these special depreciation rates and the depreciation rates available to the approved enterprise eligibility for the benefits under the industry encouragement law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority we can give no assurance that we qualify or will continue to qualify as an “industrial company” or that the benefits described above will be available in the future   special provisions relating to taxation under inflationary conditions the income tax law inflationary adjustments  generally referred to as the inflationary adjustments law represents an attempt to overcome the problems presented to a traditional tax system by an economy undergoing rapid inflation according to the inflationary adjustments law until  the results for tax purposes were adjusted for the changes in the israeli cpi in february  the “knesset” the israeli parliament passed an amendment to the inflationary adjustments law which limits the scope of the law starting  and thereafter starting  the results for tax purposes are measured in nominal values excluding certain adjustments for changes in the israeli cpi carried out in the period up to december   the amendment to the inflationary adjustments law includes inter alia the elimination of the inflationary additions and deductions and the additional deduction for depreciation starting  israeli transfer pricing regulations on november   the income tax regulations determination of market terms  promulgated under section a of the tax ordinance came into effect the “tp regulations” section a of the tax ordinance and the tp regulations generally require that all crossborder transactions carried out between related parties be conducted on an arm’s length basis and be taxed accordingly  the tp regulations are not expected to have a material effect on us tax benefits under the law for encouragement of capital investments  tax benefits prior the  amendment   the law for the encouragement of capital investments  as amended effective as of april   generally referred to as the investments law provides that a proposed capital investment in eligible facilities may upon application to the investment center of the ministry of industry and commerce of the state of israel be designated as an “approved enterprise”  the investment center bases its decision as to whether or not to approve an application among other things on the criteria set forth in the investments law and regulations the policy of the investment center and the specific objectives and financial criteria of the applicant each certificate of approval for an approved enterprise relates to a specific investment program delineated both by its financial scope including its capital sources and by its physical characteristics such as the equipment to be purchased and utilized pursuant to the program the investments law provides that an approved enterprise is eligible for tax benefits on taxable income derived from its approved enterprise programs the tax benefits under the investments law also apply to income generated by a company from the grant of a usage right with respect to knowhow developed by the approved enterprise income generated from royalties and income derived from a service which is auxiliary to such usage right or royalties provided that such income is generated within the approved enterprise’s ordinary course of business if a company has more than one approval or only a portion of its capital investments are approved its effective tax rate is the result of a weighted average of the applicable rates the tax benefits under the investments law are not generally available with respect to income derived from products manufactured outside of israel in addition the tax benefits available to an approved enterprise are contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions stipulated in the investments law and regulations and the criteria set forth in the specific certificate of approval as described above in the event that a company does not meet these conditions it would be required to refund the amount of tax benefits plus a consumer price index linkage adjustment and interest          the investments law also provides that an approved enterprise is entitled to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment that are included in an approved enterprise program in the first five years of using the equipment taxable income of a company derived from an approved enterprise is subject to corporate tax at the maximum rate of  rather than the regular corporate tax rate for the benefit period this period is ordinarily seven years commencing with the year in which the approved enterprise first generates taxable income after the commencement of production and is limited to twelve years from commencement of production or fourteen years from the date of approval whichever is earlier this time limitation does not apply to the exemption period described below should we derive income from sources other than the approved enterprise during the relevant period of benefits such income will be taxable at the regular corporate tax rates under certain circumstances as further detailed below the benefit period may extend to a maximum of ten years from the commencement of the benefit period a company may elect to receive an alternative package of benefits under the alternative package of benefits a company’s undistributed income derived from the approved enterprise will be exempt from corporate tax for a period of between two and ten years from the first year the company derives taxable income under the program after the commencement of production depending on the geographic location of the approved enterprise within israel and such company will be eligible for a reduced tax rate for the remainder of the benefits period   the year’s limitation does not apply to the exemption period a company that has elected the alternative package of benefits such as us that subsequently pays a dividend out of income derived from the approved enterprises during the tax exemption period will be subject to corporate tax in the year the dividend is distributed in respect of the gross amount distributed  at the rate which would have been applicable had the company not elected the alternative package of benefits generally  depending on the percentage of the company’s ordinary shares held by foreign shareholders the dividend recipient is subject to withholding tax at the reduced rate of  applicable to dividends from approved enterprises if the dividend is distributed during the tax exemption period or within twelve years thereafter in the event however that the company is qualifies as a foreign investors’ company there is no such time limitation as of december   we believe that we are meeting the aforementioned conditions                   foreign investor’s company “fic” a company that has an approved enterprise program is eligible for further tax benefits if it qualifies as a foreign investors’ company a foreign investors’ company is a company of which among other criteria more than  of its share capital and combined share and loan capital is owned by nonisraeli residents a company that qualifies as a foreign investors’ company and has an approved enterprise program is eligible for tax benefits for a tenyear benefit period as specified above depending on the geographic location of the approved enterprise within israel income derived from the approved enterprise program may be entitled to the following     · extension of the benefit period to up to ten years            · an additional period of reduced corporate tax liability at rates ranging between  and  depending on the level of foreign that is nonisraeli ownership of our shares those tax rates and the related levels of foreign investment are as set forth in the following table region a   rate of reduced tax   reduced tax period   tax exemption period   percent of foreign ownership     years    years        years    years        years    years        years    years

years    years        years    years        years    years      the twelve years limitation period for reduced tax rate of  on dividend from the approved enterprise will not apply subject to applicable provisions concerning income under the alternative package of benefits dividends paid by a company are considered to be attributable to income received from the entire company and the company’s effective tax rate is the result of a weighted average of the various applicable tax rates excluding any taxexempt income under the investments law a company that has elected the alternative package of benefits is not obliged to distribute retained profits and may generally decide from which year’s profits to declare dividends in  the production facilities of the company related to its computational technologies were granted the status of an “approved enterprise” under the law in  an expansion program was granted the status of “approved enterprise” according to the provisions of the law the company has elected the alternative package of benefits and has waived government grants in return for tax benefits   tax benefits under the  amendment an amendment to the investments law generally referred as the  amendment effective as of april   has significantly changed the provisions of the investments law the amendment includes revisions to the criteria for investments qualified to receive tax benefits as an approved enterprise the  amendment applies to new investment programs and investment programs commencing after  and does not apply to investment programs approved prior to december   and therefore to benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted before the  amendment came into effect which will remain subject to the provisions of the investments law as they were on the date of such approval        however a company that was granted benefits according to section  of the investments law prior the  amendment will not be allowed to choose new tax year as a “year of election” referred to below under the  amendment for a period of two years from the company’s previous commencement year referred to below under the old investments law the  amendment simplifies the approval process for the approved enterprise according to the  amendment only approved enterprises receiving cash grants require the approval of the investment center as a result of the  amendment it is no longer necessary for a company to acquire approved enterprise status in order to receive the tax benefits previously available under the alternative route and therefore such companies need not apply to the investment center for this purpose rather a company may claim the tax benefits offered by the investments law directly in its tax returns or by notifying the israeli tax authority within twelve months of the end of that year provided that its facilities meet the criteria for tax benefits set out by the  amendment such enterprise is referred to as the benefited enterprise companies are also granted a right to approach the israeli tax authority for a preruling regarding their eligibility for benefits under the  amendment the  amendment includes provisions attempting to ensure that a company will not enjoy both government grants and tax benefits for the same investment program tax benefits are available under the  amendment to production facilities or other eligible facilities which are generally required to derive more than  of their business income from export in order to receive the tax benefits the  amendment states that a company must make an investment in the benefited enterprise exceeding a certain percentage or a minimum amount specified in the investments law such investment may be made over a period of no more than three years ending at the end of the year in which the company requested to have the tax benefits apply to the benefited enterprise or the year of election where the company requests to have the tax benefits apply to an expansion of existing facilities then only the expansion will be considered a benefited enterprise and the company’s effective tax rate will be the result of a weighted average of the applicable rates in this case the minimum investment required in order to qualify as a benefited enterprise is required to exceed a certain percentage or a minimum amount of the company’s production assets at the end of the year before the expansion the duration of tax benefits is subject to a limitation of the earlier of seven to ten years from the commencement year or twelve years from the first day of the year of election the commencement year is defined as the later of a the first tax year in which a company had derived income for tax purposes from the beneficiary enterprise or b the year in which a company requested to have the tax benefits apply to the beneficiary enterprise – year of election the tax benefits granted to a benefited enterprise are determined as applicable to its geographic location within israel according to one of the following new tax routes which may be applicable to us   · similar to the currently available alternative route exemption from corporate tax on undistributed income for a period of two to ten years depending on the geographic location of the benefited enterprise within israel and a reduced corporate tax rate of  to  for the remainder of the benefits period depending on the level of foreign investment in each year  benefits may be granted for a term of seven to ten years depending on the level of foreign investment in the company if the company pays a dividend out of income derived from the benefited enterprise during the tax exemption period such income will be subject to corporate tax at the applicable rate  in respect of the gross amount of the dividend that we may be distributed the company is required to withhold tax at the source at a rate of  from any dividends distributed from income derived from the benefited enterprise and          · a special tax route which enables companies owning facilities in certain geographical locations in israel to pay corporate tax at the rate of  on income of the benefited enterprise the benefits period is ten years upon payment of dividends the company is required to withhold tax at source at a rate of  for israeli residents and at a rate of  for foreign residents generally a company that is abundant in foreign investment owned by at least  foreign shareholders and has undertaken to invest a minimum sum of  million in the beneficiary enterprise as defined in the investments law is entitled to an extension of the benefits period by an additional five years depending on the rate of its income that is derived in foreign currency the  amendment changes the definition of “foreign investment” in the investments law so that the definition now requires a minimal investment of nis  million by foreign investors furthermore such definition now also includes the purchase of shares of a company from another shareholder provided that the company’s outstanding and paidup share capital exceeds nis  million such changes to the aforementioned definition will take effect retroactively from  as a result of the  amendment taxexempt income generated under the provisions of the investments law as amended will subject us to taxes upon distribution or liquidation and we may be required to record deferred tax liability with respect to such taxexempt income we elected the years of  and  as “year of election” under the investments law after the  amendment we expect that a substantial portion of any taxable operating income that we may realize in the future will be derived from our approved enterprise status we currently intend to reinvest any income derived from our approved enterprise program and not to distribute such income as a dividend as of december   we did not generate income under the provisions of the investments law   tax benefits under the  amendment as of january   new legislation amending to the investment law came into effect the “ amendment” the  amendment introduced a new status of “preferred company” and “preferred enterprise” replacing the existed status of “beneficiary company” and “beneficiary enterprise” similarly to “beneficiary company” a preferred company is an industrial company owning a preferred enterprise which meets certain conditions including a minimum threshold of  export however under this new legislation the requirement for a minimum investment in productive assets was cancelled   under the  amendment a uniform corporate tax rate will apply to all qualifying income of the preferred company as opposed to the former law which was limited to income from the approved enterprises and beneficiary enterprise during the benefits period  the uniform corporate tax rate will be   in areas in israel designated as development zone a and  elsewhere in israel during   and  respectively in  a dividend distributed from income which is attributed to a preferred enterprisespecial preferred enterprise will be subject to withholding tax at source at the following rates i israeli resident corporation –  ii israeli resident individual –  in  and  as of  iii nonisraeli resident   in  and  as of  subject to a reduced tax rate under the provisions of an applicable double tax treaty        the provisions of the  amendment also provided transitional provisions to address companies already enjoying current benefits these transitional provisions provide among other things that  unless an irrevocable request is made to apply the provisions of the investment law as amended in  with respect to income to be derived as of january   i the terms and benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted to an approved enterprise which chose to receive grants before the  amendment came into effect will remain subject to the provisions of the investment law as in effect on the date of such approval and subject to certain conditions ii terms and benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted to an approved enterprise which had participated in an alternative benefits program before the  amendment came into effect will remain subject to the provisions of the investment law as in effect on the date of such approval provided that certain conditions are met and iii a beneficiary enterprise can elect to continue to benefit from the benefits provided to it before the  amendment came into effect provided that certain conditions are met under the transition provisions of the new legislation a company may decide to irrevocably implement the new law while waiving benefits provided under the current law or to remain subject to the current law we intend to implement the new legislation in  tax benefits under the  amendment   special provisions relating to taxation under inflationary conditions   under the income tax inflationary adjustments law  the “israeli law” results for tax purposes are measured in real terms in accordance with the changes in the israeli consumer price index israeli cpi accordingly until  results for tax purposes were measured in terms of earnings in nis after certain adjustments for increases in the israeli cpi commencing in the taxable year  we have elected to measure our taxable income and file our tax return under the israeli income tax regulations principles regarding the management of books of account of foreign invested companies and certain partnerships and the determination of their taxable income  this election is for a threeyear period accordingly commencing in the taxable year    capital gains tax on sales of our ordinary shares   israeli law generally imposes a capital gains tax on the sale of any capital assets by residents of israel as defined for israeli tax purposes and on the sale of assets located in israel including shares in israeli companies by both residents and nonresidents of israel unless a specific exemption is available or a tax treaty between israel and the shareholder’s country of residence provides otherwise the law distinguishes between real gain and inflationary surplus the inflationary surplus is a portion of the total capital gain which is equivalent to the increase of the relevant asset’s purchase price which is attributable to the increase in the israeli consumer price index or in certain circumstances a foreign currency exchange rate between the date of purchase and the date of sale the real gain is the excess of the total capital gain over the inflationary surplus   generally until the  tax year capital gains tax was imposed on individuals who are israeli residents at a rate of  on real gains derived on or after january   from the sale of shares in israeli companies publicly traded on nasdaq or another recognized stock exchange or regulated market in a country that has a treaty for the prevention of double taxation with israel this tax rate was contingent upon the shareholder not claiming a deduction for financing expenses in connection with such shares in which case the gain was generally taxed at a rate of  and did not apply to i the sale of shares to a relative as defined in the israeli income tax ordinance ii the sale of shares by dealers in securities iii the sale of shares by shareholders that report in accordance with the inflationary adjustments law that were taxed at corporate tax rates for corporations and at marginal tax rates for individuals or iv the sale of shares by shareholders who acquired their shares prior to an initial public offering that may be subject to a different tax arrangement          as of january   the tax rate applicable to capital gains derived from the sale of shares whether listed on a stock market or not is  for israeli individuals unless such shareholder claims a deduction for financing expenses in connection with such shares in which case the gain is generally taxed at a rate of  additionally if such shareholder is considered a “material shareholder” at any time during the month period preceding such sale ie such shareholder holds directly or indirectly including with others at least  of any means of control in a company the tax rate is  israeli companies are subject to the corporate tax rate on capital gains derived from the sale of shares unless such companies were not subject to the adjustments law or certain regulations at the time of publication of the aforementioned amendment to the tax ordinance that came into effect on january   in which case the applicable tax rate is  however the foregoing tax rates do not apply to i dealers in securities and ii shareholders who acquired their shares prior to an initial public offering that may be subject to a different tax arrangement   the tax basis of shares acquired prior to january   is determined in accordance with the average closing share price in the three trading days preceding january   however a request may be made to the tax authorities to consider the actual adjusted cost of the shares as the tax basis if it is higher than such average price   nonisraeli residents are exempt from israeli capital gains tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares of israeli companies publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange or regulated market outside of israel provided that such capital gains are not derived from a permanent establishment in israel the shareholders are not subject to the adjustments law and the shareholders did not acquire their shares prior to an initial public offering however nonisraeli corporations will not be entitled to such exemption if an israeli resident i has a controlling interest of  or more in such nonisraeli corporation or ii is the beneficiary or is entitled to  or more of the revenues or profits of such nonisraeli corporation whether directly or indirectly   in some instances where our shareholders may be liable to israeli tax on the sale of their ordinary shares the payment of the consideration may be subject to the withholding of israeli tax at the source   pursuant to the convention between the government of the united states and the government of israel with respect to taxes on income as amended the “usisrael tax treaty” the sale exchange or disposition of ordinary shares by a person who i holds the ordinary shares as a capital asset ii qualifies as a resident of the united states within the meaning of the usisrael tax treaty and iii is entitled to claim the benefits afforded to such person by the usisrael tax treaty generally will not be subject to the israeli capital gains tax such exemption will not apply if i such us resident holds directly or indirectly shares representing  or more of our voting power during any part of the month period preceding such sale exchange or disposition subject to certain conditions or ii the capital gains from such sale exchange or disposition can be allocated to a permanent establishment in israel in such case the sale exchange or disposition of ordinary shares would be subject to israeli tax to the extent applicable however under the usisrael tax treaty such us resident would be permitted to claim a credit for such taxes against the us federal income tax imposed with respect to such sale exchange or disposition subject to the limitations in us laws applicable to foreign tax credits the usisrael tax treaty does not relate to us state or local taxes     united states federal income taxation the following is a description of the material united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares this description addresses only the united states federal income tax considerations of holders that hold such ordinary shares as capital assets this description does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules including   · financial institutions or insurance companies            · real estate investment trusts regulated investment companies or grantor trusts   · dealers or traders in securities or currencies   · taxexempt entities   · certain former citizens or longterm residents of the united states   · persons that will hold our shares through a partnership or other passthrough entity   · persons that received our shares as compensation for the performance of services   · persons that will hold our shares as part of a “hedging” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” for united states federal income tax purposes   · persons whose “functional currency” is not the united states dollar or   · holders that own directly indirectly or through attribution  or more of the voting power or value of our shares moreover this description does not address the united states federal estate and gift or alternative minimum tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares   this description is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended existing proposed and temporary united states treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in each case as in effect and available on the date hereof all of the foregoing are subject to change which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below for purposes of this description a “us holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that for united states federal income tax purposes is   · a citizen or resident of the united states   · corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any state thereof including the district of columbia   · an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or   · a trust if such trust has validly elected to be treated as a united states person for united states federal income tax purposes or if  a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and  one or more united states persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust   a “nonus holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is neither a us holder nor a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes          if a partnership or any other entity treated as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes holds our ordinary shares the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership such a partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor as to its tax consequences you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the united states federal state local and foreign tax consequences of owning and disposing of our ordinary shares distributions subject to the discussion below under “passive foreign investment company considerations” if you are a us holder for united states federal income tax purposes the gross amount of any distribution made to you with respect to our ordinary shares before reduction of any israeli taxes withheld therefrom other than certain distributions if any of our ordinary shares distribute pro rata to all our shareholders will be includible in your income as dividend income to the extent such distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under united states federal income tax principles subject to the discussion below under “passive foreign investment company considerations” noncorporate us holders may qualify for the lower rates of taxation with respect to dividends on ordinary shares applicable to longterm capital gains that is gains from the sale of capital assets held for more than one year provided that certain conditions are met including certain holding period requirements and the absence of certain risk reduction transactions however such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate us holders subject to the discussion below under “passive foreign investment company considerations” to the extent if any that the amount of any distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined under united states federal income tax principles it will be treated first as a taxfree return of your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain we do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under united states federal income tax principles and therefore if you are a us holder you should expect that the entire amount of any distribution generally will be reported as dividend income to you   if you are a us holder dividends paid to you with respect to your ordinary shares will be treated as foreign source income which may be relevant in calculating your foreign tax credit limitation subject to certain conditions and limitations israeli tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from your taxable income or credited against your united states federal income tax liability the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income for this purpose dividends that we distribute generally should constitute “passive category income” or in the case of certain us holders “general category income”  a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed on distributions may be denied when you do not satisfy certain minimum holding period requirements the rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are complex and you should consult your personal tax advisors to determine whether and to what extent you would be entitled to this credit   subject to the discussion below under “backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements” if you are a nonus holder you generally will not be subject to united states federal income or withholding tax on dividends received by you on your ordinary shares unless you conduct a trade or business in the united states and such income is effectively connected with that trade or business   sales exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares subject to the discussion below under “passive foreign investment company considerations” if you are a us holder you generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale exchange or other disposition of our ordinary shares equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale exchange or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in our ordinary shares such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you are a noncorporate us holder capital gain from the sale exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares is eligible for the preferential rate of taxation applicable to longterm capital gains if your holding period for such ordinary shares exceeds one year that is   such gain is longterm capital gain gain or loss if any recognized by you generally will be treated as united states source income or loss for united states foreign tax credit purposes the deductibility of capital losses for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitations        subject to the discussion below under “backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements” if you are a nonus holder you generally will not be subject to united states federal income or withholding tax on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of our ordinary shares unless   · such gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states or   · you are an individual and have been present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year of such sale or exchange and certain other conditions are met   passive foreign investment company considerations a nonus corporation will be classified as a “passive foreign investment company” or a pfic for united states federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which after applying certain lookthrough rules either   ·       at least  percent of its gross income is passive income or   · at least  percent of the average value of its gross assets based on the quarterly value of such gross assets is attributable to assets that produce “passive income” or are held for the production of passive income   passive income for this purpose generally includes dividends interest royalties rents gains from commodities and securities transactions and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income pfic status is an annual determination that is based on tests which are factual in nature and our status for any year will depend on our income assets and activities for such year  therefore there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a pfic for any taxable year  although we did not use the market capitalization method to value our assets in  as noted in our prior form fs we are relying on the market capitalization method to determine the fair market value of our assets for the taxable year ended december   based on certain estimates of our gross income and gross assets the nature of our business and the anticipated amount of goodwill which is determined in large part by the market price of our stock we believe that we were not a pfic for our taxable year ended december   there can be no certainty however that the irs will agree with our position  if we were a pfic and you are a us holder as further described below you generally would be subject to ordinary income tax rates imputed interest charges and other disadvantageous tax treatment including the denial of the taxation of such dividends at the lower rates applicable to longterm capital gains as discussed above under “—distributions” with respect to any gain from the sale exchange or other disposition of and certain distributions with respect to your ordinary shares we are not providing any us tax opinion to any us holder concerning our status as a pfic for  or any other tax year  a us holder should consult his her or its own tax advisor with respect to the potential application of the pfic rules in his her or its particular circumstances because the market price of our ordinary shares is likely to fluctuate and the market price of the shares of technology companies has been especially volatile and because that market price may affect the determination of whether we will be considered a pfic we cannot assure you that we will not be considered a pfic for any taxable year        under the pfic rules unless a us holder makes one of the elections described in the next paragraphs a special tax regime will apply to both a any “excess distribution” by us generally the us holder’s ratable portion of distributions in any year which are greater than  of the average annual distribution received by such us holder in the shorter of the three preceding years or the us holder’s holding period and b any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares under this regime any excess distribution and realized gain will be treated as ordinary income and will be subject to tax as if a the excess distribution or gain had been realized ratably over the us holder’s holding period b the amount deemed realized had been subject to tax in each year of that holding period and c the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax had been imposed on the taxes deemed to have been payable in those years in addition dividend distributions made to you will not qualify for the lower rates of taxation applicable to long term capital gains discussed above under “distributions”          certain elections are available to us holders of shares that may serve to alleviate some of the adverse tax consequences of pfic status if we agreed to provide the necessary information you could avoid the interest charge imposed by the pfic rules by making a qualified electing fund or a qef election which election may be made retroactively under certain circumstances in which case you generally would be required to include in income on a current basis your pro rata share of our ordinary earnings as ordinary income and your pro rata share of our net capital gains as longterm capital gain we do not expect to provide to us holders the information needed to report income and gain pursuant to a qef election and we make no undertaking to provide such information in the event that we are a pfic   under an alternative tax regime you may also avoid certain adverse tax consequences relating to pfic status discussed above by making a marktomarket election with respect to our ordinary shares annually provided that the shares are “marketable” shares will be marketable if they are regularly traded on certain us stock exchanges including nasdaq or on certain nonus stock exchanges for these purposes the shares will generally be considered regularly traded during any calendar year during which they are traded other than in negligible quantities on at least fifteen days during each calendar quarter          if you choose to make a marktomarket election you would recognize as ordinary income or loss each year an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the pfic shares and your adjusted tax basis in the pfic shares losses would be allowed only to the extent of net marktomarket gain previously included by you under the election for prior taxable years if the marktomarket election were made then the pfic rules set forth above relating to excess distributions and realized gains would not apply for periods covered by the election if you make a marktomarket election after the beginning of your holding period of our ordinary shares you would be subject to interest charges with respect to the inclusion of ordinary income attributable to the period before the effective date of such election under certain circumstances ordinary shares owned by a nonus holder may be attributed to a us person owning an interest directly or indirectly in the nonus holder in this event distributions and other transactions in respect of such ordinary shares may be treated as excess distributions with respect to such us person and a qef election may be made by such us person with respect to its indirect interest in us subject to the discussion in the preceding paragraphs          we may invest in stock of nonus corporations that are pfics in such a case provided that we are classified as a pfic a us holder would be treated as owning its pro rata share of the stock of the pfic owned by us such a us holder would be subject to the rules generally applicable to shareholders of pfics discussed above with respect to distributions received by us from such a pfic and dispositions by us of the stock of such a pfic even though the us holder may not have received the proceeds of such distribution or disposition assuming we receive the necessary information from the pfic in which we own stock certain us holders may make the qef election discussed above with respect to the stock of the pfic owned by us with the consequences discussed above however no assurance can be given that we will be able to provide us holders with such information  a us holder generally would not be able to make the marktomarket election described above with respect to the stock of any pfic owned by us        if we were a pfic a holder of ordinary shares that is a us holder must file united states internal revenue service form  for each tax year in which the us holder owns the ordinary shares   you should consult your own tax advisor regarding our potential status as a pfic and the tax consequences and filing requirements that would arise if we were treated as a pfic foreign asset reporting certain us holders who are individuals and certain specified entities are required to report information
