the number of telephone subscribers in peninsular malaysia increased significantly by  to deal with the volume of telephony traffic an automated magneto exchange was commissioned in kuala lumpur on jalan weld in the s all telephone exchanges in the malayan trunk system could communicate with exchanges in java the philippines the us canada and mexico using shortwave radiotelephone transmitters towards the end of the decade a marconi radio terminal was installed at the kuala lumpur telephone exchange to handle overseas calls much of this telecommunications infrastructure was damaged during the second world war and the japanese occupation in  when the british reestablished their position in malaya they repaired the trunk routes restored fallen telephone poles and installed the copper wires that had either been damaged or stolen during the japanese occupation the posts  telegraphs department had been split into two separate units when the british returned they initially reunited the two entities but this effort was shortlived along with the formation of the malayan union on  april  the malaysian telecommunications department and the postal services department were born with the former controlling telegraph telephone and wireless services and the latter overlooking mail money orders and savings accounts during the emergency  there was a strong focus on providing communications links for the police and armed forces this included the installation of radio stations in the jungle as well as very high frequency vhf radiotelephony over the normal state network by  all hill stop stations required for the police vhf network were completed enabling every police station and police vehicle to communicate with headquarters and with each other the police radio services were thought to be the largest scheme of its kind in the world at the same time despite the occupation commercial activities began to flourish and demand for telecommunications services increased greatly this necessitated a third floor to be built at the telephone exchange building in kuala lumpur along with the issue of  cent coins phone booths began to spring up in kuala lumpur and penang from  to  the department’s revenue more than doubled from  million to  million as the number of telephones installed rose from  to  accordingly the trunk and junction networks expanded and the number of radio stations grew by  times to more than  in  too the penang auto exchange was opened catering for  lines in  the main trunk route linking singapore to malacca kuala lumpur and penang was completed satellite exchanges began to emerge during this period international connections have also increased linking malaysia with the rest of the world as independence became imminent a comprehensive malayanisation programme was embarked on to ensure the department would continue to be run by capable local personnel from as early as  no less than  malaysians were pursuing studies in telecommunications related areas in britain and australia their numbers were boosted by youth enrolling at the department’s gracelyn training school growthedit following the country’s independence in  the malayan telecommunications department was renamed jabatan telekom one of its first tasks was to provide telecommunications facilities throughout the nation as part of the rural development plan microwave radio links were established which by  covered most urban centres in peninsular malaysia in  too the government took control of international calls from cable  wireless which had been operating malaysia’s overseas telecommunications services for almost  years subscriber trunk dialling std was introduced enabling telephone owners in kuala lumpur to call singapore directly without having to go through an operator using the first longdistance microwave link overseas calls were further enhanced with the rollout of seacom which formed part of the commonwealth cable scheme in  the federation of malaya and singapore became partners in this initiative with malaya investing about  million in it the first phase of seacom between singapore and jesselton kota kinabalu in sabah was opened on  january  on  march  the entire system was commissioned the expanding microwave network enabled jabatan telekom to launch television services in peninsular malaysia in  using the same system while radio televisyen malaysia rtm controlled the content of local tv jabatan telekom managed the transmission of microwaves from the studio to homes as prior to  sabah and sarawak were not part of the federation of malaya telecommunications services in these east malaysia states were managed independently by the telecommunications department of sabah and sarawak in  this department merged with that of peninsular malaysia to form the telecommunications department of malaysia in  further expanding malaysia’s international connectivity an earth satellite station was built near kuantan for communications via the indian ocean intelsat iii satellite the station costing  million was completed in a record  months by a fully local team the station was to serve primarily external telephone telegraph and telex communications however it also enhanced the reception of international television programmes ln  the international telex exchange was opened allowing businesses to send telexes four years later international direct dialling idd services were introduced and the first electronic exchange was commissioned in johor bahru the volume of new development was such that in the early s the department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network in terms of systems the year  was a watershed this was when automatic telephone using radio atur  – the earliest precursor in malaysia to today’s mobile service – was introduced the service provided almost universal coverage with the installation of five mobile telephone exchanges and many radio base stations in line with the government’s privatisation agenda and in recognition of the benefits jabatan telekom would enjoy unencumbered by policies and budgets steps towards this end were

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
