cotecolisson  hsbc research division frederic boulan  nomura securities co ltd research division vincent maulay  oddo securities research division stephane richard good morning to everybody welcome to the presentation of the h results of the orange group for  and i think we can now call the company by its name first of all i would like to emphasize the major point  the key points for these results and well talk about the performance of the group in the first half of the year first of all commercially speaking weve had very good interesting figures for the first half of the year with good performance from the mobile market in france and poland well come back to that in a few minutes france very good results there good performance from spain as well and the second major point id like to talk about is the speeding up of the results and the efforts which we are making in terms of changing our cost structure in the group our aim was to have an annual reduction of eur  million and weve achieved the  of this figure already at the end of june so i think that we will be beyond this figure of eur  million by the end of the year if we look at some of the key trends underlying these figures first of all let me start with the  countries which for different reasons in fact are what everybody else is focusing on france first of all h in a market which is a very dynamic market in fact we have demonstrated the fact that we can really play our role to the indiscernible on this market i think  outstanding projects the open quadruple play sosh and the origami package which has been redesigned and we have positive net sales over the first half of the year and even for the second quarter of  weve got the strongest growth in a quarter for customer base since the arrival of the fourth operator and in q  we had a  market conquest which is slightly below our mediumterm objectives but nevertheless it is up compared with q up  points and this is supported by the development of our fiber base and the good figures which are coming in from the livebox play so all of this has meant that weve been able to preserve our market share and were fully in line with what we said in terms arpu going down arpu which should be down  to  over the year a reduction in arpu therefore with a reduction nevertheless in the churn rate let me also point out to you that at the end of  roughly  of our major customers will have an offer which will be launched after the arrival of the fourth entrant on the market there i think by then  by the end of this year the arrival of the new operator on the market will really have been taken into account on the market overall so the performance for the cost structure modification overall for france has been very positive as i said weve been aiming for a total reduction in direct costs of  a total reduction of eur  million poland this is a market which is  or has been suffering a great deal from repricing this was a major problem last year and it led us to undertake pretty energetic plans for last year to overcome this but weve got encouraging results coming in the sales are above expectations and as in france we have net sales which are particularly on the mobile contracts so these are above expectations and these are very encouraging results indeed especially compared to  with the figures for the same time last year bearing in mind of course that there was the positive effect of the euro  competition last year if we look at the rest of europe pretty positive results there with  countries out of  growing in terms of those figures and extra regulatory affairs spain romania luxembourg moldavia armenia and the dominican republic as well we have growth recovering in spain i would say outstanding results there for the group in spain with sales up  excluding the regulatory affairs in q and this is a very important figure for us its actually a record which we are registering here plus  conquest on broadband excellent figures there i think this result is absolutely outstanding in amea we have a  increase in q slightly above the figure for q which was at  and this is driven by some countries in particular côte d’ivoire senegal egypt and guinea egypt in fact had very good results in the month of june there was a  increase compared with  so this was for egypt in june once again we have great success from the mobile banking service orange money and the number of customers there has grown by  now standing at  million just a few points to give you about the uk very good results from everything everywhere very strong results in ebitda which is up  and at the end of june roughly  customers for the g service which are bringing in extra arpu of roughly  compared with the g if we look at belgium where weve had a few more problems and obviously the regulatory situation in that country has made things very difficult for us from the beginning of the year mobistar is really between a rock and a hard place between the fx and mobile operators i dont want to go into all the details you may have questions on that later on but let me just point out that the regulatory problems and weaknesses in this country are really having an impact on the balance of competition weve seen a very strong decrease in the mobile prices which are now being used as an attractive price to bring in customers this is what the fixed players are doing whereas the tripleplay prices adsl and cable are the highest there of all the surrounding countries so this is really leading to problems and we do hope that the situation  the competition situation will balance out in belgium in the shortterm on the enterprise side the economy in general particularly in france of course is suffering generally speaking and therefore this has had an impact on our sales figures on our revenue however our market share and the revenues from the cloud are continuing to hold steady for the cloud the figures have gone up by  overall for h and i think this is definitely the good news to give you the ebitda margin for the group has gone down very slightly but its only gone down by  which is much better than the figure which we had in h  when the figure went down by  so i think that we really are looking forward to our landing  the landing which were planning for  with our target of eur  billion operating cash flow for the end of this year and were already at eur  billion cash flow eur  billion for the end of june so we have achieved over  of our target already ill say a few words now about the marketing initiatives which have reinforced the main markets where we operate particularly in the latest first quarter i talked about france sosh and open we have  million customers for sosh  million for open real successes there not just in france but in most european countries as well for the livebox play this is a product which was launched in february and now we have  customers using this one interesting figure to look at is the g figures its still early days of course but i can tell you that at the end of june we have  access customers using g on our french network and these customers have usage of the g with  above of that other customers and the arpu is  up  months after its launch now these are figures which we have to be careful with of course were going to be using the g putting the g on the market for the past few months but these are very encouraging figures and we launched a convergent offer based on sosh with internet and the tv access and now the aim is to have  customers at the end of the year and finally we launched a service which we called guaranteed hours which really plays on the differentiation between the premium offers with excellent services attached to this offer so that we can stand out from the lowcost operators and we also launched a new mobile service called joyn in june which i announced back in november last year in the hello show if we look at spain we have the convergent canguro offer which was launched in april and we now have more than  customers on the g side we launched at the beginning of july we launched the g there in spain with the aim to cover more than  of the population at the end of  and we are the operator with most sites there and we are pretty certain of holding or sticking to our target of  million customers in  year in poland we have the lowcost nju brand which has started off over  customers there in  months and one interesting point there is that  of the customers are nju customers so this is really a very good way of winning back customers for the rest of europe the animals offer which has been launched in slovakia is doing well  doing very well the animals have  million customers weve got the go europe package which includes substantial reductions in the roaming parcel which were decided on by the eu last year and the aim is to sell at least  million go europe packages this year and to double the traffic on this and i think that we are even slightly ahead of the target for this product and let me point out again that weve launched a new tv paytv service in romania in june with dailymotion  working with dailymotion and there too the launch has been extremely encouraging for africa at least we are continuing to roll out the g with a spectacular increase in the number of orange customers who use the data services we have an increase of  in the number of these customers compared to  and then i talked about orange money if i could just talk to you about the average monthly transaction volume figures weve got eur  million there eur  million and really countries where the orange money services really significantly changed the habits of  the transactional habits of customers if we look now at cost reduction because this is one of the major contributors to the figures of this half year which really demonstrates that the group is totally committed to mastering its cost structure both direct and indirect costs and as ive said we have a target of eur  million savings for  and you will see on the diagram on page  there that weve already achieved a figure of eur  million eur  million for indirect costs the cost savings in fact speeded up in the h of  as i said eur  million reduction on indirect costs with eur  million coming to us in q weve really been very good on tackling the indirect costs and the ncr cuts as well the main contributor to these reductions is france through  main levers first of all reduction in headcount we have a reduction of  people in france or fulltime equivalents though we are working hard on this in france were working on the parttime people as well plus the departure programs there for the seniors in the company and weve also done very well in terms of the chrysalid plan the operational efficiency plan after which the reduction in headcount has not been so much a part of our financial project but there was an operational project working on quality of service in fact i can give you one example of this theres been very significant reductions in the number of calls we receive in the call centers and also roughly  reduction in the redirect to all call centers the people calling up several times  customers calling several times because theyve not been satisfied with the outfit the first time around so this really reflects the quality improvement and thanks to this weve been able to contribute even more to the overall effort in keeping a lid on the cost structure if we say a few words about the g now this is one of the major priorities of the group being  we want to be one of the leaders in g fixed and mobile so for g this has been launched in  countries so far france spain luxembourg romania moldavia uk and the dominican republic now i talked about the uk just now and we are the only company offering the g in the uk so we cover roughly  of the population and we have excellent performances on our g network with ultrahigh speed offers of which are really far better than those of our competitors we have an extra arpu of roughly  as i said in france we are far and away leaders in the rollout of the g we have over  towns and cities which are covered by the g we have x more active sites than our closest competitor and we have theoretical speeds which are way beyond those which our competitors could even hope to achieve and this is thanks to the quality of the spectrum which we use and as you recall we started for a indiscernible  months ago so for spain we launched the g in the beginning of july in madrid and  other cities as well for fiber now fiber optics we have a eur  billion investment for  if we look at where we stand at the moment compared with last year it was double the number of customers who are connectable and weve also doubled the numbers  the number of customers who have been connected we now have  customers when i came into this job in  we had  fiber optics really give us an average increase in arpu of eur  thanks to the content as for the g our strategy which is to be the leader in the rollout of ultrahigh speed in order to provide better services to our customers this strategy is working the initial results are extremely encouraging for fiber optics there we have a market share of  now and these figures are very encouraging theyre very very good they demonstrate where we stand visàvis our competitors some of whom are extremely aggressive on prices in order to promote their product but we have as i said a very good market share of  we are a legitimate incumbent operator in spain let me remind you that we signed an agreement to roll out those fiber optics there with vodafone eur  million in total with an investment of  through the investment agreement with vodafone and we have also an agreement there with telefonica to have access to the vertical fiber optics with these agreements the aim is to be able to connect up to  households at the end of q  we are continuing to work on adsl of course and then finally in poland where the fixed high speed we have  million customers who can be connected up this is through the vdsl principally and we have  customers who have actually been connected up already at the beginning of  we also  we pointed out some operating objectives im not going to give you the details of the table but i would like to underscore the fact that midyear  as you can see with the green lights here we are in line with virtually all of our objectives and quite ahead in certain cases if you take the increase in data of revenue  in h the annual objective is  the billions ph as our mobile market share in france  were well above the objective which is  indiscernible we mentioned fiber g we mentioned orange money too regarding something thats a little more complicated id like to say a word about the livebox play were somewhat shy of the objective which is the success of growth sales in broadband using livebox play were somewhat shy of that this essentially ascribed to the fact that we had to cast particular efforts on lowend offers without the livebox play to respond to the aggressiveness of one of our competitors who has put promotion upon promotion and offered great deals so we could not offer with livebox and hence the effects of the indiscernible to date also we decided not to cut the prices of our premium propositions in which we  also the livebox plays so that of course preserves the future value of the market thats how it was  thats how its panned out now a word about the  guidance the quality of these h  results allows us to clearly confirm our operating cash flow above eur  billion in  thats the first very important item as far as balance sheet is concerned wed also like to point out that our net debt to ebitda ratio is  will be tending towards x at the end of  and will be around x in  you must construe this ratio apart from the impact of a tax dispute thats going to start recurring and  days ago our appeal was turned down but of course were going to appeal again so this is a significant tax dispute significant tax  a substantial gervais pellissier will give you the minute details of the tax dispute the montreuil court sentence that we have an appeal for will lead us to cash out eur  billion by the end of july and of course it will have an impact on the ratio but apart from this oneshot impact which has been on provision for a long time anyway our financial balance sheet discipline will of course play their role this balance sheet discipline of ours and the confidence that senior staff has in meeting the effective indiscernible ebitda at the end of december  lead us to fully confirm our dividend payout policy with dividend at least eur  per share with an interim dividend thats eur  that will be settled on the th of december as far as portfolio of businesses is concerned we have decided to examine our operations in the dominican republic which could lead us to consider potential buyers which ill keep you abreast in a potential presentation okay before handing it over to gervais i would like to close the presentation by stressing the  key highlights of h  first sharp acceleration of the efforts cast on our cost structure the objectives for  will probably be exceeded at the end of the year and the performance and cost reduction was quite notable in h and this means that we are well underway to stabilize ebitda next year second thing i would like to underscore is the very encouraging startup of g in the uk and in france this demonstrates that theres appetite on the customers side and we can create a value with this ultrahigh speed proposition and the success and the conquest of share indiscernible of highspeed fiber in spite of tough competition and the significant addition in arpu that is what i had to tell you all this brings me and my staff to be reasonably confident and fully mobilized to meet the indiscernible in  its well within reach and the demand  the dynamics we have in h  regarding cost structure and commercial performance enables us to believe that this  indiscernible is indeed quite achievable let me hand it over to gervais gervais gilles pellissier thank you stephane i will now comment on the first half financial and operational results were on slide  you see here the main aggregates regarding our revenue trend indiscernible minus  in h with regulatory impact still weighing in france and in europe the good news is that in the indiscernible end of the cycle of indiscernible cuts there will be fewer reductions due to regulations moving ahead in fact theres still some uncertainty regarding roaming in europe and we have already factored all that into our operations and theres also the macroeconomic impact whether it be in france or in spain in particular second thing is that despite this deteriorating revenue trend theres a decline in h thats somewhat greater than in h nevertheless we are containing margin erosion thats the margin erosion and were even doing a little bit better in q than in q against this difficult backdrop as stephane said we maintained investments a  rise in investment in absolute terms which is far from negligible whereas theres a lot of pressure there on sales and in spite of that and with the work done on our cost structure we can meet our operating cash flow for the full year because we already have eur  billion in h of the eur  billion that weve committed to regarding the full year regarding net debt or ebitda ill come back to that later on when i speak about the tax dispute but the tax dispute itself exerts pressure on the ratio of  it raised by  and that of course will be factored into the full year account because since the settlement is on the th of july its not in our books for the th of june regarding the details here we are moving on to slide  in france revenue was down  excluding regulatory impact it still has the impact of the repricing in our mobile customer base but that is tapering off because  of our customers are expected  the tariff postiliad launch in spain we still have solid growth but there are  of the repricing matters and the arpu decline is comparable in spain to france there are gains in broadband that make it possible to have growing sales even if you consider regulatory impact and were probably the best performer on the spanish market in that regard so in poland we also have tariff cuts reductions and that of course has consequences on revenue mobile revenue and in other european countries well mobistar i mean for a specific point other countries grew slightly past the middle east all grew by nearly  with very positive growth levels in the countries such as senegal and côte divoire countries where mobile business has reached maturity regarding enterprise as mentioned well they affect consumption actually due to the macroeconomic situations indiscernible and that explains the pressure exerted on revenue in h for enterprise slide  ebitda as mentioned ebitda is contained towards the erosion under  point down essentially on the strength of the efforts made on costs direct costs were down  and indirect costs were down by eur  million with significant improvements regarding cost of labor our network operating content on ga as well and here we need to point out the performance of orange france which accounts for virtually all of the groups indiscernible others have indeed but this is offset by increases in countries where sales have been rising regarding the cost of labor opex for the first time ever our labor opex went down due to the staffing because we have savings greater than the increase  than the slight increase in payroll expenses in france oustide france were at  in average of payroll expense right and outside france there can be inflation in some cases not that were more or less generous in our pay policy depending on the countries its because inflation varies from  country to the next and in emerging countries inflation is rather high and that explains the rise in payroll expenses so we saved eur  million h in labor opex ascribed to the effect of the parttime senior  senior parttime plan versus eur  million last year regarding capex youll see the geographical breakdown here as stephane pointed out the  priorities are g and fiber but if you look at this under the surface you can see that all the countries have slightly increased their capex there are  exceptions enterprise their capex has to do with customer contracts there is less sales with the customers so theres less capex we spend capex on other customers contracts and the other one is rest of the world there major investment programs in submarine cables and g deployment were essentially focused on emerging countries last year in the programs so are less ambitious this year despite slowdown there in  moving on to this tax dispute that stephane broached upon and there is a specific release by orange this has to be put into the accounting and tax context of the france télécom group which is now orange in  to  our group accounted roughly eur  billion in losses eur  billion in losses gave rise to eur  billion in potential tax savings due to the fact that we could absorb future profit with the losses incurred but as most of you know it is difficult to coordinate the legal and accounting organization of a group with its tax organization all groups have that problem and that problem has to do with the french organization only and the french intermediate holding cogecom recorded a major portion of these losses but up until  the tax administration did not recognize the way in which provisions were calculated for asset impairment whereby we could deduct the losses the administration has changed its calculation systems since then so thats the way it was there is no deductibility although the provisions accounted for actual losses in the groups business there has been a restructuring of france telecom conducted from  onwards and many things have been done including the legal streamlining there were  legal entities and in the streamlining effort made there were companies that were bought all over the world so all this was streamlined and the holding cogecom was dissolved and put into france telecom sa from an accounting standpoint we had to take over the provisions that has been accrued and in order to avoid double taxation since the provisions could not be deducted when they were accrued the group considered that they should not be reintegrated when they were taken over so they were not to be considered as profit since they cannot be deducted when they had been accrued and that is what this tax dispute with the administration is all about following a tax audit that we were expecting in fact they did not recognize the situation its peculiar or unfair double taxation situation i mean there was no connection between what happened before  and what happened after  considering that there was an after and a before and there was a comparison between apples and oranges hence the dispute since the tax audit in  nevertheless out of caution the group has been communicating on this you have the information in our reference documents since the closing of  and we built up provision for the risk taking into consideration of the quarter tax in advance both in our pl and in our balance sheet so since  the amount that we have paid out temporarily to the administration have been considered as tax spew amounting to eur  billion for the main portion and there are  theres interest of i think eur  million so from a tax standpoint this has to take place because its legitimate and the group has the right to have this tax savings also the question has to do with  regarding the financial management of the group yes because if we hadnt done the eur  billion it would have to be cashed out from  to  but actually this was financed at  which is below the average cost of the groups debt so of course it appears as a rather sudden event this court ruling but at the same time in terms of the management of the company it was a good decision to the extent that we have not lost the administration has not requested any damage or compensation or penalties and the administration and the court recognized our good faith and so we do believe that the administrative court of appeal in versailles and indiscernible will prove us right nevertheless while were writing up do tax leads to a mechanical deterioration of our netnet over ebitda ratio because of course the translation of a line in the balance sheet amounted to eur  billion has a  impact on the ratio i believe that the market and the analysts has well identified the dispute the judgment that people had about the success potential may have varied but its also fair to say that this is early days were in the infant stages of the procedure theres  more instances of appeal to reach for the end of the story and the end of the story is by  so eur  billion is an opportunity someday orange will be given eur  billion and we must consider that as an option thats part of the groups value okay now moving on to net profit so net income is not impacted by the tax dispute by any stretch of the imagination because it has been factored into the results at the closing of  and even in the closing of the books in  so net income is down due to the pressure on ebitda and due to the fact that we had to write up provisions to the tune of roughly eur  million regarding the value of our shares in mobistar as the main item there are pluses and minuses but thats the bulk of it all and that explains the price change from last year if we take a look at debt as of th of june before the eur  billion do not forget that the group has continued to alleviate its debt by eur  million in h as pointed out in the bar chart on slide  here and we still pay out the dividend and we still have the same expenses and there is a slight increase in wcr in h as always so we have  at the end of june and we believe that the ratio will stay like that at the end of the year and it will increase roughly  taking into consideration the eur  billion paid to the tax administration on the th of july our debt structure remains at the high level of liquidity to face up to events such as what i just described it would also improve maturity above eur  billion the next one in  its already partly prefinanced as of  there is no amount to be paid above eur  billion compared with the groups operating cash flow you see that we are quite cautious indeed and that probably places us among the bestinclass in the telecoms industry in europe which means that we still have our ratings although its quite likely that the rating agencies may scratch their heads following the eur  billion element in the taxes which is why weve improved the maturity of our debt  years x greater than that of other large groups in the telecom industry in france and its x x greater than that of the european group now ill skip over the country breakdown and i will say a few words about france and spain now in france as stephane pointed out h was good in terms of the business nevertheless it does not fully reflect on the top line because the top line is impacted by the effects of repricing which carry over from   there will be less in  the good news is that in spite of the pressure on sales sales shall remain under control because today we can confirm that the decline in arpu in march weve said that it would be anywhere between  and  and now we can say that it will be around  so the second quarter did not bring any bad news regarding the decline in arpu over the full year but the  decline in arpu of course described through the  what reflects in mobile sales decline and also the dynamics are not what we expected regarding broadband orders broadband sales are somewhat shy of our expectations and all this explains the  decline   excluding regulation the good news is with ebitda youll see that ebitda is down a mere  virtually stabilized on the strength of the major efforts cast on orange frances cost structure delphine ernotte and claire roblet are  sitting by my side here and will be happy to entertain the questions you may have on structure  on our cost structure regarding business proper well the mobile market share statement is good despite increase in the network market share which has to do with the development of our iliad partner but i mean we cant complain about the fact that our network is being used we cant complain about that and theres the improvement in mobile contacts for private individuals that is what matters most to us if you take a look at g which is starting up very handsomely and we believe that mobile performance will improve in the coming weeks and months we have sustained our growth in the top line  yearonyear excluding regulatory impact this is the one country which is still suffering considerably in economic terms macroeconomic terms all of this indiscernible if you exclude the regulatory impacts therefore and in q were at  growth with the total for the h of  were still keeping a good control of costs there and now for the whole of the business ebitda is  so were not back to the spectacular results over the longstanding and emerging countries but nevertheless the improvement there is significant compared with what weve seen over the past few years so even when you are right at the bottom of your hole as the spanish team has been demonstrating over the past  or  years we can still do very well very good results in terms of the fixed results of the revenues there have grown by  but stephane has already given you the main figures the final table which id like to comment on are the figures for everything everywhere which we commented on yesterday in line with our plan doing very well for g but the rest of the business is doing well too suffering slightly with prepaid but nevertheless excellent performances over g is really driving the performance of enterprise and activity as a whole and we have ebitda doing well compared with the time which was presented in  ph deutsche telekom and indiscernible so we have a lot of synergies working there its taking time to implement these synergies dont forget that the british market is one which have an extensive or major commercial expenditure but overall the performance is satisfactory with  growth thank you very much indeed and we are now available to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well now take our first question from nick delfas morgan stanley nick delfas  morgan stanley research division maybe you could talk a little bit more about the french mobile service revenue performance and i think you mentioned that the arpu has stabilized q versus q i wonder if you could give us those figures and speak also a little bit more about how you see the evolution into  stephane richard delphine delphine ernotte cunci so on the french mobile revenue the figures are minus  in h and what we see is that our proactive action on our base the fact that we proactively repriced such possible base thats why nowadays end of h more than  of our contract base is on offers plus for insurance launch make us more confident on the arpu evolution next year so we expect it to be around minus  well have the queue of the reprice that we expect more than  of our base to be repriced plus free entrance at the end of the year and along this    more than  on  offers so we think that we made a big work on our customer base in order of course to reduce turn but also to stabilize our ebitda erosion nick delfas  morgan stanley research division so could you just repeat that so you think  will be repriced on  offers by when delphine ernotte cunci by end of  nick delfas  morgan stanley research division okay and arpu in q you said on the front page of the press release is stable compared to the first quarter delphine ernotte cunci yes we have a switch between q and q in q we had the plain effect of the eur   offers and also the eur  indiscernible offers and we managed to by reacting on those open and such offers to balance this effect so we had negative net adds in q and positive net adds in q in order to counterbalance the last of the beginning of the year and i just want to add the fact that the regulation effect will be decreasing in h compared to h as well also in full year  operator well now take our next question from antoine pradayrol from exane bnp paribas antoine pradayrol  exane bnp paribas research division two questions please the first one on the fixed line revenue trends can you tell us a little bit what you expect for h  compared to h  and also for  i mean do you reiterate your comments on fixed line revenues getting better even though the broadband side is a little bit weak and the second one  thats in france obviously and the second one is on stephane richards comment that he was confident that the group can stabilize ebitda in  i think you said ebitda and not operating free cash flows so i wanted to make sure that this is what you said and also to underpin this target can you give us an indication of what to expect in terms of cost cutting in  i mean is it as much as  or a little bit less a little bit more any color on the cost cutting in  will be useful stephane richard okay on the first part of the question the fixed line market in france delphine delphine ernotte cunci yes we expect almost stable revenues full year versus h on the fixed revenue antoine pradayrol  exane bnp paribas research division so what does it mean what do you mean by that no decline in h  versus h  delphine ernotte cunci its the same trend in h versus h antoine pradayrol  exane bnp paribas research division okay and  do you still say that you expect an almost stabilization of revenues in  and  delphine ernotte cunci yes were going forward with stabilization and regarding this target we have of course our ability to be more efficient on adsl but also our increasing fiber penetration which is going to be  which is already very helpful in terms of market share and will grow in fact in  and besides weve just launched a capital play lowcost offer with sosh it was launched in june and we expect it to be really really efficient into  of course but also  and besides we are still very tightly controlling the decrease of pstn and we are consistently in line with what weve  we were committed  years ago in terms of decrease  pstn decrease stephane richard antoine what i would like to emphasize regarding the fixed line market in france is that we have been able to really curve the decreasing trend of pstn revenues in the last  years we have now the number of lost lines in pstn is much lower than it used to be  years ago this is the result of a comprehensive set of actions that aims at reducing the speeds of decrease in pstn market and its supposed to be quite efficient regarding the ebitda guidance i can confirm that i was talking about ebitda generation not operating cash flow operating cash flow would be treated ph in the future but as you know we have a very clear in the beginning of this year in  our really major target and focus of the whole management team is to stabilize the ebitda next year in  and i was saying a few minutes ago that this set of results in the h  and the rest of our action make us reasonably confident in our capacity to reach this target in  regarding the cost cutting side we cannot provide today the precise figures regarding  but clearly we will keep on focusing on cost cutting programs next year there is something that i can mention which is the headcount policy in france where both demographic parameters that pursue the senior parttime plans will keep on producing a big impact on the headcount management this combined with the low level of recruitment but also very reasonable wage policy will enable us to stay on the same pace of labor cost reduction so i can probably say that we will at least reach the same level next year than this year and we will also launch a new set of programs within accessories ph in order to secure the ebitda guidance for next year just one additional point regulations would be also lower we expect actually to improve by eur  million on ebitda in fact in terms of regulation operator well now take our next question from jakob bluestone from credit suisse jakob bluestone  crédit suisse ag research division ive got  questions please firstly on the tax case could you maybe just talk through how youre thinking on dividends would be impacted and if you lose your appeal on your tax case and maybe if you could also just let us know what the time frame for the appeal is im not sure if that was lost in the translation secondly you mentioned eur  million improvement from a regulatory drag in the previous question is that assuming that the current proposed ec regulation on roaming does not go through and maybe if you could just mention what you expect would be the impact from that specific proposal and then thirdly given the decline in the share price in mobistar could you maybe just give us an update on what your thinking  your current thinking is regarding increasing or decreasing your ownership in that asset stephane richard okay regarding the tax case and the possible impact on dividends ill ask gervais to give you some details but i want to start with saying that there will be no impact on our dividend policy due to this case gervais gilles pellissier yes and the time frame the scale we have integrity to our debt situation as i said eur  billion the time frame for our appeal is that we are appealing now the time frame for decision on the appeal is at least  years which means that it will be another story and another period within  years from now and now as the cash is out so our dividend would be measured and distributed based on the cash we have as of today so again as in this case which is painful today because of the cash front from now becomes an opportunity stephane richard okay regarding the regulation issues and our view on next year and the fact that the possible eu new roaming package could impact or not this vision on regulation ill ask pierre louette to make a point pierre louette yes regarding the impact of regulation we know its a regulated decreasing impact that we witnessed on our accounts the ebitda impact expected through  is eur  million and actually we are looking at a situation in which the worst doesnt always happen apparently in the last meetings we had recently with mrs cruise ph in brussels make us believe that probably the glide path of roaming decrease and the change in the rules of international calls should not probably be implemented  or will not be implemented as quickly as she was considering it and so we expect an ebitda impact of eur  million next year instead of eur  million this year stephane richard okay and regarding mobistar ill ask maybe benoit to answer the question if he has understood the question benoit scheen yes i think that if i got it right you were asking us about if the current situation in mobistar is changing potentially our stake within the shareholding structure of the company it is not the case we are simply focusing on improving the operational efficiency of the company you have seen the numbers announced on monday the numbers are impacted by several reasons but what we are currently doing is taking very strict measures to make sure that we can reduce the cost structure and to stabilize ebitda by  so thats our key action focus for the moment making sure that we stabilize the activities and that we bounce as of  and by keeping the same position in the market thats what were focusing on for the time being stephane richard next question operator your next question comes from nicolas cotecolisson hsbc nicolas cotecolisson  hsbc research division just a followup on your net debt comment you just made so it looks like you mentioned earlier in the quarter that you could get multiple pressure from rating agencies what would you do then could you tell us some ph would you play with the  dividend or would you be happy to have a net debttoebitda ratio of x to x by end  and i also have a question on everything everywhere could you give us an indication regarding the dividend policy for the rest of the year gervais gilles pellissier regarding the net debt  things the impact of the tax case is  thats now the total impact there is no followup i think its a big difference with some of the issues thats not like for instance the decision of the european union on the  european commission on the pension which has an impact for the years to come if thats taken what we  my comment on the rating agencies wed hope to say that we will look at it and today when we look at our situation we still have the best rating after vodafone even if now vodafone is also under a negative target watch since it is interested to buy kabel deutschland but as we are further searching we are still ahead of deutsche telekom and if you look at the different agencies there is one agency with which  with whom we have remained a and indiscernible agency that might save the opportunity of the tax case to downgrade us because we have remained a with a negative outlook whereas now we are with a stable outlook bbb with the other one so in my view this is not a situation where  of the  agencies could change their rating with this tax case but i dont expect that we would be out of the scope of the remaining bestrated operators in europe but if you compare our ratios to the ratios of our peers we more or less lead in this institution for instance than deutsche telekom regarding indiscernible this has been clearly expressed by stephane here the situation is what he described and if  and we count on that well stabilize ebitda in  then we will reduce our net debttoebitda ratio not at x but we will be again on the way to growth to up to x indiscernible and what is important for the rating agency is how we will be in  in the move up or in the move down and for us whats important is to be in the move down in terms of improvement of the ratio stephane richard maybe to make an additional comment on that i would say that in my mind that this payout policy is not linked or uniquely linked to the balance sheet its firstly linked to the operational capacity of the company meaning ebitda generation and cash flow generation and this tax case even though it is actually painful in the short term maybe an opportunity to midterm has absolutely no impact on our operational capacity on what we are doing in the market on what were doing in the cost cutting program and so once again in my view regarding your shareholders the decisions regarding the dividend policy and the payout policy should be seen and considered uniquely according to the operational performance and not regarding the balance sheet i want to once again remind that we have one of the healthiest and most solid sustainable balance sheet of the whole industry we have one of the best ratings of the whole industry and so we have perfectly the capacity to deal with this tax case impact in the short term without any operational consequence so once again no one should consider this a oneshot event as meaningful regarding the payout policy of the company gervais gilles pellissier regarding ee ee we distribute this year about eur  million of dividends to each of our shareholders this is indiscernible what we had last year last year there was an exceptional dividend so eur  million which means in total eur  million dividend its also what we are trying to size in preparation of potential indiscernible we are trying also to normalize the dividend policy of ee to better prepare for the future so there is no exceptional element in this dividend this year audio gap unknown analyst okay my first question was regarding the indiscernible the rating agencies am i correct to assume that you would prefer a  notch downgrade in terms of your credit ratings for the group is bbb and keep the dividend stable and my last question  my third question is regarding the top line which is still getting worse its not really improving and youve done a remarkable job on the cost cutting so that means youre spending less for instance on financial cost do we expect it to possibly go up in h to improve the top line or do you think you will be able to improve the top line through other means gervais gilles pellissier regarding the rating agencies just to remind the situation we have  agencies with whom our rating is bbb with a stable outlook and there is one agency where we are still in a rating with a negative outlook what i said is that i expect that this event is the occasion for the agency which has remained  who has remained with an a rating to downgrade us to bbb this is what we count this is our view to date based on our different issues around the tax case of the group stephane richard regarding the top line i would like first to stress that in h the trend in top line is  due to the of the trend of market and absolutely not lead to the relative performance of orange in the market as a matter fact we have market share that are stable or even improved in some countries but clearly in europe where we are doing as you know  of our operations we are operating in markets where the arpu trends are clearly down and down by a very significant proportion so this is the first time that i would like to really underline which is that we are operating in european markets where the arpu trends are clearly very significantly down but within this environment the global commercial performance of the company is very good probably one of the best in the industry i would like also to emphasize that the new offers both on g and on fiber in the fixed market are quite promising regarding the arpu trends and will critically play a role in the next month and quarters and well consolidate us in our capacity to stabilize and then to recreate some growth in the top line and of course we are also prepared to spend what will be necessary in the commercial costs probably more in h than in h in order to preserve our market share and to give the maximum dip ph in our top line but to put it in a nutshell i would say that our strategy is clearly to protect our customer bases because this is the main asset of the company for the future we are currently leading within  and i think we are reaching the end of effective very huge price cuts nearly everywhere in europe and you know the reason for that situation i think that we have been quite successful in protecting our customer bases and our market share and thats in the next month because of this commercial performance because also of the regulatory cycle that has been mentioned before and because of the new technology g fiber especially and the fact that we will be as aggressive as necessary in the sales cost side we are reasonably also confident in our capacity to manage the top line operator your next question is from frederic boulan with nomura frederic boulan  nomura securities co ltd research division firstly if i could come back on your ebitda target for next year do we think some growth indiscernible accelerated in terms of how indiscernible and i think if we go back to the total guidance indiscernible  indiscernible considering indiscernible more pressure indiscernible and the second question is on the more compression on your asset portfolio indiscernible stephane richard okay all right maybe regarding the way we are going to secure they ebitda stabilization in  in the complex environment where there is some pressure i dont know if its a growing pressure but i wouldnt say so but there is some pressure on the top line and not only in france youre right even though i want here to remind that in  european countries we have top line growth excluding regulatory impact so maybe we should be careful about  i mean those global statements that maybe do not correspond exactly to the reality gervais do you want to add something regarding the profit impact of cost cutting gervais gilles pellissier i think on the cost cutting and we will comment that for  in the course of the year but first we have the chrysalid program which has different steps and which is improving our operations year after year its beginning it has been said earlier by stephane in answering another question the labor cut decrease will continue because we are just in  at the first step of labor cuts and number decrease in france and this will go on probably next year regarding ebitda within france and outside france youre right but this is also portfolio management we are securing this year not exactly with the figures in terms of ebitda position we could have had in mind last year at the same period so thats part of portfolio management also  operational portfolio management through well be able to offset and compensate some accident somewhere some better performance if we take spain for instance we have better performance than expected that is true and even poland is doing better than what we had initially in mind in our plan whereas it is true that belgium has an accident but this is compensating i would say though differently stephane richard frederic maybe i could suggest pierre to make a point on the chrysalid program because i think it will answer both of your questions regarding the trend in cost cutting program and then i will take the floor to speak a little bit about ma and consolidation pierre louette yes if you remember the way we designed the chrysalid program more than  years ago its really rather a transformation for them than just the direct cost saving program the costs decreased by controlling the way we operate its a program that aims at adapting the functioning of the company to the new realities of this  especially mobile telephone industry so the initial ambition was eur  billion when we launched the program it was brought to eur  billion at the end of last year and i can tell you that as of today we have covered with our proven initiatives   of the global eur  billion program until  so its a welldocumented transformation program we know exactly where were going we have a lot of initiatives which are undergoing and so with this we will transform the way we operate its based technically on many process descriptions and process optimization optimization also of the network deployment and fertilization and profitization of initiatives brought from one side of the company to the other so overall this is going the right direction we are going to be massively helped on the indirect cost structure by that the demographics of the company as you know around  people will leave the company in the next few years and they will not be replaced entirely so this is something also which is in a way linked and its parallel to the chrysalid program we are looking at a way in which were going to function in the coming years with less people so this is underway its documented and its well programmed stephane richard regarding the situation in europe i would say that first what we have done is interesting evolution of the situation in europe where in some big countries like germany today maybe italy tomorrow we see some attempts to consolidate the market i think we should still remain cautious about the output of those operations because i think that there are still a lot of hurdles to overcome whats so scary is that the current situation of the industry in europe is in my view not sustainable as you know i am clearly an advocate of the consolidation of the industry in europe but in the same time i think we still have to be realistic about the political and regulatory up cycles that are in the way of consolidation but i think that theres clearly some need for consolidation as far as we are concerned we will of course look very seriously to any kind of opportunity in the main markets where we operate i could mention spain where as you know we were a candidate to buy yoigo maybe this case will reappear in the future i could mention poland also i dont expect in the short term any major consolidation project in countries like france i would like also to say that there could be some forms of consolidation some organic ph forms of consolidations like ran sharing look at whats going on in france and as you know we have a lot of projects ran sharing all over europe i could also mention fixed to mobile consolidation or convergence i think that it could make sense in some countries maybe like spain once again or romania or other ones and to that extent i think also that the german situation is quite interesting so to summarize i would say that there is obviously some need for moves and consolidations in europe i think we are in the beginning of this process of this cycle and as far as orange is concerned we are prepared to play the maximum role in this consolidation move if it really happens and then regarding the ma policy as a whole i think that we have always been very serious in the way we are working on ma opportunities for the last  or  years and of course the discipline that we have to respect in our balance sheet will of course clearly strictly serious in our ma approach meaning that we dont have any significant projects in the short term regarding ma operator your next question comes from vincent maulay of oddo securities vincent maulay  oddo securities research division two quick followups on indiscernible stephane richard okay first opex savings in h gervais gervais gilles pellissier we had an objective for the year of opex savings eur  million is what we said in february we will be above that i think already eur  million has been achieved in h so it should be above that i will not confirm any figure today i can just say what also stephane had said before its that there is room for maneuver to increase the financial expense and especially the need for indiscernible in the second half compared to the first half i would say indiscernible  increase  between  and  increase between first half and second half for our financial expense but we will be above the initial objective this is also because the revenue is lower than what we had initially planned and we had not seen indiscernible but maybe not exactly either ph x but we didnt indiscernible stephane richard regarding the french market the free subsidiaries indiscernible delphine delphine ernotte cunci on the subsidiaries so it was indiscernible for free we dont have the results of course but we didnt see any impact on our base so we are going to see what we are going to do anyway as we always do we anticipate and of course get prepared to any new or personal competitors in general on g as stephane richard has mentioned previously we are very far ahead of our main competitors of course indiscernible is going to have the opportunity with its frequency to serve quite good coverage but weve seen us are very far from all the competitors so i dont see how ph our competitors although we are going to be as efficient as we are on coverage which is key of course in terms of new network stephane richard regarding the roaming agreement and the ran sharing prospects with free ill ask pierre to give you some answers pierre louette so as you know the roaming agreement to be considered as the first form of mutualization to some extent its been commented upon and its more or less described by the competition authority in france in march this year and what is maybe happening today between sfr and bouygues is also very much looked upon by the competition authority so we are in france with a difference to spain and romania for instance and many african countries were a bit late in the mutualization processes its very well described and then defined by the law regarding our talks and the progression of things with free it is obvious that the agreement memorandum of understanding signed between our  competitors is also a sign of the direction in which we like to in the future gervais gilles pellissier regarding dominican republic so as i said we are regarding our indiscernible potential there so we have launched a process we decided that this affected the situation process ph we see that such a process could take a few months if it goes through its not    year process unless the potential acquirer would be a competitor within dominican republic but i think there are many other options regarding ee i think weve said it already on ee i think our  partners are still contemplating and well contemplate a potential ipo and now is the timeframe is probably to show to the market that theyre a good st tier of g performance and a testament ph which means the timeframe which is  stephane richard regarding more globally the ma policy i would like to really make it clear that the management team and myself are today focused on shortterm operational management on cost cutting on commercial initiatives and clearly not on ma it being said we are focusing on organic development in our footprint we do not exclude from time to time to participate in some processes or options in order to buy a license if the country or the market is interesting it was the case as you know recently in myanmar unfortunately we did not succeed but maybe this opportunity is not totally lost so we will see but organic development in our footprint is the main priority and i want also to remind that we still have some opportunities in consolidating some of our african and middle east operations where we are still the minority shareholder and i could mention especially morocco where certainly in the northeast we are not a candidate to buy maroc telecom but we are still a candidate to becoming a majority shareholder of meditel which is our moroccan operation i could also mention tunisia maybe i want to thank all of you and to wish you a very very good holiday and to thank you also for your
