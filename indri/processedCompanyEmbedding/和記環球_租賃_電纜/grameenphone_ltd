are shared as a result there is a strong culture and shared values among coworkers it translates to increased levels of trust and a shared sense of corporate communityto find critiques of such an excellent corporation is very tough perhaps one flaw i can point out is that the work pressure is not consistent in grameenphone there are quite a few times when the employees need to work day and night to complete a project on a short noticeproduct improvementgrameen phone believes that there should be continuous process of developing the product offering there by exceeding the expectation of the consumer gp does not only offer their product to their consumer once rather they improvise their offering on a regular basis they actually offer different product offering for their consumerfree internet and reward offer for the bondhuuser as i have mentioned that bondhu package is for those who have the maximum number of fnf list so it is a clear indication that they are more social people gp offers free  mb internet to make this package more interesting this offer is beneficial for both the parties the new offering attracts the consumer to talk more and get free internet as well as the organization generated revenuebondhu users also enjoy reward of getting discount in different outlets if they talk to a particular amount of timedjuice for the djuice user they have the highest number of fnf system in the other operator with a very low call rate from the market research they have come to know that the young generation mostly use djuice and they have usage of data more than that of call so gp surprise the consumer with  off on the mobile internet package moreover the consumer has the opportunity of  fnf number to any other operator which is a great offer to them other than thatdjuice consumer has the special community rate for the djuice user and there is no need of fnf for thatstar program grameen phone has always given priorities to their high valued consumer for

airlinestheme park off on all packages is given to the star consumer at nandan theme parkdiscount at super shopin agora the gp star has  discount on purchase amountmy assignment and contributionit is a life time opportunity to work with a team who directly design and run the campaign activity gp users often receive sms on different internet package and discount offer on recharge of certain amount before sending the sms to the consumer this team does some backend activity along with the technology departmentas an intern i have done the following taskuser acceptance taste uatgp has found that btlbelow the line and micro campaign has generated huge revenue so they have now on a continuous basis send push sms to their consumer before sending the sms the team does the uat in this system the team select sim of different category like smile  bondhu ekota  d juice etc then they check whether the sim have the validity after that the person doing uat enter a particular system number to the software then the software informs whether the sim is applicable for the new internet and recharge offer then the person has to recharge a certain amount of money or activate an internet package after that again a specific number is given to the system to see whether the offer valid for the particular sim user then if the confirmation comes then the sim is selected and feedback is given as okay to the system without uat no micro campaign offer is given to the consumerpreparing faqwhenever a micro campaign is executed and a push sms is sent to the consumer then many consumers get confused about the product offering as a result they call to the grameen phone customer care thing is the employee of product department design the product offering and the employee of customer care does not know anything about the product offering however one of the values of gp is to make easier on this note on behalf of crm team i have prepared faq before any product is offered to the consumer and a copy of the faq is sent to the customer care center while preparing the faq i had to check whether i was writing the proper date and everything every single day i had to prepare at least one faq and preparing faq was one of my routine worksmaking design tool while i was assigned to prepare design tool for my team then i felt my importance because preparing design tool was the task of the micro campaign manager miss farhana’s duty and only she has the authority to design the tool however she taught me the system of making design tool and with the help of software i prepared design tool design tool basically helps to execute the campaign activity and this track about the success rate of the micro campaign software is needed to prepare design tool however i cannot put the name of the software here due to confidential issuekeeping update of the micro campaign the campaign manager has to keep update of the micro campaign activity for instance during friendship day gp might give push sms to the consumer along with an offer then the campaign manager has to track whether the campaign was successful by seeing the number of the people who took the offer for this keeping track of the micro campaign and keeping a update of the campaign activity is one of the most important activity of the campaign manager and on behalf of her i used to do thatkeeping update of the design tool i was not only responsible for managing design tool i also had to keep the update of the design tool for the execution of the micro campaign since i updated the design tool of lead specialist miss moyabia so she found it very convenient to give the list of the campaign ownerto sum up these were the task that i had to do on a regular basis besides i had to do the photocopy print out etc tasks moreover i sometimes helped my team mates to arrange a food card from the coordinator for their business partner i have never said ‘no’ to anyone or any work i have always felt that even doing a simple photocopy or print out is a big task while doing print out or photo copy i have always kept in my mind that if i mess up a single page then i might get shouted so the tenure i worked as an intern at grameen phone i have tried to work as sincerely as possible gp has taught me to show respect to all kinds of workssignificant contributionworked for a new product launch with the crm team one of the product managers came up with a completely new technology which will be soon launched by grameenphone for the very first time in bangladesh i was a part of the onsite alpha internal test group test samples of the new technology were given to very few selected team members and luckily i was one of them i had to create detail feedback report and was also given the opportunity to communicate with the foreign vendorsafter successfully running user acceptance test for the crm team once i was requested to assist for many other uat by the customer relationship management team crm handles micro campaigns so before and after launching any campaign they need to run the user acceptance test and i was called to assist during two of their major campaign launching programinteractions with the teamthe organizational culture of grameenphone which focuses on values gives the overall environment a friendly nature people at all levels are very friendly and nurture learning my supervisors as well as the whole team of crm have been very kind and helpful to me other than my supervisor while working i got to talk and gain insights from the specialist of customer  relationship management nashar ahmed my internship supervisor in particular was always ready to lend a helping hand and has taught me many thingsin addition to the whole product department i had a very good relation with the hr team they have treated us very well and from time to time asked us for evaluation of our work which seemed to have a good notion to it my interactions were not limited to these people only i also successfully interacted with some employees from the technology department to gain insights about their work as well i do believe these interactions will not be limited to my internship period only but develop into a good relation with everyone challengesthere is always an initial resistance to things we find new however overcoming these challenges help us to develop as a person there a few challenges that i faced during my internship and they are illustrated belowcoping up with the workload at the initial stages i had a bit of trouble managing the time as a lot of time was taken to do the tedious data entry along with it there was a backlog of  months of data entry that i had to clear thus the difficulty in managing the time was causing delay in the delivery of my work however as time passed by i found my tricks one of them involved sorting the data as much as possible before starting to work on them this helped me a lot later ondifferences in expectationsthere was a good difference from my expectations of the internship program and the real experience from the internship this is mainly because there are rumors of how the interns are not treated well and are not given any real responsibility with an internship grameenphone limited i knew i wouldn’t have to worry about mistreatment but i doubted how much of a real responsibility will i be provided withfirst and foremost i was surprised to see the level of flat structure that is exercised in gp i was surprised at how friendly everyone was including the product managers the dgm and gmadditionally grameenphone’s employees not only are friendly but offer amicable conversations and valuable advice when it comes to real responsibility the team i worked with i was given full freedom to work as i like given i do not violate any policies my supervisor explained it all to me and told me that given that i follow the value of “responsibility  accountability” i was empowered to continue my work on my own initially the level of sudden empowerment did shake me up a little incase i did something wrong however i realized what a huge responsibility i was being given and knew that i wanted to make the most of it it was a huge opportunity to learn as well as show my skills and i could not have asked anything more overall the internship provided me an experience above my expectations and it was one of the best experiences i had in quite some timefindingsto be very honest i could not find any flaws in the organization the flat organizational structure friendly environment and proactive employee works with dedication in order to remain the number one telecom service provider of the country to sum up the finding of the grameen phone from solely my observation is given belowa service oriented organization since this is a service oriented organization so everyone works with enthusiasm to give the best service to the consumer mix up with the retailer gp believes it is very important to educate the retailer about the product whenever a new product is launched  then the employee of the gp spend a whole working day and goes to theretail store with a view to explaining the product and offering to the consumer since most of the people feel it is easier to ask the retailer than going to the grameen phone customer care about the product offering for instance during the tenure of internship i saw that the employee went out to the retail store twice few days back they educate the retailer about the easy net campaign gp knows that if the employee goes to the retail store and talk to the retailer personally then the retailer would feel himself an important person and the campaign would be more successful alignment among all the departments gp is one of those organizations where there is alignment among the people of all departments as i have mentioned before launching a new product the uat has to be done uat cannot be performed without the help of technology department whenever we used to do uat the technology department used to give us the backup help and after the successful completion of uat the marketing team worked to do the promotional activity the people of various departments become ready to help once anyone asks for thatrecommendationthe internship program at grameenphone is very well designed and it was an experience which is worthwhile i learned a lot and interacted with everyone as much as i can thus there wouldn’t be too many changes that i would like to bring to the program if i did it again however there is always room for improvement to anything and thus i would like to improve on the followingmy knowledge during the internship period was limited roughly to the modality of one department and the telecommunication industry however given a chance i would like to interact with the marketing department and learn more about the marketing communicationi had to perform one research on “print ads” if i could redo it i would do the research more extensively and do a more indepth analysisi would like to interact more with people from other departments and increase my networking capabilitiesconclusionas expected it is an experience that helped me learn a lot grow as a person and provide me with valuable knowledge beyond those that i could have obtained from the books thus my experience in grameenphone was one of the best experiences of my life i enjoyed it as much as possible and successfully interaction and built relations with some of the top managers of the industry the environment the people all nurtured my learning process i would love to work for them on a permanent basis someday this report successfully replicated the experience of the three months i had worked as an intern in grameenphone ltd and should stand as an example of what good
