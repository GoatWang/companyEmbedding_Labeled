competitive advantage but few truly understand what it is or how to achieve and keep it a competitive advantage can be gained by offering the consumer a greater value than the competitors such as by offering lower prices or providing quality services or other benefits that justify a higher price competitive intelligence intelligence is information that has been analyzed for decision making it is important to understand the difference between information and intelligence complexity theory the basic premise of complexity theory is that there is a hidden order to the behavior and evolution of complex systems whether that system is a national economy an ecosystem an organization or a production line in business and finance complexity theory places its focus on the ways a factory or company

truly understand what it is or how to achieve and keep it a competitive advantage can be gained by offering the consumer a greater value than the competitors such as by offering lower prices or providing quality services or other benefits that justify a higher price the strongest competitive advantage is a strategy that that cannot be imitated by other companies competitive advantage can be also viewed as any activity that creates superior value above its rivals a company wants the gap between perceived value and cost of the product to be greater than the competition michael porter defines three generic strategies that firms may use to gain competitive advantage cost leadership differentiation and focus a firm utilizing a cost leadership strategy seeks to be the lowcost producer relative to its competitors a differentiation strategy requires that the firm possess a nonprice attribute that distinguishes the firm as superior to its peers firms following a focus approach direct their attention to narrow product lines buyer segments or geographic markets focused firms will use cost or differentiation to gain advantage but only within a narrow target market cost advantage resulting from efficiency efficiency is the ratio of inputs to outputs inputs can be any materials overhead or labor that is assigned to the product or service the outputs can be measured as the number of products produced or services performed the firm that can achieve the highest efficiency for the same service or product can widen the gap between cost and perceived value and may have greater profit margins there are many ways a company can increase efficiency efficiency is enhanced if holding outputs constant inputs are reduced or if holding inputs constant outputs are increased inputs can be reduced in many ways labor inputs can be reduced if employees are better trained so that time spent on each individual output is decreased decreasing waste can decrease materials needed if a method can be devised to decrease waste it would increase efficiency for instance a bottling plant might determine that  gallons of liquid are spilled every day as a result of the bottling process if the amount of lost liquid can be reduced efficiency will increase outputs can be increased by increasing the number of units a machine can produce in given period of time decreasing downtime can also increase outputs for example if a machine regularly breaks down and is out of order for two hours a day finding a way to eliminate this downtime would increase the number of outputs it is often argued that large companies by definition are able to be more efficient because they can achieve economies of scale that others are not able to reach large companies usually offer more products in each product line and their products may help to satisfy many different needs if a consumer is not sure of the exact product he needs he can go to the larger producer and be confident that the larger producer has something to offer the consumer might believe that the smaller producer may be too specialized larger companies can cater to a larger population because of sheer size while smaller companies have fewer resources and must specialize or fall victim to larger more efficient companies product differentiation product differentiation is achieved by offering a valued variation of the physical product the ability to differentiate a product varies greatly along a continuum depending on the specific product there are some products that do not lend themselves to much differentiation such as beef lumber and notebook paper some products on the other hand can be highly differentiated appliances restaurants automobiles and even batteries can all be customized and highly differentiated to meet various consumer needs in principles of marketing  authors gary armstrong and philip kotler note that differentiation can occur by manipulating many characteristics including features performance style design consistency durability reliability or reparability differentiation allows a company to target specific populations it is easy to think of companies that have used these characteristics to promote their products maytag has differentiated itself by presenting old reliable the maytag repairman who never has any work to do because maytags products purportedly function without any problems and do not require repairs the eveready battery coenergizer has promoted their products performance with the energizer bunny ® that keeps going and going many chain restaurants differentiate themselves with consistency and style if a consumer has a favorite dish at her local applebees restaurant she can be assured it will look and taste the same at any applebees restaurant anywhere in the country and the style of theme restaurants is the key to some establishments planet hollywood and hard rock cafe profit from their themes in the auto industry durability is promoted by chevrolets like a rock advertising campaign service differentiation companies can also differentiate the services that accompany the physical product two companies can offer a similar physical product but the company that offers additional services can charge a premium for the product mary kay cosmetics offers skincare and glamour cosmetics that are very similar to those offered by many other cosmetic companies but these products are usually accompanied with an informational instructional training session provided by the consultant this additional service allows mary kay to charge more for their product than if they sold the product through more traditional channels in the personal computer business dell and gateway claim to provide excellent technical support services to handle any glitches that may occur once a consumer has bought their product this houraday tech support provides a very important advantage over other pc makers who may be perceived as less reliable when a customer needs immediate assistance with a problem people differentiation hiring and training better people than the competitor can become an immeasurable competitive advantage for a company a companys employees are often overlooked but should be given careful consideration this human resourcebased advantage is difficult for a competitor to imitate because the source of the advantage may not be very apparent to an outsider as a money magazine article reported herb kelleher ceo of southwest airlines explains that the culture attitudes beliefs and actions of his employees constitute his strongest competitive advantage the intangibles are more important than the tangibles because you can always imitate the tangibles you can buy the airplane you can rent the ticket counter space but the hardest thing for someone to emulate is the spirit of your people this competitive advantage can encompass many areas employers who pay attention to employees monitoring their performance and commitment may find themselves with a very strong competitive advantage a welltrained production staff will generate a better quality product yet a competitor may not be able to distinguish if the advantage is due to superior materials equipment or employees people differentiation is important when consumers deal directly with employees employees are the frontline defense against waning customer satisfaction the associate at walmart who helps a customer locate a product may result in the customer returning numerous times generating hundreds of dollars in revenue home depot prides itself on having a knowledgeable sales staff in their home improvement warehouses the consumer knows that the staff will be helpful and courteous and this is very important to the consumer who may be trying a new home improvement technique with limited knowledge on the subject another way a company can differentiate itself through people is by having a recognizable person at the top of the company a recognizable ceo can make a company stand out some ceos are such charismatic public figures that to the consumer the ceo is the company if the ceo is considered reputable and is wellliked it speaks very well for the company and consumers pay attention national media coverage of ceos has increased tremendously jumping  percent between  and  gainesross image differentiation armstrong and kotler pointed out in principles of marketing that when competing products or services are similar buyers may perceive a difference based on company or brand image thus companies should work to establish images that differentiate them from competitors a favorable brand image takes a significant amount of time to build unfortunately one negative impression can kill the image practically overnight everything that a company does must support their image ford motor cos former quality is job  slogan needed to be supported in every aspect including advertisements production sales floor presentation and customer service often a company will try giving a product a personality it can be done through a story symbol or other identifying means most consumers are familiar with the keebler elves and the magic tree where they do all of the keebler baking this story of the elves and the tree gives keebler cookies a personality when consumers purchase keebler cookies they are not just purchasing cookies but the story of the elves and the magic tree as well a symbol can be an easily recognizable trademark of a company that reminds the consumer of the brand image the nike swoosh is a symbol that carries prestige and makes the nike label recognizable quality differentiation quality is the idea that something is reliable in the sense that it does the job it is designed to do when considering competitive advantage one cannot just view quality as it relates to the product the quality of the material going into the product and the quality of production operations should also be scrutinized materials quality is very important the manufacturer that can get the best material at a given price will widen the gap between perceived quality and cost greater quality materials decrease the number of returns reworks and repairs necessary quality labor also reduces the costs associated with these three expenses innovation differentiation when people think of innovation they usually have a narrow view that encompasses only product innovation product innovation is very important to remain competitive but just as important is process innovation process innovation is anything new or novel about the way a company operates process innovations are important because they often reduce costs and it may take competitors a significant amount of time to discover and imitate them some process innovations can completely revolutionize the way a product is produced when the assembly line was first gaining popularity in the early twentieth century it was an innovation that significantly reduced costs the first companies to use this innovation had a competitive advantage over the companies that were slow or reluctant to change as one of the first internet service providers america online offered a unique innovation for accessing the nascent internet—its unique and userfriendly interface the company grew at a massive rate leading the rapidly developing internet sector as a force in american business while most innovations are not going to revolutionize the way that all firms operate the small innovations can reduce costs by thousands or even millions of dollars and large innovations may save billions over time sustainable competitive advantage the achievement of competitive advantage is not always permanent or even long lasting once a firm establishes itself in an area of advantage other firms will follow suit in an effort to capitalize on their similarities a firm is said to have a sustainable competitive advantage when its competitors are unable to duplicate the benefits of the firms strategy in order for a firm to attain a sustainable competitive advantage its generic strategy must be grounded in an attribute that meets four criteria it must be valuable—it is of value to consumers rare—it is not commonplace or easily obtained inimitable—it cannot be easily imitated or copied by competitors nonsubstitutable—consumers cannot or will not substitute another product or attribute for the one providing the firm with competitive advantage selecting a competitive advantage a company may be lucky enough to identify several potential competitive advantages and it must be able to determine which are worth pursuing not all differentiation is important some differences are too subtle too easily mimicked by competitors and many are too expensive a company must be sure the consumer wants understands and appreciates the difference offered the maker of expensive suits may offer its suits in the widest array of colors but if  percent of the consumers wear only black and navy blue suits then the wide array of colors adds little perceived value to the product variety would not become a competitive advantage and would be a waste of resources a difference may be worth developing and promoting advise armstrong and kotler if it is important distinctive superior communicable preemptive affordable and profitable a competitive advantage can make or break a firm so it is crucial that all managers are familiar with competitive advantages and how to create maintain and benefit from them

competitive positioning what sets your product service and company apart from your competitors what value do you provide and how is it different from the alternatives competitive positioning is about defining how you’ll “differentiate” your offering and create value for your market it’s about carving out a spot in the competitive landscape putting your stake in the ground and winning mindshare in the marketplace – being known for a certain “something” a good positioning strategy is influenced by market profile size competitors stage of growth customer segments groups of prospects with similar wants  needs competitive analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats in the landscape method for delivering value how you deliver value to your market at the highest level note you can access interactive marketing planning templates and download stepbystep plans for positioning your product or service in the marketplace in our marketing planning and management app try it for free when your market clearly sees how your offering is different from that of your competition it’s easier to influence the market and win mindshare without differentiation it takes more time and budget to entice the market to engage with you as a result many companies end up competing on price – a tough position to sustain over the long term one of the key elements that many small to midsize companies overlook is how they provide value at the highest level there are three essential methods for delivering value operational excellence product leadership and customer intimacy here is a hypothetical example of each type of value operational excellence product leadership customer intimacy herringer customers don’t want bells and whistles they just want a good product at the lowest possible price herringer focuses on operational excellence so they can continually offer the lowest price in the market for example they just patented a new machine that dramatically lowers their manufacturing costs they’re not trying to create new or better products they just want to produce more volume at a lower cost herringer’s method for delivering value is operational excellence it’s a key driver of their longterm strategy and their positioning reflects it orange technology’s customers care most about quality – they want the best product orange is completely dedicated to innovation and quality they’re constantly working on product improvements and new ideas to bring to market they know what their competitors are doing and are completely focused on staying one step ahead in order to capture a greater share of their market orange’s brand and culture is all about product leadership their market recognizes it and is willing to pay for it starboard’s market is flooded with products at all points of the price spectrum yet starboard’s customers want more than a product off the shelf they want customized solutions so starboard’s strategy is to know as much as possible about their customers’ businesses so they can deliver the correct solutions over time starboard knows that they can’t just say “we offer great service” starboard delivers on their strategy in every interaction with their market   these companies have a complete understanding of how they deliver value to their market it’s part of their strategy which makes it easier for them to win a position in their respective markets here’s another way to think of it you can provide the best offering the cheapest offering or the most comprehensive offering but you can’t provide all three another key factor in your competitive positioning is your competition sure you need to put your stake in the ground and claim your turf but is it turf that you can own can you realistically beat your competition to own it rather than leaving your market positioning to chance establish a strategy what you’re ultimately striving for is to be known for something – to own mindshare of the market this is typically easier for consumer product lines than for bb companies because positioning a single product against three to five competitors is a simpler task than positioning a midsize bb company with numerous offerings in numerous markets owning a strong position in the market is challenging for most small to midsize companies but you have a better chance of achieving it if you clearly define a strategy and build your brand around it do you see your company in any of these scenarios best case neutral case worst case you provide a oneofakind offering that your market needs and wants you have strong differentiation from your competitors your market knows your name and associates it with that “one thing” that you’re known for and you continually deliver on it – perception is reality – so you continue to win mindshare in your market defending your turf and influencing your market your offering is somewhat different from – and better than – those of your competitors and you communicate that difference though probably not as consistently as you should some of your market knows your name but they describe you in different ways you’re not yet known for that “one thing” but at least you’re occasionally recognized you know that you could make a greater impact on your market with stronger positioning your market sees little difference between you and your competitors and your name is not recognized because of this you have to spend precious budget and time educating the market at each touch point you often end up competing solely on price though your business isn’t optimized to continue profitably with falling prices you have to fight long and hard for every sale it’s very difficult to meet your revenue and profit goals not sure where to start with competitive positioning access detailed stepbystep plans in our new marketing website it’s free to use get access the concept of positioning is entirely strategic it’s the first element to address in strategic marketing and everything else is aligned to it jack trout and al ries defined the concept years ago in their landmark book positioning the battle for your mind while the concept is simple – to be known for a single thing in the mind of the customer – the road to achieve it can be complex it’s best to have a clear understanding of your market –demographics segments their pains how well you and your competitors provide solutions how you truly provide value and your strengths and weaknesses – before making this decision an fullyinformed decision is vital because you’ll allocate a significant amount of resources in your journey to achieve it competitive positioning key concepts  steps before you begin your competitive positioning strategy is the foundation of your entire business – it’s the first thing you should pin down if you’re launching a new company or product it’s also important when you’re expanding or looking for a new edge profile your market document the size of your market and identify your major competitors and how they’re positioned determine whether your market is in the introductory growth mature or declining stage of its life this “lifecycle stage” affects your entire marketing strategy segment your market understand the problems that your market faces talk with prospects and customers or conduct research if you have the time budget and opportunity uncover their true wants and needs – you’ll learn a great deal about what you can deliver to solve their problems and beat your competitors group your prospects into “segments” or “personas” that have similar problems and can use your offering in similar ways by grouping prospects into segments or personas you can efficiently market to each group define how you deliver value at the highest level there are three core types of value that a company can deliver operational efficiency the lowest price product leadership the best product or customer intimacy the best solution  service determine which one you’re best equipped to deliver your decision is your method for delivering value evaluate your competition list your competitors include any that can solve your customers’ problems even if the competitors’ solutions are much different from yours – they’re still your competition rate yourself and your direct competitors based on operational efficiency price product leadership and customer intimacy it’s easy to think you’re the best so be as impartial as you can be stake a position identify areas where your competition is vulnerable determine whether you can focus on those vulnerable areas – they’re major opportunities make a decision on how to position your offering or company select the mindshare you want to own and record your strategy review the components of your market and evaluate what you want to be known for in the future condense all your research and analysis into the “one thing” that you want to be known for and design your longterm strategy to achieve it after

a good or service at a lower price or in a more desirable fashion for customers these conditions allow the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins than its competition competitive advantages are attributed to a variety of factors including cost structure brand quality of product offerings distribution network intellectual property and customer support breaking down competitive advantage competitive advantages provide an edge over rivals and an ability to generate greater value for a firm and its shareholders the more sustainable the competitive advantage the more difficult it is for competitors to neutralize the advantage the two main types of competitive advantages are comparative advantage and differential advantagecomparative advantagecomparative advantage is generated by a firms ability to produce a good or service at a lower cost than its competitors this gives the firm the ability sell its goods or services at a lower price than its competition or to generate a larger margin on sales rational consumers will choose the cheaper of any two perfect substitutes offered if the effects of comparative advantage are partially offset by imperfect substitution higher margins for the lowestcost producers will eventually benefit shareholders through superior returns or provide the company with more resources for marketing research and development or administrative infrastructure improvements to support future growthcomparative advantage can be derived from economies of scale more efficient internal systems location in geographies with low labor or low property expenses these do not always imply the company can produce a better product or service but rather they can offer a product or service for a lower price in the context of
