pakistan the telecommunications ordinance of  created the pakistan telecommunication authority pta pakistans first independent telecommunications regulator and the pakistan telecommunication company

pkrs per minute which was not affordable for most of the population in addition customer service was poor fixing a problem might take  to  days despite this consumers had to stick with ptcl as they had no other options this prompted the government to take a series of actions to improve the service by opening the telecommunications market this was critical but required a fine balance because opening the market and preserving ptcl were both important for the government in july  the government introduced a deregulation policy for the telecommunication sector which allowed and encouraged foreign companies to invest in the pakistani telecommunications market the centerpiece of the deregulation was the establishment of two categories of basic services licenses local loop ll for fixed line telecommunication within the  ptcl regions and longdistance and international ldi for connectivity between regions” two sets of criteria set by the regulatory authorities must be met before an operator is allowed to start operation one for the issuance of a license and another for the maintenance of service quality in  etisalat international pakistan a wholly owned subsidiary of emirates

index summarizes stakeholders’ perception of the regulatory and policy environment and provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress the most recent survey was conducted in july  in eight asian countries including pakistan the tool measured seven dimensions i market entry ii access to scarce resources iii interconnection iv tariff regulation v anticompetitive practices vi universal services and vii quality of service for the fixed mobile and broadband sectors the survey found that in pakistan the mobile sector was most active followed by broadband while the fixedline sector remained somewhat static the parameters that improved compared to the  survey were interconnection tariff regulation regulation of anticompetitive practices and universal service obligation in the mobile sector and market entry interconnection regulation of anticompetitive practices and universal service obligation in the fixed sector market entry received a low score in the mobile sector due to the perception that the cost of a new or renewal mobile license was prohibitive thus posing a serious barrier to entry however this conclusion may have been incorrect as the license fee at least in the case of renewal by mobilink gsm was paid in installments over a period of three years thus lack of complete information on the part of survey participants may have skewed the results mobile telecommunicationsedit further information list of mobile phone companies in pakistan instaphone and paktel were the pioneers in mobile communication in pakistan during the s they were joined by mobilink in  which was owned by motorola until its sale to orascom the trio offered amps services before switching to gsm in the early s ufone joined the mix in  the sector was highly regulated which led to high call rates and poor service quality in january  the ministry of information technology issued its mobile cellular policy with objectives to promote efficient use of radio spectrum increase choice for customers of cellular mobile services at competitive and affordable prices encourage private investment in the cellular mobile sector recognize the rights and obligations of mobile cellular operators provide for fair competition among mobile and fixed line operators and provide an effective and well defined regulatory regime that is consistent
