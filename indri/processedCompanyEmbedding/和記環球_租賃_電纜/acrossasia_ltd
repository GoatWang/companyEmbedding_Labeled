beware – first ruling in relation to new disclosure obligations skip to main content professionalsservices search search menu alerts  publications pdf share hong kong listed companies beware – first ruling in relation to new disclosure obligations december   the hong kong market misconduct tribunal mmt has made its first finding of breaches of the disclosure obligations that were introduced in  in its decision in relation to acrossasia limited acrossasia the mmt found the company and its senior executives had failed to disclose information in relation to proceedings in indonesia as soon as reasonably practicable the decision was made on  november  with the report and orders being handed down on  november  the securities  futures commission sfc commenced proceedings against acrossasia in july  alleging a failure to disclose what the sfc described as highly sensitive inside information as soon as reasonably practicable the sfc has also commenced proceedings against the chairman albert saychuan cheok and ceo vicente binalhay ang for their reckless or negligent conduct causing the alleged breach    the proceedings were the first to be commenced under the disclosure regime that came into effect on  january  the information in question related to litigation between acrossasia and a subsidiary in indonesia which had resulted in an insolvency petition being filed against acrossasia the relevant dates in relation to the disclosure of the information were  december  – the petition in the proceedings was filed  january  – the petition and other relevant court documents which was in bahasa indonesia was received by the company in hong kong  january  – english translations of the court documents were provided to cheok and ang   and  january  – cheok and ang attended hearings of the petition in indonesia  january  – the indonesian court granted the orders sought by the petition and acrossasia sought a suspension of trading  january  – the company disclosed the information in relation to the petition to the market following the disclosure of the information and the resumption of trading on  february  the share price fell by  all three of the defendants made admissions as to the facts and agreed that they had failed to disclose inside information as soon as reasonably practicable cheok and ang also admitted that they were negligent in failing to cause acrossasia to disclose the information in a timely manner as a result of the admissions the sfc did not pursue recklessness as a grounds against the two individuals after considering the evidence the tribunal agreed to proceed on that basis and in doing so took into account the fact that the individuals were construing newly introduced legislation and the court documents were not in english and related to foreign proceedings with which they were not familiar an interesting part of the mmt’s report relates to the date at which the failure to disclose arose the sfc’s case was that the failure arose on  january  when the documents were made available in english whereas acrossasia and cheok argued that it should be  january  when legal advice was obtained in relation to the documents the mmt took the view that the wording of the section specifically “as soon as reasonably practicable” suggested that it was appropriate for legal advice to be obtained before any disclosure was required to be made the tribunal agreed that it would have been unrealistic to expect an announcement on  january  before the company had had the opportunity to seek legal advice and went on to say “clearly you cannot announce what you don’t understand” that finding should provide some comfort to listed companies although it will not protect a company that delays in obtaining legal advice about such issues  the mmt found that the appropriate fine in each case should be hk but discounted the fine issued to acrossasia and ang to hk in recognition of fact that their admissions had been offered at an earlier stage than choek’s cheok and ang were also ordered to complete a training program on compliance with the inside information disclosure requirements costs were awarded both in respect of the mmt proceeding and the sfc investigation the mmt specifically noted that although this was the first case to be decided under the new provisions it was not appropriate for it to impose a deterrent sentence disproportionate to the level of culpability in this case   there are a number of other pending cases in relation to alleged breaches of the disclosure obligations as the sfc continues to focus on compliance by listed companies with the disclosure obligations and if the sfc is successful it will be interesting to see how the penalties compare  this memorandum is a summary for general
