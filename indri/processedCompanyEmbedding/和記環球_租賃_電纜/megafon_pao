soldatenkov chief executive officer of megafon commented on the financial and operational results as follows megafons performance in  was in line with our guidance for the year despite the difficult competitive environment in the russian telecoms industry the increasing pressures from tough competition caused us to reduce prices for services while at the same time to increase spending on acquisition and retention of subscribers as well as network development   the financial performance of megafon in q  and the full year completely reflected the market situation our consolidated revenue amounting to rub  billion was essentially flat yoy the growth in data revenue slowed and our adjusted oibda margin declined to  although the increases in revenue from equipment sales and wireline services were bright spots for the year   in this uncertain environment we undertook a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening our current position and anticipating eventual improvement in our business given the fact that mobile penetration in russia is now approximately  we have decided that it would be inappropriate to continue aggressively building our subscriber base instead we will focus more on improving the quality of customer care and delivering value in order to maintain the loyalty of our existing subscribers at the same time we will continue to develop our valueadded services in order to monetize mobile data and increase our revenues from this source   the proposal to acquire a controlling stake in the mailru group was the signature event of last year  this step will enable us to transform our business and evolve from a mobile operator into an integrated digital communications company it will give us an opportunity to develop together with mailru brand new products and services for our customers which will combine mobile data and digital technology capabilities and open a new chapter in the history of both megafon and the entire telecom market in russia  we are pleased to report that the transaction which was completed in early february of this year received overwhelming support from our shareholders   we are also in the final stages of defining our strategy for the next three to five years which we hope to announce at the end of may   our key priority remains to ensure the continued attractiveness of our shares to investors in

distributed in  amounted to rub  billion which is in line with the  amount   key consolidated financial data in millions of rubles   three months full year   q  q  q  q      revenue       wireless

russian revenue for q  and the full year  remained the major component accounting for over  and  respectively of total consolidated revenue our wireless revenue decreased in q  by  yoy to rub  million and in the full year  by  yoy to rub  million in each case reflecting the continued stagnation of traditional voice services due to a shift to digital technologies and growing popularity of alternative over the top services as well as the increased penetration of bundled offerings however a significant increase in revenue from handsets and equipment together with the positive performance of our wireline service revenue throughout the year served to offset this decline in our wireless revenue the increasing number of subscribers choosing bundled tariffs which generally are more economical for subscribers because they have higher data allowances also served to slow the growth rate of mobile data revenue which increased in q  by only  yoy to rub  million and in the full year  by  yoy to rub  million at the same time the share of data revenue in total consolidated revenue increased in q  from  to  and in the full year  from  to  an increase in revenue from valueadded services in q  of  yoy and of  for the full year  on the back of further development of megafons popular services including megafon tv and the megafon card partially compensated for the decline in wireless revenue wireline service revenue for the full year  increased by  yoy to rub  million due to continued expansion of our bb and bg client base and development of our portfolio of products however because the comparable q  results included the effects of certain oneoff contracts and the acquisition of gars wireline service revenue in q  increased by only  yoy to rub  million revenue from sales of equipment and accessories for q  increased by  yoy to rub  million and for the full year  increased by  yoy to rub  million as a result of the demand for more expensive highend devices which we marketed with attractive bundled offerings the average price of phones sold in megafon retail stores in q  increased by  yoy to rub    adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda margin in q  our adjusted oibda decreased by  yoy to rub  million mainly due to a  increase in the cost of revenue resulting from the higher sales of equipment and accessories noted above and higher rent expenses which was partially offset by an  reduction in employee benefit costs due to the revision of bonus accruals and related social charges a rub  million decrease in radio frequencies fees and a  decrease in sales and marketing expenses adjusted oibda margin in q  decreased by  pp yoy to  compared to  in q  overall adjusted oibda for the full year  was rub  million and exceeded the targets announced in our revised guidance adjusted oibda margin for the full year  decreased by  pp yoy to  from  in    net profit consolidated net profit in q  decreased by  yoy to rub  million mainly due to an impairment charge in the amount of rub  million relating to the goodwill allocated to the broadband internet cash generating unit which reflected the rapid decline in returns in the retail broadband segment and revisions in management forecasts in this segment in response to the current challenging economic environment and competitive pressures net profit for the full year  decreased by  yoy to rub  million due to a higher cost of services as a result of a shift in our revenue structure towards wireline services and sales of equipment and accessories which are traditionally lower margin segments higher dealer commissions resulting from the increase in the number of subscribers increased depreciation and rent expenses resulting from continued expansion of our network as well as inflation and higher office rent costs   capex capex in q  increased by  yoy to rub  million as compared to rub  million in q  we continue to maintain a significant level of investment in order to roll out our high speed mobile data network coverage across our existing network footprint as well as upgrading our g and g networks capex for the full year  reached rub   lower than the capex number for  which included the cost of the purchase of spectrum from smarts in volga region   free cash flow our free cash flow for q  increased by  yoy from rub  million for q  to rub  million for q  mainly due to the fact that there were higher cash capital expenditures in q  free cash flow for the full year  decreased by  yoy to rub  million mainly due to a rub  million or  yoy reduction in operating cash flow   net debt our net debt increased from rub  million as of  september  to rub  million as of  december  principally as a result of the dividend payment made in december   we continue to pay close attention to our leverage situation and to ensure that we maintain an optimal capital structure   earnings per share consolidated basic and diluted eps in q  decreased yoy from rub  per share to rub  per share and consolidated basic and diluted eps for the full year  decreased yoy from rub  per share to rub  per share in each case in line with the decrease in net profit   outlookguidance we expect megafons revenue for  to grow in the flat to low single digit range and anticipate that our oibda will be in the range of rub    billion we project megafons capital expenditures for  to be in the range of rub    billion  this guidance represents standalone numbers and does not include the financial results of mailru this guidance also does not take into account strategic advantages from the mailru transaction as recently disclosed by mailru mailrus standalone revenue for  on a proforma basis is expected to grow  to between rub  and  billion and its oibda margin to be around  for the full year     key operational highlights in russia wireless subscribers    dec   dec   dec   dec  number of wireless subscribers k    of which data service users k    share of data service users    pp our russian wireless subscriber base increased by  yoy to  million as of  december  as a result of attractive tariff offerings and options however we are shifting our focus from gross additions to

extra charge today the size of the russian market for legal paid content is estimated at rub  bn according to a study by ernst  young however in  the combined earnings of all players in this market were under rub  bn this was mostly due to the spread of online piracy low awareness among customers of the benefits of using legitimate services conservatism on the part of content owners and high

operations services and products return error services and products mobile voice the traditional voice services have remained the largest segment of our business however the share of voice revenue in total revenue has been declining every year due to growing mobile data usage and the increasing popularity of ott content despite the decline in revenue mobile voice communications remain an indemand service and a part of everyday life in modern russia as such we are committed to the ongoing development of this segment furthermore the potential for achieving high levels of gross margin remains strong for voice services in  the majority of megafon’s product initiatives in mobile voice services focused on growing the volumes of voice traffic within megafon’s own network onnet voice traffic and increasing the proportion of subscribers using our ‘vse vklyucheno’ ‘everything included’ bundled tariffs to increase onnet traffic consumption in july  we refined our ‘perekhodi na ’ ‘switch to zero’ tariff introducing free onnet calls within the region in which the subscriber resided our marketing initiatives in the voice segment were mostly focused on promoting this tariff plan to increase the proportion of subscribers using bundled tariffs we actively promoted our bundled tariff line ‘vse vklyucheno’ which represents a package of voice minutes messages and mobile data traffic to stimulate takeup of these tariff packages the marketing campaigns with special price offers for ‘vse vklyucheno s’ for rub month held in march  and for ‘vse vklyucheno m’ for rub month held in november–december  enabled us to double the share of customers using the ‘vse vklyucheno’ bundled tariffs in march  we transformed our bundled tariffs and tailored them to meet the specific needs of each individual branch according to the local consumption patterns for each service type in  our ‘perekhodi na ’ tariff and the bundled tariff line ‘vse vklyucheno’ were the most popular among our subscribers accounting for  and  of new subscriptions respectively the deployment of volte voice over ltelong term evolution technology a voice service based on the g mobile wireless communications standard to be launched in the nearest future will become an important milestone in the development of both voice and lte services volte’s key benefits include faster call setup times less than a second high quality of voice communications creating the effect of presence and an option to shift part of the voice traffic onto the lte network reducing the load on our g and g networks as of  august  trial volte calls were available on our g network in megafon’s stolichny branch moscow and moscow region volte will be commercially launched as soon as all necessary approvals are obtained

of communications stimulating higher mobile data usage through special price offers new offers and upgrades of our tariffs and internet options and promoting dataenabled devices in our controlled retail channels in  we upgraded our ‘vse vklyucheno’‘everything included’packages and internet options significantly increasing the amounts of available data traffic without increasing the price specifically we doubled the amount of traffic available under the ‘m’ and ‘l’ internet options increasing the amount of traffic available during the day to the amount available at nighttime we also introduced two new internet options for tablet users — ‘internet tablet xs’ and ‘internet tablet s’ available throughout russia the ‘internet tablet xs’ option was launched for tablet owners who mostly use wifi networks and rarely use mobile data as part of the offering customers subscribing to the option get free  mb of traffic per month  mb per day and if they need more traffic on certain days they can activate an extra mobile data allowance option for an extra charge at the end of   customers were using the option the ‘internet tablet s’ option was launched to target more active tablet users who get a certain mobile date amount for a monthly subscription fee dsumb per month   dsu monthly average data services usage per user is calculated by dividing the total number of megabytes transferred by our network during a given period by the average number of data services users during such period and dividing the result by the number of months in such period  some of the operating kpis presented here vary from those reported earlier due to the change in methodology for data service users calculation data service user is defined as a subscriber who has consumed any amount of data traffic within preceding month in september  we ran a marketing promotion to boost g internet consumption under which subscribers for the ‘internet sxl’ line were given an extra g data allowance good through the end of the year which was equal to the data allowance already available under their existing plan in november  we offered our customers a completely unique product – a driver’s tablet which is a plugandplay complete packaged solution the package includes a tablet tablet car charger incar tablet holder and preactivated ‘internet s’ option the package was priced at

approved a further dividend payment of rub billion pending shareholder approval in december megafon is set to pay over rub billion for  corresponding to over rub per sharein the third quarter we

development of the next generation communications standard in russia we intend to study the technical aspect of developments and implementation of the new standard g and communicate with regulatory authorities on the requirements and parameters for its commercial implementationwe aim to conduct tests of new technical solutions and potentially construct a trial g cluster in russias stadiums that will host the  fifa world cup matches together with nokia in september we conducted a test and achieved a record mobile data transfer speed just short of  gigabits per second this was made possible by our competitive advantage in spectrum and nokias high performance equipment that is already commercially availablealso in july we signed a memorandum of cooperation with huawei for the joint implementation of the internet of things solutions megafon and huawei are already in an advanced collaboration stage for the promotion in the russian markets of meu telecommunication standard narrow band iot in the third quarter we also continued to launch new services in september we launched voice over lte in the moscow region this technology enables customers to access hd voice services while using mobile internet on a g network and set up a connection in less than  secondsthe next product was presented by megafon in august thats a unique financial product the megafon debit card it was launched in cooperation with mastercard and russias round bank the card is fully integrated with the users mobile account and giving the features of a bank account the card can be used for payments and there is interest accruing on the balance the megafon card was initially tested in moscow and st petersburg and in october it became available to clients in all russias regions where megafon operatesand with this i would now like to turn it over to anna serebryanikova megafons chief operating officer thank youanna serebryanikova megafon pao  coo thank you inaudible let me present our development inaudible development we continued to focus the quality of both network and the services we provide in the third quarter we remained focused on the development of our g network and on high speeds of mobile internet connection we continued increasing our g network and by the end of september our services on g are available in  regions of russian federation which covers more than  of the population and services or prices internet lte inaudible in  bigger states of the countryour g infrastructure expanded by  since the beginning of the year and included almost  base station the amount of g traffic generated over the quarter increased by  year on year and it accounted for  of the total mobile data traffic the increase in traffic was achieved due to our attractive offering active marketing promotion and growth in number of g devices on our network and the number of units is approximately  million currentlyin q we expanded also the coverage of the lte roaming services and increased the number of countries where subscribers can enjoy seamless roaming lte roaming is now available in  countries inaudible with  operators also im proud to say that in accordance with the spectrum sharing commission which we obtained from roskomnadzor russian regulator we opened the whole  megahertz band in lte  spectrum for megafon and yota subscribers in moscowpreviously we used the mvno model now each operator obtains flexibility to use the combined spectrum and the spectrum sharing improved the customer experience and the speeds in the networkwith this im turning it over to vlad wolfson our chief commercial officer thank youvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer thank you anna good afternoon ladies and gentlemen let me update you on our services that are becoming increasingly popular among our subscribers i will start with megafon tv megafon has a unique offering for megafon tv users of the socalled allincluded line of bundles we offer free access to  tv channels and several feature films and this traffic is now buildduring  to date megafon tv audience has more than doubled and stood at  million users at the end of september approximately  of active megafon tv users also use one of our allincluded bundles and approximately  of active tv customers use their smartphones or tablets to consume the content we continue adding premium hd content to our tv platform and also come up with attractive offerings together with russias largest corporate holders and content providersas an example in october megafon tv users were offered a unique opportunity to watch five new episodes of a locally popular tv series molej yoshka for youth sports team before it premiered on the ctc entertainment channel we continue to improve the megafon tv app and our effort bared good fruit currently the average user rating of our app in the largest online application and content stores is above  of  being the maximumin the next slide i would like to give you some more color on our new financial products sergey has already mentioned that in august we unveiled our megafon debit card this is a product aimed to meet our users demand for a simpler payment and money transfer vehicle the card was initially launched in moscow and saint petersburg and since october it is available across russiathe card is fully integrated with a mobile account and has features similar to an ordinary debit card it makes money transfers easier offers cashback from partners and even has interest accrual on the balance we believe that the card is a good solution to promote existing subscriber loyalty and attract new customers and can generate additional profit through valueadded servicessince we have just launched the card we believe it is a bit too early to share any performance numbers yet but we will be happy to update you on that when we present fullyear results let me just say at this point that the card is quickly picking up with our customersand with this i would like to turn it over to gevork vermishyan who will present our financial performance for the third quartergevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo thanks a lot were on slide  our financial result third quarter  our total revenue for the third quarter marginally decreased by  year on year reaching over rub billion we posted  decline in consolidated wireless revenue impacted by a decrease in traditional voice services in mass market partially that was offset by mobility revenues in bb and bg segments as well as in yotaour fixed revenue and revenue from sales and equipments and accessories continue to demonstrate healthy growth rates almost fully offsetting the performance in mobile revenue nine months trend remains very positive as we consolidated revenue increase  compared to nine months of the previous year in q our oibda line decreased by  year on year nonetheless showing  uplift sequentiallymarginwise our russian business demonstrated healthy  rank out net profit decreased by  year on year and that was impacted by lower oibda higher depreciation amortization costs noncash loss from equity and associates especially euroset and additional income tax accruals related to tax audit in tajikistanin q  our investment has decreased by  year on year reaching rub billion importantly i would like to remind here that the comparison base of q  was elevated by the acquisition price of smart which was capitalized in the amount of rub billion in  net of that our capex was down  year on yearso we managed to reduce our capital investment expenditure due to stricter prioritization of network development projects and optimization of technical solutions for example installation of multiband base stations installation of ip radio relay lines instead of fiber optic lines and various network sharing activitiesi want to underpin that the reduction of capex had no impact on network development program as we fully implement our plans in natural terms for this year so as a result of the above ie lower capex coupled with realized cash extraction from idle working capital our free cash flow increased by  year on yearnext coming to revenue components our mobile revenue was down  as i mentioned year on year as its major component traditional voice services contracted due to the following factors we discussed it before but we want to say it again in the end of march we redesigned our bundled tariff plans to make our offering more competitive in terms of price and in terms of allowancesas a result of our active promotion of bundled tariffs in q and q this year the number of subscribers using our bundle is drastically increasing including not only new but including the existing clients have been switching from active  from archive tariff plans to bundles the introduction of free onnet calling and free national onnet roaming stimulated our clients to talk moreas a result the share of this kind of traffic in the total voice traffic has significantly increased and we see that as a reflection in the elevated direct cost in mobility i want to also to mention the roaming situation expectedly due to temporary closing of most popular foreign traveling destinations more russian citizens more clients preferred to stay in russia and we saw reduction in our roaming revenuemobile data revenue steeped in terms of its performance to  year on year despite strong expansion of a data user base by almost  and despite the traffic increase by  year on year our mobile data revenue is under pressure in terms of the growth rates due to higher penetration of bundled tariffs and active promotion of mobile data offerings with higher data allowancesspeaking about fixed revenue it continued healthy performance on the back of bb and bc clientbase expansion so it went up  year on yearsales of handsets and accessories continued to show strong momentum and increased by on the next slide i will quickly walk you through our customers so we managed to expand our subscriberbase by  million customers in russia which is an equivalent of  increase versus the previous year higher adoption of data mobile devices coupled with our affordable data offerings allowed us to increase the number of data users by almost  reaching  penetration into the basenext slide on kpis around data so you see that the dsu has rapidly increased by  in q  driven by bundle and internet options with higher mobile data allowances higher sales of dataenabled devices and also further development and improvement for our g service  g network which provides our subscribers with access to highspeed connectivityour data arpu has decreased  year on year as market dictating appmb price points have outweighed the bullish dsu trendspeaking about oibda performance so the contraction of gross profit margin by  was the key factor that impacted the oibda line the gross profit decline was attributable through the following factors i will name those so i think we need more clarity on the factorsso first and foremost the mathematical change in revenue mix in favor of low marginal segments ie fixed and handset and accessories that created a downward pressure on marginality absolutely on a rational stance of competition in retail sector with very tiny margins also added a lot of pressure to bottom linehigher interconnect expenses driven by the increasing share of our outgoing calls due to generous allowances within the bundles all that created serious pressure on the service revenue  service gross revenue  gross profit im sorrysales and marketing expenses exhibited  growth due to high dealer commissions so all above was partially balanced through ga cost reduction which went down by  in particular there are different trends within this group of cost line items rent and utilities were up  following the network development and following the utility cost increase  high utility expensesso in q  we think it was a peak season in terms of utility costs as tariffs in natural monopolies were indexed using the inflation levels of the previous year which was elevated the cpi in  was very high so we also continued to pay double rent payment attributable to our office building in oruzheyny which we own but we do not consolidate into our accountsthere was a downward movement in personnel expenses due to revision of bonus accruals we also kept advertising and marketing spend under control  lower year on yearso thats all on the pl side let me quickly walk you through balance sheet items in the third quarter we continue to enjoy very favorable market sentiment and environment to replenish our liquidity at attractive rates and tenureswe remained focused on optimization of our cash and cash equivalent structure to mitigate foreign exchange fees on the liability side and ensure that all payments to our vendors in hard currencies are honored in full in hard currency that said in q we increased the portion of hard currency in our cash and cash equivalents to  which is almost equal to the hard currency nominal value of our liabilitiesour leverage ratio remained at healthy level of  it went up a little bit from the previous quarter due to the payment of dividends in the amount of rub billionlastly on this part of the presentation a few words on the debt portfolio structure we extended the maturity of the  of the debt portfolio significantly moving the repayments to  and rd year so now the average loan life exceeds three yearswe increased the ruble debt of component in our debt portfolio to  using and including the hedges so using the  or activating the hedging strategy so matching the portfolio ruble equivalent of debt portfolio to cash and cash equivalent in hard currencieslastly in my side of the presentation i have a few words about the guidance we reiterate the guidance on the revenue from flat to low singledigit growth rate certain events that took place in q q force us to review the guidance on oibda by only rub billion so from rub billion to rub billionim sure you will ask questions so i will explain the reasons during the qa but that rub billion reduction in our outlook was compensated with the revision  downward revision of our capex guidance from rub billion to rub billion so that the net cash position remained intactthats all on my side and i give the floor to moderator to run qa thank youquestions and answersoperator thank you operator instructions alex kazbegi renaissance capitalalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst well your work i guess preempted the question so yes indeed if you would be so kind to go maybe in the same detail in terms of understanding where the pressure comes on the cost side and specifically also one more question there on the salaries and accruals would you expect a sort of reversal in the q and so do we see this q more like an outlier or this is inaudible there so thats the first questionsecond question on your data revenues i mean you had two quarters if you look quarter on quarter pretty flat data revenue growth and now you have the slight recovery so do you see this as sort of the end of the conversion into the bundles and bigger consumption kicking in or this is still too early to say that the data revenues will start growing again from this point onwardsand a last one maybe very quickly and appreciate on the new card that you cannot give much information but i just wanted to know what do you expect to get from the introduction of the card because you do incur certain costs  on the balances understandably its a loyalty card as well but what is the general expectation how should we kind of judge on it is it the retention is it the revenue attached to that you expect to have or how do we look at the card introduction beyond the obvious ones so to saygevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo ill take first question on the cost side so what are the oneoff factors that on top of what i said explaining the performance cost line items driving the oibda in q what will happen in q and what brings the guidance on oibda rub billion down the first so we have to compare it with sort of the business plan that we had in  for  in fact this business plan we did not expect such drastic competition in the retail sector in distributionwe expected some gross profit coming out from sales and equipment we expect the margin there but as i want to underscore absolutely rational performance of the players on the retail distribution market almost led the whole revenue profitability to a zero margin or very tiny margin so we just lost serious quantum of oibda from the initial plan thats firstsecond we anticipated that in  we will accomplish one big integrated project with bg client this in progress we are on it but seems that well not be completing that on time it will be deferred to  so part of the ebitda attributable to that its a project slide to  and its not in  and thirdly we didnt expect that drastic tax audits and fiscal pressure in tajikistan so we will have to record rub billion in additional reserves all that drives our view that would rather be sort of in line with reality and guide you in markets as it goes trendwise factoring this oneoff eventalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst sorry kazakhstan is yet to be charged rightgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo im sorry can you repeatalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst i said kazakhstan which you mentioned is not charged for the qgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo yes that is an accrual cashwise its not sort of charged in inaudible but management assumes that the probability of cash tax is  so we sort of accrued  basis now in terms of sellers and accruals yes you should read this as a oneoff reversal of provision that has been made in q q q now reversed in q  sorry q and q assuming that the targets will be achieved on medium levelnow when we have more crystallization view what will be the yearend and what will be the achievement of the targets we reverse in q the provision for bonuses so q will be elevated sequentiallyalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst yes yesgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo on data yes let me start maybe vlad will add couple of words i think the whole situation around data revenue is coming as a result of general trend that megafon has made a decision to eliminate the price premiums on bundled tariffs in q  first quarter this year so we had to stay pricepointwise as close to the market as possiblewe were not driving this competition were not driving the price wars we were reacting but not overreacting so the revenue allocation which we earn  the monthly fees which we earn from the clients on to the revenue products ie voice sms data value services remained intact percentagewise so all that happened is that revenue on data particularly ie part of the bundle allocated on data revenue have suffered a contraction in terms of the arpus because the new arpu or arpu for a new customer is definitely lower than the arpu for archived inaudible so there was that factoryes good on the third question about megafon bank card vlad i think you will have to take itvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer interpreted thank you gevork alex thank you for your question on megafon cards first of all i would like to say that obviously this card today is a new product in the financial area for us and indeed is related to certain costs for its launch and servicing we do not position ourselves as a bank this is a partnership project and our costs are much lower than for any other card issues in the marketas for the economics of the projects it is as you have justly asked is twofold the first component and perhaps the main component is and will continue to be the loyalty of our customers and retaining them with megafon but the project also has a revenue side and as we have mentioned the performance of the bank card project well provide an update on that when we discuss  results for the full yearalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst okay thats fine thank youoperator ivan kim vtb capitalivan kim vtb capital  analyst my first question is about the growth outlook for next year can you please elaborate a little on what you expect given the recent probably little positive price action in the market with the elimination of national roaming  sorry introduction of national roaming fees actually some price increases here and there do you expect maybe some data growth acceleration some voice revenue stabilization any color on that will be very helpfulthe second question is on your payables so the payables there was a negative change in the payables and the cash flow of more than rub billion in the third quarter i just wanted to ask what its related to and whether it will be reversed shortly maybe in the fourth quarter and the first half of gevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo gevork ill take the question so in terms of the growth outlook for next year as you may perceive were not ready at this point of time to give you guidance in terms of numbers and structure for  yet it will be done in the course of fullyear announcement results later next year but i think we are in position to give you general sentiment and cautious hope that overall based on the q and q announced accounts by all players in this industry we really understand that the market is too  an overly competitive there is no room for further innovation and development of investments with this kind of pricesand irrational competition is no longer  should no longer stay in place we are receiving these signals from the numbers that are competitive support the numbers that we support so we cautiously think that in terms of core products the main directionalization of behavior in terms of distribution the margin will come back to the market on handsets and accessories and we think that this really can happen alongside with more warm sentiment on the macro side next year yes if i addressed this question can you please repeat the question on apsivan kim vtb capital  analyst yes of course so there was the reduction payables of about rub billion in the third quarter i was just wondering whether  what its related to and whether it will be reversed in the fourth quarter maybe or sometime shortlygevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo yes understood so in terms of ap as big part of working capital component we  i dont know if we commented that before we ordered a lot of retail inventory in q to make sure that we smoothly bypass the launch of our sap retail project on st of july it went live called jur so we have  as we have deferred payment obligations with vendors that supply this retail equipment to us so that was accounts payables when we paid out this accounts the accounts payables reduced so thats one and secondly  second  that was the biggest one to be honest second was the mentioned factor around regional bonus ancillaryivan kim vtb capital  analyst okay so basically we should not expect this item to kind of reverse or change in the future rightgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo well it is a seasonal item obviously and you should expect some movements in q as  and q next year as we supply the necessary quantum of network and have deferred payment obligations the aps can be increased a little bit through that period and then reduced in qivan kim vtb capital  analyst okay thank youoperator alexander vengranovich otkritie capitalalexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst interpreted looking at your accounts we can see that this figure of yours is lossmaking and do you want to change anything in euroset operations as your shareholder and whether you have a common understanding with your partners about the future of that company if you could share your insights on that it would be very useful and interestingsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted thank you for your question vlad wolfson will handle your questionvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer interpreted as of today we dont have any special plans to change the way euroset operates we are currently looking at different options for the development of our distribution channels in general and we look at different implementation options but let me say that today no decision is final and no specific decisions have been made yet in terms of our daytoday operation or the daytoday operation of euroset as a shareholder we participate in this supervisory board together with the other shareholder vimpelcom so your question about whether we coordinate our actions yes we do when we work with the assets and inaudible continuesalexander vengranovich otkritie capital  analyst interpreted will there be any clarity about euroset at the beginning of  when you intend to announce your new strategy and secondly looking at the results of the previous quarter there was some expectation that in the second half of this year there will be an optimization of retail network so has there been any developments there and what was the performance of the number of retail pointsvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer thank you very clear questions currently we do not have any timing during which we contemplate any changes in the euroset operations as for our own retail we have already shared with you that we are fully satisfied with the operation of our internal  of our owned network both by quality and by volume and we believe that the volume of distribution channels in the russian market in our view is quite high so we indeed plan to change the number of retail points in the future but in a gradual manner not in any large movements so we are working very gradually to optimize our own networkoperator igor semenov deutsche bankigor semenov deutsche bank  analyst interpreted i just wanted to clarify on the guidance did i understand correctly that rub billion in tajikistan this will be an additional hit to ebitda in q or this as well  i mean on my estimate the  so for the negative ebitda for three quarters was about rub million so is it an additional rub billion or the total for the year will be rub billion negative ebitdaunidentified company representative no thats not correct rub billion will not be an additional hit on the q ebitda rub million of that amount has already been included in the nine months ebitda that we have reported and the balance the remaining amount is in fact below oibda so its already in our net profit for the nine months and its already in so there wont be any effect on tajikistan on the fourth quarterbut the rub million effect is in the nine months and that is together with the explanations that ive given on the distribution on the shift of oibda of a major project to  so that combined gives the difference of rub billion versus the business plan and in order to exclude the effect on the cash flow we had a mirror action on our capexigor semenov deutsche bank  analyst interpreted thank you understood also if you could clarify the reasons as to why you have decided to move interest from investment cash flow to financial cash flowunidentified company representative igor a very simple answer we just followed ifrs standards so previously we used gaap and now we use ifrs so we just followed the ifrs guidance here there is no special reason there is no business need for thatoperator interpreted operator instructions roman arbuzov ubsroman arbuzov ubs  analyst interpreted my first question is about capex whats your view on capex going forward and whether you are comfortable with the return on your investments and is there any  are there any opportunities for optimizing your capex and also if you do that how do you intend to maintain the technological leadership that you have mentionedand my second question is about the competition in the market so you have mentioned that the competition is irrational specifically in distribution so it would be interesting to know do you see even today any real steps for the improvement of the competitive environment or are we still at the level of signals or some prerequisites for the  for some future change or is your confidence in the change in the markets growingsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted sergey soldatenkov will handle your question let me participate in answering your question and thank you roman for your question regarding capex we are quite reasonable human beings and today as we see it capex is an instrument for strategy we often overlook that yes we are a technology industry so we have to maintain a certain level of capex to increase the traffic capability to improve the quality of services et cetera but we perfectly understand that if revenue doesnt grow we understand that maintaining the levels of capex at the level of last year even this year will not be  will not be reasonableobviously we cant share any numbers but we see that next year well be seeing a reduction in capex even if capex goes down in our strategy we will still plan for different clusters in the digital fields in which have the most number of subscribers so we will maintain our capex level to implement our digital strategyas for your second question the competition in the markets whether theres any real improvement such as signals i think that all players understand very clearly where we are going and where we will end up in two or three years i think that they understand it very clearly and whether that has already started i dont think it has yet because just recently our competitor tele launched free calls to other networks although they do say that this promo will only last until the new year but it demonstrates that each operator pursues their own agenda but we say that we will not be participating in price wars in terms of bundled tariff we want to have conditional rather than unconditional bundled offers we are working on that and we think that the competition is looking at that tooroman arbuzov ubs  analyst thank you and conditional bundled offers what do you mean can you please commentsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo what does that mean that means if a person spends a certain amount inaudible continues thats when you have an unlimited offer but we can  also additional services which help us earn currently there will be a bundleoperator interpreted alex kazbegi renaissance capitalalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst just to  just going back to this question about the reversal of the bonuses and more maybe general question is it based on a change in the management compensation and if that is true maybe you could just elaborate a bit what the management compensation will be based on going forward yes thats about itunidentified company representative the answer is very simple within the personnel expense ie physical personal expense that we run on monthly basis there is an additional every month  every month we accrue additional portion of a provision of  that explains the likelihood of overall management and all employees the likelihood of being compensated if the target for this particular year are achievedso every month up until  this is ninth month september we allocate this accrual on the basis that the probability is medium when we approach to the september we have more visibility on the yearend numbers and the probability of achieving or not achieving certain targets that were established now today we see that the business plan and the targets for megafon are less probable in terms of achievement and we reverse the accruals that have been made during the past nine monthsalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst yes so it has nothing to do with the change inaudibleunidentified company representative thats absolutely correct it doesnt have  doesnt lead to more capital changealex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst understood thank youoperator olga bystrova credit suisseolga bystrova credit suisse  analyst good question on strategy update and the dividend policy update that you mentioned in the beginning of the call in terms of dividend policy are you planning to time it together early next year and maybe if you can elaborate at least conceptual thinking of the new dividend policyand second question youve sort of elaborate a little bit on your competition if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how you view current price changes in the market by your competitors and gs some marginal changes by vimpelcom as wellsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted sergey soldatenkov is handling your question i will try to handle that question olga we are not showing any specific steps of our new strategy but at the same time we are working to update our dividend policy and from our recent meetings i have a very clear understanding of investor expectations in terms of the dividend policyindeed as you know twice a year we pay dividends and although we need to understand whether the shareholders will approve i understand that it could be misleading for you and well try to work on that we will try to make it more certain but so far its premature to talk about it because we will be discussing that at the board of directorsif i understand correctly your second question what is our understanding of competitor actions in terms of the rates and plans i will reiterate that each of the competitors make their own steps some upwards some downwards that includes national roaming unfortunately considering an increase of international roaming tariff thats not just our wish thats also what the european union is making us to do essentially so there may be upwards moves as well its important that everybody understands that that is the right approach sometimes and vlad will add on thatvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer interpreted thank you sergey i would like to add a couple of words on the price completion we apparently are not in support of price wars however we operate in a market and we watch very attentively every move that our competitors makebut we do have our own commercial policy we have our own marketing policies so i dont think you could expect from us the mirroring or repetition of what the competitors make we may have totally asymmetric responses but we are also concerned about the monetization of the services that well provide and we will make every effort to ensure that it wasnt just monetization through simply increasing prices but also through increasing customer value so i would really be thinking in terms of new services and better customer experience thank youoperator there are no further questions ladies and gentlemen

soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted good afternoon ladies and gentlemen im very happy to welcome you on our call to present megafons results for  i will now discuss the years key highlights as well as our key initiatives and projects and my colleagues will then follow with a detailed discussion of our operating and financial resultsim happy to report that despite a highly competitive environment in the russian market megafon was able to deliver on its three key targets of  that is revenue oibda and capex the growing pressure from tough competition  during the year we had to reduce prices for services while increasing spending on both subscriber acquisition and retention and network development thus megafons financial performance for the fourth quarter and fullyear  closely reflect the market situation our consolidated net revenue remained broadly flat yearonyear at rub billion the growth in data revenue slowed down and our oibda margin declined to  in this uncertain environment we took a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening our current market position and which we hope will have a positive effect on our financial performance going forwardread morewe shifted our focus away from continuing to aggressively build our subscriber base and made it our priority to ensure existing customer loyalty by improving the customer care quality and delivering customer value we believe at present the prices for certain mobile services are at their lowest economically viable levels that substantially limits their monetization potential that is why at the end of december  we made a decision to introduce limits in those of our plans that had previously been unlimited and to revamp our bundled offerings last year we continued implementing a number of important projects aimed at improving our operating efficiency such as the unified billing that we have mentioned already the shared services center an update on these will be presented by my colleagues in particular by anna serebryanikovaour signature event for the period was the acquisition of a controlling voting stake in mail ru group the transaction was closed in early february this year receiving an overwhelming support from our shareholders this step will enable us to transform our business and evolve from a mobile operator into an integrated digital communications company the acquisition will also enable us to jointly with mail ru develop brand new products and services for our customers which will combine mobile data and digital technology capabilities we hope that these services will open a new chapter in the history of both megafon and hopefully the entire telecom market in russiain  we remained committed to ensuring regular distributions to our shareholders in december  the egm approved the dividends in the amount of rub billion thus total dividend for  amounted to rub billion which is in line with the  amount im also pleased to report that in march this year megafon was chosen as an official provider of telecom infrastructure and additional services at all locations for the events of the fifa  confederations cup and fifa  world football cup megafon will carry out construction preparation and operation of all engineering and telecom infrastructure at all locations for the international sports events megafon will build test g zones and will offer

to five years including a review of how we approach our distribution network we hope to be able to present the updated strategy at a dedicated event at the end of may that is it from my side and with this im turning over to anna serebryanikova our cooanna serebryanikova megafon pao  coo thank you sergey good morning ladies and gentlemen i will start with a short update on the key projects which

efficiency via focused management of this tower portfolio we expect to achieve a better return on capex and incremental gains from active involvement in a tower leasing market you can see the key project implementation stages on this slide the first stage is the actual spinoff of the tower infrastructure and related assets to the tower company which is expected to be completed in summer  according to our current plans the first tower company will be ready for sale in on the next slide id like to share our results in the network infrastructure development we remain focused on improving the coverage and quality of our mobile telecommunications network further network rollout and modernization we also strengthened our fiber optic infrastructure which supports further rollout of our mobile network our fiber optic infrastructure is the largest network among russian mobile operators during the year the total number of base stations of all types increased by  yearonyear and exceeded  base stations also the number of g and g stations grew by  to almost  through organic construction and modernization of our network we increased the total length of our fiber optic network by  to more than  kilometers and increased the percentage of base stations connected via fiber to  we also entered into longterm leases on fiber optic lines in order to provide our customers in hardtoreach regions in the far east with highquality serviceson the next slide you see the improving of the results of our activities on improvement of quality of connections and provided services for our clients this is our key focus during the year we identified the needs of our subscribers in terms of network quality throughout the number of user satisfaction surveys and analysis of customer requests to contact centers as a result we introduced a key quality indicator system we implemented serious solution additions to our gnoc facilities in particular we upgraded management and monitoring systems used at our gnoc and also adopted the performance management system which is aimed at registering usage and quality metrics of provided servicesduring the year we continued to introduce solutions adding new functionality to our radio access network and optimized the parameters of backhaul network sections to improve the endtoend quality metrics of our services in  we introduced the ran quality of service technology which enables a better distribution of g and g network resources among subscribers and services depending on the type of service we implemented lte  as an additional layer and also continued to develop other layers depending on our customers needs and regional situation im also proud to say that megafon was the first operator in russia who launched the fullfledged commercial voice over lte network it enables us to provide our subscribers so far in moscow with high quality of voice services and faster call setup reduced cost of internet sessions when making a call via the lte network and we plan to continue this rollout in  all the efforts undertaken in  allowed us to improve key connectivity quality metrics seriously reduce the dropped call rates and increase the call setup success ratea few words on the g network developments of the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we remained focused on the development of our g network infrastructure to maintain highquality and highspeed of mobile internet connections as of the end of the year the g network included more than  base stations our g services are available now in  regions of russia while services of highspeed internet lteadvanced are available in  cities and regions the amount of g traffic generated in the fourth quarter increased by  yearonyear and accounted to  of the total mobile data traffic the increase in traffic was achieved due to our attractive offerings active marketing promotions and growth in the number of g devices registered in our network through more than  million units at the end of  with this im turning it over to vlad wolfson our commercial director who will talk about further development of the product thank youvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial

essentially in the four last months of the year was approximately rub billion this testifies that megafon cardholders actively use the card for payments including for megafon services as of today

 yearonyear and reached almost  legal entities while the number of bx mobile users grew by a record  and exceeded  million total bx segment revenue was up by  while bx mobile revenue was up by  higher than the mobile revenue growth rate across the group according to tmt consulting in  megafon ranked second in bx mobile revenue with a market share of  going forward megafon is looking to move from competing on price to competing on quality of services over  we completed and initiated several large and important projects in bc and bg segments we signed a contract with glonass satellite navigation system to act as a fullmvno partner we started a project together with rosseti national power grid company to install in  power stations intrusion monitoring and telemetry systemsin  megafon provided comprehensive telecommunications and engineering support services for two major events the russiaasean forum in sochi in may and at the confederation cup russia draw procedure part of the preparation for the  football world cup im also pleased to report that megafon won the tender and signed a contract with russian federal treasury to ensure broadband and mobile communications

of geotracking and new hr and car fleet monitoring technology we also were the first in russia to pilot test the narrowband iot with that im turning it over to our cfo gevork thank yougevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo i will start with traditional overview of our earnings trends in fourth quarter and fullyear  our total consolidated revenue for fourth quarter totaling rub billion decreased by  yearoveryear revenue was impacted by  decline in wireless revenue as a result of decrease of traditional voice services however we continue to see strong growth in revenue from sales and equipment which increased more than  and we also saw stabilization of growth rates in wireline revenue in fourth quarter where revenue was up by  though it is important to highlight that fixed revenue in bx demonstrated on a yearly basis solely doubledigit performance on an annual basis our consolidated revenue was up  which is completely in line with the guidance oibda wise in fourth quarter our oibda declined by  yearoveryear to rub billion our oibda for the fullyear  totaled rub billion which was also above our fullyear guidancei would like to stress out that we reported adjusted oibda which is presented net of noncash impairment charge in the amount of rub billion relating to the goodwill allocated to the broadband internet cgu which is netbynet our adjusted oibda margin in q was down by  yearoveryear it came down to  while fullyear oibda margin achieved  our net income decreased by  in the quarter and it was largely because of this rub million noncash impairment that i mentioned before and elevated da important to say that the adjusted net income for this netbynet impairment shows over  increase on a quarterly basisnext slide the fourth quarter is traditionally a quarter with higher capex numbers as you know this year was not an exception in q  we spent approximately third of our annual capex budget and as a result succeeded in delivering on our fullyear targets as well our actual capex  came to rub billion which is rub billion below the upper range of the fullyear guidance its important to say that despite this decrease in capex weve completed all natural kpis in our technical plan of development and strong ruble helped us to deliver lower capex meantime our unlevered free cash flow on a quarterly basis was up on the next slide i will speak about revenue components q  wireless revenue was down  mainly as a result of continued contraction in voice due to growing popularity of bundled tariffs which were revised in spring last year in response to the market competitive pressures and increasing number of subscribers using mobile internet and shifting to digital technologies as a result of growing popularity of messages and ott services our mobile data continued to be one of the largest contributors to total revenue with a share of more than  the growth rates in mobile data stabilized and were standing at  in q  we saw a continuing upward trend in data user base which increased  to  million customersfixed line segment continued to perform well but stabilized in fourth quarter at  but as i said one of the reason was  i will say that one of the reason was equalization of comparable base in  there was an nonorganic portion of gars revenue and its important to say that on the annual basis the fixed revenue is showing good results sales of handsets and accessories continued to show strong growth rates increased  the revenue in this segment benefited from higher demand from more expensive and highend devices which were marketed along with attractive bundled offerings the average price of dataenabled devices sold in our megafon retail stores has increased by few words about the customer base on the second slide as said previously it has increased by  reached  million users at the same time our data user base continued to increase at a healthy rate of  on the back of higher adoption of data mobile devices coupled with our data offerings within bundled tariffs our data user base now accounts for almost  overall subscriber base compared to  a year agonow i would like to give you an update on our kpis the expansion of data user base higher data allowances increased sales of dataenabled devices and further development of our network allowed us to increase data usage per customer to more than five gigs per month in q  which is increasingly high  higher than the year ago despite higher data usage our data arpu decreased  yearonyear due to lower price per megabyte an increasing share of users choosing bundled tariffs with higher data allowances profitability wise which is on the next slide adjusted oibda net of noncash impairment charge has decreased by  yearonyear the key reason was the decline in gross profit by  as a result of the increased cost of services mainly attributable to higher sales of equipment and accessories which posted strong growth rates and accounted for  of the total revenue versus  year ago the increase in cost of services was partially offset by lower sga costssales and marketing expenses have been under control they decreased this quarter  due to lower advertising spend and smarter dealership spend ga costs were down  due to lower employee benefits and social charges they went down  and decreased radio frequency fees by  as a result of change of roskomnadzor methodology relating to frequency charge calculation which was introduced in late  few words about our balance sheet at the end of the quarter our leverage stood at  times net debttoebitda mainly as a result of the increase in longterm portion of total debt and lower oibda  we believe our leverage remains at the upperend of acceptable range over one quarter we continue to increase the portion of cash held in usd in order to mitigate the risks associated with the execution of our foreign exchange denominated liabilities so this portion grew from  to  sequentially here im glad to say that our debt structure and leverage led to an upgrade of the outlook on russian sovereign rating by moodys from negative to stable on next slide you see our debt portfolio structure as well as of the yearend as you may see over one year we have managed to significantly redesign the structure of our debt portfolio to mitigate risks associated with this refinancing and repaymentnow over  of our debt portfolio is denominated in rubles matching our revenue mix significantly extended average portfolio life now approximately half of our debt becomes due payable in five years or later which is a comfortable situation in early  we continued to optimize our debt in february we signed an agreement with sberbank a total amount of rub billion with a maturity in  the funds and the proceeds were used to finance the purchase of economic interest in mail ru with this agreement we also modified terms under three existing facilities jumbo facility totaling rub billion including lower interest rates and revised early repayment terms following that in march this year  we executed a partial refinancing of the existing ruble debt facility with alfabank and unicredit a total amount of rub billion and also managed to significantly reduce interest rates and extend maturitythe conclusive slide in my presentation speaks about guidance traditionally we expect our revenue to be flat or lowsingle digit growth rate in  we also anticipate our adjusted oibda to be in the range of rub billion to rub billion and the decline in oibda will be offset by a reduced capex guidance which now stands in the range of rub billion to rub billion as opposed to rub billion demonstrated in it is important to refresh here that this forecast represent standalone numbers they dont include financial results of mail ru and financial forecasts but based on mail ru guidance they expect a standalone revenue in  to grow  to  between rub billion and rub billion and they expect their oibda margin to be around  our guidance is intentionally conservative on oibda reflecting the uncertainties in the current environment and does not take into account synergies from mail ru transaction nor any potential recovery in the market conditions thank you very much with this lets open qa sessionquestions and answersoperator operator instructions alex kazbegi renaissance capitalalex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst i have three questions and all of them about the guidance please the first one is about your revenue guidance i think i just saw the interview which mr soldatenkov gave and he said  service revenue growth so if you could confirm that this revenue guidance which you are giving of course includes the handsets as well and its indeed  service is that what you are expecting and i guess that is meaning that reduction on the equipment salesnumber two is visavis your capex if you could give us a bit of color on how much of that is driven by fx again and how much of that so to say real reduction in the capex if i may qualify so to say real reduction in the capex and what is the main so to say purpose of this capex in any case is it mostly coverage is it mostly transport where does it goand lastly on your ebitda again mostly recurring again to interview of mr soldatenkov where he suggested that the euroset could be split between yourself and vimpelcom possibly even within a month and i think as you mentioned this ebitda doesnt include any external so to say factors but if you would consider for instance indeed the split of euroset happening how would that change your guidance for instance could you give us a bit of color on that thank you very muchsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted alex thank you for your question let me start with question number three about the potential split of euroset this question is handled by sergey soldatenkov we wouldnt want to comment on this so when we are prepared to make a statement we will let you know we will update the marketas for your other questions indeed yes earlier today there was a press conference and i was given an interview and it wasnt  but it was rather  to  that we are seeing for next year not for   we believe to be a year of stabilization when the focus on the development of our base will help us overcome the switching over of subscribers from our older tariff plans to the newer ones so next year is where we expect to see growthgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo second question with respect to the capex guidance here straight answer to your question would be that the fx rate as we have in the business plan which is the basis for building up the guidance on capex has zero impact on the difference numbers so a fixed noise is absolutely omitted here in reality the structure of the capex easily it will be changing yearonyear in  versus  not dramatically but still it is being changed first and foremost our investment governance prescribes that capital allocation are getting only those projects which bear higher roic and we focus on that so it is easy for us having set a monitory target for investments in next year to prioritize the investment projects which will be put into gearsecondly when the standard technology is developing and on the back of heavy lte investments over the past years we feel base case as part of the investment budget shall not bear that much of g coverage kind of capex than it used to have in previous years so basically these are explanations why we believe that rub billion to rub billion decrease is acceptable and not risky and of course that anticipates that should forex misbehave and ruble pop up to  then obviously we would have a problem and we would come to the market explain and revisealex kazbegi renaissance capital  analyst okay understood can i go back to this ebitda guidance question i understand its all speculative about whether the split happens or not but just to say it would happen would that warrant revision of the guidance or not reallygevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo one of the disclaimers given in the guidance traditionally is that when we are making the guidance we put into it the information the management has at the point of giving this guidance thats why now nonorganic ma you dont see a mail ru numbers in here nor you see any potential impacts of ma transactionsoperator roman arbuzov ubsroman arbuzov ubs  analyst thank you very much for taking the question my first was actually a follow up on alexs question around the ebitda guidance it feels somewhat more conservative and as he opened say it is conservative but i was just wondering is there anything you made clear euroset is not there but is there anything else that maybe making it more conservative potentially so things like tajikistan we saw some oneoffs last year we also saw historically some volatility with expenses coming from the longterm incentive program so maybe there are a few things that are on your mind that can pop up in  so if you could please just give us maybe a little bit more color that will be very helpfuland then my second question is just on the dividends and so obviously its a board decision and you are limited in what you can say but maybe you can comment on the dividends from the perspective of what you think the company can actually afford as opposed to what actually happens in terms of your ability to pay youve mentioned that you are now probably towards the higherend of the leverage range in terms of where you want to beand also youre talking about your ebitda being down midsingle digits or potentially even worse in  so with that in mind do you think were still in the times of when megafon can afford to pay out more in dividends than the cash flow that it makes as you have been doing for the last two years or do you think we should really be thinking as  of cash flow is sort of the topend of where you should realistically be in terms of the dividend or potentially even lower to maybe have some deleveraging i appreciate you are limited in terms of what you can say precisely here but just some discussion on your ability to pay dividends that will be helpful thank you very muchgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo yes youre right roman we are indeed limited in discussing the dividends i think the only points that i can mention here is that we of course talk freely to the sell side we of course talk to buy side and we understand what are the areas of concern of the existing dividend policy which was introduced prior to ipo back in  on different market conditions and different times so we understand that we need to add more transparency to this dividend policy and more predictability to the dividend policythis is absolutely certain and this is workinprogress today sometime later during this year presumably in april you will hear the boards recommendation so its not long to wait and also we need to say that we promised to you that the strategy session will be held in format of capital market day at the end of may and this capital market day and strategy discussion obviously would have to be followed by an announcement of the concept of new dividend policy that this strategy can deliver thats all i can say on the dividendswith respect to the first question lets put it this way so you see our revenue guidance which is flat to singledigit growth rate you also understand the inflationary pressures that the direct costs and the operational costs have in the pl you also hopefully recall that we are really striving and making cost management exercises on a daily basis and the good testament for that is fourth quarter oibda which came in absolute terms more or less flattish but in reality the guidance message that im trying to send to the market is that the market environment is still uncertain the oibda guidance extrapolates the trend we previously saw with half rate dynamics so i mean we decelerate the decline trend in oibda which is already something good achievement and any potential shortfall of oibda between the years is covered by and offset by capex to stabilize cash flowsoperator herve drouet hsbcherve drouet hsbc  analyst yes good afternoon thank you again as well for taking my questions first question is trying to get your view on the data services data arpu which you know have been down do you see any room to start to improve those data arpu looking forward i mean is it more matter of how the competition is going to do in certain regions or i mean do you feel that there is more to be monetized especially considering the cheap data pricing you got so i just wanted to get a bit of your view on what you think how promotions will evolve especially this year and where do you see competitions moving in terms of tariff and packages and the second thing is again back to euroset can you tell us so far what prevented it to split euroset between you and vimpelcom what are the main hurdle that prevents you to do it and not to have already done it thank yousergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted vlad wolfson will answer your questionvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer interpreted thank you i will tackle your question regarding tariffs and tariff plans you can see in our documents the numbers that we announced and published demonstrating the data usage is significantly growing and its over  gb per user in the fourth quarter so thats approximately  growth and we can see that data arpu is going down so responding to your question whether there is any reason to believe that this could be changed we do believe that this situation should start to turnaround in  megafon has discontinued unlimited tariff plans for our users in our new sales we believe this will help us to more accurately offer our services to our users and to monetize the traffic that we can see growing in our network thank you and sergey soldatenkov is handling your question on eurosetsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted i would like to say once again to remind you that we are not commenting this today about any challenges of the splits please give us more time we will get back to you when we are prepared to tell you about the potential split of euroset thank youoperator ivan kim vtb capitalivan kim vtb capital  analyst good evening two questions please firstly can you update us on the data storage law what are the latest developments what are your latest expectations or whats the timeline  any color you can give us on that would be very helpful and secondly gevork if we understood you correctly you said the leverage is now indeed at the upperend of the acceptable range so is it so did you get it right first and second if it is so that probably it means that the dividends will have to come down even though i understand that the dividend push is something to consider later on but there are just some general guidelines here which means that if you are at the upperend of your comfortable leverage level than you have to cap the dividends any thoughts on this will be very helpful thank youanna serebryanikova megafon pao  coo thank you ivan this is anna i will take the first question on data storage in terms of moving the timeline which is now in the law we dont see such indications currently but what we see is that  now you know the issue is within the government and we hope that the government has realized the potential negative impact to the industry of the full scale implementation of the law so i think that there may be some positive developments in terms of duration of the storage and the prefiltering systems thats all i can say thank youivan kim vtb capital  analyst inaudible  microphone inaccessibleanna serebryanikova megafon pao  coo i think that in order to be able to implement the law we need at least  to  months so we dont have more time than summer so i think that the government also understands thatgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo ivan yes gevork here again on the leverage we demonstrate  times leverage as of yearend post announcement events or postsubsequent events as you appreciate and know was a mail ru transaction which obviously took the leverage up  standalone megafon leverage up to two times of course optically starting from first quarter this year going further would really show very nice leverage metrics as we consolidate mail ru operations and sites but understanding that this is an internet company and our economic strategy is  there we think we have to be not sort of giving ourselves a free ride as a result of mail ru consolidation into any discussions about leverage and dividend policyand i know that i probably dont speak very pronounced on sending an pronounced messages on exact dividend policy but i urge you to wait a little bit until we give the privilege of dividend policy adoption to our board of directors what im trying to say is that on a standalone basis leverage metrics are a little bit elevated to my opinion and does not on one hand create any problems with respect to fundamental stability and financial stability of the company since our corporate finance activities and fund raising activities and ability to manage that is at very high level so we borrow cheap and we borrow long and we have very nice and comfortable amortization profile but the carrying cost of debt has an impact on our free cash flow and the more you sort of see our standalone leverage the more leverage that you have is declining so we need to find a nice balance between fundamental value of the company capital allocation through dividends and prudent credit metrics which we will do and communicate to the market sometime very soonoperator inaudible goldman sachsunidentified participant interpreted thank you for the presentation i have a couple of questions do you have more understanding about your interaction with mail ru and can you perhaps share something about this even now when can we expect any joint projectsand my second question is whether you see any potential for capex reduction in absolute terms in  or will capex not go down in midterm to longterm thank yousergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted so since youre asking in russian i will be happy to answer in the russian as well in terms of interaction with mail ru certainly for us this is a very good transaction in terms of our differentiation our digital strategy differentiation as colleagues have mentioned well be telling you more about this when we announce our strategy later this year but even today we can see two areas that are currently quite obvious for us and these are big data exchange that we will be launching very soon and the vkmobile projectwe will also be presenting them separately we have other sources of synergy we will be telling you about it later because its hard to be telling you about something that we have thought about but not yet implemented and good work continues in terms of our capex guidance we can only limit ourselves to the yearly guidance but the main reason why this annual guidance is going down and hopefully not just for us but across the industry so we believe that you can use it with good probability but according our rules we only guide for one year thank youoperator igor goncharov bcsigor goncharov bcs  analyst yes thank you very much and im not sure which language is more appropriate i will ask in english in terms of further integration of the quantum after the acquisition of mail ru are you comfortable to expand your integration in content in particular if we take a look on your presentation you highlighted you have provided premium access to your subscribers of megafon tv to the product of ctc media is there any chances that you might be looking at providing a stake in the company or in a related companyanna serebryanikova megafon pao  coo i can also take this question first we do not  we never speak about potential ma deals second we do not think that the only way to make a successful partnership is by acquisition we think that  and we are now learning quite successfully that we can do partnerships not only by acquisition thank youoperator sergey libin raiffeisen banksergey libin raiffeisen bank  analyst hello thank you so my question is whether you could share your estimates on cost savings from moving to shared services center and also new headquarters in moscow and if its in anyway reflected in your guidancegevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo yes sergey this is gevork so without telling you the split yearonyear i think this scs project carries as much as rub million savings overall and there explained as an arbitrage between the salaries in a lowcost and highcost environment as well as in lease expenses so the shared service center effect is inside the business plan and therefore is within the guidance the other question was with respect to the savings from hq office rightsergey libin raiffeisen bank  analyst yesgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo okay well in reality yearonyear or sequential comparison does not show and should not show any savings as a result of consolidation of offices the case that we provided when we acquired a  stake or  stake in the company owner of this real estate was the legally binding obligation to see which was signed in  to see at very high rates and very expensive walk away fee instead we negotiated better deals in ruble terms no fx longterm and less space and here we are so the difference is a little bit i mean there is savings but between its like a delta case between forecast and reality so its not factored into the guidance it cannot be factored were going to move premises in two three months and so up until that time we will carry the double lease rents but were going to be still in the money for that particular investmentsergey libin raiffeisen bank  analyst okay but you assume that you stop paying rent for the old offices starting from say second half this year and you also included in the guidance rightgevork vermishyan megafon pao  cfo yes if the question was about that yes youre right were stopping paying rent here we start paying rent there but again you need to understand that were consolidating like five offices including low cost lease offices of netbynet megafon retail stolichny branch and more probably more expensive headquarter megafon and were moving to a rub per square meter per annum so theres not much of a saving as a result of thatoperator olga bystrova credit suisseolga bystrova credit suisse  analyst yes good evening thank you very much for the question the first one is on your own distribution chain youve said several times that you have plans to reduce the number of your own stores if im not mistaken by about  per annum so i just wanted to see if theres any progress on that and maybe you can share with us number of stores you currently have in your own distribution networkand the second question on pricing you mentioned that you have amended prices for the new subscribers at the end of december do you see any opportunity for you or in russia in general to change pricing for the existing subscribers one way or the other and if you do how do you think that will develop and when thank you very muchsergey soldatenkov megafon pao  ceo interpreted olga thank you for your question its handled by vlad wolfsanvlad wolfson megafon pao  chief commercial officer interpreted in terms of our changes in our distribution strategy they do exist indeed we have a program to reduce our own retail stores megafon retail but we do not disclose the numbers about what weve done so far and well decide whether we want to disclose it at the end of the first quarter this year so whether we want to disclose it reporting on our first quarter results in terms of prices i think the question consists of two parts the price changes that we implemented in december and that youre referring to is our business as usual this is ongoing work we have looked into different markets studies and then also we take customer service to really see how much theyre willing to pay and what they want to see in the tariff plans so thats an ongoing regular work in terms of the pricing for the existing subscribers i think thats not possible in a direct manner but we are constantly working on promoting new services to the existing customer base and often due to the new product we are capable of increasing the average sales per useroperator it appears there are no further questions i would like to turn the call back to dmitry kononov for any additional or closing remarksdmitry kononov megafon pao  director for ir  ma folks were about out of time i
