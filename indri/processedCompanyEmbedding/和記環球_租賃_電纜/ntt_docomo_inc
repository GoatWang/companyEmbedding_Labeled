cloud environment up and running as quickly as possible fujitsu’s strength and si capability helped ntt docomo complete the cloud infrastructure deployment within a mere  months fujitsu also provides full support to ensure seamless operation of the mobile secure desktop service that included the creation of a viable software licensing regime in the cloud  a need for uncompromised capability to deliver excellent usability and enduser experience even over lowbandwidth connections adoption of the citrix virtualization solution with features to enable differential data transfer between desktop service environments and user terminals ensured communication efficiency fujitsu also provided design support for desktop service screen development customer’s background ntt docomo unveiled its new daas offerings to the market in february  ntt docomo inc the largest mobile communications operator in japan has been an influential force in the evolution of mobile technologies and standards in japan and in providing leadingedge mobile services to its customers examples of the most advanced communications technologies introduced by ntt docomo include the company’s trademarked imode foma and xi read ‘crossy’ and japan’s first lte longterm evolutionbased network services in  inspired by its corporate philosophy “we will create a new communication culture” ntt docomo implemented a new corporate vision “pursuing smart innovation heart  vision” this marked the company’s intention of achieving further growth and delivering new value to its customers and society in upholding that strong message ntt docomo is very active in fostering a range of activities to realize smart innovations mr hiromiki moriyamadirectorcloud computing platformsolution business departmentcorporate marketing divisionntt docomo inc   as part of the company’s efforts to facilitate work related innovations ntt docomo wished to start a new service that would support mobile workers and bring significant improvements in their productivity and convenience “traditionally bandwidth issues had remained the fundamental challenges in implementing cloud computing to a mobile computing environment” explained mr hiromiki moriyama director solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo inc “however in recent years we’ve been able to see significant advancements in network bandwidth quality and speed for example ntt docomo’s latest xi service has made it possible to provide ultrahighspeed and stable internet connections those changes in the external environment presented the opportunity to us and in may  we decided to embark on a project which would provide a commercially available mobile secure desktop this would be aimed at delivering innovative cloudhosted desktop computing to mobile workers” continued moriyama when ntt docomo began working on the project it wanted to develop the new service in a forwardlooking manner the intention was not only to accommodate existing customer needs but also generate solutions for the future “for further growth of our cloudbased service business building a highlysecure scalable and flexible cloud environment was one of our paramount goals to that would allow us to quickly respond to change and diversity and maintain our competitiveness in the global marketplace at ntt docomo we put effort into the design and development of the new service and in parallel we commenced infrastructure deployment planning” said moriyama ntt docomo’s new service aimed at mobile workers mobile secure desktop achieves significant productivity improvements and enhanced data security ntt docomo’s mobile secure desktop is a cloudhosted virtual desktop service it is designed to enable mobile workers to work more effectively and efficiently at any location in the world they do this by accessing a centrallymanaged desktop environment from their pcs zeroclient devices and tablets wherever they connect mobile workers use the same desktop environment and have work continuity without concerns about data security issues users are also freed from the threat of information leaks as all important user data resides in a secure environment within the ntt docomo datacenter and not on the local devices mobile secure desktop also significantly reduces desktop administration effort and associated costs ms chisa yoshidomicloud computing platform service promotionsolution business departmentcorporate marketing divisionntt docomo inc ms chisa yoshidomi a staff member in the solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo talked about the background and objectives of the company’s launch of the mobile secure desktop service “from the viewpoint of increased mobility one of our urgent tasks was to address the common challenges that many businesses are facing in today’s society – enabling people to do their jobs more efficiently and productively in particular allowing them to work on their pcs at any time from any location inside and outside the office without concern about data security problems since the introduction of the protection of personal information act personal information protection law japan enabled in  organizations have been under increasing pressure to meet strict security compliance standards today it’s estimated that as many as  percent of japanese businesses have some sort of prohibition on employees taking their pcs away from the office however in examining realworld situations that kind of excessive security policy is causing significant inconvenience to many employees and actually limiting their productivity i believe ntt docomo can help resolve such situations with our new virtualized desktop service we are aiming to address two heterogeneous goals these are delivering improved productivity and tightening information security for our customers” mr yasunori kondocloud computing platform business strategysolution business departmentcorporate marketing division ntt docomo inc before going to a vendor for help with infrastructure deployment ntt docomo spent over a year on thorough internal considerations discussions and evaluation of the concepts of the new service “maintaining the users’ pointofview was we thought the most important factor when developing and evaluating the service at ntt docomo we created a test environment and evaluated the concepts of mobile secure desktop with experimental user groups in assuming that the service would be used in a mobile computing environment one of our biggest challenges was to ensure an excellent browsing experience and stressfree communication even for users with lowbandwidth connections to solve such challenges we tried the citrix client virtualization software and decided that the adoption of citrix would be a great solution the citrix software provides a feature that enables differential data capturing and transmission between the desktop service environment and user terminals this greatly improves communication efficiency as the least amount of data is transferred” said mr yasunori kondo a staff member in charge of business strategy solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo inc endtoend support from fujitsu enables the mobile secure desktop service comprehensive capabilities are the key in selecting an ict partner to jointly drive the project mr takashi todacloud computing platform technical managementsolution business departmentcorporate marketing division ntt docomo inc   ntt docomo completed the definition of their mobile secure desktop infrastructure after undertaking thorough testing and evaluation including the monitoring of test results and market trends they then started to look for an ict partner they could work with “we compared the capabilities of ict vendors from many angles to achieve a successful roll out of the new service ntt docomo really needed a trusted partner with full strengths in si and support capabilities one that would not only help us deploy the core cloud foundation for our new service but also operate the new cloud environment taking many factors into consideration  for example their existing line of products strengths in solution deployments and very importantly rich experience and expertise in citrix implementations ntt docomo concluded that fujitsu would be the partner we could rely on” says mr takashi toda a staff member in the solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo “we also really appreciated fujitsu’s effort and ability in meeting our needs by completing the infrastructure deployment tasks in such a short lead time  as we didn’t have much time before rolling out the service” continued toda mr teiju konnocloud computing platform business strategysolution business departmentcorporate marketing divisionntt docomo inc mobile secure desktop directly delivers a familiar windowsbased desktop environment to users  as a service this enables them to start working on their virtualized desktop anytime and anywhere they wish they simply log on using their own logon account and password in the mobile secure desktop environment os installation effort is also no longer required for each individual local device in providing such services it was essential for ntt docomo to have sophisticated software license management and there is still room to improve the existing software licensing models “in the age of clouds and ondemand computing there’s been a lack of standardization of approaches to software licensing this is because not all software vendors provide cloudready licensing models that’s the real situation today ntt docomo and fujitsu as a distributer are now collaborating to resolve the technology barriers related to software licensing in the cloud” said mr teiju konno a staff member in charge of business strategy in the solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo mr yuichi tanoguchicloud computing platform service developmentsolution business departmentcorporate marketing divisionntt docomo inc with the new daas offerings ntt docomo wished to support every day business activities and mobile worker communication as a result ensuring usability was another priority development area of the mobile secure desktop “in the process of developing storage service which is ntt docomo’s proprietary online application for mobile secure desktop we relied on fujitsu to design and develop the service screens and a set of management tools we gave fujitsu lots of requirements some of which i believe were very challenging to meet but fujitsu really came up with the goods for us in a very responsive manner thanks to comprehensive support from fujitsu we were able to get the job done within the given short time period and without compromising usability of the service” recalled mr yuichi tanoguchi a staff member in the solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo inc in july  the mobile secure desktop project entered its actual cloud deployment phase with all the effort put in by ntt docomo in conjunction with fujitsu the cloud infrastructure was successfully built within a mere  months ntt docomo chose to adopt citrix xendesktop virtualization software to create the virtualized desktop environment for the underlying hardware the company selected fujitsu’s hardware products which are well recognized as meeting customer demands for higher reliability these included fujitsu primergy bx blade servers fujitsu eternus dx storage systems and the eternus nr f network disk array ntt docomo also understood the high density consolidation capabilities of fujitsu primergy its complete set of server management tools and the advanced features in the eternus storage including data deduplication with this great combination of versatile virtualization technology and high reliability hardware the resulting cloud foundation built in the ntt docomo datacenter achieved greatly scalable and a secure environment for multitenancy business benefits and future scenarios supporting expanded use of cloud computing in society in february  mobile secure desktop was made available commercially and immediately following the service launch ntt docomo received overwhelming responses from the market the company assumes that the exclusive advantages provided by mobile secure desktop are drawing user attention one user benefit is the minimum level of initial investment the service can be implemented by purchase of a single user account that comes with standard desktop features such as microsoft office suite email and antivirus software mobile secure desktop users are also provided with access to the storage service that allows them to uploaddownload files and manage their address books if a user device is lost or stolen the associated user account can be remotely locked out to prevent unauthorized access to the device these features are all included in the service enabling the users to achieve significant roi mr yasushi morimanagercloud computing platform business strategysolution business departmentcorporate marketing divisionntt docomo inc   “the response to mobile secure desktop has been immense of course the service is now used by many mobile workers who need to work outside of the office or at multiple sites in addition to such orthodox usage we are striving to expand the use of the service for wider purposes for example some of our customers have expressed great interest in implementing mobile secure desktop for trial purposes to test the concepts of clouds before they actually move into a full cloud environment we are also excited to see the expansion of our service into nontraditional fields such as sohos schools and inhome medical care previous introduction of such advanced technology was a challenge due to small user volumes and budget constraints” said mr yasushi mori manager solution business department corporate marketing division at ntt docomo inc looking forward moriyama is very excited with the many possibilities that mobile secure desktop will bring “i strongly believe this solution is a great example of the power of mobile cloud computing which will be a driving force in supporting technological evolution in japan we will soon move into a new age where desktop pcs are consumed as a service not as a physical asset to purchase at ntt docomo we are thrilled to accelerate our effort to expand the mobile secure desktop business and continue to make our services better and better to realize our vision and aims we greatly look forward to continued work with fujitsu” ntt docomo inc is striving to cultivate unlimited possibilities in mobile communications and provide futuregeneration services to its customers as a trusted ict partner of ntt docomo fujitsu is onehundred percent

application upgrades by  to  ntt docomo now has an agile system that supports its business by quickly responding to customer needs in the fast paced mobile market download pdf  mb system upgrade for better services and growth ntt docomo is japans largest mobile network operator with around  million subscribers docomo is working towards its vision of creating a new communication culture and introduced the worlds first third generation g mobile network services in  beginning with the docomo imode services the company was a pioneer of the mobile internet market docomos ict system is also one of the most advanced in terms of performance in japan its customer data management system aladin is an example the system connects the docomo information centers with its shops all over japan controlling all procedures for contracting and sales for example entering customer information and checking credit risks processing one of the biggest volumes of customer data in japan aladin also integrates and manages network usage statistics tariff plans and the application of discount services of each subscriber for many years docomo has worked handinhand with fujitsu to upgrade aladin which is essential for expanding docomos business and services the two companies embarked on a project to develop the second generation of aladin in  in the same year a new regulation was introduced in japan allowing mobile phone users to switch providers much more easily the aladin system had to be transformed to meet this new challenge over time large systems become more complicated and aladin was no exception repeated upgrades and changes had left the system applications bloated and made further upgrades more difficultthere are normally four major service releases per year to introduce new services each of these took four months from design through development and testing even a minor service release between the major releases took over two months to produce aladin could not keep pace with the speed of docomos business needs becoming a bottleneck for growth a flexible robust framework for business agility the target of aladin transformation was to halve the time and costs for new service releases in order to reduce the testing time it was crucial to identify clearly which elements within aladin would be affected by the system upgrade it was also required to maintain the structural integrity of the application despite the repeated upgrades to respond to these two challenges docomo collaborated with fujitsu to jointly develop a new foundational framework for aladin named xframework xframework has two main features first it can adapt to changes flexibly xframework places the business layer as the core comprised of business process management bpm and business rule management system brms functions any newly developed business flows and rules are reflected to the program in the business layer this enables new functions for new services to be implemented in aladin with quick turnarounds second xframework is highly robust built on logical data objects docomo defined a structured data object of all the information such as a tariff plan and a model of mobile phones in ways it is linked to each subscribers phone number aladin designers and developers use this data object to maintain application integrity under repeated system upgrades removing the bottleneck and building on success after the introduction of the second generation of the aladin system unnecessary program development and testing were eliminated because information from the system upgrade clearly shows where to change in the application structure as a result the development time for major service releases was reduced by  and finished within three months simultaneously the time required for minor releases was cut by  to  to just three weeks in june  docomo introduced two new tariff plans one was the first flat rate plan for voice calls and the other was the shared mobile data plan for families the new aladin system enables docomo to release attractive plans first to market prior to the competition while the total development workload decreased by  the company has become able to respond to  more demands for functional upgrades resulting in a  times productivity improvement the productivity gains mean that docomo can now finish updates to the aladin system faster than many other activities associated with the launch of a new service such as staff training or brochure creation the aladin system is no longer a bottleneck it is transformed to support the business with agility leverage the success of aladin docomo continues to improve aladin to meet the demands for new tariff plans and new services tailored to customer lifestyles the possibilities of mobile services are unlimited docomo continues to develop new services including the dmarket cloud service for their smartphone and pc users xframework has also been applied to these services as well

function before any of its competitors the increase in the number of minor users of mobile phone services such as imode increases has been accompanied by a rise in the number of crime victims and incidents triggered by browsing of dating sites and adult sites as a countermeasure starting in  docomo began offering kids imode currently kids imode filter an optional service for minors that restricts access to sites other than imode menu sites as part of efforts to address social needs for security however these days elementary schools increasingly put up their own websites and in the case of filtering with blanket denial of access to sites other than imode menu sites customer needs are not served so url filtering is now gathering attention as a new countermeasure starting in  docomo has been offering kids imode plus currently named imode filter a service for restricting access to sites falling under specific categories such as dating sites and adult sites this service blocks access to sites such as dating sites and adult sites that are considered harmful to the sound development of minors through filtering that uses netstars url databases while allowing access to sites offering useful information for life such as school websites moreover as changes such as the cancellation of access restriction services or lowering the restriction level require parental consent this service is highly praised and trusted by all quarters as a revolutionary service that can drastically restrict misuse of mobile phone sites by minors further starting in  docomo changed the name of its kids imode plus service to imode filter to reflect further evolution of this service to answer a wider range of filtering needs including for example corporate customers wishing to reduce communication costs caused by unnecessary access by others in addition to minors this new service is enjoying a very favorable reception business needs for access management are greater than anticipated and the majority of corporate contracts for the batch introduction of mobile phones elect to use the imode filter ito along with dating sites and adult sites unwanted email is a major annoyance for mobile phone services at docomo in addition to original unwanted email countermeasures we started in  to apply filtering using netstars url databases which we had used thus far for the imode filter to unwanted emails this resulted in the addition of the urlcontaining email rejection setting to our service menu although initially we just thought about providing the urlcontaining email rejection setting as one of our unwanted email countermeasure setting menu items upon actual introduction the effectiveness of this service was very clear to see and since it was easy to set we find it to be effective for promotion to customers who are not comfortable with handling devices whose number is on the rise says inoue attesting to a favorable reception of this service that went beyond docomos expectations the reasons why docomo chose to use netstar are the quality and track record of its databases since before the imode filter docomo used netstar for blocking specific sites for its mopera u internet service for foma and the quality of netstars databases had been demonstrated regarding the provision of the urlcontaining email rejection setting ito says we selected netstar based on its trustworthiness for mopera u and imode filter however since there are unwanted email specific urls we newly established the category of unwanted email links describing selection and determination of categories according to the purpose of a service the imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting are both provided free of charge due to the wish for peace of mind striving to avoid having docomo mobile phones be the cause of experiences with harm however before during consultations regarding unwanted email countermeasures we would have to provide guidance regarding setting contents such as individual receptionblocking setting after having heard how the customer uses email now we can just recommend the urlcontaining email rejection setting says yamada expressing high regard for the effect on raising customer satisfaction for docomo which attaches great importance to the peace of mind of its customers both the imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting services will see their importance grow in the future we conducted thorough testing to ensure that top items appearing on multiple search sites can be  guarded says takashi ito platform development manager platform department product  service division since we make peace of mind one of our sales points imode filter and urlcontaining email rejection setting are both important services says akiko inoue first security promotion incharge contents  customer department demand for the urlcontaining email rejection setting has been steadily increasing since its introduction says megumi yamada first security promotion incharge contents  customer department in order to maintain and improve filtering accuracy netstar operates the industrys first dedicated mobile phone site url
