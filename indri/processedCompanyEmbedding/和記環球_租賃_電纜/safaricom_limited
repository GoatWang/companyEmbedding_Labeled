provides a method for mobile users to alert someone that they wish to be called but either cant or wont pay for the call the method is costfree for the users but costly in network bandwidth that is why safaricom sometime ago introduced a flashback service that gave every subscriber five free sms messages with a single predefined message stating please call me thank you although the messages can be annoying when sent just for fun they are very useful when one is in trouble and has no airtime it also gives parents more of a reason to get mobile phone for their children without the real need
