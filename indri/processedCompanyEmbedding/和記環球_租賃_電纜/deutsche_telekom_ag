telekom annual report   management report  group innovation deeninfobasketdownload centerannual report  management reportinnovation and product developmentgroup innovation group innovationon may   we established group innovation as the central innovation unit in the group it orchestrates all innovation activities at deutsche telekom and creates crosssegment product and service innovations group innovation merges innovations wherever we identify synergies for the group this gives rise to innovations not only within group innovation but also in the units working on our traditional core business and direct marketing activities in the individual national companies group innovation drives new areas of innovation with a longer development horizon of three to five years the challenge it faces lies in backing the key solutions for the notsonear future today secondly group innovation also provides classic product development services directly to our operating segments in this case with a development horizon of one to two years we strive to enrich our product portfolio with more new products and innovative solutions which is vital if we are to position our operating segments as attractive and competitive elements of our core portfolio innovation you can trust group innovation is committed to “innovation you can trust” the unit delivers innovations that represent the essential brand attributes of our group namely trust and reliability our products and offers must naturally be safe but “innovation you can trust” means more than this it means that our innovations will work easily our products interact seamlessly with the network service and partner offers it is only the combination of innovation and core business activities that will ultimately grow successful innovations for our customers group innovation our operating segments and other innovationoriented areas such as deutsche telekom capital partners dtcp are closely networked and regularly exchange views so that we can identify our customers’ needs and supply them with innovative products and services “innovation you can trust” is also the guiding theme of our internal collaboration we can rely on each other and know that we are working on the right ideas innovation cannot be prescribed innovation is a culture that has to be nurtured and brought to life from the inside large enterprises like our group especially need a vibrant corporate culture that fosters innovation key elements of this culture include fast decisions and implementation on the basis of lean internal processes freeing up creative potential promoting and challenging new ideas and entrepreneurial initiative innovation focus – four areas of innovation for innovation work to succeed innovation activities must be geared to the group as a whole and follow a holistic concept we therefore rely – as graphic  shows – on our four interrelated innovation areas consumer products business customer products networkinfrastructure and processesservicethe focus is always placed on our customers regardless of whether these are consumers or our business customers our concept involves identifying new customer issues anticipating customer needs and finding innovative solutions in response here it is essential to establish networking between the individual innovation areas especially since many innovation topics relate to more than one of the four fields e g convergent offers as a key strategic principle for our consumer products we have made a splendid first move in germany with the convergent products in our magentaeins portfolio and international rollout has already begun group innovation is working to integrate more services in this convergence strategy thus increasing the attraction of the magentaeins offers in the case of business customers our aim is to offer a simple modular product portfolio and at the same time to combine our standard products intelligently with products from our partners our focus on the network side is on seamless secure connectivity above all for business customers – on a global scale and with quality differentiation in the processesservice innovation area we want to anticipate and respond to the requests and needs of our customers as specifically as possible and with consistent quality across all contact channels innovation governance clear process structures give ideas the scope they need to grow and transform into innovative products and services as graphic  shows innovation processes in our company pass through four phasesthey all start with an idea – arising from market and trend research customer feedback from our staff in the product and innovation units or from partnershipscollaboration with our partnersduring the selection phase we evaluate each idea how easy is it to implement how great is its potential how high is customer interest rated in the development phase we integrate customer desires and requirements for design and handling into the product or service conceptfinally the product or service is transferred to the marketin each of the four phases we naturally verify the extent to which the resources we use are in proportion to the anticipated result this may well lead to development of a product being abandoned during one of the phases of the innovation process which is a vital option since not every good idea has the potential to become a good product or a good service every innovation must offer our customers added value we have set up an innovation governance concept to manage innovation processes in the group it includes the portfolio  innovation board which makes sure we get our priorities right the board identifies and selects innovation focuses for our group and decides how they will be executed in order to define and implement an innovative product portfolio that offers maximum chances of success in order to implement these strategic innovation focuses we also continuously enhance our internal financing formats this means that with an additional innovation budget we can equip new innovation projects or additional opportunities for existing strategic priorities with resources at short notice and without red tape such financing is granted independently of annual planning periods and therefore intensifies our focus on market and customer requirements with these resources we finance both centrally managed innovations e g through group innovation and local innovation developments e g directly from our operating segments this is subject to the proviso that the product and service ideas in question are in line with our group’s central innovation focuses sustainability is another of our product development drivers the demand is growing for digital solutions that are secure environment and climatefriendly and offer added value for our society we therefore work intensively not only to improve the security of our services but also focus our development work on more energyefficient technologies that will reduce co emissions and on durable and recyclable products and digital care solutions in the areas of ehealth and emobility methods and concepts design thinking the design thinking approach is the basis on which we tread new ground and acquire new insights we have adopted it to ensure we differentiate ourselves from the market in general by offering outstanding customer experiences group innovation has for this reason defined a standard design thinking concept it includes a design process which is valid for the entire group and can be transferred to development processes already in place in our two operating segments germany and europe as well as the different design thinking methods scope for learning trying out and applying the defined content is offered by the design academy our internal training platform design thinking will thus establish itself not only as an attitude within the group but will also enrich and improve the actual cooperation across all group units design thinking therefore produces design doing creating scope for ideas our digital innovation arena in berlin creates the ideal scenario for ideas for digital life in the future it offers first and foremost an optimal working environment from a stateoftheart it infrastructure modern premises and facilities for lively exchange which are available round the clock through to creative rooms for relaxation here employees from tlabs from hubraum from the design and partnering areas work together on premises extending over around  square meters the creative mix of people from all areas of our innovation business ranging from entrepreneurs to developers and designers makes the digital innovation arena the hotspot for ideas in germany innovation provides answers
