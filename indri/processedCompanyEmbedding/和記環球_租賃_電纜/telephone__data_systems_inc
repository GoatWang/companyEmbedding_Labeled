lineage with central office telephone systems and in larger or more complex systems may rival a central office system in capacity and features with a key telephone system a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons which indicated the status of lines with builtin lamps contents  key telephone system  electromechanical sharedcontrol key system  electronic sharedcontrol

arrangements with individual line selection buttons for each available telephone line the earliest systems were known as wiring plans and simply consisted of telephone sets keys lamps and wiring key was a bell system term of art for a customercontrolled switching system such as the linebuttons on the phones associated with such systems the wiring plans evolved into modular hardware building blocks with a variety of functionality and services in the a key telephone system developed in the bell system in the s key systems can be built using three principal architectures electromechanical sharedcontrol electronic sharedcontrol or independent key sets new installations of key telephone systems have become less common as hybrid systems and private branch exchanges of comparable size have similar cost and greater functionality electromechanical sharedcontrol key systemedit a typical rotary dial key telephone the western electric eighteenbutton call director manufactured from  to the early s before the advent of largescale integrated circuits key systems were typically composed of electromechanical components relays as were larger telephone switching systems the systems marketed in north america as the a a a and the a key system are typical examples and sold for many decades the a family of western electric company weco key telephone units ktus were introduced in the late s and remained in use to the s a equipment was primitive and required at least two ktus per line one for line termination and one for station telephone instrument termination the telephone instrument commonly used by a systems was the weco series telephone introduced in  a key systems simplified wiring with a single ktu for both line and station termination and increased the features available as the a systems became commonplace requirements for intercom features grew the original intercom ktus weco model  were wired for a single talk link that is a single conversation on the intercom at a time the weco a dial intercom system provided two talk links and was often installed as the dial intercom in a a or a key system the a systems were complex troublesome and expensive and never became popular the advent of a technology in the  simplified key system set up and maintenance these continued to be used throughout the s when the arrival of electronic key systems with their easier installation and greater features signaled the end of electromechanical key systems two lesserknown key systems were used at airports for air traffic control communications the  and  key systems these were uniquely designed for communications between the air traffic control tower and radar approach control rapcon or ground control approach gca and included radio line connections automatic electric company also produced a family of key telephone equipment some of it compatible with western electric equipment but it did not gain the widespread use enjoyed by western electric equipment electronic sharedcontrol systemedit with the advent of lsi ics the same architecture could be implemented much less expensively than was possible using relays in addition it was possible to eliminate the manywire cabling and replace it with much simpler cable similar to or even identical to that used by nonkey systems electronic sharedcontrol systems led quickly to the modern hybrid telephone system as the features of pbx and key system quickly merged one of the most recognized such systems is the att merlin additionally these more modern systems allowed a diverse set of features including answering machine functions automatic call accounting caller id remote supervision of the entire system selection of signaling sounds speed dialing stationspecific limitations such as no long distance access or no paging features could be added or modified simply using software allowing easy customization of these systems the stations were easier to maintain than the previous electromechanical key systems as they used efficient leds instead of incandescent light bulbs for line status indication lsi also allowed smaller systems to distribute the control and features into individual telephone sets that dont require any single shared control unit generally these systems are used with a relatively few telephone sets and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set such as speeddialing numbers in synchrony between the various sets hybrid key telephone systemedit into the st century the distinction between key systems and pbx systems has become increasingly blurred early electronic key systems used dedicated handsets which displayed and allowed access to all connected pstn lines and stations nortel t series key system telephone the modern key system now supports sip isdn analog handsets in addition to its own proprietary handsets  usually digital as well as a raft of features more traditionally found on larger pbx systems their support for both analog and digital signaling and of some pbx functionality gives rise to the hybrid designation a hybrid system typically has some call appearance buttons that directly correspond to individual lines andor stations but may also support direct dialing to extensions or outside lines without selecting a line appearance the modern key system is usually fully digital although analog variants persist and some systems implement voip services effectively the aspects that distinguish a pbx from a hybrid key system are the amount scope and complexity of the features and facilities offered hybrid systems are a common tool in the financial services industry used on trading floors these advanced hybrid key systems generally only require attached pbxs for interaction with backoffice staff and voicemail these systems commonly have their front end units referred to as turrets and are notable for their presentation of hootnholler circuits multiple hoots are presented to multiple users over multiplexed speakers to multiple

february  learn how and when to remove this template message an avaya gsi pbx with front cover removed view from the top a private branch exchange pbx is a telephone exchange or switching system that serves a private organization and performs concentration of central office lines or trunks and provides intercommunication between a large number of telephone stations in the organization the central office lines provide connections to the public switched telephone network and the concentration aspect of a pbx permits the shared use of these lines between all stations in the organization the intercommunication aspectclarify allows two or more stations to directly connect while not using the public switched telephone network each pbxconnected station such as a telephone set a fax machine or a computer modem is often referred to as an extension and has a designated extension telephone number that may or may not be mapped automatically to the numbering plan of the central office and the telephone number block allocated to the pbx initially pbx systems offered the primary advantage of cost savings for internal phone calls handling the circuit switching locally reduced charges for telephone service via centraloffice lines as pbx systems gained popularity they began to feature services not available in the public network such as hunt groups call forwarding and extension dialing from the s a simulated pbx known as centrex provided similar features from the central telephone exchange a pbx differs from a key telephone system kts in that users of a key system manually select their own outgoing lines on special telephone sets that control buttons for this purpose while pbxs select the outgoing line automatically or formerly by an operator the telephone sets connected to a pbx do not normally have special keys for centraloffice line control but it is not uncommon for key systems to be connected to a pbx to extend its services a pbx in contrast to a key system employs an organizational numbering plan for its stations in addition a dial plan determines whether additional digit sequences must be prefixed when dialing to obtain access to a centraloffice trunk modern numberanalysis systems permit users to dial internal and external telephone numbers without special codes to distinguish the intended destination historyedit pbx switchboard  the term pbx originated when switchboard operators managed company switchboards manually using cord circuits as automated electromechanical switches and later electronic switching systems gradually replaced the manual systems the terms private automatic branch exchange pabx and private manual branch exchange pmbx differentiated them solidstate digital systems were sometimes referred to as electronic private automatic branch exchanges epabx as of update the term pbx is by far the most widely recognizedcitation needed the acronym now applies to all types of complex inhouse telephony switching systems two significant developments during the s led to new types of pbx systems one was the massive growth of data networks and increased public understanding of packet switching companies needed packetswitched networks for data so using them for telephone calls proved tempting and the availability of the internet as a global delivery system made packetswitched communications even more attractive these factors led to the development of the voice over ip pbx or ippbx the other trend involved the idea of focusing on core competence pbx services had always been hard to arrange for smaller companies and manyquantify companies realized that handling their own telephony was not their core competence these considerations gave rise to the concept of the hosted pbx in wireline telephony the original hosted pbx was the centrex service provided by telcos since the s later competitive offerings evolved into the modern competitive local exchange carrier in voice over ip hosted solutions are easier to implement as the pbx may be located at and managed by any telephone service provider connecting to the individual extensions via the internet the upstream provider no longer needs to run direct local leased lines to the served premises system componentsedit a pbx often includes cabinets closets vaults and other housings console or switchboard allows the operator to control incoming calls interconnecting wires and cables logic cards switching and control cards power cards and related devices that facilitate pbx operation microcontroller or microcomputer for arbitrary data processing control and logic outside telco trunks that deliver signals to and carry them from the pbx stations or telephone sets sometimes called lines the pbxs internal switching network uninterruptible power supply ups consisting of sensors power switches and batteries current trendsedit since the advent of internet telephony voice over ip technologies pbx development has tended toward the ip pbx which uses the internet protocol to carry calls most modern pbxs support voip isdn pbx systems also replaced some traditional pbxs in the s as isdn offers features such as conference calling call forwarding and programmable caller id as of  isdn is being phased out by most major telecommunication carriers throughout europe in favour of allip networks with some expecting complete migration by   originally having started as an organizations manual switchboard or attendant console operated by a telephone operator or just simply the operator pbxs have evolved into voip centers that are hosted by the operators or even manufacturers even though voip is considered by many people as the future of telephony the circuit switched network remains the core of communications and the existing pbx systems are competitive in services with modern ip systems five distinct scenarios exist hostedvirtual pbx hosted and circuitswitched or traditional centrex ip centrex or hostedvirtual ip hosted and packetswitched ip pbx private and packetswitched mobile pbx solution mobile phones replacing or used in combination with fixed phones pbx private and circuitswitched for the option to call from ip network to the circuitswitched pstn ssisup the hosted solutions include interconnecting media gateways home and smallbusiness usageedit historically the expense of fullfledged pbx systems has put them out of reach of small businesses and individuals however since the s many small consumergrade and consumersize pbxs have become available these systems are not comparable in size robustness or flexibility to commercialgrade pbxs but still provide many features the first consumer pbx systems used analog pots telephone lines typically supporting four private analog and one public analog line they were the size of a small cigar box in europe these systems for analog phones were followed by consumergrade pbxs for isdn using small pbxs for isdn is a logical step since the isdn basic rate interface provides two logical phone lines via two isdn b channels which can be used in parallel with the adoption of voip by consumers consumer voip pbxs have appeared with pbx functions becoming simple additional software features of consumergrade routers and switches additionally many telecommunications providers now offer hosted pbx systems where the provider actually hosts the pbx and the phone handsets are connected to it through an internet connection open source projects have provided pbxstyle features since the s these projects provide flexibility features and programmability pbx functionsedit functionally the pbx performs four main call processing duties establishing connections circuits between the telephone sets of two users eg mapping a dialed number to a physical phone ensuring the phone isnt already busy maintaining such connections as long as the users require them ie channelling voice signals between the users disconnecting those connections as per the users requirement providing information for accounting purposes eg metering calls in addition to these basic functions pbxs offer many other calling features and capabilities with different manufacturers providing different features in an effort to differentiate their products common capabilities include manufacturers may have a different name for each capability auto attendant auto dialing automated directory services where callers can be routed to a given employee by keying or speaking the letters of the employees name automatic call distributor automatic ring back busy override call blocking call forwarding on busy or absence call logging call park call pickup call transfer call waiting campon conference call custom greetings customized abbreviated dialing speed dialing direct inward dialing did direct inward system access disa the ability to access internal features from an outside telephone line do not disturb dnd followme also known as findme determines the routing of incoming calls the exchange is configured with a list of numbers for a person when a call is received for that person the exchange routes it to each number on the list in turn until either the call is answered or the list is exhausted at which point the call may be routed to a voice mail system interactive voice response local connection another useful attribute of a hosted pbx is the ability to have a local number in cities in which you are not physically present this service essentially lets you create a virtual office presence anywhere in the world music on hold night service public address voice paging shared message boxes where a department can have a shared voicemail box voice mail voice message broadcasting welcome message interface standardsedit interfaces for connecting extensions to a pbx include dect – a standard for connecting cordless phones internet protocol – for example h and sip pots plain old telephone service – the common twowire interface used in most homes this is cheap and effective and allows almost any standard phone to be used as an extension proprietary – the manufacturer has defined a protocol one can only connect the manufacturers sets to their pbx but the benefit is more visible information displayed andor specific function buttons interfaces for connecting pbxs to each other include dpnss – for connecting pbxs to trunk lines standardized by british telecom this usually runs over e ecarrier physical circuits internet protocol – h and the session initiation protocol sip are ipbased solutions for multimedia sessions primary rate interface isdn – provided over t  bearer channels and  signaling channel or e carriers proprietary protocols – if equipment from several manufacturers is on site the use of a standard protocol is required qsig – for connecting pbxs to each other usually runs over t tcarrier or e ecarrier physical circuits interfaces for connecting pbxs to trunk lines include internet protocol – h sip mgcp and interasterisk exchange protocols operate over ip and are supported by some network providers isdn – the most common digital standard for fixed telephony devices this can be supplied in either basic circuit capacity or primary  or circuit capacity versions most medium to large companies would use primary isdn circuits carried on t or e physical connections rbs robbed bit signaling – delivers  digital circuits over a fourwire t interface standard pots plain old telephone service lines – the common twowire interface used in most domestic homes this is adequate only for smaller systems and can suffer from not being able to detect incoming calls when trying to make an outbound call commonly called glare interfaces for collecting data from the pbx file – the pbx generates a file containing the call records from the pbx network port listen mode – an external application connects to the tcp or udp port the pbx streams information to the application network port server mode – the pbx connects to another application or buffer serial interface – historically used to print every call record to a serial printer in modern systems a software application connects via serial cable to this port a data record from a pbx or other telecommunication system that provides the statistics for a telephone call is usually termed a call detail record cdr or a station messaging detail record smdr hosted pbx systemsedit virtual pbx systems or hosted pbx systems deliver pbx functionality as a service available over the public switched telephone network pstn or the internet hosted pbxs are typically provided by a telephone company or service provider using equipment located in the premises of a telephone exchange or the providers data center this means the customer does not need to buy or install pbx equipment generally the service is provided by a lease agreement and the provider can in some configurations use the same switching equipment to service multiple hosted pbx customers the first hosted pbx services were featurerich compared to most premisesbased systems of the time some pbx functions such as followme calling appeared in a hosted service before they became available in hardware pbx equipment since introduction updates and new offerings have moved feature sets in both directions it is possible to get hosted pbx services that include feature sets from minimal functionality to advanced feature combinations in addition to the features available from premisesbased pbx systems hostedpbx allows a single number to be presented for the entire company despite its being geographically distributed a company could even choose to have no premises with workers connected from home using their domestic telephones but receiving the same features as any pbx user allows multimodal access where employees access the network via a variety of telecommunications systems including pots isdn cellular phones and voip this allows one extension to ring in multiple locations either concurrently or sequentially allows scalability so that a larger system is not needed if new employees are hired and so that resources are not wasted if the number of employees is reduced eliminates the need for companies to manage or pay for onsite hardware maintenance supports integration with custom toll plans that allow intra company calls even from private premises to be dialed at a cheaper rate and integrated billing and accounting where calls made on a private line but on the companys behalf are billed centrally to the company hosted pbx providersedit the ongoing migration of most major telecommunication carriers to ipbased networks coupled with the rise in cloud communications has resulted in a significant rise in the uptake of hosted pbx solutions mobile pbxedit a mobile pbx is a hosted pbx service that extends fixedline pbx functionality to mobile devices such as cellular handsets smartphones and pda phones by provisioning them as extensions mobile pbx services also can include fixedline phones mobile pbx systems are different from other hosted pbx systems that simply forward data or calls to mobile phones by allowing the mobile phone itself through the use of buttons keys and other input devices to control pbx phone functions and to manage communications without having to call into the system first a mobile pbx may exploit the functionality available in smartphones to run custom applications to implement the pbx specific functionality in addition a mobile pbx may create extension identifiers for each handset that allow to dial other cell phones in the pbx via their extension shortcut instead of a pstn number ippbxedit an ip pbx handles voice signals over internet protocol bringing benefits for computer telephony integration cti an ippbx can exist as physical hardware or can carry out its functions virtually performing the callrouting activities of the traditional pbx or key system as a software system the virtual version is also called a
