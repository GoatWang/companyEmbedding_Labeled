orange polska q  results conference call on the th of july operator instructions todays call is being recorded i will now hand over the conference to mr leszek iwaszko please go aheadleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department hello yes hi sorry good morning everyone welcome to orange polska results conference call for the second quarter of  my name is leszek iwaszko i am the head of investor relations today we have with us ceo of orange polska jeanfrançois fallacher and cfo maciej nowohonski our results have been published yesterday evening and they are available on our ir website now let me hand the floor to jeanfrançois to start the presentationjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo thank you very much leszek good morning ladies and gentlemen so welcome to this quarterly results conference i will as usual start with highlights of the quarter and then i will pass the floor to maciej nowohonski which will tell you more on the financial side and at the end of course we will welcome your question and hopefully give some answers to youso lets start with the overall results of the quarter as you can see they are solid our ebitda was in a small decline almost flat versus last year how was this achieved actually i will mention  factors first of all  and we will come back on that i mean we are very happy with the start of orange love our new convergent offer that we launched in the middle of february that allows us to achieve our commercial costs  goals sorry at low cost actually second reason for that good performance we have lowered the handset subsidies in line with whats happening on the polish market our mix is supporting commercial costs of the nation and finally this quarter as you probably have seen we closed quite a number of real estate transactions which are also helping for a good ebitda performance of qso on the next page i would like to spend a little bit more time on our commercial achievements so first of all i will comment convergence so its been now a bit  this product has been becoming our flagship proposal on the polish market you know that today still a majority of the households in poland are buying media and telecom in different providers obviously with this offer we want to change this and we are i mean doing that concretely because orange love our new flagship product has acquired  customers in the course of actually a bit less than  months so we believe this is really a good convergence so thats the first thing i would like to comment you have to know as well that  of these new  customers actually have purchased at least  additional service from orange so there is really value creation through this new offerread moreas you can see on this graph the convergent base has increased also by  this quarter we are now exceeding  million convergent customers and actually a majority as you can see there of our sales of fixed broadband and mobile are now done via these convergent offers so much more than in the past so i believe that this strategy of convergence is really starting to bear its fruit is starting to worknow lets have a closer look on mobile so im going to comment the graphs  the bottom graphs on the left side the net additions were rather good as you can see there theyre a little bit lower than last year that you can see on the graph simply because we have been trying this quarter like the first quarter to have a more balanced strategy between volumes and value and as you understood very well we have been putting emphasis on value the mnp outlook in the second quarter is still positive for us in postpaid its marginally i would say worse than last year because we have come to  positive mnps versus k so thats quite in a  thats quite good and comparable to last yearon mobile broadband you will see in this graph that the net additions are negative and that obviously we are losing mobile broadband customers so these are the customers that are using only dongles or devices that are pure data devices this category loses appeal on the market simply because i would say  reasons first of all its probably linked to the success of our fixed broadband offers and second due also to the fact that with smartphones we are giving now more and more abundant data packages which are making probably the use of these offers redundantand last but not least i would like to comment on our performance on the fixed broadband side so these are two other slides the transformation of our customer base is continuing the net additions as you can see are very positive thanks to fx the fixed wireless and of course fiber so the fiber net additions that you can see on the right chart on the bottom are good they are slightly below the ones in q this is something if you remember well we warned you about simply because this quarter has been containing in poland a lot of days off each month long weekends which has been actually slightly weighting and that explains the slight decrease that we were expecting if you remember well in q overall we are really on track with the sales and you will see later more in detail that the penetration of fiber customers inside our deployments is also raising which is positive newsi would like to comment also  other topics that happened in the second quarter which i believe are important for the future of orange polska the first one is socalled poland operational program digital poland operational program popc so for those of you who are polish you are aware of this this is a program which is funded by european funds to deploy broadband in wide areas in poland we are extremely happy that we have been the winner actually in  vendors organized by the government out of if i remember well something like  vendors the program is actually heaved subsidized as you can see these are very important investments because we are going to deploy a total number of households which will be more than  households for a total investment of pln  billion and you will notice that out of this pln  billion  so pln  million will be financed by the european commissionso we believe this is for us a unique opportunity to deploy ftth in areas which are i would say more smaller cities or suburbs of the big cities because we are extremely happy as well that we won the suburban areas of warsaw in december and that actually allows us to deploy again fiber in areas where we obviously wouldnt have deployed without this european funding these are important investments because you will see that pln  billion is a more than year investment in fiber at the current speed we are having so thats really a significant event that we would like  and a very positive one that we would like to stress to youwe assume arpu actually will be comparable in these areas and in other locations where we deploy fiber while we believe also the adoption rates should be higher simply because there would be much less presence of cable companies and competitors so based on the experience we already have on such smaller cities we believe the monetization will be good and  as good on our other fiber investments so we are very pleased that we have won these  cities and that we can also contribute to the development of the local communities in poland and will improve the digitalization of poland through this important investment that i remind will concretely happen in   and the last topic i would like to comment here is the fact that we have announced a few days ago the acquisition of the electricity distribution business of multimedia polska so obviously this is not a very big acquisition this is very modest but i would like to take the opportunity that you are here to comment it its a small acquisition but nevertheless strategically important you will remember that we have started an energy reselling business at orange polska that is going well its growing and through this acquisition we actually will accelerate our business of energy electricity reselling so we will grow the base to  customers through this acquisition that will make us the leader of the alternative energy market in poland and by this acquisition actually we are i would say gaining  year versus our original business case that allows us to accelerate this very specific business with this acquisition we are buying just paying customers who by the way are having average  years contract and we are not taking any costs nor employees because we are buying the customer base so basically i would believe this is a good move a modest one but a good move that will accelerate our again electricity reselling business in polandthats all for me now i will give the floor to maciej nowohonskimaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo thank you jeanfrançois hi to everyone so we are on page  of the presentation with the financial highlights you can see that the top line dynamics now reflect more yearoveryear situation which is comparable on the installments front for the ebitda this is supported by our more value oriented approach combined with very good achievement on the sale of the real estate front and finally cash has rebounded above the trend that we have seen in q and it is now betterso lets go to the next page where we see more information on the revenue of the group here we are down yearoveryear after  quarters of growth but i  as i was mentioning we were flagging it already to you that installments yearoveryear situation is not comparable it became finally much appletoapple situation right now and right now you can see the trend which is with us after equalization of the installments impact so with this quarter the base of the previous quarter is finally comparablein fixed business the dynamics are slightly improving and this is thanks to the fixed broadband which has started to grow while legacy area obviously continues to hit us quite significantly i will come back on that the legacy when commenting the ebitda as wellso now maybe lets look  lets take a look at the mobile revenue in more detail because its an interesting set of information on slide  let me explain maybe first the title of this slide what do we mean by more value oriented approach as you remember in the previous  years we were very active in customer acquisitions which was successful we reported recordhigh net additions we gained market shares but obviously it cost us as well considerably so since the beginning of this year as jeanfrançois already mentioned we aim to be more balanced between volumes and valuewe have been gradually limiting handset subsidies making sure we will still remain competitive and yet we are able to maintain customer net additions at good and even satisfactory level why it is mainly thanks to orange love which was already mentioned by jeanfrançois which allows us to differentiate visàvis the competition so it is making a real difference and orange love also interestingly decreases the direct price competition in mono products in mono mobile offers and the majority of the mobile subscriptions in bc are now made through orange love so also customers are increasingly buying smartphones on open markets and exchange them less frequently than in the past and as a result in q that volume of commercial acts both acquisitions and retentions was higher yearoveryear but significantly increased also proportion on the simonly offers that we are selling so thanks to lower handset subsidies and on the other hand more simonly commercial acts we are able to generate more value of course we are closely monitoring the situation the commercial situation on the market and we will leave for ourselves flexibility in that respect in the future especially regarding the subsidy policy so more simonly offers more installment offers more convergent discounts which are allocated to mobile part of the business it is all weighing on our evolution of arpu and that will continue to be soso looking forward to the second semester and i think especially in q we expect some negative impacts coming from implementation of the roaming especially by the fact that q and months of july and august are high vacation seasons for polish people so a lot of them will travel and a lot of them will use the data versus not using the data in the past so here we can expect some weigh on the ebitda of q especiallyso then a couple of seconds on fixed broadband on the next slide so here we clearly show a continued transformation of this part of our business and we confirm that the trend of the revenue is sustainable so it is growing on the base front adsl losses are increasingly offset with fiber and wireless for fixed solutions and those  categories are clearly for us the growth drivers and this growth is obviously facilitated by the offer by the orange love by our flagship and good quality of our mobile network which is supporting a lot of the customer experience that we see among our customersinterestingly the usage of the wireless for fixed the usage of data is quite high and we are able to accommodate this usage its more than  gigs per month so those customers are really active on the data front and in terms of the overall evolution of the customer base it is up  with growing categories the growth areas wireless for fixed and fiber vdsl constituting now almost  of our base so its a sharp sharp positive evolution of the structure of our base according to our internal estimates in the first semester we managed to stabilize the total market share and we continue to grow the market share in fast fixed broadband categorynow a couple of things on the fiber front page  so here all the production of the network and the customer takeup progress as scheduled we extend the coverage of the fiber faster and the  we use the infrastructure of the other operators while doing so so in the second  in the first semester around  of our production relates to thirdparty infrastructure from operators like inaudible or netia and our fixed fiber broadband is available right now in almost  million households which represents a coverage of  of households in big cities in poland so its a considerable chunk already and please note that we still continueand a few interesting facts here for the coverage that the highest coverage we have today is in lublin it is  of all households in lublin there are some  other cities that we already exceed the coverage by  so these are bydgoszcz elblag opole radom and szczecin and volumewise the highest coverage is obviously in warsaw in the capital where we have more than  households connectable already and that gives us around  of the coverage in warsaw so the average customer adoption rate was at the end of first semester at  and is obviously growing and this is a good development that we are able to report to you and in  cities among the ones that we have already invested in fiber the adoption rate is surpassing the level of the  so we will continue to work on the improvement of the monetization of the fiber network in the second semester especially in the peak commercial season which is for us qthen lets go to the financial front on the ebitda and here as jeanfrançois mentioned already the ebitda was almost flat yearoveryear and it was mainly thanks to the better evolution of our direct margin just to recall you the direct margin is the difference between the revenues and the direct costs and those direct costs are commercial costs like customer acquisition and retention costs content costs and interconnect and better performance on the fixed broadband and mobile allowed us to compensate better the drop related to the legacy business and the legacy drag you can see it on the graph is still with us will be with us the in future our main objective right now is to make this compensation as good as it is only possiblemobile benefited from more valueoriented strategy that we have already discussed and you can also see the decrease of the commercial costs the biggest improvement was the fixed broadband and here it is not only the revenue which is growing but also the direct margin which started to grow simply the volume is  positive volume evolution is surpassing the current commercial costs that we invest into this categorygood news on the indirect costs this quarter were supported by exceptionally good sales of the real estate and we are really satisfied with the result achieved so far second semester is again very ambitious for us in our plans but as usual no guarantee of success because of the complex process of  which is standing behind such every sale of the real estatefor the second semester we would like to continue the good commercial trends that we have especially subsidy policy plays its important role here in the second semester however we will remain for ourselves the flexibility and the right to make proper decisions visàvis the different tactical situations on that front uncertainties will be with us especially on the roaming front because here we are in the new situation as all operators are as the whole market and we will have to see what are the developments in the  especially in q because this is the high seasonand obviously the real estate remains for us important component of the ebitda evolution however by its natural nature uncertainthen on page  you can see the net income which is better and it is supported by better evolution of the ebitda by lower depreciation here the lower depreciation the reasons are known to you because they are not new theyve been with us in the previous quarters and the commercial costs are finally also slightly lowerfinancial costs financial costs capex first semester was clearly the picture of the turnaround and the fact that we are investing in the turnaround the fiber capex is up  yearoveryear so we continue at a very high pace of production and fiber is  of our capex overall in the first semester so at the same time in all other areas we try to be lean as much as possible these categories are down  yearoveryear and it is the result of the optimization that is an ongoing task for us and completion of certain projects which were with us last year and are not anymoreand in terms of the fiber capex please note that the unitary capex is very similar yearoveryear apples to apples so we keep a good control over the cost of the investments that we have behind the fiberthen the cash flow on the next page of course i already mentioned it is better and it rebounded after q and it was thanks mainly to ebitda much lower cash capex and very high proceeds from the sale of the real estate yearonyear of course you can see some working capital still being a drag this is coming mainly from the fact that the mix of the purchased handsets is changing right now we are selling more expensive handsets this is what customers actually want to buy and we have adjusted our purchases and we are paying for that faster than we recover the installment fee which will be coming to us in  years perspective then we gradually optimize the spendings on the handsets i guess we can expect q being lower in purchases of the handsets its a little bit of the seasonality but also the fact that we adjust to more simo situation we should not forget that overall this year cash flow generation is under the influence of still dropping ebitda yearoveryear and very high capex investments so you should not expect outstanding cash performance in such situation this is basically naturalwe are continuously working on the working capital improvement right now as we speak we have around pln  million of the working capital in the supply chain financing model so this is helping us to optimize the payment terms quite significantly and not excluded that in the second semester we will make some further progress in that respectthen very quickly on the net debt on the next page it is broadly stable we can say it is around x net debt to ebitda there is still in the first semester a negative impact of the cash because of the q not fully compensated by a good q one additional news  not news really but really information is about the european commission fine of course it can in the future weigh on our leverage however the court of justice plans to issue judgment in another case before ours and the timing of this decision has not yet been set this decision in front of us so this increases the probability that the verdict in our case may be delayed well even until so thats all on my side thank you for your attention and i hand the floor back to jeanfrançois for conclusionjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo thank you maciej so let me give you a brief conclusion in the second quarter our commercial results confirm the with confidence the success of the orange love offer that really differentiates us on this very competitive polish market it also helps to monetize our fiber investment and transform i would say the turnaround of fixed mobile businesson the financial front you have understood it we are quite satisfied with these good results and actually we are reiterating with confidence our full year guidance however as maciej has been stating it there are certain risks ahead of us especially in q as roaming the famous new roamlikehome implementation is quite a key risk because this is the high season of roaming all  a lot of polish people going abroad so there is still a bit of uncertainty there and definitely a riskas concerns the backtoschool period and the christmas commercial period we believe they will be very intensive we are currently working towards making our proposals for this period even more simple and the same time taking care of value that it is bringing to us again we are pursuing a value strategy and not a volume strategy anymorelast but not least a quarter ago i told you that we would give our strategic update alongside these q results however we received some feedback from some of you that as we are in the middle of the summer we prefer to postpone it to september  so immediately after this we will meet investors on road shows and conference so actually i would like to invite you all for the special event that we will hold on september  on the warsaw stock exchange where we will comment our plan for the coming  yearsnow it reminds me to thank you for your attention that concludes our presentation and we give you the floor for questionsleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department yes as usual we start the questions on the floor so i encouragequestions and answerspawel puchalski dom maklerski bz wbk sa research division  head of equity research pawel puchalski bz wbk ive got couple of questions first of all you mentioned roamlikeathome whats the expected amount of negative impact on ebitda starting in quarter  the other question would be on working capital i just want to be sure  well i would like to know whether your working capital would decline or your negative working capital input will decline below pln  per quarter as of quarter  or not the other question would be one of the first pages you show the impact of fiber in  falling from  to  and you are commenting that it slows down because of the calendar days et cetera well fiber is pretty new for you the number  the growth should be accelerating quarter after quarter so actually that would be a good explanation for a very mature business but not for expanding line of business and fiber should be expanding fiber business in your case so please explain me once again why is it only jeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo yes i will take this last question and then i will give the floor to maciej who will answer the  first if you allow me so again i mean if youll remember when in poland in april may june we had very long weekends of  days each month in a day where sales happen basically from monday to saturday when you have this kind of very long weekend it really is weighting believe me thats one second explanation is if you remember well until mid of feb we still had prepaid registration prepaid registration as the  was a big opportunity to sell because we had a lot of traffic in our shops from customers of ours that were coming to register their prepaid so we had quite good sales in fiber as well as in q so those are really the  explanations again we are not disappointed by the sales and if you compare them with the sales of last year they are already from a totally other order of magnitude so the fiber i would say sales are really there they are really growing so we are absolutely confident on this onemaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo so regarding your question on roaming today im not in the position to give you a concrete impact of that because well actually we have a certain element of uncertainty how the adoption of the data roaming usage will actually happen during the vacation period its important for us because this is around   of the total traffic for the year so we will see we nevertheless should factor in the fact that the margin of q margin of q for that activity will not repeat for sure we will have more costs we will have a little bit less revenue on that we may have some positive impact coming from the fact that the usage in poland will be higher for guests from abroad of course it is not the same type of the total traffic because users in poland from abroad represent probably  or  of that who is traveling from poland to abroad so there will be a positive traffic but we can assume that the trend will be distorted by some tens of millions above  million in q  q q then regarding working capital i think that the structural thing that is still weighing on the working capital and will remain a weight is the fact that we still sell more installments than we receive the cash from the existing installments in our portfolio so the balance sheet position on the installments monthly sale quarterly sale is still growing and will be growing throughout the second semester will be growing as well most probably through the first semester of  and then we expect some kind of stabilization that cashins from that category will start to equalize to new contracts that we are signing on that front so this is a structural thing on the payables front and the handsets ive already commented that we should see an easing situation here and as we mentioned already we have some additional action plan to increase the supply chain financing which should help but the structural drag is coming from the installmentsleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department any more questions any more questions from the room pawelpawel szpigiel dom maklerski mbanku sa research division  analyst pawel szpiegiel from mbank and my question i have one question lower base  lower cost base this quarter resulted from a change in clients acquisition policy but i hardly recognize any material cuts in any other cost lines and the room for cost cut in orange polska is ample in my opinion for instance compared to annual revenue generated per  employee in orange polska and in your competition the productivity gap is so visible for me and so i just want to ask what you as management want to do with this overstaffing in socalled legacy business even today you mentioned that the trends you cannot actually change the negative trends in the legacy business yesjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo so first of all please be cautious enough not to compare a pure mobile business benchmarks with i would say a former incumbent fixed business which obviously has nothing to do so please do us a favor and compare ourselves with some of our peers everywhere else in europe or in eastern europe thats a fair comparison the second topic is you know we are still i mean plans this year to release employees in orange polska so thats going at a quite a high pace if you look yearonyear we have  less employees than last year so this is obviously ongoing we are well aware and i  of the fact that we still need to work on our costs this is part of the things we will talk about on september  actually partleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department piotrpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst piotr raciborski wood  company i have  questions first one concerns roamlikeathome regulation my question is have you renegotiated or do you plan to renegotiate the wholesale rates with your parent company because probably you could be offered much better rates than at least  competitors in poland so it may a competitive advantage for you all right so maybe the first oneleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department so if i can be a little bit vague in that respect because this is a commercial story and a commercial discussion so we will be really glad to report to you any changes in that if they will be significant when they come and we will not flag upfront the movements because we dont want to jeopardize any discussions that we could have on the interconnect front with actually all operators across europejeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo i take the opportunity to also come back on the meat that i see on this market that some operators because they would be part of big european groups would be actually subsidized by their mother companies which obviously not at all the case so i heard this a few times that we orange would actually not suffer from this simply because we are a part of a large group this is absolutely not the case however you are right we are in the process in the course as maciej is saying to renegotiate our agreement with other operators thats very clear and especially when we look at our roaming profile the first destination of roaming for polish people is germany so we are obviously at least starting now working on optimizing looking at the new volumes the cost of buying these minutes and these megabytes for us in germany thats very clear but as maciej is saying at this stage we cant give you more details but thats obviously ongoing going on and with the aim obviously to reduce these prices with the new volumespiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst okay but do you mean there is like no competitive advantage in that you are a part of the international groupjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo no because we are a company which is listed on the stock  is listed on the stock we are standalone and we dont seek subsidies for the group for whatever reason that we are part of the group thats not working like this so we are competing at the same  i would say with the same weapons and also with the same i would say issues sometimes than our competitors in the polish marketpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst and when considering the impact from roamlikeathome regulation youve guided that it would be like pln  million in second half of the year so like pln  million annually or something like that or how do you think it could be in situation where we have unlimited roaming tariffs so it should be probably considered to be more than thatjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo i think that today we do not have to say more on that front i guess this is the floor situation that we could have the impact stronger but as i say it is very difficult estimate as of today and dont forget that its in our view a shortterm situation because there are many things that operators can do in the future to stabilize the margin on the roaming front in the future many things but more long term than short termpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst okay is there some regulatory solutions to stop losing money on roaming or the compensationjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo i believe we can be very clear and bold i mean something we are selling for free which is costing us is never going to be money making thats clear roaming in europe will not be money making because it is free okay but lets look at things positively i mean this regulation is brandnew its been put in place very recently in poland obviously as we said we are going to negotiate prices we pay to other operators thats one second of all its yet another reason why the polish market should be keen on i would say some kind of repair on the prices front because after the very high price of licenses a few year ago now we are all hit by roamlikehome all of us so thats also i would say positive we can look at things positively as well i think in the longer term this is not going to be a sustainable situationpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst yes okay could you comment on kpis of the mobile segment because youve lost over  of prepaid sim cards as like only acquired only  of postpaid customers and why kpis in mobile segment are so weak i know there is some impact of the prepaid inaudible registration still okay its got  because youve mentioned about it in the presentation but what exactly happened to the kpis and thus the cut in subsidies have impact on lower acquisition on all the mobile customersjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo so we have not especially commented prepaid this time because  but if you remember well in the previous conferences we were really explaining that there would be  prepaid markets there would be the prepaid market before registration with some dynamics and there would be a prepaid market after registration now we clearly are after registration and the dynamics are not at all the same especially on the gross adds side so you can understand very well that the number of new prepaid cards acquired in the quarter is not at all the same than it used to be simply because people need to show their papers their id papers before they are buying the prepaid card so the level of gross adds in the prepaid business is not at all the same its uncomparable now in this new environment than it used to be before so that is basically explaining this decline believe me we are obviously watching very closely prepaid if we look at actually the base which is the active prepaid base there is no issue at all in the evolution of our active prepaid base if we comparing q to q so there is no warning outside the fact i must admit that these kpi the way we all report it market mobile market is declining but its simply due again to this registration effect there is no i would say strong impact on our prepaid business as suchpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst okay and my last question is concerning  would you like to say something just last quarter you saw that so starting from q it should normalize okay for inaudiblemaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo i mean it was  months since the registration process startedpiotr raciborski wood  company financial services as research division  analyst my last question concerns capex your plan to further cut capex ex fiber ormaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo as i was saying it is our everyday job to optimize the capex we do it not only on the businessasusual front but also on the fiber front its an ongoing activity of the management every week we are working on the investment acceptance and every week we have the effects of that longterm perspective is i guess quite positive for us but we need to take into account that in the future we may have some additional transformation costs in the capex which are not existing today because we will have to transform the business but more on that will be in septemberleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department any more so i suggest to switch to our teleconference listeners operator pleaseoperator operator instructions our first question is coming from ondrej cabejšek from berenbergondrej cabejšek berenberg research division  analyst my first question is a followup on the fiber to the home net adds so i was wondering if you sort of normalize this quarter for the working days comparative to previous quarters what your net adds would look like if you have an estimate and second question would be if you could break down in terms of your commercial adds in mobile in terms of subsidies simonly and installments what was the share this quarter and what was it say a year ago and how big of a risk do you think that subsidies returning to the market eventually is and what would trigger that potentiallymaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo ondrej this is maciej speaking the  im not sure i fully understood the first question this is about the normalization of the sales of the fiber yes and predictions for the second semester of the yearondrej cabejšek berenberg research division  analyst yes exactly so if you took out the bank holidays and all the long weekends that you said were impacting the fiber net adds this quarter and you had a normal quarter in terms of work days and thus days where you sell this product what would be roughly the number of fibertothehome net adds that you would have had in the quarter inaudiblemaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo well we will not be guiding by weeks ourselves i think its more comfortable for everybody to take a look at the longer perspective for ourselves the second semester is comprising of  periods basically there is a period until the end of august and this is for many our customers or future customers a vacation period and then from september what starts really is the back to school and then the next commercial season is the christmas season so we will have most probably  different types of dynamics in those  seasons so its  sorry they do not fit exactly the quarter realization but thats the reality that we havejeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo sorry if we would normalize the sales would be higher basically and the daily sales are increasingmaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo well the second question of ondrej was about the importance of the simonly in adds right now we have  of our adds in simonly last year it was around half does it answer your questionondrej cabejšek berenberg research division  analyst it does partly break down the remaining  in terms of installments and subsidies or is that something that you dont want to comment onmaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo well then the rest is subsidies basically  excuse me installments there is no almost anything sold on the subsidized typical subsidized front it is installmentsoperator our next question is coming from anna kazaryan from vtb capitalanna kazaryan vtb capital research division  equities analyst could you please share your view on the current competitive environment on polish telecom market and do you see that tmobile is still aggressive and do you see a room for price increases in mobile segment its my first question and second question is about handset sales could you share whats the gross margin on handset sales after the latest price increases in probably a rough numberjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo shall i take this one so talking about the polish market first of all on the prepaid market we see quite some aggressiveness from players we have decided actually not to follow we are a strong player on prepaid so some of them have been actually been very aggressive on the low end vendors and lowered the price on the first prepaid packages we decided not to follow our sales are good and we want really not to enter in this small price war on prepaid thats one on postpaid yes tmobile is still aggressive we are as you understood cautious we believe that looking at everything that is happening on this market and especially the new roamlikehome this is not the moment to fuel a price war so we are extremely cautious about defending our value if you look at our sales they are good our net additions on mobile are quite strong so there is no reason at all for us to change the strategy at this point of timemaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo so regarding the margin on the subsidies we will not guide you very precisely here but we are still slightly subsidizing the whole activity it is the level of the subsidy which diminished very significantly in our view around x and still the overall margin on the activity is below the water so we are still slightly subsidizing but much much less versus what we have been doing a year agojeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo and as concerns your question about price increases we would not see it like that we would not see it like that but we would rather believe that in this market there is space for what we call more for more basically and thats  obviously we dont know what the other players and competitors are going to do and how theyre going to behave but we definitely believe that there is space for such a strategy in polandmaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo anna you wanted to ask one additional question yesanna kazaryan vtb capital research division  equities analyst yes i just want to clarify so just about handset sales so whats the level of the gross margin of this particular segment of your revenuemaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo it is not very different from being close to a  situation but still some millions of subsidy in qoperator our next question is coming from inaudibleunidentified analyst my question was regarding your fiber monetization you said you continue to work on it could you expand on how you plan to do thatmaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo yes with pleasure we are very much in line our business case that we have presented to the market quite a time ago and just to recall you the main coordinates of this business case we want to reach between  to  of the customer coverage on the production that we do we want to have payback within  to  years depending on the level of the competition that we have and the irr on overall business case should be higher by  higher than the wacc of the company significantly higher so these are the elements that are still valid as of today of course there are some differences a little bit lower arpu a little bit lower costs so all of that still flies within the original business caseoperator our next question is coming from vera sutedja from erste bankmaria veronika sutedja erste group bank ag research division  analyst my question is related to the real estate sale is this the second quarter figure is part of a bigger deal of lets say bigger package in term of the sale you said that you have an ambitious plan in the second half what is the realistic case are we expecting similar or even bigger than the second quarter the second question related to your presentation on page  where you mention the flexibility for commercial spending in the peak season is this related specifically to orange love to fiber or to mobile and im wondering  im trying to figure out the balance here between what you said focus on value versus this flexibility on for commercial spending because they are in contrary to each othermaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo vera so i will take the answer to the question number one real estate second semester expectations it is not connected what we expect to achieve in the second semester with the transactions closed in the first semester and thus by definition it is subject to quite high uncertainty how the results will look like in reality but we shoot high with our targets we shoot really highmaria veronika sutedja erste group bank ag research division  analyst okay may i just add on that question for example if this real estate in the second half does not come true the guidance of the ebitda pln  billion to pln  billion will not be in danger rightmaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo no its  with all risks and opportunities that we have the guidance that we present to you that we reiterate by the way today its pln  billion to pln  billion is something that we are going to achievejeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo to come back on your first question on the subsidies clearly we are stating this because q is always a very strong period the christmas period is a very strong sales period attached to the very strong sales is attached of course strong big commercial costs thats the reason why you heard this comment earlier when we are saying we want to defend value is where you understood it much more careful with the subsidies than we used to be in the past and it is not that we are not subsidizing anymore our offers we are but some of them we are not some of them we are less and obviously we put emphasis on what is strategic for us so the emphasis is put on orange love our convergent offersoperator operator instructions our next question is coming from inaudibleunidentified analyst my question is on your net additions in broadband you showed some increase in q but if i dig deeper into the figures i see that actually if you were to exclude the wireless book fixed then your net additions will be approximately  so my question is actually if you consider this capex inaudible replacement capex or if you actually point your capex strategically right because actually if you take the real fixed broadband and net add is  this is simply a replacement and what people want to buy is wireless for fixed so if you could comment on thisjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo yes my first comment is that wireless fixed is real fixed broadband seen from a customer point of view because customers dont really care on how we are providing but more the experience they have so thats the first point so you cannot just exclude this by stating this is not real however i get your question and its obviously a good question youre right if we would exclude the wireless then we are almost at equilibrium i would like to remind that the way we have done this fiber investment in the past still is we have done this investment on areas which are mostly large cities where our market share is not that high because the cable competition has been playing its role so i remind you that in the last quarter  of our gross adds have been customers taken from competition so thats one of the things you need to remind as well when looking at these fiber numbers this is an aggressive weapon towards competition this is not i would say fiber is not the weapon where we are migrating our adsl base so that explains also this i think this is something you should really keep in mind obviously across the time this can changeunidentified analyst so do you believe that you can come to a point when the increase will  net adds will be higher than  i mean if fiber will be taking up more clients than adsl will lose inaudiblejeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo not only we believe but we are working very hard to reach there believe me so not only we believe again but we are really working hard to do that on products on distribution channels on  also on the tv on the content that we are providing on fiber so thats  we more than believeunidentified analyst all right so this should improve over time and then the other followup is are you able to really charge a premium over adsl with fiber how do they compare the price for the old spectrum technology to adsl vdsl and fiberjeanfrançois fallacher orange polska sa  president of the management board and ceo this is not the case this is not the case because we are in a very competitive market in poland and obviously its not a fight against ourselves the question is not pricing of fiber versus pricing of adsl the question was what products are we putting on the market and how competitive it is so now we have with fiber a competitive product which is priced accordingly to i would say to the market conditions in poland so unfortunately i cannot tell you that actually there is a big i would say price delta with adsl i remind that our strategy is convergence and there we are creating value so the strategy is by convergence getting additional rgus getting additional products from a given family from a given household thanks to this convergence strategy thats where our strategy isleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department as we do not have any questions from teleconference just space for one more followup from the floor please pawelunidentified analyst question on presenting of your results you are a telecom company not real estate disposal agency you present all the figures in an appropriate way i like your excel et cetera but you still include your gain on assets disposal in adjusted ebitda which is inappropriate your adjusted ebitda margin is not appropriate because its affected with oneoff disposal of assets which happened in quarter  which would be actually weaker quarter on quarter and these disposals provide  of bottom line and  of your net free cash flow for the quarter so maybe its time to adjust your adjusted ebitda for nontelco activitymaciej nowohonski orange polska sa  member of the management board  cfo thank you very much for the question first of all and recommendation second of all i will very elegantly disagree with you because the nature of the telco business is as it is incumbents are as they are they are coming from the past very similar for each incumbent and you will find a similar activities of real estate optimization in each incumbent so it is inherent part of our business we have to optimize that and this is the optimization that we are doing previously we needed maybe a building to contain our network infrastructure in a given city right now it is just a container its a natural way of progressing with the network not only quality but the network infrastructure costs as well so i will once again disagree with recommendation but thank you for the questionleszek iwaszko orange polska sa  director of ir department thank you very much for your attention and welcome  would like to invite
