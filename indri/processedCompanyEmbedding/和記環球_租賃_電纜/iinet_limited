suburban garage in perth as iinet technologies pty ltd it began as one of the first australian isps to offer tcpip internet access as opposed to the storeandforward techniques such as mhsnet that were then in use at other isps it claims it was the first isp to offer ppp access in australia and to be the first to base operations on the then new linux operating system the company outgrew its suburban home in  and moved to cbd office accommodation yet its early growth during the internet boom was hampered by the ability of telstra not releasing bigpond as an isp until  to cope with the demand of needed telephone lines and by the sheer competitive pressure in the perth market which had a comparative oversupply of lowcost providers in  iinet successfully expanded into the adelaide market under the name lightiinetnetau named after colonel light in partnership with locals john lindsay and leigh hart the sa arm moved quickly to become the number three isp in the state before being acquired by auslink in citation needed early growthedit a growing demand on infrastructure and a rapidly increasing number of staff saw the company relocate again in  to the central qv building also in early  the western australian internet association formed in  to represent the internet community in western australia created a peering and interconnection arrangement known as waix  between its members which included iinet and several other perthbased isps in late  the internet market was moving towards k technology as one end of a k connection must be digital the racks of modems found in every isp became redundant overnight and expensive cbdhosted equipment offered by cisco ascend and livingston became a requirement in order to survive in the marketplace in  competitive pressure from budget national providers led by onetel started to reach the perth market in  founding partner michael malone purchased the company outright and listed it on the australian stock exchange in september  under ticker symbol iin the newfound capital was used to acquire its two major local rivals in the perth area – wantree internet and omen internet – along with numerous smaller rivals such as networx internet infinite data octal and net trek online services this was perceived by most observers as a rationalisation of an unsustainable services market and allowed not only iinet but also other providers such as westnet eftel itself an agglomeration of several isps formed in  arachnet and global dial among others to grow in the local market and to expand into fullyfledged national providers after the dotcom bubble burst in mid iinet fared poorly on the markets – with shares at one stage falling to a from a a issue price – however its share price recovered as time progressed in september  iinet became the first western australian provider to offer adsl technology growth through acquisitionedit the company created a new registered telecommunications provider iitel later renamed chime communications that sought to improve internet access prices by making wholesale telephone access much cheaper this was possible through new interconnection agreements mandated by the australian governments deregulation of the telecommunications industry and provided the foundation for iinets later move into telephony via its iiphone later phone advantage and phone  and iinetphone later iinet voip products based on its new abilities and after consolidating its local position iinet focused on expanding to national coverage in the early s through strategic acquisitions and natural growth the acquisitions were ruralnet mildura and regional victoria tas access tasmania granite internet fleurieu peninsula south australia rocknet rockhampton queensland hartindale sydney country netlink regional victoria origin internet regional victoria froggy internet sydney virtual communities melbourne octa darwin transact australian capital territory and queanbeyan with the advent of adsl access iinet and several other western australian providers on the waix were at the forefront of the price and service wars and were able to make a sizable push eastwards into larger lucrative markets in  iinet made what was then its biggest acquisition purchasing key new zealand provider ihug the acquisition significantly increased iinets share of the australian and new zealand internet market in  iinet acquired the residential isp business aj trademarks of rival ozemail the business side and infrastructure of that business remained in the ownership of usparent mci ozemail had been australias largest isp until  when it was acquired by mci the retail arm had been neglected and the company moved very late into adsl meaning that it had difficulty positioning itself as a broadband player iinet initially used both the ozemail and iinet brands on the east coast but by  iinet had largely abandoned the ozemail brand using its own corporate image across australia dslam deploymentedit in late  throughout  and into  iinet moved to introduce their own dslam infrastructure colloquially known as iislams or iidslams in the industry into telephone exchanges australiawide this move allowed iinet to be the first australian dsl carrier to offer speeds of over  mbits to a significant number of customers the maximum download speed was initially  mbits adsl which increased to  mbits and later to  mbits as adsladsl standards have been ratified and tested with iinets equipment there are currently over  enabled exchanges active around australia and a list of these exchanges can be found at iinets official website launch of telephony productsedit  saw the introduction of iiphone in the form of a longdistance carrier in february  iinet introduced their fullservice iiphone telephony service with their new range of iibroadband packages allowing customers to pay their telephony costs completely through iinet including line rental and local calls in august  iinet released iinetphone their consumer voip service the product was an addon service available only to customers that also use their iiphone service as with most voip services call costs were well under standard market prices for a regular copper line the iinetphone service supports inbound and outbound calls to normal australian pstn numbers in  iinet were trialling its msan services in three perth telephone exchanges but release and expanded trial of these has since been put on hold until further notice msans are iinets own full telephone service meaning they can be completely off telstras phone service and onto their own this would result in a lower line rental price for its customers and free additional add on options to the phone service regulatory conflict with telstraedit in late  telstra wholesale made changes to their pricing arrangements each of which forced iinet to make changes to their product line and pricing the first of these changes was to the dslam port rate which resulted in an increase of the cost of a  mbit port iinet reduced the speeds for their two cheapest plans to  kbits while doubling the data allowance on these plans in an attempt to placate users they also rebranded the plans available to their telstra wholesale customers  kbits and  mbits plans to iibroadband reserving the iibroadband moniker to uncapped up to  mbits speed plans only available in areas connected to an exchange with an iinet dslam in april  another iibroadband using telstra wholesale plans speed was reduced to  kbits though existing plan users were allowed to keep their speed the second was an increase in line rental for iiphone the rate was increased from a to a and was also blamed on price increases from telstra wholesale michael malone said in regard to both changes were disappointed in the changes to our broadband arrangements and line rental prices from telstra wholesale and were challenging this this dispute has now been resolved and line rental has since returned to amonth under the rebranded phone  plan on the iinet website suspension and resumption of share tradingedit iinets share value slid from a in september  to a in april  on  april  iinet requested a trading halt pending the release of an announcement two days later it suspended its shares from quotation initially the company advised it intended to resume trading on the asx the following week but on  april a local newspaper wa business news speculated that one line of thought is that uncertainty on behalf of iinets bankers will result in the company embarking on a capital raising to address concerns over banking covenants and provide its bankers with a measure of confidence other speculation in the same article suggested that iinet may be about to exit new zealand or the ceo was about to sell his shareholding on  may  iinet advised the asx that its shares would remain suspended as its march quarter results had been well below expectations the company announced on  may  that updated financial figures for the previous year would not be released for one to two weeks on  may the west australians business section reported on the matter and claimed that founder michael malone had been sidelined and that the company was open for takeover according to analysts who rated singtel optus as the most likely suitor on  may wa business news agreed with the wests claim that takeover offers were being evaluated however contradicted the claim that malone had been sidelined meanwhile zdnet reported it is likely iinets management will move more conservatively now that their financial dirty laundry has been so publicly aired theyll need to remain focused on consolidating their assets after what is expected to be a large drop in iinets share price when the stock resumes trading on  may the stock was reinstated to official quotation and fell on its first trading day to a after the  may edition of the west australian reported that iinet was in the red for the first time in five years and had vowed not to repeat costly mistakes powertel a sydneybased telco would emerge with a diluted stake of  at c a share  and michael malones share would be diluted to  on  may amcom telecommunications announced it had acquired a  stake in iinet becoming the companys largest shareholder on  june the malone family increased their holding to  sale of ihug – new zealand subsidiaryedit on  july  iinet announced that they were wanting to sell their new zealand subsidiary – ihug potential buyers included orcon internet limited vodafone and telstraclear the sale to vodafone nz was announced on  october  at a price of a million – roughly six times ihugs ebit at the time  acquisitionsedit january  saw iinet recommence its acquisition strategy with the purchase of the customer base of local perth isp upnaway this was followed in may with the purchase of rival perthbased isp westnet in a friendly acquisition worth  million in a departure from previous acquisitions iinet also announced that westnet would continue to operate as a separate entity however as of  some marketing copy is identical suggesting at the very least a degree of backoffice collaboration now exists as part of the westnet acquisition iinets online gaming presence was closed in august  with operations being moved to the former westnet gaming site fl  acquisitionsedit iinet continued to grow through acquisitions by purchasing rival isp netspace in march  the deal valued at  million increased iinets total number of broadband subscribers to  and also followed the pattern of the westnet takeover with netspace remaining operational as a separate entity under iinet in late july  iinet agreed to purchase aapts consumer operations for  million from telecom new zealand as part of the acquisition telecom new zealand entered into a blocktrade agreement to sell their  share holding in iinet to institutional and sophisticated investors a move viewed by many as a defensive action against a takeover bid from industry rival tpg the purchase of aapt increases iinets total broadband subscribers to more than  and total active services to more than   acquisitionsedit on  november  it was announced that iinet was in the final stages of negotiations in the acquisition of canberrabased telco transact the acquisition was completed on  november  at a cost of  million on  december  iinet announced it would acquire rival isp internode for  million with the transaction due to be completed late february   acquisitionsedit on  august  iinet announced it would be purchasing the south australian isp adam internet for  million after an identical bid by telstra was rejected by the australian competition  consumer commission accc on grounds that the telco giant would use its acquisition of adam to undercut its rivals offers through the use of favourable wholesale supply deals the sale process was completed at the end of august with adam becoming a subsidiary of iinet afact lawsuitedit main article afact v iinet on  november  the australian federation against copyright theft afact filed a lawsuit against iinet in the federal court of australia claiming that iinet infringed copyright by failing to prevent its subscribers from downloading illegally copied material using the bittorrent peertopeer protocol the lawsuit was cofiled by  film and affiliated companies including village roadshow universal pictures warner bros and th century fox as well the seven network an australian television broadcaster and alleges breach of copyright on a number of popular movies and television shows it was later revealed in a wikileaks document afact was backed by mpaa in response iinet issued a statement indicating that iinet had been passing on the reports of infringement received from afact to law enforcement authorities and that iinet could not disconnect a customers phone line based on an allegation unproven in the courts michael malone managing director of iinet went on to state that afact is arguing that they dont want to talk to the police and we should just cut the customers off however the statement of claim filed at the federal court does not indicate afact are asking for users to be disconnected but that iinet subscribers are prevented from committing copyright infringement the case is regarded as a test case for copyright infringement in australia and afact was represented by gilbert  tobin the same law firm that successfully sued the makers of kazaa in  in  justice cowdroy in the federal court found in favour of iinet noting that while iinet users did infringe this was not the responsibility of iinet to deal with on  april  the high court of australia confirmed the intervening federal court full bench decision affirming the first instance decision of cowdroy though not supporting all his reasons roadshow films pty ltd v iinet ltd  hca   april  in his reasoning gummow j noted in particular the current legislation did not provide a mechanism to deal with peertopeer infringements and it needed to be addressed by legislature products and servicesedit iinet limited provides broadband and ip telephony communication services to consumers and business customers its flagship products are

naked broadband plan advertisements  accc skip to content skip to sitemap search form search toggle navigation menu home media media releases listen iinet limited pays  in penalties following accc infringement notices for naked broadband plan advertisements  march iinet limited iinet has paid penalties of  following the issue of two infringement notices by the australian competition and consumer commission in relation to recent advertisements for iinet’s naked broadband gb plan the infringement notices were issued because the accc had reasonable grounds to believe that iinet’s advertisements contravened the australian consumer law acl by failing to prominently state the total minimum price of the service iinet’s advertisements appeared on a tram and billboard in metropolitan melbourne in november  the advertisements displayed a monthly price of  for iinet’s naked broadband gb plan the total minimum price was included in the advertisement but the accc considered that it was not displayed in a prominent way as required by the acl “consumers must be able to understand the true cost of an advertised product so that they can make informed purchasing decisions” accc chairman rod sims said “businesses must ensure that when they advertise part of the price of a good or service the total minimum price is also prominently displayed” “prominence means that the total minimum price can be easily seen and strikes the attention of the consumer in assessing whether the total minimum price is prominent it is important to consider the context in which the advertisement appears  for example if the advertisement is on a moving vehicle where consumers may only be able to see the advertisement momentarily” consumer protection in the telecommunications sector remains an accc enforcement priority in  telstra paid a  penalty for an infringement notice in relation to an iphone  advertisement which the accc considered made a false or misleading representation as to the total price payable by consumers in  the high court upheld a decision ordering tpg to pay a  million penalty to the accc in relation to misleading advertisements the advertisements gave the impression that consumers could acquire tpg’s unlimited adsl broadband internet service for  per month when in fact it could only be acquired with a bundled home telephone line for an additional  per month plus startup costs the payment of a penalty specified in an infringement notice is not an admission of a contravention of the acl the accc can issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened certain consumer protection laws as iinet is a publicly listed company the amount of each infringement notice penalty is  iinet tram
