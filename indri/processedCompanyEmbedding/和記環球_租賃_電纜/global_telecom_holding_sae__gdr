as stated in this announcement  a further announcement will be released by the company on the commencement of the share buyback confirming the launch date and expiration date   buyback shares as defined below must be validly offered for sale prior to the expiration date   buyback shares purchased by the company pursuant to the share buyback will be held in treasury until a reduction of capital is approved by an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the shareholders of the company the shareholders which is expected to occur on or around  march  in accordance with egyptian law if the aggregate number of ordinary shares of the company offered for sale in the share buyback the buyback shares exceeds  representing  of the total issued share capital of the company the number of buyback shares which will be accepted from each shareholder who offered buyback shares into the share buyback will be scaled down prorata in relation to the total number of buyback shares so offered

application which the company has submitted to the egx in the form appended to this announcement as appendix  the egx share buyback application the share buyback will be financed using available cash

the board of directors of the company believes that the cancellation of the gdr program through the cancellation of the gdr listing and the termination of the deposit agreements as defined below the cancellation is in the best interests of the company  the low volume of trading of the gdrs on the london stock exchange does not offer investors the opportunity to trade in meaningful volumes or with any frequency within the public markets  for the twelve months ending  december  the average daily trading volume in gdrs was  representing an average value of us per day  additionally the regulatory and administrative burden on the company including associated costs will be reduced as a result of the cancellation of the gdr listing as the company will no longer have a duallisting on the london stock exchange and the egx  given the low trading volume of the gdrs on the london stock exchange the regulatory and administrative burden on the company in maintaining the gdr listing and associated costs the company considers it  more costeffective to cancel the gdr listing and  beneficial to shareholders  the issued ordinary shares of the company the shares will remain listed on the egx  in the event of cancellation no material impact is expected on the companys performance the cancellation is subject to the approval of an extraordinary general assembly meeting of the gdr holders represented

listing is currently expected to occur on or around  march   the precise date of the cancellation of the gdr listing will be announced in due course cancellation of the gdr listing will significantly reduce the liquidity and marketability and potentially reduce the market value of the remaining gdrs in connection with the proposed cancellation the company intends to simultaneously amend and terminate the deposit agreements as amended and restated from time to time the deposit agreements entered into in connection with the gdr program  any such termination will be conditional upon shareholder approval of the cancellation  the amendments to the deposit agreements will enable the depositary to offer for sale the shares immediately posttermination and also enable the depositary to offer for sale the shares remaining posttermination in any offer that is then open and available  such amendments do not require the approval of gdr holders  under the terms of the deposit agreements gdr holders will receive not less than  days notice of such amendment and termination  following the termination of the deposit agreements if a gdr holder has not surrendered its gdrs and requested delivery to it of the shares underlying its gdrs such shares may be sold on behalf of such gdr holder by the depositary and the net proceeds of such sale returned to such gdr holder upon surrender of its gdrs and the deduction of a cancellation fee at a preferential rate of us as opposed to the ordinarily payable cancellation fee of up to us per gdr in addition to the deduction of a cable fee of

on a qoq basis the customer base grew by  million customers in q  total revenue in q  was flat yoy while banglalinks service revenue decreased  to bdt  billion  the low singledigit decline in service
