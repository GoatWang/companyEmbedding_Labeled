photoautotroph abundance from september  to august  as well as an estimate of autotroph biomass it is only a rough indicator of primaryproduction potential and not an actual estimate of it provided by the seawifs project nasagoddard space flight center and orbimage play media the maps above show earths monthly terrestrial net primary productivity from february  to december  the data come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on nasa’s terra satellite values range from near  grams of carbon per square meter per day tan to  grams per square meter per day dark green a negative value means decomposition or respiration overpowered carbon absorption more carbon was released to the atmosphere than the plants took in in midlatitudes productivity obviously interacts with seasonal change with productivity peaking in each hemisphere’s summer the boreal forests of canada and russia experience high productivity in june and july and then a slow decline through fall and winter yearround tropical forests in south america africa southeast asia and indonesia have high productivity not surprising with the abundant sunlight warmth and rainfall however even in the tropics there are variations in productivity over the course of the year for example the amazon basin exhibits especially high productivity from roughly august through october  the period of the areas dry season because the trees have access to a plentiful supply of ground water that builds up in the rainy season they actually grow better when the rainy skies clear and allow more sunlight to reach the forest in ecology primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from atmospheric or aqueous carbon dioxide it principally occurs through the process of photosynthesis which uses light as its source of energy but it also occurs through chemosynthesis which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy almost all life on earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production the organisms responsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs and form the base of the food chain in terrestrial ecoregions these are mainly plants while in aquatic ecoregions algae predominate in this role ecologists distinguish primary production as either net or gross the former accounting for losses to processes such as cellular respiration the latter not contents  overview  gross primary production and net primary production  terrestrial production  oceanic production  light  nutrients  iron  measurement  terrestrial  grasslands  forests  aquatic  global  estimates  primary production and plant biomass for the earth  human impact and appropriation  see also  references overviewedit the calvin cycle of photosynthesis primary production is the production of chemical energy in organic compounds by living organisms the main source of this energy is sunlight but a minute fraction of primary production is driven by lithotrophic organisms using the chemical energy of inorganic molecules regardless of its source this energy is used to synthesize complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide co and water ho the following two equations are simplified representations of photosynthesis top and one form of chemosynthesis bottom co  ho  light → cho  o co  o   hs → cho   s   ho in both cases the end point is a polymer of reduced carbohydrate chon typically molecules such as glucose or other sugars these relatively simple molecules may be then used to further synthesise more complicated molecules including proteins complex carbohydrates lipids and nucleic acids or be respired to perform work consumption of primary producers by heterotrophic organisms such as animals then transfers these organic molecules and the energy stored within them up the food web fueling all of the earths living systems gross primary production and net primary productionedit gross primary production gpp is the amount of chemical energy as biomass that primary producers create in a given length of time gpp is sometimes confused with gross primary productivity which is the rate at which photosynthesis or chemosynthesis occurs some fraction of this fixed energy is used by primary producers for cellular respiration and maintenance of existing tissues ie growth respiration and maintenance respiration the remaining fixed energy ie mass of photosynthate is referred to as net primary production npp npp  gpp  respiration by plants net primary production is the rate at which all the plants in an ecosystem produce net useful chemical energy it is equal to the difference between the rate at which the plants in an ecosystem produce useful chemical energy gpp and the rate at which they use some of that energy during respiration some net primary production goes toward growth and reproduction of primary producers while some is consumed by herbivores both gross and net primary production are in units of mass per unit area per unit time interval in terrestrial ecosystems mass of carbon per unit area per year g c m− yr− is most often used as the unit of measurement terrestrial productionedit an oak tree a typical modern terrestrial autotroph on the land almost all primary production is now performed by vascular plants with a small fraction coming from algae and nonvascular plants such as mosses and liverworts before the evolution of vascular plants nonvascular plants likely played a more significant role primary production on land is a function of many factors but principally local hydrology and temperature the latter covaries to an extent with light specifically photosynthetically active radiation par the source of energy for photosynthesis while plants cover much of the earths surface they are strongly curtailed wherever temperatures are too extreme or where necessary plant resources principally water and par are limiting such as deserts or polar regions water is consumed in plants by the processes of photosynthesis see above and transpiration the latter process which is responsible for about  of water use is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants transpiration allows plants to transport water and mineral nutrients from the soil to growth regions and also cools the plant diffusion of water vapour out of a leaf the force that drives transpiration is regulated by structures known as stomata these structure also regulate the diffusion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the leaf such that decreasing water loss by partially closing stomata also decreases carbon dioxide gain certain plants use alternative forms of photosynthesis called crassulacean acid metabolism cam and c these employ physiological and anatomical adaptations to increase wateruse efficiency and allow increased primary production to take place under conditions that would normally limit carbon fixation by c plants the majority of plant species oceanic productionedit marine diatoms an example of planktonic microalgae in a reversal of the pattern on land in the oceans almost all photosynthesis is performed by algae with a small fraction contributed by vascular plants and other groups algae encompass a diverse range of organisms ranging from single floating cells to attached seaweeds they include photoautotrophs from a variety of groups eubacteria are important photosynthetizers in both oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems and while some archaea are phototrophic none are known to utilise oxygenevolving photosynthesis a number of eukaryotes are significant contributors to primary production in the ocean including green algae brown algae and red algae and a diverse group of unicellular groups vascular plants are also represented in the ocean by groups such as the seagrasses unlike terrestrial ecosystems the majority of primary production in the ocean is performed by freeliving microscopic organisms called phytoplankton larger autotrophs such as the seagrasses and macroalgae seaweeds are generally confined to the littoral zone and adjacent shallow waters where they can attach to the underlying substrate but still be within the photic zone there are exceptions such as sargassum but the vast majority of freefloating production takes place within microscopic organisms differences in relative photosynthesis between plankton species under different irradiance the factors limiting primary production in the ocean are also very different from those on land the availability of water obviously is not an issue though its salinity can be similarly temperature while affecting metabolic rates see q ranges less widely in the ocean than on land because the heat capacity of seawater buffers temperature changes and the formation of sea ice insulates it at lower temperatures however the availability of light the source of energy for photosynthesis and mineral nutrients the building blocks for new growth play crucial roles in regulating primary production in the ocean available earth system models suggest that ongoing ocean biogeochemical changes could trigger reductions in ocean npp between  and  of current values depending on the emissions scenario lightedit a kelp forest an example of attached macroalgae the sunlit zone of the ocean is called the photic zone or euphotic zone this is a relatively thin layer – m near the oceans surface where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis to occur for practical purposes the thickness of the photic zone is typically defined by the depth at which light reaches  of its surface value light is attenuated down the water column by its absorption or scattering by the water itself and by dissolved or particulate material within it including phytoplankton net photosynthesis in the water column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer turbulent mixing by wind energy at the oceans surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates creating the aforementioned mixed layer the deeper the mixed layer the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it the mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone to being much deeper than the photic zone when it is much deeper than the photic zone this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur the maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth as long as there are adequate nutrients available net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth both the magnitude of wind mixing and the availability of light at the oceans surface are affected across a range of space and timescales the most characteristic of these is the seasonal cycle caused by the consequences of the earths axial tilt although wind magnitudes additionally have strong spatial components consequently primary production in temperate regions such as the north atlantic is highly seasonal varying with both incident light at the waters surface reduced in winter and the degree of mixing increased in winter in tropical regions such as the gyres in the middle of the major basins light may only vary slightly across the year and mixing may only occur episodically such as during large storms or hurricanes nutrientsedit annual mean sea surface nitrate for the world ocean data from the world ocean atlas  mixing also plays an important role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients inorganic nutrients such as nitrate phosphate and silicic acid are necessary for phytoplankton to synthesise their cells and cellular machinery because of gravitational sinking of particulate material such as plankton dead or fecal material nutrients are constantly lost from the photic zone and are only replenished by mixing or upwelling of deeper water this is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water consequently between mixing events primary production and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer even in the presence of abundant light however as long as the photic zone is deep enough primary production may continue below the mixed layer where lightlimited growth rates mean that nutrients are often more abundant ironedit another factor relatively recently discovered to play a significant role in oceanic primary production is the micronutrient iron this is used as a cofactor in enzymes involved in processes such as nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation a major source of iron to the oceans is dust from the earths deserts picked up and delivered by the wind as aeolian dust in regions of the ocean that are distant from deserts or that are not reached by dustcarrying winds for example the southern and north pacific oceans the lack of iron can severely limit the amount of primary production that can occur these areas are sometimes known as hnlc highnutrient lowchlorophyll regions because the scarcity of iron both limits phytoplankton growth and leaves a surplus of other nutrients some scientists have suggested introducing iron to these areas as a means of increasing primary productivity and sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere measurementedit the methods for measurement of primary production vary depending on whether gross vs net production is the desired measure and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus gross production is almost always harder to measure than net because of respiration which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production ie sugars before they can be accurately measured also terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to belowground organs and tissues where it is logistically difficult to measure shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem scale also greatly affects measurement techniques the rate of carbon assimilation in plant tissues organs whole plants or plankton samples can be quantified by biochemically based techniques but these techniques are decidedly inappropriate for large scale terrestrial field situations there net primary production is almost always the desired variable and estimation techniques involve various methods of estimating dryweight biomass changes over time biomass estimates are often converted to an energy measure such as kilocalories by an empirically determined conversion factor terrestrialedit in terrestrial ecosystems researchers generally measure net primary production npp although its definition is straightforward field measurements used to estimate productivity vary according to investigator and biome field estimates rarely account for below ground productivity herbivory turnover litterfall volatile organic compounds root exudates and allocation to symbiotic microorganisms biomass based npp estimates result in underestimation of npp due to incomplete accounting of these components however many field measurements correlate well to npp there are a number of comprehensive reviews of the field methods used to estimate npp estimates of ecosystem respiration the total carbon dioxide produced by the ecosystem can also be made with gas flux measurements the major unaccounted pool is belowground productivity especially production and turnover of roots belowground components of npp are difficult to measure bnpp belowground npp is often estimated based on a ratio of anppbnpp aboveground nppbelowground npp rather than direct measurements gross primary production can be estimated from measurements of net ecosystem exchange nee of carbon dioxide made by the eddy covariance technique during night this technique measures all components of ecosystem respiration this respiration is scaled to daytime values and further subtracted from nee grasslandsedit the konza tallgrass prairie in the flint hills of northeastern kansas most frequently peak standing biomass is assumed to measure npp in systems with persistent standing litter live biomass is commonly reported measures of peak biomass are more reliable if the system is predominantly annuals however perennial measurements could be reliable if there were a synchronous phenology driven by a strong seasonal climate these methods may underestimate anpp in grasslands by as much as  temperate to  tropical fold repeated measures of standing live and dead biomass provide more accurate estimates of all grasslands particularly those with large turnover rapid decomposition and interspecific variation in timing of peak biomass wetland productivity marshes and fens is similarly measured in europe annual mowing makes the annual biomass increment of wetlands evident forestsedit methods used to measure forest productivity are more diverse than those of grasslands biomass increment based on stand specific allometry plus litterfall is considered a suitable although incomplete accounting of aboveground net primary production anpp field measurements used as a proxy for anpp include annual litterfall diameter or basal area increment dbh or bai and volume increment aquaticedit in aquatic systems primary production is typically measured using one of six main techniques variations in oxygen concentration within a sealed bottle developed by gaarder and gran in  incorporation of inorganic carbon c in the form of sodium bicarbonate into organic matter stable isotopes of oxygen o o and o fluorescence kinetics technique still a research topic stable isotopes of carbon c and c oxygenargon ratios  the technique developed by gaarder and gran uses variations in the concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production typically three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and stoppered the first is analysed immediately and used to determine the initial oxygen concentration usually this is done by performing a winkler titration the other two vessels are incubated one each in under light and darkened after a fixed period of time the experiment ends and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured as photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration the light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration so provides a measure of net photosynthesis ie oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel the technique of using c incorporation added as labelled naco to infer primary production is most commonly used today because it is sensitive and can be used in all ocean environments as c is radioactive via beta decay it is relatively straightforward to measure its incorporation in organic material using devices such as scintillation counters depending upon the incubation time chosen net or gross primary production can be estimated gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times  hour or less since the loss of incorporated c by respiration and organic material excretion  exudation will be more limited net primary production is the fraction of gross production remaining after these loss processes have consumed some of the fixed carbon loss processes can range between  of incorporated c according to the incubation period ambient environmental conditions especially temperature and the experimental species used aside from those caused by the physiology of the experimental subject itself potential losses due to the activity of consumers also need to be considered this is particularly true in experiments making use of natural assemblages of microscopic autotrophs where it is not possible to isolate them from their consumers the methods based on stable isotopes and oar ratios have the advantage of providing estimates of respiration rates in the light without the need of incubations in the dark among them the method of the triple oxygen isotopes and oar have the additional advantage of not needing incubations in closed containers and oar can even be measured continuously at sea using equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry eims or a membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims however if results relevant to the carbon cycle are desired it is probably better to rely on methods based on carbon and not oxygen isotopes it is important to notice that the method based on carbon stable isotopes is not simply an adaptation of the classic c method but an entirely different approach that does not suffer from the problem of lack of account of carbon recycling during photosynthesis globaledit as primary production in the biosphere is an important part of the carbon cycle estimating it at the global scale is important in earth system science however quantifying primary production at this scale is difficult because of the range of habitats on earth and because of the impact of weather events availability of sunlight water on its variability using satellitederived estimates of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi for terrestrial habitats and seasurface chlorophyll for the oceans it is estimated that the total photoautotrophic primary production for the earth was  gt c yr− of this  gt c yr−  was the product of terrestrial organisms while the remaining  gt c yr−

areal terms it was estimated that land production was approximately  g c m− yr− excluding areas with permanent ice cover while that for the oceans was  g c m− yr− another significant difference

part of the earths npp cycle but exert a disproportionate influence in it in  josep garí designed a new indicator of sustainable development based precisely on the estimation of the human appropriation of npp he coined it hanpp human appropriation of net primary production and introduced it at the inaugural conference of the european society for ecological economics hanpp has since been further developed and widely applied in research on ecological economics as well as in policy analysis for sustainability hanpp represents a proxy of the human impact on nature and can be applied to different geographical scales and also globally the extensive degree of human use of the planets resources mostly via land use results in various levels of impact on actual npp nppact although in some regions such as the nile valley irrigation has resulted in a considerable increase in primary production in most of the planet there us a notable trend of npp reduction due to land changes δnpplc of  across global landmass in addition to this end consumption by people raises the total hanpp  to  of potential vegetation npp it is estimated that in   of the earths icefree land area  cropland  pasture was devoted to human agriculture this disproportionate amount reduces the energy available to other species having a marked impact on biodiversity flows of carbon water and energy and ecosystem services and scientists have questioned how large this fraction can be before these services begin to break down reductions in npp are also expected in the ocean as a result of ongoing

transistor is a stack of semiconductor layers each with a carefully controlled composition thickness and electrical conductivity to ensure optimal device performance these layers must be deposited in a carefully controlled manner atom by atom to form a virtually perfect crystalmbe is the ideal growth technology for depositing films in this manner this growth process begins by loading all of the materials that are to be incorporated into the epitaxial film into separate inert containers known as crucibles every crucible is heated up to a temperature that causes its source to evaporate at a stable desired rate when a shutter is opened a beam of atoms or molecules travels under an ultrahigh vacuum from its cell to a heated substrate heating ensures that every molecule ‘cracks’ into atoms when hitting the surface of the substratecompound semiconductors form when two or more sources are directed at the substrate simultaneously for example a film of gallium arsenide grows when gallium and arsenic atoms impinge on the wafer at the same time their freedom to move around the surface before settling down holds the key to forming a perfect crystal with alternating atoms of gallium and
