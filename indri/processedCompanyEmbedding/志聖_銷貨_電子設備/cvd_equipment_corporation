chemical vapor deposited three dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name cvd d graphene™ and  business wire nov 9   pm est nasdaq cvv cvd equipment corporation cvd today launched a new line of chemical vapor deposited three dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name cvd d graphene™ and is expected to enable new high performance products karlheinz strobl vp of business development states “the cvd d graphene™ cellular material platform is based on a three dimensional graphenefoam like material having several two dimensional a few atomic layers thick graphene sheets that are mechanically and electrically fully interconnected in three dimensions this novel highly customizable material platform enables the preservation of many of the high performance material properties of the traditional one atom thick two dimensional graphene sheets such three dimensional graphene materials can be further functionalized by chemical vapor deposition electro deposition andor chemical grafting to develop even more advanced materials for high performance product developments this new nanomaterial platform interconnects the two dimensional nano world with the three dimensional macroscopic world of products in a more manufacturable manner the novel material platform is already being explored by innovators for a growing range of product applications it is anticipated that as additional variations of the material are developed more growth market opportunities will become available”  cvd materials corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of cvd equipment corporation that focuses on providing a range of nanoenabled materials and products” said leonard rosenbaum president “by leveraging our custom equipment design and manufacturing capabilities with the process development and manufacturing capabilities of our application laboratory cvd materials corporation can optimally focus on shortening the time to market for novel nanoenhanced material products with the commercialization of cvd d graphene™ cellular materials using a range of nickel foam templates and by tuning the thickness of the carbon film layers we can provide an expanded range of cvdgraphene™ research materials that enables our customers to develop new products including higher performance batteries ultracapacitors and gas liquid and bio

are saying about our systems i built two cvd systems when setting up my lab they were basically clones of a system i had used previously so the design was already in my mind and mostly down on paper however i severely underestimated the time involved in selecting all the proper pieces and parts by the time things finally came together and the first system came online i found myself wishing i had simply purchased complete solutions from a company that had already invested the time to engineer a reliable system as a new faculty member funds are a limited resource but time is even more so quickly getting the ball rolling on research is worth more than what one might save with a homebuilt approach  erik einarsson phd assistant professori am glad to share with you the good news that ever since the very first batch of samples we continued to produce long and uniform silicon nanowires suffice to say that members of our research group are all impressed with the turnkey reliability as well as extensive safety features of this lpcvd system which greatly satisfy the needs of our fundamental research program in nanomaterials we also appreciate the custom system design effort to cater
