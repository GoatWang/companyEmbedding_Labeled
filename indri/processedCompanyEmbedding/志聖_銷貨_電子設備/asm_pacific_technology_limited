asm laser separation international laser dicing  grooving scroll down this is what we stand for products we offer laser dicing and grooving systems that enable the lowest cost of ownership through the shortest process time and high flexibility this ensures that asmpt’s laser systems are ideally suited for your application applications we develop laser dicing and grooving solutions that enable semiconductor manufacturers to reduce the product manufacturing cost through yield improvement higher productivity increased number of dies per wafer our expertise is in rfic led ic lowk and discrete technology to enable the low cost of ownership all modules within the system support and contribute to achieve this proposition to keep up with the demanding semiconductor market continuous technology development enables smaller better and more cost effective products for wafer dicing and grooving applications about us asm laser separation international is the inventor of multibeam laser dicing and grooving the multi laser beam dicing and grooving process is the technology with very low thermal impact while having a very high productivity asm laser separation’s solutions enable you to reduce your manufacturing cost significantly and to execute your semiconductor technology road map   read more history alsi originated from the semiconductor industry and has a clear understanding of how to meet the driving forces in this industry alsi was founded in the year  as a spin off from philips semiconductors and started with a transfer of knowhow and patents from royal philips nv through which alsi has obtained the unique intellectual property rights on multiple beam laser separation technology the philips laser dicing technology was proven by the billions of separated units and alsi continued the development of this proprietary technology and introduced it to the whole semiconductor industry meanwhile alsi’s technologies have lead to a breakthrough in the led and rfic industry wafers of high brightness led’s and gaas rfic’s for mobile communication are increasingly diced by alsi’s multiple laser beam process in which alsi has achieved a leading position asm laser separation international alsi is a wholly owned subsidiary of asm pacific technology ltd asm pt  which is listed on the hong kong stock exchange and is  the world’s largest assembly and packaging equipment
