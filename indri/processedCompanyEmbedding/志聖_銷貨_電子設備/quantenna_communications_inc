quantenna » blog archive » quantenna announces world’s first ac g wave  wifi product line   news quantenna announces world’s first ac g wave  wifi product line world’s fastest gbps family for wifi access points features true x™ and mimo for ghz and ghz to manage highdensity wireless networks fremont calif sept    ibc  quantenna communications inc the leader in ultrahigh performance wifi today announced the availability of the industry’s first g wave  wifi product family the products are built on quantenna’s true x™ qsrg wifi platform with multiuser mimo mumimo technology for home wireless access points and residential gateways quantenna’s uptostreams g wave  product family delivers unprecedented wifi performance reliability and capacity for highdensity environments and can address both the service provider and retail market segments g wave  is a revolutionary new way for wifi networks to operate as wifi usage continues to explode g wave  provides the flexibility and scalability to meet the growing demand for wifi capacity quantenna is the first and only company implementing g wave  to support speeds up to gbps this milestone speed benchmark for wifi is attained by combining the industry’s first true x™ mimo configuration for ghz networks with a x mimo configuration on ghz networks for a combined stream configuration quantenna’s g wave  platform delivers the maximum capacity within the minimum spectrum so that more streams can be simultaneously transmitted with improved range and reliability this means that  wifi access points or gateways using quantenna’s g wave  product family can support more clients each running more efficiently for such demanding applications as realtime video ott video voice iot and other services even singleuser mimo sumimo x and x client performance is vastly improved ensuring that the millions of currently shipping mainstream smart phones tablets and notebook pcs will also benefit from an improved wifi experience according to abi research over  billion products with ac will ship worldwide by the end of  “shipments of devices which support the ac standard grew significantly in  and ” said abi research director philip solis “rising demand for home access points that can manage and support the dozens of wifi devices is generating an immense opportunity for leading component suppliers such as quantenna who are early to market with innovative solutions” the qsrg wave  product family also supports a unique adaptive mimo architecture this enables g wave  access points to maximize overall network performance delivering the best possible capacity across all client devices this is important as the mix of legacy and new client devices are changing as end consumers adopt more devices with ac “in wifi access points more antennas are always better but g wave  is not just about x mumimo and faster speeds it’s about making better use of network and airtime efficiency to support the growing number of connected devices services and applications” said dr sam heidari quantenna ceo “after pioneering the wifi industry with x mimo we’ve gained a deep understanding of realworld channel behavior in crowded environments these insights have led to the creation of g wave  and the world’s first x mimo which are poised to revolutionize the wifi experience” in addition g wave  allows access points to support up to four simultaneous multiuser mimo mumimo clients per group this means more total system capacity and aggregate throughput can be supported  a trend that continues unabated as the number of clients increases per household over time more consumers will experience the fastest most reliable video streaming experience faster downloads and uploads and better performance even at extremely long distances in challenging highdensity wifi home environments and outdoor applications like wifi hotspots key wave  features and benefits • integrated ap chipset for dualband ghz and ghz dual concurrent operation

mainstream wifi segment new qsrgax access point solution complements bestinclass qsrgax stream solution announced in oct  las vegas jan   globe newswire  quantenna communications inc nasdaqqtna a leading provider of high performance wifi solutions today announced a new ax product called qsrgax with support for dualband dual concurrent x  x operation this product joins quantennas qsrgax the worlds first dualband dual concurrent x  x ax stream access point solution previously announced in october  ax advancements promise to expand the wifi market particularly in segments where there are higher user densities such as the home enterprise and public venues we estimate that the total ax enabled device shipments will increase from  thousand units in  to  million units in  said christian kim senior analyst iot connectivity and telecom electronics at ihs markit as service providers and device manufacturers bring increasing bandwidth and services to the home consumer demand for faster and more robust wifi continues to rise wifi must continue to support an ever increasing array of mobile and internetofthings iot devices and do so more efficiently in denser environments such as multidwelling units mdus ax is designed to address these demands through improved bandwidth efficiency orthogonal frequencydivision multiple access ofdma is added in order to allow simultaneous operation of many clients which increases overall network capacity in addition network efficiency is also improved as ofdma preambles the portion of the frame used for network synchronization can be shared amongst all client devices since ofdma is a schedulerbased approach there is less contention between client devices and the access points for access to the air therefore the ax access point allows client devices to have longer sleep times enabling extended battery life finally ax allows these improvements in both ghz and ghz bands supporting applications that need long range in ghz frequencies as well as applications which demand higher speed and denser network coverage in the ghz frequencies the qsrgax solution supports  total streams of ax  streams in the ghz band and  streams in the ghz band qsrgax joins quantennas stream qsrgax chipset to form a complete family of ax access point solutions that address both mainstream and highend markets these ax access point solutions are designed to be compatible to both future ax client devices as well as existing wifi client devices such as quantennas bestinclass acnagb solutions ax is the future of wifi said dr sam heidari
