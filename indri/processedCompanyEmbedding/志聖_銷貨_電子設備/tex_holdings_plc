manufacturers of hydraulic hammer and compaction equipment its products and sales agents are found in most developed countries or regions where modern construction methods are an essential element in meeting infrastructure targets yet when the british steel piling company ltd as it was originally called was founded by edward le bas in  its immediate objective was not the manufacture of equipment but to promote the use in britain of steel sheet piling the driving and extraction of the piling was obviously an important part of this with the result that the company was soon called upon to provide equipment for others to carry out such work by  the earliest versions of bsp steamair piling hammers had appeared as had equipment for extracting piles the company’s influence continued to grow before during and after the second world war in terms of both piling and piling machinery and equipment for a number of years it was also involved in the manufacture of drilling earth boring and tunnelling machines bsp was transformed into a fulltime foundation equipment manufacturer during the early s when the newly nationalised british steel corporation took over the marketing of all uk produced steel sheet piling the company was acquired by tex holdings plc in  and is still based at great blakenham near the suffolk town of ipswich where it first established a manufacturing centre in  always at the forefront of significant foundation equipment developments bsp initiated the worldwide move towards hydraulic hammers and set the standard for their design and construction today over  per cent of the company’s products are exported and it is represented in 6 countries it has always been bsp’s policy to make every effort to ensure that every product is suited to the application for which it has been specified customers have the reassurance of knowing that their investment in bsp foundation equipment has been designed and manufactured to meet all of the following criteria value

had time to read our annual accounts and i will be happy to address any questions you may have in due course   i will now give you a short report of the trading companies   the plastics division overall is trading in line with expectations  at barnstaple the factory faces subdued orders  a price increase with a major customer has been forced through which may result in this work ultimately being lost   trading at the derby site has however been better than budgeted which will help maintain the overall divisional performance   the plastics division does though face pressure on costs such as that of raw materials and the impact of the national minimum wage which is putting general pressure on wages overall   within the engineering division tex engineering has opened the year strongly on the back of increased demand for a number of its product lines   with margin and overheads under control we should see the company report another solid profit this year   eurotex have received the long awaited order from chile which will free up stock reduce our stock reserves and move our company into profit  further rationalisation of this company is being investigated   the atc team has been expanded and  is expected to be a year of transition the aircraft carrier project is continuing to provide work moreover there are a number of further opportunities both within the civilian and military market worldwide  the growth in air travel the doubling in air passenger numbers is driving the need for additional airport capacity and within that the demand for control towers   bsp has opened the year slowly   enquiry levels remain buoyant including enquiries from the baltic states and south america for the airfield damage repair system     gm tex achieved a profit in its first full year of trading after allowing for the costs of relocation to claydon the current year will see the completion of the move into a new purposebuilt factory which will allow us to develop larger generator units in conjunction with a major engine manufacturer   qk honeycomb products suffered from its prices being affected by exchange rate fluctuations in 6  assuming that exchange rates remain at current levels the effect of this will not be repeated in the current year  on a positive note the leisure vehicle market which provides the underlying volume of qk business is returning to prerecession levels   we live in difficult times which makes forecasting and planning for the group somewhat testing  however the board is confident that any upturn will be to our advantage   as a board we prioritise the care and support of our pensioners i am pleased to report the pension fund deficit has stabilised due in part to the high level of the stock market we continually monitor the most effective way of handling the large liabilities that our pension fund presents    we will continue to protect the interests of both our pensioners and those who have given many years of good service to the group we as your directors will continue to act in the best interest of our shareholders in both good and difficult times     this information is provided by rnsthe company news service
