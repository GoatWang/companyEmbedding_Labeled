change of the stock over a period of time shown in percentage it is also useful to calculate the relative performance of a stock comparing its price change with the change of a benchmark index over the same period benchmarking stocks on the basis of their performance could be more complex when calculating total return which consists in adding to the stock price change any other return from an investment over the period such as dividends furthermore currency conversion rate must be considered when the investment is made in a different currency as the exchange rate change over the period
