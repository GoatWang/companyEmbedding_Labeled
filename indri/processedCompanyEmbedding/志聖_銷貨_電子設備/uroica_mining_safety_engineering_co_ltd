beta calculationsthe beta calculator offers additional flexibility such as reference index apply the same reference index for all companies in your list regardless of their country sampling frequency choose between a weekly or a monthly sampling frequency for the closing prices debt for unlevered beta choose the type of debt to be used for unlevered beta calculations additional beta statistics calculate rsquared and tvalueabout betastandard beta is cocalled levered which means that it reflects the capital structure of the company including the financial risk linked to the debt level unlevered beta or ungeared beta compares the risk of an unlevered company ie with no debt in the capital structure to the risk of the market unlevered beta is useful when comparing companies with different capital structures as it focuses on the equity risk unlevered beta is generally lower than the levered beta however unlevered beta could be higher than levered beta when the net debt is negative meaning that the company has more cash than debtmany different betas can be calculated for a given stock the main common variables that affect beta calculations are the time period the reference date the sampling frequency for closing prices and the reference indexthe calculation divides the covariance of the stock return with the market return by the variance of the market return beta is used very often for company valuation using the discounted cash flows dcf method the discount rate is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital wacc the wacc is essentially a blend of the cost of equity and the aftertax cost of debt the cost of equity is usually calculated using the capital asset pricing model capm which defines the cost of equity as follows re  rf  β × rm
