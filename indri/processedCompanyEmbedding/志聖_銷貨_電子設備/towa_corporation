semiconductor chips is applied to the area around the semiconductor chip via a gate supply port before it is cured in addition we have also developed and market molding equipment that utilizes the compression method whereby semiconductor chips are immersed in a flowable resin in advance and then the flowable resin is cured semiconductor manufacturers use larger lead frames and substrates in an attempt to improve productivity and reduce the production cost in addition semiconductor molding technologies are required to be compatible with the slimmer dimensions and higher integration of semiconductor devices and with increased thickness for compatibility with power devices and modularization our molding equipment caters to these various needs view all singulation equipment together
