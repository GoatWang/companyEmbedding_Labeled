wire｜nakamura choukou chinese japanese contact us business overview about us home we are independently developing manufacturing and distributing dinaprism a diamond saw wire cutting tool that is essential to the slicing process of electronic materials used for solar batteries leds etc by using a unique fixed method for our diamond grains we can achieve highspeed results remarkable strength and reduce costs while maintaining a high reputation features of our independentlydeveloped dinaprism diamond saw wire what is diamond wire manufacturing process of silicon wafer nakamura choukous diamond wire is used in the slicing process in manufacturing silicon wafers which are used for the main part of a solar battery panel that is a solar cell a “diamond wire” is a tool used to thinly slice rectangular silicon ingots that are precut to the dimensions of each wafer it is a threadlike slicing tool made with a thin piano wire with diamond granules firmly attached and is thinner than a human hair characteristics and strengths solutions for our clients our highspeed highstrength diamond fixation technology enables us to produce our dinaprism diamond saw wire with highefficiency at a low cost this also allows us to provide speedy detailed customization to meet the demands of various customers at the slice processing site transition from free abrasive grain method to fixed abrasive grain method for the slice processing method used for electronic materials we expedite transition from a conventional free abrasive grain method to a fixed abrasive grain method the fixed abrasive grain method enables higher production capacity and eases environmental strain for a revolutionary improvement in slice processing of electronic materials additionally nakamura choukou is making efforts to further thin the diamond wire since increasing the number of silicon wafers produced from an ingot is an important advantage for wafer manufacturers in terms of production efficiency and cost reduction the th japan grand prize meti minister’s award nakamura choukou received the th japan grand prize awarded by mr edano minister of economy trade and industry as one of the most excellent manufacturers date wednesday february   venue national graduate institute for policy studies roppongi minato ward tokyo diamond saw wire development points by adopting a fixed grain method for slice processing of our diamond saw wires cost reduction becomes a requirement and in order for new processing methods to become firmly established acquiring processing requirements and diamond saw
