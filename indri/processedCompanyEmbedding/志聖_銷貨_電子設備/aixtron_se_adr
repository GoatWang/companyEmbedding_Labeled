post a messagetop reactionsrrobert spaul joseph watson  reporting for infowarsprison planet the mainstream media is completely blacklisting any mention of the bombshell revelations by investigative reporter seymour hersh about murdered dnc staffer seth rich in which hersh explained how rich was wikileaks’ source for the dnc leak and how the “russian hacking” story was completely concocted by former cia director john brennanin an audio tape obtained by big league politics hersh says he saw an fbi report leaked to him by an insider which confirms that rich had contacted wikileaks with sample emails from the dnc leak and asked for payment for the full data dump“all i know is that he offered a sample an extensive sample i’m sure dozens of emails and said ‘i want money’ later wikileaks did get the password he had a dropbox a protected dropbox” he said they got access to the dropbox” added hershthe pulitzer prizewinning author said seth rich first contacted wikileaks in late spring of last year and that the dnc later tried to cover up the truth by inventing the story that russia had hacked their systems and that this was part of a disinformation operation overseen by former cia director john brennanalthough he thinks rich’s murder was a robbery gone wrong hersh acknowledges that the former dnc staffer was concerned for his safety“the word was passed according to the nsa report he also shared this dropbox with a couple of friends so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems’” said hersh “wikileaks got access before he was killed”almost  hours after this bombshell story and not one single mainstream media outlet has covered the issue despite a wikileaks tweet of the hersh audio receiving over  retweetsin contrast virtually every msm outlet in existence offered breathless coverage to yesterday’s claims that president trump was personally involved in helping craft a “fake news” story that seth rich was killed as retribution for him leaking the dnc emails in order to “divert attention away from the ongoing russia investigation”the nature of both stories is exactly the same – they are both based on unproven claims although hersh’s claims seem more credible given his reputation yet the media has chosen to elevate one story and completely ignore the otherit’s almost like huge media corporations have an agenda to only push a narrative that damages donald trump and bolsters the narrative that russia interfered in the presidential election while burying the truth about seth rich’s role in the dnc

operator let me start by welcoming you all to aixtrons q and full year  results conference call thank you for attending this call id like to welcome our president and ceo martin goetzeler as well as our coo dr bernd schulte as the operator indicated this call is being recorded by aixtron and is considered copyright material as such it cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without expressed permission your participation in this call implies your consent to this recording as with previous results conference calls i trust that all participants have our results presentation slides page  of which contains our safe harbor statement i would like to point out that it applies throughout this conference call you may also wish to have a look at our latest ir presentation which includes additional information on aixtrons markets and its technologies both presentations and further documents are available on our website this call is not being immediately presented via webcast or any other medium however we will place an audio file of the recording or a transcript on our website at some point after the call i would now like to hand you over to martin goetzeler aixtrons president and ceo for opening remarks martin martin goetzeler thank you guido ladies and gentlemen good day to you all let me welcome you on behalf of aixtrons executive board to the presentation of our  results let me start by making some general comments before going into the numbers i will then hand over to bernd who will talk about his priorities for  in and around our technology portfolio i will close the presentation with a summary of the broader business issues we are addressing and give you a view about aixtrons business prospects in  and beyond in february of last year we gave guidance that revenues for the full year  would be somewhere between € million and € million we expected a significantly stronger revenue generation in the second half of  compared to the first half of  we also stated that we would reach an ebitda ebit net result and free cash flow slightly less compared to  but to remain negative for the full year  we reaffirmed this guidance in our q conference call in august and then in october we narrowed the revenue guidance to € million to € million also adding that order intake for the year would be somewhere between € million to € million revenues came in at  million for the year and our order intake at  million which was the highest since  we also managed to improve profitability year on year and inherently q was our best quarter in five years but as expected and communicated we remained unprofitable over the full year  due to continued high research and development cost we see signs of a stabilization in the led market but more importantly we have seen a significant recovery in both revenues and orders for applications beyond leds and according to our estimate we have become the global leader in mocvd equipment sales last year which is a result of the successful diversification strategy particularly in the various areas of advanced compound semiconductors these semiconductors are key enablers for large technology trends such as electric vehicles energy storage and renewables not to mention autonomous driving big data cloud computing or g mobile networks we believe that aixtron technology will position its customer to participate in the growth opportunities of this major technology trends by using rf laser ir sensor or high frequency and high power device let me now take you through our numbers for the full year  starting with the slide one which gives an overview of revenues equipment orders and order backlog in  we generated eur million in the revenues which was virtually unchanged compared to the previous years eur million net sales equipment sales in  at eur million were higher than  eur million the remainder of revenues mainly eur million representing  of revenues were generated by the sales of spare parts and service on a regional basis the majority of total revenues of  were generated by sales to customers in asia with americas accounting for  and europe with  in terms of product mix optoelectronics excluding leds was the biggest business at eur million representing  of equipment sales this was higher compared to last year evidencing the strength in orders for our core nonled product in fact order intake aixtron totaled eur million last year or  higher than in  the total equipment order backlog of eur million at december   was  higher than the opening backlog at january   of eur million this solid backlog will allow a better production utilization in the first half of  compared to  please also note that we have not revalued this backlog in  as we have assumed the same budget rate of  usdeur turning to the next slide in  we generated a gross profit of eur million which was a considerable improvement on the eur million from the previous year this led to a  percentage point improvement of gross margin to  which is a reflection of higher efficiencies in production and service for the full year  we managed to keep operating costs below our eur million annual target operating cost for the full year at eur million was slightly higher than the previous years eur million and that was slightly below  of revenue the operating loss or ebit for  also still not positive at minus € million improved over the minus € million loss we generated in  that said we did make a profit in q which we generated positive ebit of € million which was driven by strong sales totaling € million and the gross margin of  the net loss for  was reduced and came in at a loss of € million compared to the € million loss we recorded in  with regards to cash flows we did see an improvement in operating cash flow in  from minus € million in  to minus € million in  which was mainly a reflection of the reduced losses within the business the level of the negative cash flow was also impacted by the second installment of the agreed repayment of the previous year received deposits to our chinese customer sanan in q  due to the high shipments and shipment levels at the end of  our receivables increased and our inventories declined a large part of this open goods was cleared this quarter positively impacting cash flow and liquidity in q  the inventory level now reflects much better our order backlog turning to the next slide aixtron continues to have a solid balance sheet with € million in cash and cash equivalents brought down to some € million in cash and € million on deposit with a maturity of more than  days cash levels were down from € million at the end of  which is main reflection of the negative operating cash flow in  aixtron has no financial debt and an equity ratio of  now let me hand you over to bernd who will talk about our technology portfolio bernd schulte thank you martin let me start by saying that the opportunities we see in front of us are manifold thanks to the years of investment we have made in technology and product development there are large global trends such as the move to renewable energy big data and the electrification of automobiles all of which require  semiconductor materials our product portfolio puts us in a very good position to benefit from these market developments which are supported by the stronger interest for our deposition solutions across a wide range of applications however some of our new technologies still require further upfront expenditures and investments for technology development and we are pursuing different options to reduce these upfront costs driving the decision and the execution of these options will be one of our major focuses for this year and could include measures such a joint venturing or other forms of partnering one area im particularly excited about is power electronics we are seeing several of our customers now move from rd and sampling to production of particular interest is the growing demand for so called wide band gap materials such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide which we believe will be increasingly used in everything from mobile phones to electric cars and wind turbines we think this could be a growing opportunity for us another area where we see an increasing potential is for lasers including so called pixels for d imaging high speed data transfer and sensing finally bringing new products in a timely fashion to market is a core focus for me as it does not affect revenues but also costs for this year the goal is to achieve customer quantification of all oled deposition and thin film encapsulation technology we will also continue our efforts focusing on optimizing material costs as well as efficiencies across the whole business with that let me give you back to martin martin goetzeler thanks bernd over the last  months aixtron has been in the media spotlight due to the planned takeover of the company by fujian grand chip we as a management team as well as our supervisory board thought this was a very good deal for not only shareholders but also the future of the company following the withdrawal of the takeover offer on december   due to the inability of fujian grand chip to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals aixtron has been focusing its corporate strategy on ensuring that its technology portfolio is optimally structured and positioned consistent with this aixtron is currently pursuing various options for reducing the upfront cost needed to develop to the companys future technologies these options include as bernd just mentioned looking for suitable partners and intra joint ventures and other alternatives all these measures are intended to enable aixtron to sustainably return to profitability and to achieve positive operating result in  this strategy was laid by the supervisory board in order to commercialize some of the technologies we are developing in a timely fashion we plan higher rd expenses the result is that based on the existing structure we expect to achieve lower ebitda ebit and net result for fiscal year  however as previously discussed we are pursuing the various options in order to reduce upfront cost and to return to sustainable profitability depending on the execution of this above mentioned strategy with its various alternatives and due to the uncertainty of its impact on profit management is currently not in the position to offer guidance on ebitda ebit and net results for fiscal year  management will provide an update on the  earnings outlook as plans materialize regarding free cash flow aixtron expects a further improvement of the figure in  this development is influenced by the significant reimbursement of an advance payment in q  which will not repeat as to revenues and orders based on the existing business structure and the assessment on aixtrons current order situation with the internal budget rate of  usdeur our guidance for both revenues and orders is in the range of eur million to eur million for the full year  we see growth opportunities this year and beyond for our mocvd solutions for the production of widebandgap power devices we also see continued strengths in photonics applications for laser and sensor application in addition we expect a solid contribution from memory and logic applications driven by demand for d nand flash memory applications we remain very much focused on costs margin contributions and allocation of funds as well as continuously reviewing the performance and prospects of aixtrons product portfolio as in previous years we expect that aixtron will not require any external bank debt financing in  finally as this is my last results conference call as ceo of aixtron let me thank the shareholders and analysts for their support employees and the management team for their contributions in the last years and the dedication despite the uncertainties we have gone through im leaving aixtron confident that with the strategy it has adopted the innovative products it can offer to numerous huge future markets the processes it has put in place not to mention the highly qualified group of employees and clear result focus the company is on the road towards sustainable profitability ladies and gentlemen this concludes our  annual results presentation thank you and all the best to all of you bernd and i are available now to answer your questions guido pickert thank you martin and bernd operator please open the line for questions now questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and the first question comes from thomas becker from commerzbank please your line is open now thomas becker thank you a couple of questions with respect to rd spending this year so could you please be a little bit more granular referring to in what part you want to step up rd again is this oled is this power electronics second question would be again also on the rd budget can you quantify what percentage of the rd budget you have spent in last year on the oled project that would be great and with respect to restructuring so what are the plans going forward will you restructure the company will you enter into a new restructuring program or is this left open until new management new ceo arrives martin goetzeler thank you mr becker for the questions first of all on the rd we dont show details on rd cost for the past and for the future but what we said in our annual report is that the share for the future technologies and that includes for example our organic activities our power electronics but also our  on silicon last year exceeded  of our rd spending thats the number which we communicated also in our annual report why would it go up this year or what is the reasoning behind let me  here i can only comment that in some areas we are getting closer to the qualification stage and in order to do so we need to increase our efforts and this definitely on one side its positive on the other side as you also i think implied its challenging and that creates this necessity to find solutions to lower the upfront expenses via partnering or jv or other alternatives and thats what we also communicated this is also not depending on the new or old management as i said to you this was agreed with the supervisory board however we are looking on various options here for partnering also for the structural approaches but i would like to ask for your understanding that in this call we cannot go further into details on that thomas becker with respect to the restructuring to say of the company is there anything baked into the ebitda loss for this year you do not give a quantitative guidance but are there any oneoffs included martin goetzeler are we talking now about last year or this year thomas becker this year going forward basically the question is going forward are there any restructuring programs planned this year martin goetzeler what i can reconfirm is that we are looking at these different options for partnering for possible jvs other alternatives and depending basically on the outcome this will basically  then we will be able to communicate anything on changes in the company but in general we are looking and this is what we also wrote in our communication in our annual report we are focusing as we said to look for partners we are looking for options jvs and other alternatives and thats the current status and i would ask you for your understanding that we cannot give more details on that thomas becker last question from my side is with respect to the end market dynamics in  is it fair to assume that the led business or the market momentum in the classic led market that this has lets call it bottomed out its not saying that it will go up but that it will not go down further is it fair to assume martin goetzeler mr becker bernd will answer that question bernd schulte hello mr becker its bernd schulte yes i think its a fair assumption that the led business has bottomed out in  i think what were hearing from customers is they are running at very high utilization rate also the pricing has stabilized which are good indications that the market looks more positive than  into this year nevertheless we all keep in mind that  was very indiscernible thomas becker additional one with respect to the atomic layer deposition business that you have there is a second customer qualified that to my understanding will this customer which is qualified also asked for volumes this year martin goetzeler we do not expect really volume manufacturing a lot of volume from this customer this year operator next up is mr malte schaumann from warburg research your line is open now malte schaumann just a follow up on your led market comments even in a growing maybe end market but do you really think that aixtron might be able to participate given that bq was getting all the awesome stuff and chinese competitors are increasingly penetrating the existing customers in china or should we rather look then for maybe lets say flat led sales for you martin goetzeler yes the led market certainly you have to differentiate in the gan led market for blue leds and the red led markets for red orange and yellow certainly you are right in your statement that the situation in china particularly in china for blue led has become extremely competitive for the equipment manufacturers also with the increasing level of qualification of chinese competitors and we will only participate in markets where we can get appropriate margins so if the markets continue to develop with a huge margin pressure we will always consider whether we participate specific bids or not differently in the red orange yellow market there we are seeing also a healthy growth which we have not seen for several years and we expect also this year for us a good opportunity here to participate for red orange yellow malte schaumann okay specifically on the optoelectronics market that really came up with a very good sales volume in  about  million i recall that earlier in the year you were not really sure how that market will develop and would have been satisfied with lets say  million  million in sales after the strong year  so what is your current perspective going forward do you think that market might be able to deliver a good growth would you be satisfied with stable sales should we expect a decline in the high level so whats your view on that area bernd schulte certainly  was after many years of relatively low volumes an extremely good year and a very strong increase and that is of course prudent not to assume continuing this business highs however were hearing from the end markets very encouraging signals about introduction of photonics devices into end user product in the consumer electronics namely cellphones et cetera and i think to answer your question directly i think over the midterm i see a very sustainable business how much that influence this year depends on the adoption of these new these two devices in the consumer electronic applications so how fast will the consumer electronics companies ramp these new gadgets into their products malte schaumann okay and that would lead to potential growth in the future or would that just may not that tough but justify the current sales level bernd schulte i think maintaining the current stature would be already good but i think i could even show some growth on the moderate level malte schaumann yes okay martin goetzeler it really depends as we said on the pace of the adaption but i also mentioned in my talk that this is one of the opportunities for this malte schaumann yes okay and maybe your view on the power electronics market how that is going to develop it was not that strong in  is that trend about to turn around do you see customers moving to what kind of volume production martin goetzeler while weve seen customers moving to volume production already however they do not do this buying   systems at once so theyre renting step by step typically buying maybe two or three tools at once thats typically the volume order they place because were growing from a very low level and again here it is about the pace of the penetration of the gallium nitride and silicon carbide devices into the power market which currently is served by silicon devices and it is all about the adoption in the end products it is not a question of if its just a question of when bernd schulte if you look at the distribution quarter by quarter you saw aixtron post a good recovery in the second half malte schaumann thats right and how would you answer the question then of when is there a point in time when you would really expect a surge in sales or is it really a very slowly developing market over the next two three four years martin goetzeler its different than we have seen it in the led space it is a conservative market with a healthy growth and you compete with a very strong competitor thats silicon i think its probably the strongest competitor you can consider and it really depends how fast industry can reduce costs and show the performance as i said its a matter of adoption and how that translate in our true sales that basically the adoption end products will show nevertheless it will be a growing area bernd schulte and mr schaumann that was also one of the items i mentioned in my talk really as an opportunity for growth malte schaumann then two questions left the first is regarding silicon what does it take really to maybe increase sales there maybe not in  but then   that in the indiscernible thats sufficient really to see when customers move forward to see increasing demand for your systems or do you really need to penetrate additional application films for the systems martin goetzeler yes first you have to indiscernible your current accounts and your current films thats important to stay competitive and keep your customers happy and second then as you say you have to qualify your technology with new films and bringing those films you have qualified as one customer those films to other customers thats basically what were doing and yes so for the short term you have probably read about the strong demand in memory devices were seeing a very positive development malte schaumann and anything in the pipeline for new qualifications or why that  multiple speakers martin goetzeler yes there is a pipeline and as i said it is not necessarily a new product a new equipment but is taking equipment what you have and qualify different films malte schaumann okay last question is on oleds once your customer qualifies everything  your deposition equipment everything ready to move to volume production pilot production whatever or what is the surrounding in terms of masks is your chamber then fully qualified at a larger area so how far away then maybe the largest or most substantial revenue contributions from that way as the customer is able or not able then quickly move to larger production martin goetzeler yes with oled you have to go through several steps first as you know we have a different deposition technology than the established technology and the first thing is to prove that feasibility at a customer site which we are making where we have made last year extremely good progress the second step is then going through a medium size just to test this feasibility into a lets say semi production environment and then finally to have a large area system and we are currently in the process of discussion with a leading customer on the second step i mentioned operator the next questioner is gunther hollfelder from baader bank gunther hollfelder first question is a followup on the power semiconductor side widebandgap the sales in  can you talk about the sale of gallium nitride versus silicon carbide is it like  or its more silicon carbide bernd schulte i think it is much more on the gallium nitride i would say  to  is gallium nitride gunther hollfelder and on the led business i think you reported like  sales of your group sales related to led so i was just wondering out of the  how much is related to blue lights to mid power blue light leds bernd schulte i think in the led what we are reporting in leds majority is gallium nitride led so you can rightly assume that this is blue led gunther hollfelder okay and would you differentiate between midpower and high power then on the blue light side martin goetzeler in our led we have both we have gallium nitride and gallium arsenide included there is a misunderstanding but what we also mentioned in our annual report i think is that gallium nitride we have a significant portion of that sale was also related to our sell off of inventory so going forward the focus definitely as bernd explained is on margin business again but also on this red orange yellow and other specialty applications where we see good margin opportunities bernd schulte we do not differentiate in the chip sizes because with the same tool you can you can produce various chip sizes gunther hollfelder okay and you mentioned also vcsel laser technology potential of the opportunity with d sensing for example i was just wondering about the technology manufacturing technology thats used i mean it seems some of the vcsel guys they are using mbe technologies or some mocvd or is it the combination of both or how you see this developing over the next years bernd schulte i think the majority in the market for vcsel is using mocvd and i think we have there are four five different companies in the world who are providing the products and i think we have the good thing is we have a very strong position there and what i mentioned is that the growth over the last three four years was quite limited but in particular last year we saw a very very strong demand and indiscernible potential use or the future use of those devices in consumer electronic applications gunther hollfelder right and then i had a follow up on the silicon business especially in particular about china indiscernible so are you in a position or you already in talks with chinese memory projects so this might be more an opportunity maybe for cvd technology given the process nodes bernd schulte i think you are right that could be an opportunity but we are in quite initial stage here because first you have to also qualify in their technology expansion gunther hollfelder and the last question on oled in particular oled encapsulation i mean you had this follow up payment in  but at the same time it seems that the sales performance disappointed i dont know whether you have any intangible or goodwill on the balance sheet but it seems you decided against an impairment or anything here martin goetzeler this question was related to organic… gunther hollfelder to plasmasi martin goetzeler to plasmasi definitely you are right we have goodwill on our books for plasmasi but this is a business which we are pursuing and we are following we are actually also working closely with customers particularly here we have installed a tool and we are also planning to install further ones over the next couple of quarters so its not that we have huge quantities currently in our forecast but we are pursuing this business and we want to bring it to market maturity im surprised that there wasnt this perception that we did not follow and continue with our thinfilm encapsulation business its true that we didnt mention it in detail like for example our opd activities but its also on a smaller scale and its actually also a little bit earlier than our opd business gunther hollfelder okay i understand many thanks operator and next up is mr karsten iltgen from bankhaus lampe karsten iltgen yes hi thank you one question concerning our rd budget for this year again can you quantify by how much youre planning to increase martin goetzeler again i think there is a little bit of misunderstanding we have said that based on current structure if everything continue as it is that would come out important to understand we are pursuing alternative routes currently in order to find ways to manage and to reduce our upfront investment and thats currently our focus here therefore its difficult currently for these scenarios which we dont know exactly which one will definitely at the end be executed to give you a hint on the potential level of for example rd costs so its somehow also related to definitely to the scenarios or to the executed strategy at the end and there are options as you know and nevertheless and this is i think the message which we gave today is there are some areas where we need to get closer to qualification closer to production level as customers then you have to increase your efforts and that i think we mentioned a couple of times and therefore you can also see where these additional rd costs may come from thank you karsten iltgen but just on a quarterly level are we going to see rd stepping up quarter by quarter until you have found a solution in terms of partnership or jv or anything like this martin goetzeler i think im not sure how much you look also at our employees we are really looking also definitely continue to look into our cost and we will manage projects very tightly so if there are changes in the increases it would be also for external cost thats something which we are managing very tightly but its currently difficult to predict in which quarters can have more but from that perspective i would again ask for understanding that we first work on the options and then come back with a clear indication of what that means for accounting karsten iltgen the main reason i was asking was because i was surprised by your guidance of declining ebit this year and i think the only reason you mentioned is potentially increasing rd i think there is no other reason or is there why earnings may go down this year bernd schulte based on the current structure thats the main reason thats true karsten iltgen the way you just described it rd at the end of the day may not go up this year because you manage it tightly and also youre seeking other options technical difficulty at the end of the day if it is not going to decline this year bernd schulte let me summarize again see what i said is that the increase might come from external order or external performances of suppliers who work for us and do some rd work it will not come from significant increase of people or so thats what i said and thats definitely something which can impact quarterbyquarter but currently its definitely  its too early to say how it will impact which quarter but we are planning something for the entire year and based on this i would also ask you for your understanding that we dont go more into details now how this impacts different quarters karsten iltgen and on a different topic do you have any visibility on order rate in q any sense of where this is heading martin goetzeler we definitely have a forecast for our own purposes but this is not something which we are guiding or we are communicating so i would ask you on this  on my last call here not to change that karsten iltgen but the lower end of your guidance seems to imply an order rate of only € million in q which seems low martin goetzeler i think what we showed on the slide in the presentation is between € million and € million is the guided order intake for the rest of the year in order to fulfill this target how this distributes over different quarters thats something to see your number comes up and this doesnt include definitely spares and services if we are at the lower end of this guidance but its always  its a calculated number from your side and therefore i cannot confirm and i will also not deny it so as we said this is our guidance and we stick to this karsten iltgen one last thing on power semis again the fact that infineon and wolfspeed walked away is it a good or bad thing and have you been supplying wolfspeed with systems in the past bernd schulte we certainly cannot comment on a particular customer we supply to but all i can say that we supply to all the major power semiconductor manufacturers whether that has been good or bad for us thats a very complex question i can only say the future will tell us operator the next question is from juergen wagner from mainfirst bank juergen wagner thank you for taking my question you mentioned in your prepared remarks that trade receivables more than doubled have they all converged to cash and you also mentioned for the full year you expect an improvement in free cash flow could it be that it might even be possible positive depending on the magnitude of the ebit loss and my last question would be does your order guidance include any oled business those are my questions thank you martin goetzeler so obviously receivables i will not go more into detail but we said a large part of the receivable turned in and i will stick to that so it was clear and so its a large part and you can identify what a large part is but you also know our normal level of receivables over the quarters before and that i think could indicate how that might end up then in q again is related to indiscernible so thats regarding the trade receivable the free cash flow thats a good question we have to see how the year develops and also how the year afterwards develops because that implies then how much do we have to do on inventory side so we have besides those receivables which come in the first quarter we have to really see how the business how the volumes develop and thats something which we have to bear in mind and then we will see what the impact can be on our free cash flow but it really is volume driven because if we see a similar situation like this last year and it has a different scenario then if we can also continue basically at a very solid and good level quarter by quarter so thats definitely a different case in terms of cash so besides this trade receivable impact which we definitely also have to watch end of this year we have also the nonrepeated payment to our customers so there you have definitely two impacts which you can consider i think on organic its really important to not forget what bernd said we have this for certain customers particularly in ovpd we have situation that they go to different cycles in order to qualify at the end for production and depending on which area and which level we are the order intake will be very different because as long as we are in qualification and significant preproduction stage also the levels of order intake will be significantly lower so we have some plans also by the way for tfe in our order intake plans however not on a large scale operator and the next question comes from indiscernible unidentified participant good afternoon hi thank you for taking my call just a quick one on the restructuring assets and just reading from the guidance in a statement talking about some options just including just looking for partners or joint ventures as shareholders of this company we were hoping a little bit more detail on this process i mean we really understand the process is ongoing and theres so much you can share with the investor community here but i mean the things i was just trying to understand is how long has this process being going on and are you i mean as the company just working like an advisory firm or some sort of investment bank and just in this process and when you talk about partners and joint ventures what sort of parties are you approaching or you just approaching like i dont know just investment funds or customers or i was just trying to understand who youve been approaching just for your joint ventures and partnerships thank you martin goetzeler yes thank you mr sanol for your question but please understand because to achieve the best desired output for our shareholders we should be very careful what we announce to the public those processes are very very sensitive and we are looking in all various opportunities and all what you mentioned could be possible in the discussions with you but please understand that this is a sensitive process and we should not share more at this point in time operator and next gunther hollfelder from baader bank gunther hollfelder i had a followup question on the gross margin  at the sales level you had a gross much i think around  i was just wondering with your focus on the led side on margins and with an expected lets say flat sales volume in  what is the underlying gross margin assumption you have for  bernd schulte i cannot share that with you mr hollfelder however what i can say and what i would like to say is what i dont know if you remember the difference between q and q in our sales and shipment is enormous and that definitely on one side creates under absorption in one quarter and it definitely is not very very efficient also if you basically add capacity in the other quarter so we expect that because of this and more distributed loading that there are further opportunities in basically improving our under absorption and improving our production cost deterioration gunther hollfelder and is there an impact from the aix r in  a negative impact on the gross margin bernd schulte yes there is but there will be also an impact in  martin goetzeler im not sure if you  just to clarify we have a contribution but its significantly under proportion thats the right wording maybe gunther hollfelder so you would say there is less of a negative impact in  compared to multiple speakers bernd schulte not compared to the two years but from the sale of this equipment operator next up is mr david mulholland from ubs david mulholland i know there is not a lot what you can say around what youre planning but can you at least talk about is this something youre trying to partner with customers or is it something you might consider with in terms of peers and other equipment companies or are you open to all of that and then secondly obviously youve given a fairly clear commitment on the  profitability if it fair to interpret that to say that at some point in  youll draw a line under this if you havent managed to get clear signs that revenue is coming through or some form of partnership you will then cut cost so that you can one way or the other achieve our profitability target martin goetzeler i like your question unfortunately i cannot answer more than bernd already said in his answer and i already said to another question before we really ask for your understanding we believe that if we communicate anything here it could have a negative impact on the activity so we would appreciate if you can support this and ask for your understanding on the other side i can only reconfirm that and thats true for me but also for bernd my successor here that the goal for going for a positive  holds and is now our clear focus guido pickert with this we would like to close todays call thank you for your question and especially for your sustained interest in aixtron despite all ups and downs that we have gone through over the past years please let me direct some  a few words to martin who is leaving us very soon i would personally like to thank you for very intense and trustful collaboration over the past four years we wish you all the best whatever you will do and wherever it will take you and im certain our paths will cross again sometime in the future thank you martin goetzeler thank you guido guido pickert operator operator with this we have come to the end of todays conference call thank you very much for your attention good bye copyright

produced on aixtron equipment to the next link in the value chain namely the electronic device manufacturers the companys customers also include research centers and universities most of the world’s leading electronic device manufacturers produce in asia and consequently the majority of aixtron sales continue to be delivered into this region see also “development of revenues” for a breakdown of revenues by technology and region  competitive positioning aixtron’s main competitor in mocvd applications remains veeco instruments inc usa veeco aixtron also competes with a number of asian manufacturers including taiyo nippon sanso japan additional companies continue to attempt to qualify their own mocvd tools with customers for example jusung engineering co ltd south korea or nuflare technology inc japan are known to have been active in the development of inhouse equipment solutions for the production of leds certain chinese companies such as advanced microfabrication equipment inc or tang optoelectronics equipment shanghai corporation limited are working on the qualification of mocvd equipment supported by respective government initiatives based on the latest published market share research by gartner dataquest forecast semiconductor manufacturing equipment worldwide april  it was estimated that the share of the worldwide mocvd equipment market estimated  total market value usd  million held by aixtron in  was around  particularly due to stronger demand from opto and power electronic applications the market share is expected to increase again significantly in  in the same report the company’s strongest competitor in terms of sales veeco instruments inc had an estimated market share of approximately  viewed in the mid to longterm aixtron continues to target retaining a market leading position in the global mocvd market for cvd mocvd and aldtechnologies for silicon applications aixtron competes with a variety of other equipment companies including lam research inc usa applied materials inc usa tokyo electron ltd japan asm international nv netherlands ips technology south korea jusung engineering co ltd south korea and hitachi kokusai electric co inc japan with the company’s currently available silicon semiconductor manufacturing technologies and thin film processes aixtron is potentially well positioned to offer advanced films for nm node and below for memory and logic integrated circuits ics aixtron technologies enable extremely high precision in depositing very thin material layers and facilitate the consistent coating of complex threedimensional microelectronic device structures moreover they offer new material deposition possibilities for next generation semiconductor devices and in aixtron’s opinion present high development potential for the future however as aixtron only addresses a specific niche market share of the total silicon semiconductor market is not considered meaningful at this point in time for emerging organic semiconductor applications aixtron competes with established manufacturers such as ulvac inc japan tokki corporation japan snu precision south korea sunic system south korea and a number of other smaller companies while these competitors use the vacuum thermal evaporation vte or polymer technologies to produce oleds aixtron offers oled manufacturers its own highly innovative ovpd® and pvpd® large area deposition technologies in aixtron’s opinion due to a perceived superior process technology enabling a reduction of oled manufacturing costs these technologies have the potential to compete successfully with vte and polymer technologies especially in the field of large area displays aixtron is positioning itself as an alternative deposition system supplier for next generation oleds and large area deposition applications such as displays future lighting solar cells and other electronic oled applications for thin film encapsulation applications aixtron’s pecvd technology competes with manufacturers such as ulvac inc japan snu precision south korea applied materials inc usa and a number of other smaller companies applying pecvd or ald technology as aixtron’s organic material deposition and encapsulation technologies as well as most customer applications are still in the market entry phase organic semiconductor market share information is considered not meaningful at this point in time  financial and nonfinancial performance indicators the executive board has implemented dedicated control systems and procedures to manage monitor analyze and document company risks and opportunities including a key performance indicator system addressing relevant product groups with a primary focus on the “market” “finance” and “technology development” control areas in the “market” control area using third party reports and direct customer dialog aixtron pursues a customer and marketled product development strategy through the careful examination of market trends and customer requirements the objective of this strategy is to ensure the timely market availability of new and appropriately competitive product generations in line with customer requirements in the “finance” control area the executive board uses a range of internal and external financial and nonfinancial performance indicators with particular focus on order intake revenues margin contributions ebit ebitda and free cash flow the objective of these controls is to ensure that profitable revenue growth is matched with cost and asset efficiency to achieve sustainable value generation in the “technology development” control area the executive board again uses a range of performance indicators to evaluate the progress of key research and development projects the management regularly reviews compliance with project plans predefined targets and quality gates such as timelines quality cost and margin targets following the release of new products for example the management monitors closely the development of the respective revenues and related returns the objective of this review process is to ensure that ongoing technological developments retain not only the necessary level of technological standards but also commercial competitiveness throughout the life of the product  government regulation due to the nature of aixtron’s products the shipment of some products to customers in certain countries requires the company to obtain an export license from statutory authorities in germany the uk and the us including for example the bundesamt für wirtschaft und ausfuhrkontrolle bafa in germany the department for international trade in the uk as well as the department of state and the department of commerce in the us research and development activities as well as the manufacturing and demonstration of the company’s products involve the use of potentially harmful chemical and hazardous materials and radioactive compounds and as a result aixtron is subject to stringent environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations such as industrial safety regulations the ordinance on hazardous substances labor protection laws or the workplaces ordinance the company is also subject to other regulations for example the provisions of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act relating to the maintenance of books and records and antibribery controls aixtron has an anticorruption guideline in place which is mandatory for every aixtron employee  report on economic position  global economy as a producer of capital goods aixtron could be affected by the global economic development as far as it could have an effect on its own supply chain and cost of sales as well as on its customers sales projections and therefore also on their investment behavior global economic development remained subdued throughout the year  with growth in the advanced economies especially the united states slowing down significantly and the unexpected brexit vote adding another remarkable risk to future growth perspectives in its world economic outlook update published january   the international monetary fund imf projected global growth in  slightly below the previous years level at an estimated    with growth in the advanced economies for  being forecast at    and in the emerging and developing countries at    however this global economic environment had no specific effects on aixtrons business development in fiscal year  as aixtron is more dependent on innovationdriven industry business cycles such as the progressing technology changes in semiconductor markets growth figures from the us which fell short of expectations and a correspondingly cautious monetary policy by the federal reserve saw a slightly weakening us dollar throughout most of the year  only towards the end of the year triggered by a new interest rate increase the us dollar surged to a yearhigh of  usdeur the yearend exchange rate on december   was  usdeur compared to  usdeur an increase of approximately  the average exchange rate used by aixtron to translate income and expenses denominated in us dollars in fiscal year  was  usdeur q  usdeur q  usdeur q  usdeur q  usdeur which was stable compared to the previous year   usdeur aixtron management continues to carefully monitor the developments of the global economy and the financial markets and regularly examines what can potentially be done to mitigate negative exogenous effects on aixtron’s business  the semiconductor equipment market the total ald market of which

reporting is the core component of aixtron’s strategic risk and opportunity management in different areas of the company risk representatives responsible for risk reporting have been appointed as an international technology company aixtron is engaged in business operations worldwide and is consequently exposed to a variety of risks the company may also benefit from the opportunities related to the risks it is exposed to in order to minimize risks aixtron established an enterprise risk management system that is continuously being adapted to the evolving business environment and business processes to minimize risks and to capitalize on opportunities aixtron pursues a forward looking product strategy by observing current and identifying anticipated future market trends and customer requirements and continuously striving to develop and maintain unique selling propositions related to its technology this product strategy incorporates measures for honing the company’s profile in its target market for building new partnerships and alliances as well as for training third parties engaged to market sell and deploy aixtron products in fiscal year  the company continued to monitor market trends and the activities of its competitors and evaluated market analyses and forecasts produced by leading market research companies project management and quality assurance systems are routinely deployed in all areas of product development where risk awareness and evaluation play a crucial role therefore aixtron uses systems for project management and quality control in this area these measures are accompanied by a training and development program for managers and specialist employees and by procedures to maintain and expand the necessary infrastructure when required aixtron deploys accounting control and forecasting systems for the global monitoring and management of core enterprise information regular reporting processes ensure that information on business and market trends is regularly updated in addition to annual budget planning realtime forecasts are used to continuously review and update the company’s plans as part of the company’s financial control procedures variances between actual and budget figures are continuously identified and analyzed and serve as basis for corrective measures as necessary furthermore the executive board analyzes the company’s net assets financial position and results of operations on a continuous basis the frequent exchange of knowledge and experiences at all hierarchy levels worldwide ensures the constant and efficient flow of information as well as rapid decisionmaking the executive board informs and includes where required the supervisory board in all key decisions at least once every quarter and normally at shorter intervals the audit committee of the supervisory board meets regularly with the executive board to discuss analyze and monitor financial issues arising in the course of the company’s business activities internal guidelines governing risk management insider trading and the disclosure of share price sensitive information ensure compliance with all applicable laws and the implementation of the corporate governance recommendations specified in the german corporate governance code the company’s supervisory board is informed about the status plausibility and further development of the risk management system by the executive board on an ongoing basis in addition it is the company’s auditor’s duty to inform the supervisory board about their audit of the risk management early warning system  internal control over financial reporting aixtron’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control and risk management and for reviewing its continuing effectiveness such processes are designed to manage risks and to provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss management ensures to the extent possible that the system of internal procedures and controls is appropriate to the nature and scale of the company’s activities and that appropriate processes and controls are in place to effectively manage and mitigate strategic operational financial and other risks facing the company this also includes the centrally monitored compliance to group wide accounting guidelines and valuation principles in financial reporting the company has an ongoing process of identifying evaluating and managing risk management and audit committee confirm that necessary actions are being undertaken to eliminate perceived failings or weaknesses identified from these reviews based on the company’s assessment management has concluded that aixtron’s internal control and risk management was effective as of december   to provide reasonable assurance that the system of internal procedures and controls are appropriate and effective aixtron’s management reviewed the results of management’s assessment jointly with the audit committee of aixtron’s supervisory board  single risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on aixtron’s results of operations financial position net assets liquidity cash flows the market price of its shares and the actual outcome of matters that the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report refer to the risks described below are not the only ones the company faces there may be additional risks aixtron is currently unaware of and risks that are common to most companies including political risks the risk of force majeure and other unforeseeable events there may also be risks that aixtron now believes are immaterial but which also may ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company for additional information regarding forwardlooking statements see ‘‘forwardlooking statements’’ included in this annual report  currency exchange risks and other financial risks the company’s operations are conducted by entities in many countries and a substantial portion of its sales and production costs are denominated in currencies other than the euro as a result fluctuations between the value of the euro and other major currencies may affect the company’s business as well as the business of aixtron’s customers and suppliers in addition changes in monetary or other policies including as a result of the regionally unbalanced economic development as well as geopolitical conflicts would also likely affect foreign currency exchange rates in order to manage foreign exchange risks the company routinely monitors if and to what extent currency hedging instruments should be used and management actively manages the currency risk of balance sheet items by pursuing an active balancing of assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies as of december  no hedging contracts were in place aixtron anticipates that international revenues including revenues from asia will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues as a result a significant portion of the company’s revenues will be subject to risks of dealing with customers on a global scale these risks include changes in foreign laws or regulations tariffs or trade barriers military confrontations political or economic instabilities managing foreign subsidiary or distributor operations aixtron conducts business with a large number of customers worldwide and is therefore exposed to the risk of bad debt losses this potential risk is significantly reduced by down payments letters of credit or bank guarantees further information on this subject is contained in section  “trade receivables and other current assets” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for  because aixtron operates in a number of countries throughout the world its operating income is subject to taxation in differing jurisdictions and at differing tax rates aixtron seeks to organize its affairs in a tax efficient and balanced manner taking into account the applicable regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which aixtron operates may audit the company’s tax returns and may disagree with the positions taken in those returns which could cause aixtron to incur significant legal expenses and divert the company’s management’s attention from the operation of its business an adverse outcome resulting from any settlement or future examination of aixtron’s tax returns may subject the company to additional tax liabilities and may adversely affect its effective tax rate an outside audit is currently being performed by the german tax authorities which may result in supplementary tax payments aixtron regularly assesses the financial strength of its banking partners and will take appropriate measures should it detect any significant deterioration or risk the company’s need for cash is targeted to be generally provided for through operating cash flows and to a smaller extent through grants the company currently commands adequate cash and cash equivalents to meet business needs and carries no debt however should low market demand and resulting low revenue levels persist then this may significantly harm operating results cash flows as well as cash reserves in the future if aixtron cannot quickly and appropriately realign its business structure in line with adverse conditions the need for additional external funding may arise the availability of equity based funding might be negatively influenced by a low share price if it is not possible to acquire sufficient funding aixtron could be forced to delay or reduce operations a share price decline may also result in the necessity of an impairment of assets primarily goodwill please refer to note  to the company’s consolidated financial statements “intangible assets” for more information aixtron’s future budgets for operating expenses capital expenditures operating leases and service contracts are based upon the company’s assumptions as to the anticipated market acceptance of its products and other factors significant deviations of these assumption could have material adverse effects on the company  companyspecific risks market and competition risks persistently subdued global economic development or currency fluctuations might adversely affect the business of aixtron’s customers and suppliers and thus also harm aixtrons business development the semiconductor industries can be cyclical and thus highly volatile and unpredictable although semiconductors are used in many different products the markets for those products are interrelated to various degrees the industry has historically experienced sudden changes in supply and demand for semiconductors the timing length and severity of these industry cycles are difficult to predict the cyclical nature of aixtron’s operations could be influenced and amplified by changes in economic and political conditions as a result and in addition persistently subdued market demand for aixtron’s manufacturing equipment could lead to low order intake and resulting revenue levels aixtron must be able to react quickly to these changes in supply and demand the described cyclical nature of aixtron’s customers or supply and demand in the addressed markets with its respective impact on market demand and business operations for aixtron may adversely affect aixtron’s results of operations financial position net assets and cash flows during periods of declining or low demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment aixtron needs to be able to quickly and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions to manage its inventory levels to reduce the possibility of future inventory writedowns resulting from obsolescence because a certain proportion of aixtron’s costs are fixed in the near term the company’s ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls is limited during periods of rapid growth aixtron’s business must be able to acquire andor develop sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and to attract hire assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people aixtron’s business operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes and changes in the competitive environment if the company does not develop new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements it may not be able to compete successfully in this market aixtron’s competitive advantage and future success depend on its ability to successfully develop new products and technologies as well as new markets for its products and services they also depend on the introduction of new products to the marketplace in a timely manner as well as the qualification of new products with its customers and the commencement and adjustment of production to meet customer demands in addition aixtron’s competitors may have greater resources than aixtron or may otherwise be better suited to compete in the company’s markets in order to compete aixtron must attract retain and permanently motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to the company’s business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to attract retain and motivate qualified employees aixtron relies heavily on paying cash compensations at marketcompetitive rates and offering additional incentives and bonus payments if such cash payments cease to be viewed as a valuable benefit by the company’s key employees the company’s ability to attract retain and motivate its employees could be adversely impacted which could negatively affect its results of operations andor require aixtron to increase the amount it expends on cash and other forms of compensation aixtron’s customer base has been in the past and may in the future be highly concentrated orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for and likely will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company’s revenues this may lead to economic setbacks should a principal customer discontinue its relationship with aixtron or this may lead to customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to the company aixtron’s ability to increase revenues in the future will also depend upon its ability to obtain new orders from existing or new customers in addition because a relatively small number of large manufacturers many of whom are aixtron’s customers dominate the industries in which they operate it may be especially difficult for the company to replace these customers if it loses their business a large portion of orders in aixtron’s order backlog are orders from its principal customers aixtron often faces lengthy sales and qualification cycles for its products and customer contracts regularly include demanding technical or other commercial hurdles which have to be met aixtron’s products are being tested to determine whether they meet customer or industry specifications during such a qualification period aixtron invests significant resources and dedicates substantial production capacity to the manufacture of these new products prior to any commitment to purchase by the prospective customer and without generating meaningful revenues from the qualification process therefore in many cases the company must invest significant time and funds with no assurance that these efforts or expenditures will result in revenues revenues from aixtron’s systems primarily depend upon the decision of a prospective customer to invest in or upgrade its manufacturing capabilities which typically involves a significant capital commitment by the customer aixtron often experiences delays in obtaining system orders while customers evaluate and receive internal commercial or technical approvals for the purchase of these systems the company’s customers may experience difficulties in acquiring manufacturing facilities or maintaining a sufficient flow of raw materials and components or accessing sufficient cash funding to achieve their increased manufacturing output should this occur customers could request to delay aixtron system shipments these delays may include the time necessary to plan design or complete a new or expanded semiconductor fabrication facility in addition the company’s customers could accelerate or delay expenditures or they could cancel or reschedule their orders as a result aixtron must be able to react quickly to these changes in supply and demand aixtron therefore may increase production in anticipation of customer orders that may not materialize failure to quickly align the company’s cost structure and manufacturing capabilities with industry fluctuations could lead to significant losses or a failure to capitalize on increased demand opportunities to partly protect aixtron from negative effects of the cyclicality of the semiconductor markets aixtron outsources a large part of its production to third party suppliers in order to manufacture and obtain many critical components many of these components are only available from a limited number of suppliers or in some cases even a single supplier to minimize risks in this area the company generally dual sources the supply of procured key items because of the cost of aixtron’s systems the company generally aims to keep its inventories at minimum levels aixtron generally does not have longterm supply agreements with many of its suppliers consequently the company could experience significant price increases andor may not be able to obtain replacement components in a timely manner or at all in addition aixtron is dependent on a limited number of suppliers because aixtron often does not account for a significant part of its suppliers’ business the company may not have access to sufficient capacity from these suppliers in periods of high demand in addition aixtron risks having important suppliers terminate product lines change business focus or even go out of business if aixtron were required to change any of its suppliers it would be required to requalify each new supplier aixtron estimates that it could take approximately six to eighteen months to replace suppliers of certain critical components used in its systems in addition in connection with thirdparty manufacturing activities it is possible that aixtron may encounter unforeseen technical complexities that it may be unable to resolve or that the resolution of such complexities may lead to delays in the implementation of these thirdparty manufacturing activities aixtron invests significantly into rd and aixtron’s future success depends highly on its ability to translate the knowledge gained from rd into commercial success should this fail or be delayed then this could result in unplanned higher costs or the necessity to write down assets aixtron’s competitors may have greater resources than aixtron or may otherwise be better suited to compete in the company’s markets and aixtron’s failure to compete successfully with these companies would seriously affect its business as a result of doing business internationally aixtron must comply with different laws and regulations new or changed domestic or foreign laws and regulations may be imposed on aixtron aixtron is also subject to export control and economic sanctions laws which prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of aixtron products by or in decreased ability to export or sell products to existing or potential customers with international operations any actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws and regulations or any decreased use of aixtron products or limitation on the ability to export or sell products may have a material adverse effect on aixtron’s business financial condition results of operations and reputation aixtron’s operating results may fluctuate significantly which may cause the market price of its ordinary shares to increase or decrease significantly the timing of an order often depends on the capital expenditure budget cycle of customers in addition the time it takes the company to build a product to customer specifications which the company refers to as the build cycle typically ranges from three to nine months followed in certain cases by a period of customer acceptance during which the customer evaluates the performance of aixtron’s system and may potentially reject such system as a result of the build cycle and evaluation periods the period between a customer’s initial purchase decision and revenue recognition on an order often varies widely and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in operating results aixtron’s leases may be terminated or the company may be unable to renew our leases on acceptable terms if aixtron decides to relocate aixtron may incur additional costs if aixtron terminates a lease aixtron’s businesses use potentially harmful chemicals and other hazardous materials aixtron is subject to environmental risks and regulations which could negatively affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition aixtron is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions as it may undertake acquisitions of or significant investments in other businesses with complementary products services or technologies acquisitions or other significant investments may bear risks such as difficulties in integration of the acquired company lack of synergies loss of key employees or customers diversion of management’s attention from daily operations impairment of acquired assets worsethanexpected performance of acquired companies increased project related and administrative expenses or declining share price aixtron may also be subject of being acquired with or without the consent of management aixtron may divest the business as a whole or parts of its business in addition to some of the acquisition related risks divestures could bear the risk of losses on disposal information security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and other related cyber security issues could disrupt aixtron’s internal operations damage the company’s brand and reputation or otherwise harm its business and may incur significant costs to minimize mitigate or protect against those risks cyber security breaches could compromise the security of aixtron’s data and infrastructure thereby exposing such information to unauthorized access by third parties aixtron currently is was or may become involved in claims pending or threatened litigation or other legal proceedings aixtron cannot exclude the possibility of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties or of itself being held liable for allegedly infringing upon third party intellectual property rights or to breach applicable securities or other laws the outcome of current pending and threatened litigation proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty decisions of courts or other authorities as well as settlements may cause significant expenses aixtron may also have to allocate significant management time and attention while in all cases the company may not be able to prevail in its legal actions for more details to the previously mentioned litigation risk please refer to “ report on postbalance sheet date events” included in this report aixtron voluntarily delisted its adss from nasdaq effective january   and terminated its adr program effective february   on january   the company filed a certification on form f with the sec to deregister under the sec rules aixtron’s sec reporting obligations under the exchange act were immediately suspended upon the filing of the form f and the deregistration is expected to become effective  days after the filing of the form f which would be on or about april   delisting deregistration and suspending its sec reporting obligations in the us could negatively affect the liquidity and trading prices of its outstanding adss and ordinary shares  overall statement to the risk situation neither within fiscal year  nor at the time of writing has the executive board identified any risks that could jeopardize the company’s continued existence  report on expected developments  future market environment and opportunities in their world economic outlook update as of january  the imf forecasts global growth to increase to  in  and  in  global growth is expected to be supported by economic activity to pick up in pace especially in emerging market and developing economies at this point in time aixtron does not expect any significant influence on its business development from the global economic environment however the possibility of further setbacks to the global economy cannot be ruled out gartner dataquest estimated forecast semiconductor manufacturing equipment worldwide q update december  that semiconductor

capacity driven by higher demand for optoelectronic applications and wide band gap devices for power management according to gartner the total silicon power transistor market is expected to grow from usd  billion to  billion between  and  gartner april  according to a study from ihs the market for sic and gan power electronics devices which can be produced using aixtron equipment is estimated to generate a volume of usd  billion by  estimates of an accessible market size for the respective production equipment are based on internal assessments and are therefore not meaningful at this point in time aixtron management believes that the markets aixtron addresses with its organic large area ovpd and pvpd deposition technologies as well as with its pecvd thin film encapsulation technology bear growth potential in the mid to longterm driven by increasing demand for oled displays the market volume for oled devices including oled tvs are expected by ihs in its oled shipment and forecast report to grow from approximately usd  billion in  to approximately usd  billion in  oled tv panel shipments are expected to increase from  million shipped units in  to  million shipped units in  display supply chain consultants january  however as with all emerging technologies there is an element of risk associated with the timing of aixtron’s technology being adopted by the market aixtron’s pecvd technology for the production of carbon nanostructures continues to contribute positively to total revenues but due to its rd focus the revenue volumes are comparably low and are expected to remain on low levels in the short term estimates of an accessible oled or carbon nanostructure equipment market size are based on internal assessments and are therefore not disclosed the total ald market of which aixtron addresses only a specific niche with its system technologies was estimated by gartner dataquest in its latest forecast of december  forecast semiconductor manufacturing equipment worldwide q update to be valued at usd  million for  e usd  million e usd  million influenced by the production qualification of aixtrons qxp tool by two major asian memory chip manufacturers and by solid demand for nandflash memory devices aixtron sees further growth potential with this technology in all of its addressed markets aixtron expects future growth as aixtron technologies to manufacture semiconductor devices are the enabling technologies for emerging megatrends such as big data cloud computing g mobile networks electric vehicles autonomous driving or highly efficient energy storage  expected results of operations and financial position following the termination of the planned takeover transaction by a chinese investor in december  aixtron now is focusing on the optimal structure of its technology portfolio as part of its corporate strategy against this background aixtron is currently pursuing different options in order to successfully reduce required upfront expenses for the development of future technologies these options include looking for partners joint ventures or other alternatives all these measures are targeted to enable a sustainable return to profitability and to report a positive ebit for full year  for memory and logic applications management expects a significant contribution again in  due to solid growth of nandflash memory applications however demand development for production equipment for dram memory applications is uncertain due to a cautious investment behavior in the dram end markets investments for tfos will be aligned with customers’ requirements management sees near to midterm potential for mocvd equipment from a continuing penetration of wide band gap gan and sicbased power devices in terms of mocvd equipment for the manufacturing of optoelectronic devices such as redorangeyellow and specialty leds as well as photonics for lasers and sensor applications management expects an improving demand based on the existing business structure and the assessment on aixtron’s current order situation with the internal budget rate of usdeur  management expects for fiscal year  to achieve revenues and an order intake between eur  million and  million due to planned additional upfront expenses for development of future technologies and based on the existing structure aixtron expects to achieve lower ebitda ebit and net result for fiscal year  as previously discussed aixtron is pursuing the options mentioned above in order to return to sustainable profitability depending on the execution of above mentioned strategy with its various options and due to the uncertainty of its impact on profit management is currently not in the position to offer guidance on ebitda ebit and net result for fiscal year  management will provide an update on the  earnings outlook as the above mentioned plans materialize influenced by the significant reimbursement of an advance payment in q which will not repeat aixtron expects a further improvement of the free cash flow in  in addition to above mentioned activities management will continue to focus on costs margin contributions and the allocation of funds and will continuously review the performance and prospects of the companies’ product portfolio as in previous years management expects that the company does not require any external bank debt financing in  furthermore the company will retain its strong equity base also in the foreseeable future  overall statement on the future development due to the companies’ proven ability to develop and
