patented electron bombarded active pixel sensor ebaps® is the core of our extreme lowlight products for the defense industry this proprietary technology enables the ongoing development of our advanced digital sensors and systems for applications including military night vision weapon sights surveillance and precision targeting intevac’s ebaps technology is based on a iiiv semiconductor photocathode in proximityfocus with a high resolution backsidethinned cmos chip anode the electrons emitted by the photocathode are directly injected in the electron bombarded mode into the cmos anode where the electrons are collected amplified and readout to produce digital video directly out of the sensor light spectrum addressed by ebaps delivering superior performance visible  nearinfrared selectable by photocathode choice resolution  frame rate  low power selectable by silicon sensor choice the ebaps sensor achieves stateoftheart night vision performance in a compact lightweight low power low cost package by eliminating the complex components associated with traditional image intensifier assemblies how the di² sensor works photons are absorbed by photocathode allowing electrons to be emitted electrons are accelerated by high voltage electrons are collected on megapixel cmos silicon sensor digital output isie sensor note this product is under the export control of the office of defense
