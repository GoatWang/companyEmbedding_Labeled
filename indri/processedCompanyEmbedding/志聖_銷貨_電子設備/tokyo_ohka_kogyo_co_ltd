high dencity packages field tok supports the miniaturization of semiconductors and other devices through photoresists for plating and photosensitive permanent film used in highdensity integration japanese pradvanced high dencity packages field advanced high dencity packages field toks semiconductor packaging field we are focused on developing photoresists for plating to address redistribution layers rdls aimed at ultrasmall targets and continuous electrolytic plating we are also focused on developing photoresists for plating that target the formation of μbumps tall copper pillars and stud gold bumps the advantages of positive photoresists include not only their proven track record by customers and their resolution and rectangularity but also their detachability and resistance to electrolytic plating solution processes flexibility and resistance to plating chemicals compared with dry film photoresists and negative photoresists going forward tok will continue devoting efforts to helping improve the yields of our customers subsidiaries this is the tokyo ohka kogyo tok special website for the highdensity integration field we are focused on developing photoresists for plating

offering tok’s unique packaging  mems manufacturing technologies in terms of both materials and equipment that widely support the manufacturing of lighter thinner and more compact mobile devices and electronic components with high functionality in addition to being equipped with highly sophisticated functions mobile devices are rapidly becoming lighter thinner and more compact in a pace much faster than we could have imagined packaging and mems manufacturing technologies play an extremely important role for such advancement we have developed and commercialized optimal photoresists and processing equipment for a range of packaging processes including the newest technologies photoresists for packaging are available for a wide range of production technologies including waferlevel csp sip rdl tab and cof in the field of processing equipment we have developed unique technologies for thick film processing such as a coating machine that can form thick films at  μm with excellent cd uniformity mems manufacuturing technology is widely used for the miniaturization and higher functionality of electronic components this technology is an integrated combination of electricity machinery light and materials and expected to be an integral part of fundamental technologies necessary for the development of electronic components in fact it has already been employed by some electronic components and introduced to manufacturing technologies of image sensors inkjet nozzles and highfrequency wave devices we have commercialized thickfilm permanent photoresists for mems and developed a nonspin coater that can form thick films capable of highly uniform photoresist coating at a  μm level with a single application and a developing machine for thick films we offer high quality most advanced and most effective processing technologies in the mems field as well thus widely supporting the miniaturization of electronic components in terms of both materials and equipment glossary positive photoresist when image developing process is carried out after exposure the unexposed part remains as a pattern negative photoresist when image developing process is carried out after exposure the exposed part remains as a pattern wafer level csp a general term for packages that are as small as or a little larger than the chip size of semiconductor photoresist film formation a liquid photoresist film is formed by spin coat spray coat curtain coat or slit coat methods the dry film resist is formed on a substrate by lamination chemicallyamplified photoresist an acid with a catalytic action is generated when a photochemical reaction is used the functional group in the resist polymer reacts with the acid as a catalyst in the baking process carried out after exposure and a pattern is formed with the change in physical properties naphthoquinone photoresist a general term for a dicarbonyl compound that has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring of an aromatic compound quinone when the aromatic ring of the quinone is a naphthalene ring it is called naphthoquinone and a pattern is formed with the photoreaction of this naphthoquinone wafer thinning a wafer is thinned
