engineering corporation our quiet clean pressing equipment realizes downsizing weight reduction and low noise and vibration we are an rd company dedicated to automated laborsaving equipment precision molds and precision machining we have an integrated production system that covers from equipment and mold design to programming adjustment and delivery this reduces the time required for design and productization our internally developed soft press has been highly evaluated for its contribution to improving quality and work environments in semiconductor plants for this we received the science and technology agency’s directorgeneral’s award we have also changed conventional cornerpost dies by making the usual cylindershaped guide post into a square shape to enhance resistance to pressure and improve machining precision ・ various kinds of automated assembly equipment product description our soft press is an optimal device for cutting molding chalking and pressfitting thin metal sheets it is driven by a servomotor and controlled by a microcomputer and its mechanical sections are oilfilled it has excellent silencing properties low noise and low vibration this press equipment works gently on the product each manufacturing process in our buildingblock system is modularized to easily configure automated and integrated production facilities for multiple production processes authorizationcertification obtained iso  february  and iso   intellectual property soft press is already patented in japan korea taiwan us and europe はこちら square guide post molds product description guide posts are mechanical parts that connect upper and lower molds the posts used in ordinary molds are cylindershaped but our molds use square guide posts these square posts use cylindershaped roller bearings rather than the spherical bearings used in round posts this significantly enhances the rigidity of the post and stabilizes the machining accuracy the resulting pressing becomes more resistant to unbalanced loads within the mold and more stable in addition the blade is stabilized without swaying this prevents the cutting tool from wearing off which prolongs its service life

laser beam machines and many resin molding presses we can complete planning design prototype manufacturing evaluation and productization phases in a short period of time business description our company deals with machining mold dies we are mainly involved in tf processing lead processing in the postprocess assembly phase for semiconductors and related pressing marking and inspectionsorting equipment we recently expanded our sales channels to enter the automobile industry assembling equipment for invehicle electronic parts by making use of our track record in the field of semiconductor assembly our business also covers other fields such as solar power generation equipment real estate and home use elevators industry manufacturing strength of productstechnologies soft press conventional presses are hydraulically operated so they need to be large and massive they also produce a great deal of noise and vibration while constantly consuming electricity for operating the hydraulic pump soft press is a quiet clean press facility driven by a servomotor which makes it small and lightweight without producing much noise or vibration its contribution to enhancing product quality and the work environment in semiconductor plants has been highly recognized for this we received the science and technology agency’s directorgeneral’s award corner post molds connecting guide posts between the upper and lower sides of a mold are usually cylindershaped we made these into square poles to enhance their resistance to pressure and to enhance machining precision this prolongs the service life of the cutting tool which reduces the mold maintenance cost representatives message our company started as a mold manufacturer but we are now group of experts that can develop and manufacture many things inhouse this includes running gears for molds microcomputer electric devices and servo presses in addition to other component technologies for automatic machines our sales department has been specialized in the semiconductor industry we will now modify the development and manufacturing departments to quickly capture and cultivate emerging needs to swiftly adapt to the changing times company structure for market developmentoverseas expansion our company has had dealings with major domestic household electrical appliance manufacturers and auto parts makers and these are still continuing our stocks are listed so we have an internal control system in place to conduct audits our workflow is well established from the start of transactions to the delivery phase we
