business plan products and services the fourth in a comprehensive series to help you craft the perfect business plan for your startup by jeff haden jeff haden is a ghostwriter speaker linkedin influencer and contributing editor to inc jeffhaden contributing editor incjeffhaden  comments credit getty images in the products and services section of your business plan you will clearly describeyepthe products and services your business will provide keep in mind that highly detailed or technical descriptions are not necessary and definitely not recommended use simple terms and avoid industry buzzwords so your readers can easily understand on the other hand describing how the companys products and services will differ from the competition is critical so is describing why your products and services are needed if no market currently exists for example before there was federal express overnight delivery was a niche business served by small companies fedex had to define the opportunity for a new largescale service and justify why customers neededand would actually usethat service patents copyrights and trademarks you own or have applied for should also be listed in this section depending on the nature of your business your products and services section could be very long or relatively short if your business is productfocused you will want to spend more time describing those products if you plan to sell a commodity item and the key to your success lies in say competitive pricing you probably dont need to provide significant product detail or if you plan to sell a commodity readily available in a variety of outlets the key to your business may not be the commodity itself but your ability to market in a more costeffective way than your competition but if youre creating a new product or service make sure you thoroughly explain the nature of the product its uses and its value etcotherwise your readers will not have enough information to evaluate your business key questions to answer are products or services in development or existing and on the market what is the timeline for bringing new products and services to market what makes your products or services different are there competitive advantages compared with offerings from other competitors are there competitive disadvantages you will need to overcome and if so how is price an issue will your operating costs be low enough to allow a reasonable profit margin how will you acquire your products are you the manufacturer do you assemble products using components provided by others do you purchase products from suppliers or wholesalers if your business takes off is a steady supply of products available in the cycling rental business example weve been using products and services could be a relatively simple section to complete or it could be fairly involved it depends on the nature of the products the company plans to rent to customers if blue mountain cycling rentals plans to market itself as a provider of highend bikes describing those bikesand the sources for those bikesis important since highend cycling rentals is intended to be a market differentiation if the company plans to be the lowcost provider then describing specific brands of equipment is probably not necessary also keep in mind that if a supplier runs out of capacityor goes out of business altogetheryou may not have a sufficient supply to meet your demand plan to set up multiple vendor or supplier relationships and describe those relationships fully  remember the primary goal of your business plan is to convince you that the business is viableand to create a road map for you to follow the products and services section for our cycling rental business could start something like this  product description blue mountain cycle rentals will provide a comprehensive line of bicycles and cycling equipment for all ages and levels of ability since the typical customer seeks mediumquality equipment and excellent services at competitive prices we will focus on providing brands like trek bikes shimano footwear and giro helmets these manufacturers have a widespread reputation as mid to highlevel quality unlike equipment typically found in the rental market the following is a breakdown of anticipated rental price points per day and per week bicycle   helmet   etc notes customers can extend the rental term online without visiting the store a grace period of two hours will be applied to all rentals customers who return equipment within that twohour period will not be charged an additional fee competition blue mountain cycle rentals will have clear advantages over its primary competitors the bike shops located in harrisonburg virginia newer equipment inventory with higher perceived quality price points  percent below the competition online renewals offering greater convenience a liberal return grace period that will reinforce our reputation as a customerfriendly rental experience future products expansion will allow us to move product offerings into new equipment sales we will also explore maintenance and fitting services leveraging our existing maintenance staff to provide valueadded services at a premium price and so on  when you draft your products and services section think of your reader as a person who knows little to nothing about your business be clear and to the point think of it this way the products and services section answers the what question for your business make sure you fully understand the what factor you may run the business but your products and services are its lifeblood now lets take a look at the next major section of your business plan the market opportunities more in this series how to write a great business plan key concepts how to
