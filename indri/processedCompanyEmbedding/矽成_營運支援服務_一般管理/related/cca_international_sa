free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for a broader coverage including national account systems used outside of the us see national accounts the national income and product accounts nipa are part of the national accounts of the united states they are produced by the bureau of economic analysis of the department of commerce they are one of the main sources of data on general economic activity in the united states they use doubleentry accounting to report the monetary value and sources of output produced in the country and the distribution of incomes that production generates data are available at the national and industry levels seven summary accounts are published as well as a much larger number of more specific accounts the first summary account shows gross domestic product gdp and its major components the table summarizes national income on the left debit revenue side and national product on the right credit expense side of a twocolumn accounting report thus the left side gives gdp by the income method and the right side gives gdp by the expenditure method the gdp is given on the bottom line of both sides of the report gdp must have the same value on both sides of the account this is because income and expenditure are defined in a way that forces them to be equal see accounting identity we show the  table later in this article we present the left side first for convenient screen display the us report updated quarterly is available in several forms including interactive from links on the bureau of economic analysis bea nipa  page other countries report based on their own adopted system of national accounts which are frequently based on the us nipas the widely adopted united nations system of national accounts or their own custom approach the level of detail granularity accounted for internally and reported publicly varies widely across countries likewise a nations system of accounts analogous to a firms chart of accounts are typically gradually revised and updated on their own individual schedule the us nipas are prepared by the staff of the directorate for national economic accounts within the bea the source data largely originate from public sources such as government surveys and administrative data and they are supplemented by data from private sources such as data from trade associations bea  – contents  income accounting  production accounting  see also  notes  references  external links income accountingedit the income side of the national income and product account report begins with the kinds of income people might have employee compensation includes the wages and salaries paid to anyone whose income is subject to income tax withholding since wages and salaries affect more individuals and families directly than the other sources of income it has by far the largest value national income accounts of the us note  billions of current us employee compensation note   proprietors income with iva and cca note   rental income of persons with cca  corporate profits with iva and cca note   net interest and miscellaneous payments  taxes on production and imports  less subsidies − business current transfer payments net  current surplus of government enterprises  equals national income ni  statistical discrepancy  equals net national product nnp  consumption of fixed capital  equals gross national product gnp  income receipts from the rest of the world  less income payments to the rest of the world − equals gross domestic product gdp note   proprietors income is the payments to those who own noncorporate businesses including sole proprietors and partners inventory value adjustment iva and capital consumption adjustment cca are corrections for changes in the value of proprietors inventory goods that may be sold within one year and capital goods like machines and buildings that are not expected to be sold within one year under rules set by the us internal revenue service irs rental income of persons excludes rent paid to corporate real estate companies real estate is capital rather than inventory by definition so there is no iva corporate profits with iva and cca is like the entries for proprietors income and rental income except that the organization is a corporation corporate profit is shown before taxes which are part of taxes on production and imports two lines down business current transfer payments is not explained here net interest and miscellaneous payments is interest paid minus interest received plus payments to individuals and corporations that are not elsewhere classified nec taxes on production and imports does not include corporate income tax payments to the states and to the federal government taxes on production and imports were previously classified as indirect business taxes and include excise taxes sales taxes property taxes and other taxes relating to business production while the report includes the net value of interest payments and receipts both the taxes paid and subsidies from the government are shown national income ni is the sum of employees proprietors rental corporate interest and government income less the subsidies government pays to any of those groups net national product nnp is national income plus or minus the statistical discrepancy that accumulates when aggregating data from millions of individual reports in this case the statistical discrepancy is us billion or about  of gross domestic product a discrepancy that small less than threetenths of one percent is immaterial under accounting standards gross national product is net national product plus an allowance for the consumption of fixed capital mostly buildings and machines usually called depreciation capital is used up in production but it does not vanish finally gdp is gross national product plus payments from the rest of the world that are income to residents of the us minus payments from the us to the rest of the world that count as income where they are received production accountingedit macroeconomics defines gdp from the production perspective as the sum of personal consumption investment net exports and government expenditures gdp  c  i  x − m  g national product accounts of the us note  billions of current us durable goods    nondurable goods    services    personal consumption expenditures    nonresidential    residential    change in private inventories −   gross private domestic investment    exports    less imports −   net exports of goods and services   − federal    state and local    government consumption expenditures and gross investment    gross domestic product gdp note     the production side report also begins with individuals and families in this case their personal consumption expenditures on goods and services c in the definition durable goods are expected to last more than a year furniture appliances cars etc and to have little or no secondary resale market nondurable goods are used up within a year food clothing medicine services includes everything else everything we buy that has little or no physical presence like banking health care insurance movie tickets and so on gross private domestic investment includes expenditures on goods that are expected to be used for an extended period of time i in the definition residential investment includes owner occupied and rental housing nonresidential investment includes buildings machinery and equipment used for commercial or industrial purposes small business agriculture manufacturing service etc the last element of investment accounts for any change in the value of previous investments that are still in use called inventory net exports reports the balance between goods produced domestically but consumed abroad x and goods produced abroad but consumed domestically m there is no distinction between consumption and investment or between the private and public sectors a consumers imported television a corporations imported lab equipment and the governments use of imported food on military bases count equally when net exports are positive the country has a trade surplus when net exports are negative there is a trade deficit government consumption expenditures and gross investment includes all government expenditures on domestically produced goods and services like an individual or family the government consumes food clothing furniture and other goods and services in its administrative military correctional and other programs governments also invest in buildings for program use and in improvements to harbors rivers roads and airports transfer payments like subsidies to the unemployed or the retired are not included in this item since they are simply a movement of money from government to citizens rather than a purchase of goods or services the sum of the four production categories is gross domestic product the value of all domestic expenditures on goods and services gdp

certificate of conformity is granted to a product that meets a minimum set of regulatory technical and safety requirements generally type approval is required before a product is allowed to be sold in a particular country so the requirements for a given product will vary around the world processes and certifications known as type approval in english are generally called homologation or some cognate expression in other european languages compliance to typeapproval requirements can be denoted by a thirdparty marking on the back of the product eg abs tuvul csa or by a typeapproval certificate obtained by a manufacturer and kept on file the ce mark found on the back of many electronic devices does not mean that the product has obtained type approval in the european union the ce mark is the manufacturers declaration that the systemassembly meets the minimum safety requirements of all the directives laws applicable to it and of itself does not signify any third party involvement in the design or testing of a systemassembly many of the new approach safety directives do not mandate third party involvement at all eg lvd emd and the ones that do eg ped mdd atex only require notified body nobo involvement above a certain degree of risk category when the risk category mandates this involvement the ce marking on the systemassembly will be followed by the nobo number which right to

europe regulations unece and also regulates the approval of whole vehicles vehicle systems and separate components recent changes to the requirements have seen the general safety regulation gsr ec amending directive ec by substituting the equivalent unece regulations in place of the ec directives in effect the directives are being replaced by unece regulations this now makes compliance with the

converted vehicles in this case another technical document might help register your car only car and motorcycles are eligible history and legislationedit certificates of conformity have been defined in eu’s single internal market and type approval directive ec eu’s single internal market became official on  january  part of the “ec” effort was to remove the technical barriers preventing the free movement of products within the eu market the greatest impact of this effort has been in the area of standards in the automotive sector the eu commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive technical and environmental standards between all the member states eu legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise particle emissions and safety in addition the eu’s directive on type approval eu council directive  eliminates the need for national type approval requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the eu this directive aims at the clarification of the type approval procedure for motor vehicles separate technical units ie trailers and components it simplifies the documentation designates the type approval number of a separate technical unit by a certificate of conformity and defines the vehicles individual technical units and components certificates of conformity as specified in annex ix of eu directive  will be required for an automobile to enter into service for component approvals an endorsement that is issued under the relevant regulations by the un economic commission for europe unece is recognised as equivalent to an approval granted under comparable eu legislation in march  the eu council formally adopted the few remaining pieces of componentrelated legislation that are necessary to make the wholevehicle type approval a reality for passenger cars in june  eu member state officials approved the adoption of eu legislation creating a single system for the certification of passenger cars in turn defining the safety and other technical requirements legislation established an eu type approval system to replace the national schemes of the twelve member states in  the eu type approval system became mandatory vehicles with an eu type approval can be marketed anywhere in the european community therefore a vehicle only needs to receive the type approval certification in one eu country in order to be accepted in all of the other member countries to receive a type approval products may either be brought to a testing facility or manufacturers may opt to maintain their own testing equipment nevertheless us and eu automobiles still must be certified to this single set of rules by an authorised member state agency a similar system was adopted for the type approval of two and
