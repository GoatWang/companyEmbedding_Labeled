aim introduction for the year under review the group continued its existing core businesses of providing customer loyalty solutions programmes and sale of beauty care products the customer loyalty solutions industry remained extremely competitive with countless players in the industry and with everchanging technology however despite operating in a volatile foreign exchange environment in indonesia the group’s customer loyalty business growth was steady with a strong customer base the indonesian operations continued to be the major contributor of revenue to the group the beauty care business under the brand name of haba has its flagship store at pavilion kuala lumpur as well as counter outlets in other department stores in the klang valley this business segment also maintained a steady volume of sales amidst a highly competitive industry financial results for the year ended  december  the group recorded a revenue of rm million the revenue for the year under review increased by  compared to last year’s revenue of rm million against the increase in revenue the group registered a higher profit before taxation of rm million compared to the previous year’s profit of rm million the improvements in revenue and profit were mainly attributed to the better results achieved by the indonesian operations amidst an appreciating indonesia ruppiah against our currency prospects the group is actively exploring the development of new products and services based on its existing platforms in both local and international markets the board is aware that the continuous cut back on corporate spending on loyalty marketing by the group’s clients and customers’ preference for instant redemptions and gift vouchers will continue to pose a major challenge to the group’s customer loyalty solutions business in malaysia however this segment has shown encouraging growth in indonesia and the group expects this trend to continue in the current year in this regard while the group is focusing its resources to tap into this area of growth it is also mindful of the risks associated with doing business in a foreign country for the group’s beauty care products business the
