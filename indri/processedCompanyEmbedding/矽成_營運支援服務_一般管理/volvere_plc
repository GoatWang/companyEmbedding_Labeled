pleased to report on the results for the year ended  december  the groups trading businesses contributed positively during the year and as a result we once again achieved record net asset assets per share of gbp  gbp all businesses have continued to perform satisfactorily in  to date david buchler chairman  may  net assets attributable to owners of the parent company divided by total number of ordinary shares outstanding at the reporting date less those held in treasury see note  chief executives statement introduction the groups progress overall in  was very pleasing with group revenue from continuing activities reaching a new record of gbp million  gbp million particularly encouraging was the performance of impetus automotive which was acquired in  principal activities the company is a holding company that identifies and invests in undervalued andor distressed businesses and securities as well as businesses that are complementary to existing group companies the company provides management services to those businesses the trading subsidiaries activities during the year were food manufacturing security solutions and automotive consulting and each of these is reported as a separate segment operating review the financial performance of each segment is summarised below and in the financial review and further detailed in note  to the financial statements food manufacturing shire foods limited shire in which the group has an  stake was acquired in  and manufactures frozen pies pasties and other pastry products for retailers and food service customers this year was shires fifth full year of trading within the group shires revenue for the year decreased slightly to gbp million  gbp million and it achieved a profit before tax and intragroup management and interest charges of gbp million  gbp million profit before tax was gbp million  gbp million  with the difference being intragroup interest and management charges the effect of sterlings devaluation following the brexit vote resulted in increased raw material prices and this coupled with a change in product mix resulted in lower profitability whilst we remain positive overall about shires contribution to the group there are some headwinds facing the business not least increasing labour rates and a reluctance by customers to pass on price rises to consumers however raw material prices now seem to have largely stabilised and we have agreed with customers new pricing and product specifications which are expected to relieve downward margin pressure from the second quarter of  throughout  shire continued to seek growth opportunities through product innovation the company has been developing a seasonal product range and initial launches with customers have proved successful this is expected to continue in  further information about shire can be found at wwwshirefoodscom automotive consulting impetus automotive limited was acquired in march  and  was therefore its first full year within the group impetuss principal activity is the provision of consulting and related services to the automotive sector including vehicle manufacturers retailers and national sales companies the group has an  stake in impetus revenue in  was gbp million and its profit before tax and intragroup management and interest charges was gbp million  months to  december  gbp million profit before tax was gbp million  months to  december  gbp million  with the difference being intragroup interest and management charges the automotive industry is evolving driven by increasing innovation and technology in both vehicles and their supply and support channels this provides a dynamic and challenging backdrop for impetus and we believe the business is wellpositioned in such an environment since acquisition we have prepared the company for growth by increasing client focus staff efficiency and improving backoffice systems we believe the financial performance in  reflects this greater focus and has been pivotal in winning new work as part of a plan to widen impetuss service offering the company has with effect from april  assumed responsibility for the management and delivery of a large automotive manufacturers learning and development activities in the uk as a result impetus now employs almost  people an increase of approximately  compared to march  and we expect impetus financial contribution to increase further this year as a result further information on impetuss activities can be found at wwwimpetusautomotivecom security solutions sira defence  security limited sira the groups digital cctv viewing software business continued its good progress with revenue increasing to gbp million  gbp million and achieving a profit before tax of gbp million  gbp million sira remains focused on

the groups investment and management services segment comprises central overheads partially offset by management and interest charges to group companies and returns from treasury management activities on current asset investments future strategy our strategy has been the same since incorporation in  and has delivered excellent results we seek acquisitions of underperforming businesses that we believe we can build into attractive marketleading companies whilst achieving excellent riskadjusted returns for shareholders although uncertainty created by brexit has created challenges it may yet yield more opportunities for us in the years ahead jonathan lander chief executive  may  profit before intragroup management and interest charges is considered to be a relevant and useful interpretation of the trading results of the business such that its performance can be understood on a basis which is independent of its ownership by the group financial review financial performance detailed information about the groups segments is set out in note  to the financial statements which should be read in conjunction with this financial review and the chairmans and chief executives statements overview group revenue from continuing operations rose from gbp million to gbp million the growth was due mainly to impetus automotive limited ial contributing a full years revenue for the first time there was underlying growth in ial compared to the same period last year whilst the groups other businesses reported broadly consistent revenues profit before tax from continuing operations rose from gbpm in  to gbpm mainly due to the excellent performance of ial offset partly by lower profitability in shire foods limited shire the trading performance of each of our businesses is outlined in the chief executives statement and set out further in note  to the financial statements food manufacturing this segment reflects the trading of shire foods owned since july  shires revenue for the year decreased to gbp million  gbp million and profit before tax and intragroup management and interest charges fell to gbp million  gbp million we reported in  that we expected the loss of a customer contract due to the customer bringing manufacturing inhouse in early  to reduce revenue and result in lower profitability as a whole the effects of growth with other customers partly offset the revenue reduction but the increase in raw material costs following the devaluation of sterling resulted in downward margin pressure during the first quarter of  new trading terms and product formulations have been agreed with customers and this should result in more stable margins the year financial performance of shire is summarised in the table below year ended  year ended  year ended

million as new client work was won and our headcount grew in line with that the company has been awarded a contract which commenced on  april  for an initial term of  years to manage and deliver training and learning services in the uk for a large client this is expected to increase the profit of the business the extent of which will depend on the achievement of contractual service levels throughout the life of the contract the initial consideration for the purchase of impetus in march  was gbp million in february  the company issued new shares to certain management and staff such that the group now holds approximately  of the company at the end of  group loans outstanding were gbp million however since acquisition total interest and management charges of gbp million have been paid

invests in distressed businesses and securities which by their nature often carry a higher degree of risk than those that are not distressed the groups businesses are principally engaged in the provision of services that are dependent on the continued employment of the groups employees and availability of suitable profitable workload also in the automotive consulting and food manufacturing segments there is a dependency on a small number of customers and a reduction in the volume or range of products or services supplied to those customers or the loss of any one of them could impact the

warnford court  throgmorton street london ecn at and online at wwwvolverecouk  accounting policies basis of accounting these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and ifric interpretations as adopted by the european union adopted ifrs and with those parts of the companies act  applicable to companies preparing their accounts under adopted ifrs the company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with financial reporting standard  frs  these are presented below going concern the groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the strategic report in addition note  to the financial statements includes the groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk the group has considerable financial resources and operates in a number of different market sectors as a consequence the directors believe that the group is well placed to manage the business risks inherent in its activities despite the current uncertain economic outlook the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements the following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in all material respects in the preparation of these financial statements basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to  december each year control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities all subsidiaries have a reporting date of  december the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation noncontrolling interests presented as part of equity represent the portion of a subsidiarys profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the group the group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interests the results and net assets of subsidiaries whose accounts are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at average and yearend rates respectively business combinations the group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations the consideration transferred by the group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisitiondate fair values of assets transferred liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the group which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement acquisition costs are expensed as incurred the group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquirees financial statements prior to the acquisition assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisitiondate fair values goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets it is calculated as the excess of the sum of the fair value of consideration transferred the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisitiondate fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisitiondate fair values of identifiable net assets if the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above the excess amount ie gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately the purchase of a noncontrolling interest is not a business combination within the scope of ifrs  since the acquiree is already controlled by its parent such transactions are accounted for as equity transactions as they are transactions with equity holders acting in their capacity as such no change in goodwill is recognised and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised see above for information on how goodwill is initially determined goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses and is reviewed annually for impairment other intangible assets all other intangible assets are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are amortised on a straightline basis as set out below over their estimated useful lives which are considered finite registered design rights are amortised over the life of the registration residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and they are subject to impairment testing where indicators of impairment are present intellectual property rights   straight line software   straight line when an intangible asset is disposed of the gain or loss on disposal is determined as the difference between the proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss within other income or other expenses revenue recognition revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts vat and other salesrelated taxes sale of goods is recognised when the group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership generally when the customer has taken undisputed delivery of the goods there are no service obligations attached to the sale of goods customer rebates are deducted from revenue revenue earned on time and materials contracts is recognised as costs are incurred income from fixed price contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion determined on the basis of work done of the relevant contract revenue from consulting services is recognised when the services are provided by reference to the contracts stage of completion at the reporting date when the outcome can be assessed reliably contract revenue and associated costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs that have been incurred and are recoverable contract costs are recognised in the period in which they are incurred if it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue the expected loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss the gross amount due from customers for contract work is presented within trade and other receivables for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceeds progress billings the gross amount due to customers for contract work is presented within other liabilities for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses discontinued operations discontinued operations represent cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represent a separate major line of business or are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business cash generating units forming part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business are classified within continuing operations until they meet the criteria to be held for sale the posttax profit or loss of the discontinued operation is presented as a single line on the face of the consolidated income statement together with any posttax gain or loss recognised on the remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group constituting the discontinued operation on changes to the composition of groups of units comprising discontinued operations the presentation of discontinued operations within prior periods is restated to reflect consistent classification of discontinued operations across all periods presented operating segments ifrs  operating segments requires the disclosure of segmental information for the group on the basis of information reported internally to the chief operating decisionmaker for decisionmaking purposes the group considers that the role of chief operating decisionmaker is performed collectively by the board of directors volvere plc is a holding company that identifies and invests principally in undervalued and distressed businesses and securities as well as businesses that are complementary to existing group companies its customers are based primarily in the uk europe and the usa financial information including revenue and profit before tax and intragroup charges is reported to the board on a segmental basis segment revenue comprises sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and finance income segment profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before tax and intragroup charges for the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments the board reviews the noncurrent assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available all assets are allocated to reportable segments assets that are used jointly by segments are allocated to the individual segments on a basis of revenues earned all liabilities are allocated to individual segments information is reported to the board of directors on a segmental basis as management believes that each segment exposes the group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to their varying business life cycles the segment profit or loss segment assets and segment liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts recognised in the financial statements each segment is managed separately leasing assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments each determined at the inception of the lease the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability finance charges are charged directly against income rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease foreign currencies transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions at each reporting date monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period retirement benefit costs the groups subsidiary undertakings operate defined contribution retirement benefit schemes payments to these schemes are charged as an expense in the period to which they relate the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the relevant company and group in independently administered funds taxation the tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity property plant and equipment items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss freehold property is revalued on a periodic basis depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method on the following bases freehold property   per annum improvements to shortterm leasehold property  over the life of the lease plant and machinery   per annum investments investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs available for sale current asset investments are carried at fair value with adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income investment income income from investments is included in the income statement at the point the group becomes legally entitled to it interest income and expenses are reported on an accruals basis using the effective interest method impairment of property plant and equipment and intangible assets including goodwill at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cashgenerating unit in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase sharebased payments the group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain directors and employees equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant the fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the groups estimate of options that will ultimately vest fair value is measured by use of a blackscholes pricing model the expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value raw materials are valued at purchase price and the costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are assigned using a weighted average cost formula the cost of finished goods comprises raw materials directly attributable to manufacturing processes based on product specification and packaging cost net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable selling expenses cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances overnight deposits and treasury deposits the group considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents financial assets the group classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows fair value through profit or loss fvtpl this category comprises only inthemoney derivatives they are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement the group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables these assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market they arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers trade receivables but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment receivables are considered for impairment when there is a risk of counterparty default availableforsale nonderivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as availableforsale and comprise the groups investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries associates or jointly controlled entities they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity other comprehensive income on disposal amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal fair value is determined by reference to independent valuation statements provided by the investment manager or broker as the case may be through whom such investments are made where the underlying investments are exchangetraded the midprice of the investment is used impairment all financial assets except those at fvtpl are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date to identify whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired different methods are used to determine impairment as described above financial liabilities the group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows fvtpl this category comprises only outofthemoney derivatives they are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement other financial liabilities other financial liabilities include trade payables and other shortterm monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method bank and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the amount advanced net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding financial liabilities and equity instruments financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities invoice discounting the group uses an invoice discounting facility and retains all significant benefits and risks relating to the relevant trade receivables the gross amounts of the receivables are included within assets and a corresponding liability in respect of proceeds received from the facility is included within liabilities the interest and charges are recognised as they accrue and are included in the income statement with other interest charges significant management judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and expenses the nature of the groups business is such that there can be unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding its business the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates significant management judgements the judgements that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below consolidation management have concluded that is not appropriate to utilise the exemption from consolidation available to investment entities under ifrs as it is not considered to meet all of the essential elements of the definition of an investment entity as performance is not measured or evaluated on a fair value basis accordingly the consolidation includes all entities which the company controls current asset investments declines in the fair value of current asset investments are considered for indicators of impairment where the decline in value is significant or prolonged the asset may be considered to be impaired with the resulting impairment losses recognised in the income statement short term and insignificant declines in fair value that are considered to be temporary are reflected in other comprehensive income significant estimates information about estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets liabilities income and expenses is provided below actual results may be substantially different receivables due to the nature of some services provided by certain businesses within the group the recoverability of receivables can be subject to management estimates management estimation is required in measuring and recognising provisions and otherwise determining the exposure to unrecoverable debts sensitivity is limited through the groups credit control procedures and the overall high quality of the groups customer base although it is acknowledged that some customer concentration can mean that adjustments could be material useful lives of depreciable assets the depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value which are reviewed annually increasing an assets expected life or residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the consolidated income statement management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology or regulations inventories in determining the cost of inventories management have to make estimates to arrive at cost and net realisable value furthermore determining the net realisable value of the wider range of products held requires judgement to be applied to determine the saleability of the product and estimations of the potential price that can be achieved in arriving at any provisions for net realisable value management take into account the age condition and quality of the product stocked and the recent sales trend the future realisation of these inventories may be affected by marketdriven changes that may reduce future selling prices business combinations when the group completes a business combination the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are recognised the determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based to a considerable extent on management estimations if the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill if the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement fair value measurement management uses valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments where active market quotes are not available and nonfinancial assets this involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument management bases its assumptions on observable data as far as possible but this is not always available in that case management uses the best information available estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arms length transaction at the reporting date deferred tax asset the group recognises a deferred tax asset in respect of temporary differences relating to capital allowances revenue losses and other short term temporary differences when it considers there is sufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered against future taxable profits this requires management to make decisions on such deferred tax assets based on future forecasts of taxable profits if these forecast profits do not materialise or there is a change in the tax rates or to the period over which temporary timing differences might be recognised the value of the deferred tax asset will need to be revised in a future period the most sensitive area of estimation risk is with respect to losses the group has losses for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these financial statements as future economic benefit of these temporary differences is not probable if appropriate profits are earned in the future recognition of the benefit of these losses may result in a reduced tax charge in a future period new standards and interpretations  in issue but not yet effective at the date of authorisation of these financial statements certain new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published by the iasb that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the group information on those expected to be relevant to the groups

restrict the subsidiaries use of the assets the carrying amount of the assets and associated liabilities is as follows   gbp gbp trade receivables   borrowings     because of the normal credit periods offered by the subsidiaries it is considered that the fair value matches the carrying value for the assets and associated liabilities the group is exposed to credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers primarily in the automotive consulting and food manufacturing segments both segments have a relatively large number of customers however there is a significant dependency on a small number of large customers who can and do place significant contracts provisions for bad and doubtful debts are made based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile experience and circumstances there were no significant amounts due from individual customers where the credit risk was considered by the directors to be significantly higher

instruments are  trade receivables  cash at bank  current asset investments  loans and finance leases  trade and other payables the group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks  cash flow interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  other market price risk policy for managing these risks is set by the board following recommendations from the chief financial  operating officer certain risks are managed centrally while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre the policy for each of the above risks is described in more detail below interest rate risk due to the relatively low level of borrowings the directors do not have an explicit policy for managing cash flow interest rate risk all current and recent borrowing has been on variable terms with interest rates of between  and  above base rate and the group has cash reserves sufficient to repay all borrowings promptly in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates all cash is managed centrally and subsidiary operations are not permitted to arrange borrowing independently the groups investments may attract interest at fixed or variable rates or none at all the market price of such investments may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in underlying interest rates it is not considered relevant to provide a sensitivity analysis on the effect of changing interest rates since at the year end the groups investments had the following interest profiles which contained no variable rates   gbp gbp no interest   fixed interest     foreign currency risk foreign exchange risk arises when individual group operations enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency sterling the directors monitor and review their foreign currency exposure on a regular basis they are of the opinion that as the groups trading exposure is limited to transactions with a small number of customers and suppliers it is not appropriate to actively hedge that element of its foreign currency exposure nor is its exposure to foreign currency risk considered to be significant liquidity risk the group maintains significant cash reserves and therefore does not require facilities with financial institutions to provide working capital surplus cash is managed centrally to maximise the returns on deposits credit risk the group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales the groups policy for managing and exposure to credit risk is disclosed in note  other market price risk the group has generated a significant amount of cash and this has been held partly as cash deposits and partly invested pursuant to the groups investing strategy investments were made in  in equity funds which reflect the groups need to access capital all such investments were disposed in the year so there is no market price risk as at  december  the directors believe that the exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable in the groups circumstances capital management the groups main objective when managing capital is to protect returns to shareholders by ensuring the group will continue to trade profitably in the foreseeable future the group also aims to maximise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital the group manages its capital with regard to the risks inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis the group considers its capital to include share capital share premium fair value reserve and retained earnings net debt includes short and longterm borrowings including lease obligations and shares classed as financial liabilities net of cash and cash equivalents the group has not made any changes to its capital management during the year the group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements an analysis of what the group

prices or indirectly ie derived from prices level  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs the directors consider the carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities to be a reasonable approximation of their fair values in  investments held at fair value were all listed on a recognised market and hence their valuation was not subject to significant judgement or uncertainty such investments are therefore considered to fall under level  in the ifrs  fair value hierarchy freehold property is carried at fair value and is therefore considered to fall under level  in the ifrs  fair value hierarchy freehold property was subjected to an independent valuation on  april  the valuation was in accordance with rics guidelines on open market value there is no movement in the year in the fair value the directors do not consider that the value is below the highest and best use value for the property maturity of financial

and the inclusion of a first full year of trading of the groups transport planning  engineering business jmp consultants limited     profit after tax from continuing operations stated after a oneoff sharebased payment charge of £ million and an exceptional credit of £ million was £ million  £ million the improvement in profits mainly being the result of continued growth and improved profitability at shire foods limited   transport planning  engineering   the groups transport planning  engineering segment consists of jmp consultants limited jmp which was acquired in may   revenues for the year ended  december  were £ million compared with £ million for the  months from the date of acquisition to the end of   profits for the year were £ million stated after a sharebased payment charge of £ million representing an underlying profit of £ million  £ million after adjustment for one off items related to the acquisition for the period from acquisition to  december   there was a sharebased payment charge of £ million  £nil relating to the issue of equity to certain management and staff during the year  this has resulted in the groups shareholding in jmp being reduced to    food manufacturing   shire foods financial performance improved significantly during the year with revenue in  up by  to £ million  £ million  the growth reflects the effects of new customer contracts which had been won but where supply only commenced in the second quarter of the year  the continuing focus on quality with efficiency is now beginning to show through improved profitability with shire achieving profits before intragroup interest of £ million including exceptional income of £ million compared to £ million in    exceptional income consists of the release of certain liabilities which are no longer payable in accordance with the terms of a company voluntary agreement cva which shire entered into in   the cva has now ended and shires net assets have increased by £ million as a result   security solutions   sira defence  security achieved revenue growth in  with revenues up from £ million to £ million  costs remained tightly controlled resulting in the achievement of a modest profit of £ million following a breakeven result last year  the adoption of siraview the cctv viewing software by the police has continued to be encouraging  we are forging relationships with the wider supply chain to ensure siraviews gateway to accessing viewing and managing video footage remains a robust customer proposition   investment revenues other gains and losses and finance income

pending investment in other acquisitions the group continues to seek short term investments where there is the opportunity for attractive returns   dividends   in accordance with the policy set out at the time of admission to aim the board does not currently intend to recommend payment of a dividend and prefers to retain profits as they arise for investment in future opportunities or to purchase own shares for treasury where that is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders     purchase of own shares   the group purchased for treasury a total of  shares   shares for total consideration of £  £ representing an average price of £ per share  £ per share  as of  december  the groups share repurchases total £ million   earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share were p  basic p diluted p   key performance indicators kpis   the group uses key performance indicators suitable for the nature and size of the groups businesses the key financial performance indicators are revenue and profit before tax  the performance of the group and the individual trading businesses against these kpis is outlined above and disclosed in note    internally management uses a variety of nonfinancial kpis as follows in respect of the food manufacturing sector order intake manufacturing output and sales are monitored weekly and reported monthly in the transport planning  engineering segment staff utilisation amounts billed to clients and cash collected are closely monitored order intake is monitored weekly and reported monthly in respect of the security solutions segment   risk factors   the company and group face a number of specific business risks that could affect the companys or groups success  the company and group invests in distressed businesses and securities which by their nature often carry a higher degree of risk than those that are not distressed  the groups businesses are principally engaged in the provision of services that are dependent on the continued employment of the groups employees and availability of suitable profitable workload  also in the food manufacturing segment there is a dependency on a small number of customers and a reduction in the volume or range of products supplied to those customers or the loss of any one of them could impact the group materially   these risks are managed by the board in conjunction with the management of the groups businesses   more information on the groups financial risks is disclosed in note    directors interests   the directors interests in the share capital of

      notes forming part of the preliminary announcement     the financial information set out above which was approved by the board on  may  is derived from the full group accounts for the year ended  december  and does not constitute the statutory accounts within the meaning of section  of the companies act  the group accounts on which the auditors have given an unqualified report which does not contain a statement under section  or  of the companies act  in respect of the accounts for  will be delivered to the registrar of companies in due course   copies of the companys annual report and financial statements are expected to be sent to shareholders on  june  and will be available from the companys registered office abacus house  gutter lane london ecv as and website at wwwvolverecouk         accounting policies   basis of accounting   these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and ifric interpretations as adopted by the european union adopted ifrs and with those parts of the companies act  applicable to companies preparing their accounts under adopted ifrs going concern the groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position are set out in the strategic report  in addition note  to the financial statements includes the groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk the group has considerable financial resources and operates in a number of different market sectors as a consequence the directors believe that the group is well placed to manage the business risks inherent in its activities despite the current uncertain economic outlook   the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements   the following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in all material respects in the preparation of these financial statements             basis of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to  december each year  control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities  all subsidiaries have a reporting date of  december the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate  all intragroup transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation noncontrolling interests presented as part of equity represent the portion of a subsidiarys profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the group the group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective ownership interests business combinations the group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  the consideration transferred by the group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisitiondate fair values of assets transferred liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the group which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement  acquisition costs are expensed as incurred   the group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquirees financial statements prior to the acquisition assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisitiondate fair values   goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets it is calculated as the excess of the sum of the fair value of consideration transferred the recognised amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisitiondate fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisitiondate fair values of identifiable net assets if the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above the excess amount ie gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately the purchase of a noncontrolling interest is not a business combination within the scope of ifrs  since the acquiree is already controlled by its parent  such transactions are accounted for as equity transactions as they are transactions with equity holders acting in their capacity as such no change in goodwill is recognised and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss   goodwill goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised see above for information on how goodwill is initially determined goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses and is reviewed annually for impairment other intangible assets  all other intangible assets are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which are considered finite  residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and they are subject to impairment testing where indicators of impairment are present  registered design rights are amortised over the life of the registration when an intangible asset is disposed of the gain or loss on disposal is determined as the difference between the proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss within other income or other expenses   revenue recognition revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts vat and other salesrelated taxes    sale of goods is recognised when the group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership generally when the customer has taken undisputed delivery of the goods there are no service obligations attached to the sale of goods   revenue earned on time and materials contracts is recognised as costs are incurred  income from fixed price contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion determined on the basis of work done of the relevant contract revenue from consulting services is recognised when the services are provided by reference to the contracts stage of completion at the reporting date when the outcome can be assessed reliably contract revenue and associated costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date when the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs that have been incurred and are recoverable contract costs are recognised in the period in which they are incurred   if it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue the expected loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss   the gross amount due from customers for contract work is presented within trade and other receivables for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceeds progress billings the gross amount due to customers for contract work is presented within other liabilities for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses   discontinued operations discontinued operations represent cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represent a separate major line of business or are part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business  cash generating units forming part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business are classified within continuing operations until they meet the criteria to be held for sale  the posttax profit or loss of the discontinued operation is presented as a single line on the face of the consolidated income statement together with any posttax gain or loss recognised on the remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group constituting the discontinued operation  on changes to the composition of groups of units comprising discontinued operations the presentation of discontinued operations within prior periods is restated to reflect consistent classification of discontinued operations across all periods presented   operating segments ifrs  operating segments requires the disclosure of segmental information for the group on the basis of information reported internally to the chief operating decisionmaker for decisionmaking purposes  the group considers that the role of chief operating decisionmaker is performed collectively by the board of directors   volvere plc is a holding company that identifies and invests principally in undervalued and distressed businesses and securities as well as businesses that are complementary to existing group companies  its customers are based primarily in the uk europe and the usa   financial information including revenue and operating profits is reported to the board on a segmental basis  segment revenue comprises sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and finance income  segment profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before tax  for the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments the board reviews the noncurrent assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available  all assets are allocated to reportable segments  assets that are used jointly by segments are allocated to the individual segments on a basis of revenues earned    all liabilities are allocated to individual segments  information is reported to the board of directors on a segmental basis as management believes that each segment exposes the group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to their varying business life cycles  the segment profit or loss segment assets and segment liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts recognised in the financial statements  each segment is managed separately   leasing   assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value or if lower at the present value of the minimum lease payments each determined at the inception of the lease  the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation  lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability  finance charges are charged directly against income  rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straightline basis over the term of the relevant lease foreign currencies transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions  at each reporting date monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date  gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period   retirement benefit costs the groups subsidiary undertakings operate defined contribution retirement benefit schemes  payments to these schemes are charged as an expense in the period to which they relate  the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the relevant company and group in independently administered funds taxation the tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax  the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year  taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible    deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method  deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised  such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit  deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered   deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised  deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity property plant and equipment items of property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss  depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method on the following bases freehold property                                                                       per annum improvements to shortterm leasehold property                            over the life of the lease plant and machinery                                                                  per annum   investments investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value including transaction costs  available for sale current asset investments are carried at fair value with adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income investment income income from investments is included in the income statement at the point the group becomes legally entitled to it  interest income and expenses are reported on an accruals basis using the effective interest method impairment of property plant and equipment and intangible assets including goodwill   at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss  if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any  recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use  in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount  an impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cashgenerating unit in prior years  a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase sharebased payments the group issues equitysettled sharebased payments to certain directors and employees  equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant  the fair value determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period based on the groups estimate of options that will ultimately vest fair value is measured by use of a blackscholes pricing model  the expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations in determining the groups sharebased payment charge arising in respect of the shares issued to noncontrolling interests as set out in note  the group has evaluated the enterprise value of jmp  this evaluation has considered the range of possible earnings multiples that could apply on an exit to a business such as jmp the rights attaching to the shares issued the proportion of the resulting equity participation and the existence of a single large shareholder with significant influence inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value raw materials are valued at purchase price and the costs of ordinarily interchangeable items are assigned using a weighted average cost formula the cost of finished goods comprises raw materials directly attributable to manufacturing processes based on product specification and packaging cost  net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any applicable selling expenses   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances overnight deposits and treasury deposits  the group considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents financial assets the group classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired  the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows   fair value through profit or loss fvtpl  this category comprises only inthemoney derivatives  they are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement  the group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss   loans and receivables  these assets are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market  they arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers trade receivables but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset  they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment receivables are considered for impairment when there is a risk of counterparty default   availableforsale  nonderivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as availableforsale and comprise the groups investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries associates or jointly controlled entities  they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity other comprehensive income  fair value is determined by reference to independent valuation statements provided by the investment manager or broker as the case may be through whom such investments are made  where the underlying investments are exchangetraded the midprice of the investment is used   impairment all financial assets except those at fvtpl are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date to identify whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired  different methods are used to determine impairment as described above   financial liabilities   the group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired  the groups accounting policy for each category is as follows   fvtpl  this category comprises only outofthemoney derivatives  they are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement   other financial liabilities  other financial liabilities include trade payables and other shortterm monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method   bank and other borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the amount advanced net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument  such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method  interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding financial liabilities and equity instruments financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into  an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities   invoice discounting   the group uses an invoice discounting facility and retains all significant benefits and risks relating to the relevant trade receivables  the gross amounts of the receivables are included within assets and a corresponding liability in respect of proceeds received from the facility is included within liabilities  the interest and charges are recognised as they accrue and are included in the income statement with other interest charges   significant management judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and expenses  the nature of the groups business is such that there can be unpredictable variation and uncertainty regarding its business  the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  actual results may differ from these estimates    significant management judgements   the judgements that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below   deferred tax asset   the group recognises a deferred tax asset in respect of temporary differences relating to capital allowances revenue losses and other short term temporary differences when it considers there is sufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered against future taxable profits   current asset investments declines in the fair value of current asset investments are considered for indicators of impairment where the decline in value is significant or prolonged the asset may be considered to be impaired with the resulting impairment losses recognised in the income statement short term and insignificant declines in fair value that are considered to be temporary are reflected in other comprehensive income   significant estimates   information about estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets liabilities income and expenses is provided below actual results may be substantially different   revenue recognition   due to the nature of some services provided by certain of the groups businesses the recoverability of receivables can be subject to management estimates  whilst the group has a thorough process for reviewing the requirement for receivables and credit note provisions this area is inherently subjective    useful lives of depreciable assets   management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date based on the expected utility of the assets uncertainties in these estimates relate to technical obsolescence that may change the utility of certain equipment used in the production of food   inventories   management estimates the net realisable values of inventories taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date the future realisation of these inventories may be affected by marketdriven changes that may reduce future selling prices   consolidation   management have concluded that is not appropriate to utilise the exemption from consolidation available to investment entities under ifrs  accordingly the consolidation includes all entities which the company controls   business combinations   management uses valuation techniques in determining the fair values of the various elements of a business combination see note    fair value measurement   management uses valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments where active market quotes are not available and nonfinancial assets this involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument management bases its assumptions on observable data as far as possible but this is not always available in that case management uses the best information available estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arms length transaction at the reporting date   new standards and interpretations  in issue but not yet effective   at the date of authorisation of these financial statements certain new standards and amendments  to existing standards have been published by the iasb that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the group information on those expected to be relevant to the groups financial statements is provided below   management anticipates that all relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the groups accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement new standards interpretations and amendments not either adopted or listed below are not expected to have a material impact on the groups financial statements   ifrs  financial instruments    the iasb recently released ifrs  financial instruments  representing the completion of its project to replace ias  financial instruments recognition and measurement the new standard introduces extensive changes to ias s guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and introduces a new expected credit loss model for the impairment of financial assets ifrs  also provides new guidance on the application of hedge accounting   the groups management have yet to assess the impact of ifrs  on these consolidated financial statements the new standard is required to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after  january    ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers   ifrs  presents new requirements for the recognition of revenue replacing ias  revenue ias  construction contracts and several revenuerelated interpretations the new standard establishes a controlbased revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in many areas not covered in detail under existing ifrss including how to account for arrangements with multiple performance obligations variable pricing customer refund rights supplier repurchase options and other common complexities   ifrs  is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after  january  the groups management have not yet assessed the impact of ifrs  on these consolidated financial statements

approximates to carrying value at  december  and    the group is exposed to credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers primarily in the transport planning  engineering and food manufacturing segments  both segments have a relatively large number of customers however there is a significant dependency on a small number of large customers who can and do place significant contracts particularly in the food manufacturing segment  provisions for bad and doubtful debts are made based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing profile experience and circumstances  there were no significant amounts due from individual customers where the credit risk was considered by the directors to be significantly higher than the total population   there is no significant currency risk associated with trade receivables as the vast majority are denominated in sterling   the ageing analysis of trade receivables is disclosed below  £  £ up to  months    to

period in satisfaction of unsecured liabilities of approximately £   during  shire made the final payments due under the cva and in so doing was released from all remaining liabilities that were subject to the cva  the balances released totalled £ and the associated credit is shown separately in the income statement under the caption exceptional income   the fair value of all other trade and other payables approximates to book value at  december        financial instruments  risk management   the groups principal financial instruments are   ·      trade receivables ·      cash at bank ·      current asset investments ·      loans and finance leases ·      trade and other payables   the group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks   ·      cash flow interest rate risk ·      foreign currency risk ·      liquidity risk ·      credit risk ·      other market price risk   policy for managing these risks is set by the board following recommendations from the chief financial  operating officer  certain risks are managed centrally while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre  the policy for each of the above risks is described in more detail below   interest rate risk   due to the relatively low level of borrowings the directors do not have an explicit policy for managing cash flow interest rate risk  all current and recent borrowing has been on variable terms with interest rates of between  and  above base rate and the group has cash reserves sufficient to repay all borrowings promptly in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates  all cash is managed centrally and subsidiary operations are not permitted to arrange borrowing independently   the groups investments may attract interest at fixed or variable rates or none at all  the market price of such investments may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in underlying interest rates  it is not considered relevant to provide a sensitivity analysis on the effect of changing interest rates since at the year end the groups investments had the following interest profiles which contained no variable rates    £  £ no interest   fixed interest               foreign currency risk                                                                                                               foreign exchange risk arises when individual group operations enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency sterling  the directors monitor and review their foreign currency exposure on a regular basis they are of the opinion that as the groups trading exposure is limited to transactions with a small number of customers and suppliers it is not appropriate to actively hedge that element of its foreign currency exposure nor is its exposure to foreign currency risk considered to be significant   liquidity risk   the group maintains significant cash reserves and therefore does not require facilities with financial institutions to provide working capital  surplus cash is managed centrally to maximise the returns on deposits    credit risk   the group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales  the groups policy for managing and exposure to credit risk is disclosed in note     other market price risk   the group has generated a significant amount of cash and this has been held partly as cash deposits and partly invested pursuant to the groups investing strategy  investments have been held in  in a mixture of equity funds and subinvestment grade securities of a uk bank which have been made having regard to the groups need to access capital market price movements of these investments could materially affect the value of the groups assets  the directors believe that the exposure to market price risk from this activity is acceptable in the groups circumstances   capital management   the groups main objective when managing capital is to protect returns to shareholders by ensuring the group will continue to trade profitably in the foreseeable future  the group also aims to maximise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital   the group manages its capital with regard to the risks inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis   the group considers its capital to include share capital share premium revaluation reserve and retained earnings  net debt includes short and longterm borrowings including lease obligations and shares classed as financial liabilities net of cash and cash equivalents  the group has not made any changes to its capital management during the year  the group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements   an analysis of what the group manages as capital is outlined below    £  £ total debt   less cash and cash equivalents       net debtfunds       total equity

loans and receivables cash and cash equivalents         total financial assets       fair values   the directors consider the carrying values of all financial assets and liabilities to be a reasonable approximation of their fair values  investments held at fair value are all listed on a recognised market and hence their valuation is not subject to significant judgement or uncertainty  such investments are therefore considered to fall under level  in the ifrs  fair value hierarchy   maturity of financial assets   the maturities and denominations of financial assets at the year end other than cash and cash equivalents and loans and receivables note  above are as follows  £  £ sterling no fixed maturity       maturity of financial liabilities    the maturity of borrowings including finance leases carried at amortised cost is as follows    £  £ less than six months       six months to one year one to two years two to five years more than five years                   the above borrowings are analysed on the balance sheet as follows   loans and other borrowings current  finance leases currentloans and other borrowings noncurrent finance leases noncurrent                   borrowings are secured on certain assets of the group and interest was charged at rates of between  and  during the year   the maturity of other financial liabilities excluding loans and borrowings

differences       net unrecognised deferred tax asset       deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated using the rate of corporation tax expected to apply when the relevant temporary differences reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net   the unrecognised
