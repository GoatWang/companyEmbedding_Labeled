email delivery frequently asked questions broker listing revolution brewing in nuclear fuel technology published thu aug      marty biancuzzo technology analyst not content with causing geopolitical chaos the russians are wreaking havoc in the energy sector too in a positive way that is on monday i noted how russian scientists have created floating nuclear power plants which offer a radical solution to expanding nuclear power as an energy source well the russians aren’t the only ones innovating in this area one company much closer to home has taken a giant step further… it’s actually trying to reinvent the way nuclear fuel is produced to do so it’s going right to the source of nuclear energy the technology even boosts power output and is safer than conventional uraniumbased nuclear fuel there’s no question that it represents a major advancement in nuclear science but the question is how does its stock match up this company wants a nuclear revolution based on the outskirts of washington dc in mclean va lightbridge corp ltbr is a littleknown nuclear fuel technology firm its business is essentially divided between its technology rd and nuclear energy consultancy services lightbridge wants to shift the focus of nuclear fuel from conventional uranium to an element called thorium it’s a sound idea as you’ll see thorium boasts several benefits over uranium but there’s often a huge gap between innovation and execution and as you’ll also see getting this innovation off the ground and widely accepted as a nuclear fuel is a monumental challenge cash take a glance inside lightbridge’s books and things quickly turn dark and that’s putting it mildly the firm sports some of the worst numbers i’ve seen in a long time for example revenue and gross profit have steadily declined for over five years now in fact lightbridge’s revenue has plummeted by  since  dropping from  million to only  million last year gross profit same story it nosedived by  – from  million in  to a woeful  in  other major metrics are similarly awful lightbridge ceo seth grae claims the company is in a “developmental stage” that’s partly true… while the name “lightbridge” has only been around since  the company isn’t a startup the company was actually founded in  and was previously known as thorium power inc – and novastar resources ltd before that not only does this company appear to have an identity crisis it seems to have been in a “developmental stage” since  that’s  years with a steady drop in financial performance chaos meter  high impact as the global population rises so does the strain on the energy infrastructure and existing resources when it comes to the nuclear industry the world needs safer and more economically competitive nuclear power well lightbridge has invented and patented highimpact fuel technology that it believes will achieve both goals how by offering customers allmetal and thoriumbased fuels to replace today’s uraniumenriched power you see after uranium is mined it gets converted to a gaseous form it’s then transferred to an enrichment plant where it’s “enhanced” that enriched gaseous uranium is then transported to a fuel fabrication plant where it’s converted into uranium dioxide powder the powder is pressed into small fuel pellets that are then inserted into fuel rods when bundled together these rods form fuel assemblies that’s what powers nuclear reactors but lightbridge’s fuel rod technology offers new reactors and two alternative fuel types first there’s thorium thorium is a radioactive metal traces of it can be found in most rocks and soils and it’s about three times more plentiful than uranium that helps ease concerns over the uranium constraints lightbridge claims its array of thoriumbased rods are better than conventional uranium ones because they reduce the weight and volume of used fuel by  and uranium requirements by  allinall lightbridge says its thoriumbased fuel will increase nuclear reactor power output by  and eliminate nuclear waste material that’s used for nuclear weapon development lightbridge also offers an interchangeable allmetal fuel rod these entirely metallic fuel rods boast three key benefits… they provide a power output boost of up to  they result in a  rise in reactor uprate time spent running the required operating temperature of the fuel created from its allmetallic rods is  degrees fahrenheit compare that to the moltenhot  degrees fahrenheit required for oxide fuel this lower operating temperature keeps the fuel from approaching dangerous temperatures during accidents chaos meter  acceleration when it comes to shortterm stock accelerants there’s a common theme with lightbridge… given the company’s million market cap and thin volume any whiff of good news or bad news in the nuclear industry has the potential to move the stock big time… exclusive contentmustsee trump’s financial disclosure statementthis could be the biggest obama “scandal” ever… it has to do with a secret that he and the pentagon kept hidden at  savage rd fort meade maryland for his entire presidency you won’t want to miss this the cia spends billions of dollars to keep scandalous stories under wraps so we wouldn’t be surprised if they wanted this page taken down immediately click here for the shocking truth take a look… in addition lightbridge announced two weeks ago that it will be the first us company to work with the vietnam agency for radiation and nuclear safety varans to help develop the country’s nuclear energy program this is a lucrative opportunity vietnam’s billion nuclear industry is second only to china’s in southeast asia and the us commerce department says the market will grow to  billion by  as governments focus more on nuclear safety and finding innovative ways to generate power while avoiding disasters lightbridge is wellplaced to offer traders quick opportunities to profit be warned though this is a dangerous game to play given the stock’s low volume you’d be hardpressed to get out unscathed if shares fall hard chaos meter  orders the demand for nuclear power solutions today is stronger than ever given that lightbridge’s fuel offers both new and existing nuclear power plants better safety and power output the company believes it can generate revenue from new plants plus the maintenance and upgrade of existing ones that’s great in theory but up to now it has yet to generate any orders or revenue the other segment of lightbridge’s business model is its nuclear strategy and consultation work to global governments and commercial operations it has a large and wellrespected team here including the former head of advanced nuclear fuel design at general electric ge the former head of nuclear technology at westinghouse the former head of the international atomic energy agency and a slew of former nuclear regulators from several different countries since lightbridge isn’t generating revenue from its technology the company’s consultation work is the crux of its business needless to say relying on just one segment for revenue is pretty risky given that business will rise and fall unfortunately lightbridge has experienced more downs than ups recently in  revenue from its consulting segment sank by  pulling in  million compared to the  million it generated in  hopefully the varans deal will produce an upturn here chaos meter  scalability  it’s fair to say that lightbridge is “all in” on its technology if it gains widespread traction it will finally transform the company’s fortunes if not… well it would spell disaster lightbridge does boast strong established relationships through its consulting segment and in order to grow it intends to license its nuclear fuel design to existing nuclear fuel fabricators it’s also looking for fuel fabricators that have longterm fuel supply contracts with nuclear power plants the structure of these licensing agreements will likely require major fuel suppliers to share fuel development costs also fuel suppliers will need to pay an upfront technology access fee to lightbridge plus royalties from future fuel sales the company believes that continued heavy rd spending coupled with product demonstrations will ensure commercial licensing contracts in roughly one to two years i’m skeptical… successful commercialization is multipronged and one of those prongs requires expensive marketing costs to potential fuel fabricator customers while the other requires raising government awareness despite lightbridge’s solid team of former government agency heads it doesn’t help speed the exorbitant time that government processes tend to take this is evidenced by the company’s prolonged efforts since  given its financial situation time is a luxury that lightbridge does not have chaos meter  overall chaos ranking  final verdict an investment in lightbridge is an investment in thorium and metallic fuels or more accurately an investment in the belief that thorium will become a major source of nuclear energy given its abundance and environmental benefits over uranium it’s likely that thorium will have a growing role in the nuclear industry but it’s not a certainty – and not anytime soon either even lightbridge’s own timeline doesn’t project ample commercialization until beyond  in the meantime it’ll be spending much more on researching and developing its metallic fuel than its consulting business can keep up with and that’s the problem… lightbridge’s nearterm life expectancy seems rather fragile if anything the best i can say is that this is a “prechaos” company whose main catalysts at the moment come from newsdriven events rather than its own disruptive breakthroughs your eyes in the pipeline marty biancuzzo related articles legal mandate sparks x profit opportunity schizophrenic investing the  personality types of investors holding my feet to the fire… two small stocks one giant mystery comments  art frewin says august   at  am thanks for the article seems over priced to me they have established a pretty good marketing plan and they have convinced me if the technology is there that it will be the future of electrical and all sorts of power that being said economic structure does not change quickly at my age trying to reap the benifits through investment is probably remote the real problem is now a days no one wants to comprise when it comes to the enviroment and nothing is black and white dirty coal lets not use it that will work for a while  but when it comes to turning off the electricity because there is not enough to go around then we will see just how uncomprising they can be reply martin says august   at  am thorium…gimme a break it has been in the works for like  years and they never got it to work doubt these guys can make it viable also it is a lie that thorium is safer in terms of waste it is actually worse replyalan replyaugust th  at  pmthorium has indeed been successfully used in nuclear reactors but the best way to do it is in a molten salt reactor which is not what these guys are pushing of course eventually most reactors are likely to be powered by thorium but given the lack of crisis in uranium availability that will take longer than it should the msrbased thorium reactor liquid fluoride thorium reactor or lftr is the most common term does reduce the waste stream significantly due to much more complete fuel burnup and the end waste products are relatively shortlived hundreds of years vs ’s in addition to there just being less of them reply lester logan says january   at  am back to the future with thorium but this time get real partner with other governments and companies make money and be rich sign me off as a
