strategy s kumars nationwide spinning a new biz strategy october    ist executives at s kumars nationwide ltd take their clothes very seriously impeccable suits crisp shirts and welltailored trousers are the norm in its office at worli mumbai were the clothiers of the nation today and the world tomorrow says vicechairman and managing director nitin kasliwal with quiet pride sknl which started out as a textile distributor in  is today one of the countrys largest textile and apparel companies with a portfolio of brands that covers all the segments of the market  formal informal and luxury segmentation kasliwal points out is the key to his business strategy for instance sknls strategic business units or sbus are clearly outlined consumer textiles luxury textiles home textiles carmichael house readytowear and the international business but theres another more important division kasliwal focuses on socioeconomic segmentation at the bottom of the pyramid is the economy segment that caters to a population of about  million higher up is the midpremium space with approximately  million people even further are the premium and super premium categories which serve about a  million we want to have the widest and deepest panindia presence which is why were in each of these categories he points out wide and deepin the economy segment the company has its namesake fabric brand s kumars but that market too has migrated fast towards readymade apparels so on the readytowear side it is launching a new brand called world player then in the midpremium segment it has belmonte for both fabric and apparel at the premium end theres reid  taylor and now at the superpremium segment it has stephens brothers kasliwals flagship brand is reid  taylor it retails between rs  and rs  in the readytowear segment it is present across  retail stores and  standalone outlets in  cities it competes with the likes of zodiac arrow louis philippe van heusen allen solly color plus and provogue for market share reid  taylor was launched a decade ago after an indifferent start it has become the number two player in the worsted suit market to begin with it had got pierce brosnan to endorse the brand brosnan at that time was the lead actor in james bond films but he failed to connect with indian consumers though the commercials were slick  the company had decided to focus on television as the preferred medium of communication sknl then roped in amitabh bachchan that did the trick for reid  taylor in marketing circles reid  taylor is considered the ageing superstars biggest success as a brand ambassador the brand has grown to rs  crore rs  billion now going forward kasliwal hopes to make reid  taylor a lifestyle brand which can be extended to perfumes shoes and so on to beef up its premium portfolio sknl will soon launch krugar a premium casual wear brand perhaps because reid  taylor is very strongly associated with formal wear meanwhile it has begun to retail the superpremium british brand stephens brothers through eight stores across seven cities in the country it is priced between rs  and rs  however it will be repositioned as a mainstream brand as a result there will be price cuts and an increase in the number of stores below reid  taylor in the midpremium category sknl has belmonte it is endorsed by shah rukh khan is available in fabric as well as readymade apparel and is priced between rs  to rs  this sector experts say is the sweet spot in which bulk of apparel sales in the country take place sknl has leveraged its association with khan to become the formal wear sponsor of kolkata knight riders the indian premier league team owned by khan the company knows the great potential this category holds so it will launch a yettobenamed casual and denim wear brand in this segment the reason is simpleâ  strong growth of the indian textile and apparel industry at about  per cent the middle class indian population is expected to grow from  million households in  to  million in  concurrently annual household income is projected to grow  per cent per annum from  to  for the masses as for the economy end sknl has big things planned while it already has a fabric brand in s kumars it is now launching world player a new readytowear line this brand positioned as a mass product will be priced anywhere between rs  and rs  this line of clothing will be mainly focused on suburbs and towns in the b c d and e categories given its experience in the fabric business kasliwal is confident that while the margins may not be high the return on capital will be decent we have the capability of making garments at rs  per metre and then selling it at rs  he says for the brand that will be launched in january  the company did thorough research to the extent that its marketers even went to rural homes and small towns results revealed that people in these regions want a brand with a foreign sounding name thus the company decided to come out with world player a brand that will not be high on fashion but will cater to their aspirations here too a brand ambassador will be roped in however unlike its other brands the television commercials of world player will appear mainly on stateowned doordarshan which runs on the terrestrial network only  per cent of india is covered by cable anyway says kasliwal this mind you is also the price band that several retailers have as their target for their private labels most of them already have products with lower price points in their retail network kasliwal may have to bank on these very retailers to sell world player will they push it given the fact that retail margins on private labels are far more attractive at the same time kasliwal is stretching himself in the the other direction as well in  sknl bought leggiuono an italian shirt fabric manufacturer more recently it bought hartmax a large formal wear brand in the united states hartmax is also a leading supplier to all leading department and specialty stores like dillards nordstorm bloomingdales barneys neiman marcus and saks fifth avenue the rationale behind buying the company was the sheer size of the mens apparel market in the us within that the mens formal clothing business a  billion category is growing at  per cent annually according to kasliwal sknl will supply fabric and garments from india that will generate significant margins for the company so for instance a brand of hartmax hickey freeman is typically priced at  while the cost to make it in india would be just  this is what we mean when we say clothier of the
