producing a composite film more specifically the present invention relates to a solventless laminating adhesive suitably used in order to produce a composite film and a process for producing the composite film background art composite films having a plurality of films adhesively bonded with a laminating adhesive are widely used in the field of packaging materials twopart laminating adhesives composed of a base composition containing polyol and a curing agent containing polyisocyanate have been widely known hitherto in recent years there has been studied the development of a twopart solventless laminating adhesive without containing any organic solvent from the viewpoints of reduction of environmental load and improvement of working environment for example there has been proposed a solventfree twopart curable adhesive composition containing a polyol component a and a polyisocyanate component b the composition having a viscosity of  mpa·s or more at ° c immediately after the components a and b are mixed together see for example the following patent document  also there has been proposed a solventfree twocomponent curable adhesive composition containing a polyol component a and a polyisocyanate component b in which at least either component a or b contains at least one polyol component selected from the group consisting of a polyether polyol a polycarbonate polyol and a polyurethane polyol and exhibiting crystallinity at room temperature and a proportion of the crystalline polyol component is  to  by weight of the total weight of the components a and b see for example the following patent document  the solventfree twocomponent curable adhesive composition has a viscosity of  to  mpa·s at ° c immediately after the components a and b are mixed together and an increasing ratio of the viscosity after the composition is stood at ° c for  minutes is  or less relative to the viscosity immediately after the mixing further there has been proposed a twopart curable solventless adhesive in which a base composition contains a polyol having an acid group and a secondary or tertiary terminal hydroxyl groups accounting for  or more of the entire terminal hydroxyl groups and a curing agent contains an isocyanate groupterminated urethane prepolymer having an average functionality of  to  which is obtained by reaction of an aralkyl polyisocyanate and a polyol and an aliphatic polyisocyanate andor a modified substance thereof see for example the following patent document  the twopart solventless laminating adhesive described above is obtained by mixing the base composition and the curing agent in a solventless laminating apparatus and the mixture is coated onto a film which passes through between a pair of rolls each rotating in the same direction in opposed relation to each other subsequently the film is adhesively bonded to the other film with a nip roller to thereby produce a composite film patent document  japanese unexamined patent publication no  patent document  japanese unexamined patent publication no  patent document  japanese unexamined patent publication no  disclosure of the invention problems to be solved however when in the solventless laminating apparatus the mixture of the base composition and the curing agent is coated onto the film with the pair of rolls each rotating in the same direction in opposed relation to each other air is inadvertently entrapped during coating due to air entrainment so that minute air bubbles may be generated in the adhesive layer of the composite film moreover it has been known that on the downstream side of the pair of rolls in the film transport direction a paddlelike stringing phenomenon occurs between the surfaces of the rolls which are spaced apart from each other when such stringing phenomenon occurs the film surface coated with the adhesive may be damaged resulting in formation of a minute void in the adhesive layer of the composite film in the meantime even if the twopart solventless laminating adhesive does not contain any organic solvent its viscosity needs to be low enough to enable coating therefore as compared with the case of blending an organic solvent into the adhesive the average molecular weights of the base composition and the curing agent in the twopart solventless laminating adhesive must be significantly low the small average molecular weights of the base composition and the curing agent make an initial cohesive force weak so that the adhesive needs to be aged for several days in order to exhibit adhesive strength during the aging air bubbles and minute voids existing in the adhesive layer move gather and develop as a result a spotlike matte or orange peellike appearance of the composite film is disadvantageously formed in particular such disadvantage is apparent in a film having excellent gas barrier property because entrapped air bubbles are difficult to remove on the other hand there is a process of coating the twopart solventless laminating adhesive at high temperature so as to increase the average molecular weights of the base composition and the curing agent to some extent however when the adhesive is coated at high temperature damage to the film cannot be avoided when the coating speed is increased in order to improve productivity a stringy adhesive generated by the abovementioned stringing phenomenon is torn into pieces during the coating and the torn adhesive pieces are then scattered into air to cause a large quantity of mist resulting in significant deterioration of the working environment it is an object of the present invention to provide a solventless laminating adhesive capable of avoiding poor appearance of a composite film adhered with the adhesive although it is a solventless laminating adhesive coating while reducing damage to a film and further improving productivity while preventing deterioration of the working environment and a process for producing a composite film using the solventless laminating adhesive means for solving the problem the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention contains a polyisocyanate component and a polyol component both of which are free from polyol components exhibiting crystallinity at room temperature has an initial viscosity of  to  mpa·s three minutes after the polyisocyanate component and the polyol component are mixed and a viscosity increase of  to  relative to the initial viscosity  minutes after the mixing and in a coating apparatus provided with a pair of rolls opposed to each other each of the rolls rotating in an opposite direction in the opposed portion is coated onto a film passing through between the rolls in the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention it is preferable that the film is coated at  to ° c in the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention it is preferable that a coating speed of the film is  mminute or higher in the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention it is preferable that the polyisocyanate component contains a urethane prepolymer having an isocyanate group at its molecular terminal and having a number average molecular weight of  to  and the polyol component contains a polyester polyol having a number average molecular weight of  to  a process for producing a composite film according to the present invention in a coating apparatus provided with a pair of rolls opposed to each other each of the rolls rotating in an opposite direction in the opposed portion a solventless laminating adhesive containing a polyisocyanate component and a polyol component both of which are free from polyol components exhibiting crystallinity at room temperature and having an initial viscosity of  to  mpa·s three minutes after the polyisocyanate component and the polyol component are mixed and a viscosity increase of  to  relative to the initial viscosity  minutes after the mixing is coated onto a film passing through between the rolls in the process for producing a composite film according to the present invention it is preferable that the film is coated at  to ° c in the process for producing a composite film according to the present invention it is preferable that a coating speed of the film is  mminute or higher effect of the invention in the process for producing a composite film according to the present invention the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention is coated onto a film with a pair of rolls rotating in the opposite direction to each other therefore during the coating a shearing force applied by the pair of rolls can reduce occurrence of air bubbles and can prevent occurrence of a stringing phenomenon the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention has an initial viscosity of  to  mpa·s three minutes after a polyisocyanate component and a polyol component are mixed and a viscosity increase of  to  relative to the initial viscosity  minutes after the mixing for this reason coating can be performed at low temperature and high speed with the pair of rolls rotating in the opposite direction to each other therefore although the adhesive is a solventless laminating adhesive poor appearance of the composite film adhered with such adhesive can be avoided besides since the coating can be performed at low temperature damage to the film can be reduced during the coating further since the coating can be performed at high speed productivity can be improved and deterioration of the working environment resulting from mist can be prevented brief description of the drawings fig  is a schematic explanatory view showing a solventless laminator adopting a reverse system serving as a coating apparatus which is used for

roll  in opposed relation to the doctor roll  so as to be in contact therewith the metering roll  rotates in the same direction as the doctor roll  in the portion contacting with the doctor roll  the coating roll  is arranged on the downstream side of the metering roll  in opposed relation to the metering roll  so as to be in contact therewith the coating roll  rotates in the same direction as the metering roll  in the portion contacting with the metering roll  the impression roll  is arranged in opposed relation to the coating roll  so as to be in contact therewith the impression roll  rotates in the opposite direction the same direction as the transport direction of the first film  to the coating roll  in the portion contacting with the coating roll  the laminating unit  is arranged on the downstream side in the transport direction of the first film  with respect to the coating unit  and on the downstream side in the transport direction of the second film  with respect to the second

temperature of the coating roll  when the coating temperature is within the above range damage to the first film  due to heat can be minimized incidentally when the adhesive  is coated onto the first film  from the coating roll  the surface temperature of the coating roll  may rise due to friction in order to prevent such temperature rise the coating roll  is provided with cooling means eg a

the doctor roll  the metering roll  a cutting roll  the coating roll  and the impression roll  may be used the same reference numerals are used in fig  for the same members as those shown in fig  and the description thereof is omitted in fig  the coating unit  includes the doctor roll  the metering roll  the cutting roll  the coating roll  and the impression roll  the metering roll  is arranged in opposed relation on the downstream side of the doctor roll  so as to be in contact with the doctor roll  the metering roll  rotates in the same direction as the doctor roll  in the portion contacting with the doctor roll  the cutting roll  is arranged in opposed relation on the downstream side of the metering roll  so as to be in contact with the metering roll  the cutting roll  rotates in the same direction as the metering roll  in the portion contacting with the metering roll  the coating roll  is arranged in opposed relation on the downstream side of the cutting roll  so as to be in contact with the cutting roll  the coating roll  rotates in the same direction as the cutting roll  in the portion contacting with the cutting roll  the film adhered with the solventless laminating adhesive of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a film to be laminated as a composite film and examples thereof include a metal foil used as a barrier layer and a plastic film used as an inner layer of the bather layer the metal that may be used to form the metal foil includes for example aluminum stainless steel iron copper and lead the metal foil has a thickness of  to  μm or preferably  to  μm the plastic that may be used to form the plastic film includes for example an olefinic polymer eg polyethylene polypropylene a polyester polymer eg polyalkylene terephthalate such as polyethylene terephthalate pet and polybutylene terephthalate polyalkylene naphthalate and a copolyester that contains these polyalkylene arylate units as main ingredients a polyamide polymer eg nylon  nylon  and a vinyl polymer eg polyvinyl chloride ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer ethylenevinyl alcohol copolymer the plastic film also includes a film having inorganic layer formed on at least one side thereof the inorganic layer may be formed by a vacuum evaporation sputtering or solgel technique the inorganic substance that may be used to form the inorganic layer includes for example an element such as titanium aluminum and silicon or an inorganic compound including the abovementioned elements eg oxide specific examples thereof include deposited films such as an aluminumdeposited film and a silicadeposited film moreover the plastic film may be a laminated composite film first laminated film constructed of any coextruded films or the abovementioned plastic films which are bonded together the plastic film is a nonoriented film nonoriented polyethylene nonoriented polypropylene cpp etc or a uniaxially or biaxially oriented film biaxially oriented polypropylene biaxially oriented polyalkylene terephthalate nylon etc without any particular limitation and can be appropriately selected according to the purposes the plastic film usually has a thickness of  to  μm the surfaces of the metal foil and the plastic film may be subjected to surface treatment such as corona discharge treatment and primer bonding treatment further the metal foil and the plastic film may be appropriately printed these metal foil and plastic film are appropriately used as either the first film  or the second film  in the abovementioned solventless laminator  after the composite film  obtained by the abovementioned solventless laminator  is wound up by the takeup roll  and is thereafter aged at room temperature or under heating so that the aged film is cured the solventless laminator  can be used for primary lamination secondary lamination or the like without any particular limitation and for example the adhesive  is coated onto a surface of the barrier layer or a surface of the plastic film by the solventless laminator  and the adhesion surfaces are laminated to prepare a primary composite film primary lamination thereafter the primary composite film is aged at room temperature or under heating eg at  to ° c so that the aged film is cured subsequently the adhesive  is coated onto a surface of the primary composite film or a surface of the plastic film by the solventless laminator  and the adhesion surfaces are laminated to prepare a secondary composite film secondary lamination thereafter the secondary composite film is aged at room temperature or under heating eg at  to ° c so that the aged film is cured when the composite film  is produced in the abovementioned manner the adhesive  is coated on the first film  by a pair of rolls namely the coating roll  and the impression roll  which rotate in the opposite direction to each other therefore during the coating a shearing force applied by the coating roll  and the impression roll  can reduce generation of air bubbles and can prevent occurrence of a stringing phenomenon the adhesive  has an initial viscosity of  to  mpa·s three minutes after the curing agent and the base composition are mixed and a viscosity increase of  to  relative to the initial viscosity  minutes after the mixing for this reason coating can be performed at low temperature and high speed with the coating roll  and the impression roll  that rotate in the opposite direction to each other therefore although the adhesive  is a solventless laminating adhesive poor appearance of the composite film  adhered with such adhesive can be avoided besides since the coating can be performed at low temperature damage to the first film  can be reduced during the coating further since the coating can be performed at high speed productivity can be improved and deterioration of the working environment resulting from mist can be prevented the composite film  obtained in the abovementioned manner has excellent appearance and adhesive strength over a long period of time even after subjected to hightemperature sterilization treatment such as hotwater spray treatment hotwater rotary sterilization treatment or steam rotary sterilization treatment which is hot water treatment at ° c or higher and is excellent in adhesiveness for lamination heatandhumidity resistance and aptitude for hightemperature sterilization while the occurrence of peeling between the layers can be reduced and without spoiling the content therefore the composite film  can be effectively used for producing packaging materials in various industrial fields such as food products beverages medical products and quasi drugs examples while in the following the present invention will be described in further

proportion of not less than  weight  from the standpoint of compatibility with the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b it is preferable to use acrylate andor methacrylate monomers derived from alcohols containing  or more carbon atoms hereinafter referred to sometimes as methacrylate monomers however it is not absolutely necessary to use such methacrylate monomers derived from alcohols containing  or more carbon atoms but methacrylate monomers such as butyl acrylate and butyl acrylateethyl acrylate which are not derived from alcohols of  or more carbon atoms can also be employed  from the standpoint of ease of handling the vinyl polymer a is preferably a polymer having a number average molecular weight of  to  from the standpoint of improved elongation properties greater weather resistance and satisfactory workability of the cured product a vinyl polymer having a number average molecular weight of  to  is still more preferred the number average molecular weight of the vinyl polymer a can be determined by gpc in terms of polystyrene equivalent  the reactive silicon containing group of said vinyl polymer a is represented by the general formula  wherein r and r each represents a substituted or unsubstituted univalent organic group containing  to  carbon atoms or a triorganosiloxy group x represents hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group which may be the same or varying over a plurality of occurrences a represents an integer of   or  and b represents an integer of    or  provided however that the condition of sum of as  b ≥  is satisfied n represents an integer of  to  the reactive silicon containing group preferred from economic points of view is a group represented by the general formula  wherein r and x are as defined above b represents an integer of   or   the average number of reactive silicon containing groups in the vinyl polymer a is at least one preferably not less than  particularly preferably not less than  from the standpoint of providing sufficient curability  the particular species of the hydrolyzable group in the formula  includes halogen atom hydrogen atom an alkoxy group an acyloxy group ketoximato group amino group amido group aminoxy group mercapto group and an alkenyloxy group among these alkoxy groups such as methoxy group and ethoxy group are preferred in consideration of the hydrolyzability under mild conditions  as typical groups for r and r in the formula  alkyl groups such as methyl group and ethylgroup cycloalkyl groups such as cyclohexyl group etc aryl groups such as phenyl group etc and aralkyl groups such as benzyl group etc can be mentioned furthermore r and r may each be a triorganosiloxy group represented by the formula r sio r is the same as r among these methyl group is particularly preferred  as specific examples of said reactive silicon containing group trimethoxysilyl group triethoxysilyl group triisopropoxysilyl group dimethoxymethylsilyl group diethoxymethylsilyl group and diisopropoxymethylsilyl group can be mentioned  the greater the number of hydrolyzable groups attached to the silicon atom particularly to the same silicon atom is the higher the reactivity of the reactive silicon containing group is so that the curing speed of the composition of the invention tends to be increased however the elongation at break of the cured product is sometimes sacrificed for example trimethoxysilyl group is more reactive than dimethoxysilyl group so that a polymer having a trimethoxysilyl group tends to be more reactive and higher in curing speed but smaller in the elongation at break after cure than a polymer having a dimethoxymethylsilyl group a curable composition with an improved curing speed may be obtained by using a vinyl polymer having a trimethoxysilyl group as said vinyl polymer a or using a vinyl polymer having a trimethoxysilyl group in combination with a polymer having a dimethoxymethylsilyl group furthermore a curable composition with a high curing speed may also be obtained by introducing both kinds of groups into one and the same polymer the amount of use of a highly reactive polymer eg said polymer having a trimethoxysilyl group and the relative amounts of said two groups in one and the same polymer can be judiciously selected so as to give a cured product having the desired elongation at break and curing speed among other variables the above practice is recommendable because it is easy to introduce a highly reactive functional group such as trimethoxysilyl into a vinyl polymer the technology that can be used for introducing a reactive silicon containing group into the vinyl polymer a is described in inter alia japanese kokai publication sho  while the skeletal polymer of the vinyl polymer a is generally produced by the ordinary radical polymerization technique using a radical initiator it can also be obtained by the living radical polymerization technique and other techniques as disclosed in japanese kokai publication  when the ordinary radical polymerization technique is used the molecular weight distribution mwmn of the polymer is generally not less than  when the number average molecular weight is not less than   by the living radical polymerization technique the polymer with a molecular weight distribution mwmn of less than  or even  or  or less can be obtained the molecular weight distribution mwmn can be determined by gpc analysis polystyrene equivalent  the curable composition comprising a vinyl polymer with a broad molecular weight distribution as synthesized by the ordinary radical polymerization technique typically the polymerization technique using an azo or peroxy radical initiator and a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b undergoes a greater viscosity buildup and hence adversely affects workability as compared with the curable composition exclusively comprising the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b but may have a viscosity of the order permitting its use as a sealing material among vinyl polymers having a reactive silicon containing group a methacrylic polymer having a reactive silicon containing group is preferred but when such a polymer is synthesized by the ordinary radical polymerization technique it is preferable to use an alkyl methacrylate monomer having an alkyl group of not less than  carbon atoms an alkyl meth acrylate monomer having an alkyl group of  to  carbon atoms and an acrylic andor methacyrlic monomer having a reactive silicon containing group to synthesize a random copolymer comprising such monomer units it is also a preferred protocol to use an alkyl meth acrylate monomer having an alkyl group of  to  carbon atoms and an acrylic andor methacrylic monomer having a reactive silicon containing group without using an alkyl meth acrylate monomer having an alkyl group of not less than  carbon atoms to synthesize a random copolymer comprising of such monomer units of course these copolymers may additionally contain other monomer units referring to the random copolymer having a reactive silicon containing group a further alternative protocol comprises using an acrylic andor methacrylic monomer having such a functional group as oh instead of the acrylic andor methacrylic monomer mentioned above to prepare a random copolymer according to the same polymerization technique as above and introducing a reactive silicon containing group into the copolymer through the utilization of said functional group  the polyoxyalkylene polymer b includes polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyoxybutylene polyoxytetramethylene polyethylene oxidecopropylene oxide and polypropylene oxidecobutylene oxide among others  substantially any polyoxyalkylene polymer having a repeating unit of the general formula  ―r―o― wherein r represents a bivalent organic group preferably a straightchain or branchedchain alkylene group of  to  carbon atoms is particularly preferred because it has a comparatively low glass transition temperature and gives a cured product having satisfactory cold resistance  referring to the general formula  r is preferably a straightchain or branchedchain alkylene group of  to  carbon atoms more preferably one of  to  carbon atoms the repeating unit represented by the general formula  includes the folllowing species among others the main chain skeleton of the polyoxyalkylene polymer may comprise only one kind of repeating unit or two or more kinds of repeating units particularly when the curable composition is to be used as a sealant or an adhesive the propylene oxide polymer particularly a polymer predominantly composed of propylene oxide namely a polymer containing  weight  or more preferably  weight  or more of propylene oxide is preferred because of its noncrystallinity and comparatively low viscosity  the technology of synthesizing a polyoxyalkylene polymer includes but is not limited to the polymerization method using an alkali catalyst such as koh the polymerization method using a transition metal compoundporphyrin complex catalyst such as the complex obtainable by reacting an organoaluminum compound with porphyrin as described in japanese kokai publication sho for instance the polymerization method using a double metal cyanide complex catalyst as disclosed in inter alia japanese kokoku publication sho japanese kokoku publication sho usp  usp  usp  usp  usp  and usp  and the polymerization method using a phosphazene as disclosed in japanese kokai publication hei  the polyoxyalkylene such as polyoxypropylene which has a number average molecular weight of not less than  is preferably synthesized using a double metal cyanide complex catalyst from production cost and other points of view  the reactive silicon containing group of said polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is a group containing a hydroxyl group or other hydrolyzable group directly attached to a silicon atom and capable of crosslinking by forming a siloxane bond through the reaction catalyzed by a curing catalyst as typical examples there can be mentioned the groups represented by the general formula  wherein r and r each represents an alkyl group of  to  carbon atoms an aryl group of  to  carbon atoms an aralkyl group of  to  carbon atoms or a triorganosiloxy group represented by the formula r sio r represents a univalent hydrocarbon group of  to  carbon atoms three r groups may be the same or different  when two or more r or r groups are present such groups may be the same or different x represents a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group and when two or more x groups are present such groups may be the same or different c represents   or  and d represents    or  c need not be the same over m occurrences of the group represented by the general formula  m represents an integer of  to  with the condition of sum of cs  d ≥  is satisfied  the hydrolyzable group represented by x is not particularly restricted but may be a hithertoknown hydrolyzable group specifically hydrogen atom halogen atom an alkoxy group an acyloxy group ketoximato group amino group amido group acid amide group aminoxy group mercapto group an alkenyloxy group etc may be mentioned the preferred among these are hydrogen atom an alkoxy group an acyloxy group ketoximato group amino group amido group aminoxy group mercapto group and an alkenyloxy group and in view of the hydrolyzability under mild conditions and ease of handling an alkoxy group is particularly preferred  the hydrolyzable group and hydroxyl group may be attached in  to  units per silicon atom and the value of sum of cs  d is preferably in the range of  to  when two or more hydrolyzable andor hydroxyl groups are present within the reactive silicon containing group the groups may be the same or different  the silicon atom forming said reactive silicon containing group may be singular or plural and when silicon atoms are linked together by siloxane bonding or the like the number of silicon atoms may range up to about   from availability points of view reactive silicon containing groups represented by the general formula  wherein r and x are as defined above d is an integer of   or  are preferred  as examples of r and r in the above general formulas   and  there can be mentioned alkyl groups such as methyl ethyl etc  cycloalkyl groups such as cyclohexyl etc  aryl groups such as phenyl etc aralkyl group such as benzyl etc and triorganosiloxy groups represented by the formula r sio where r is methyl or phenyl for instance among these methyl group is particularly preferred  the more specific examples of said reactive silicon containing group are trimethoxysilyl group triethoxysilyl group triisopropoxysilyl group dimethoxymethylsilyl group diethoxymethylsilyl group diisopropoxymethylsilyl group and so forth  the curing speed of the composition can be increased by introducing reactive silicon containing groups having high reactivity such as trimethoxysilyl groups into the polyoxyalkylene polymer particulars of this technology have already been discussed above  the above introduction of reactive silicon containing groups can be carried out in the known manner for example the following methods may be mentioned a an organic polymer having a functional group such as hydroxyl group within the molecule is caused to react with an organic compound having an active group capable of reacting with said functional group and an unsaturated group to give an organic polymer having the unsaturated group or copolymerized with an unsaturated groupcontaining epoxy compound to give an unsaturated groupcontaining organic polymer the reaction product thus obtained is then hydrosilylated by permitting a hydrosilane having a reactive silicon containing group to act thereon b an unsaturated groupcontaining organic polymer prepared in the same manner as in a is reacted with a compound having a mercapto group and a reactive silicon containing group c an organic polymer having a functional group such as hydroxyl group epoxy group or isocyanato group within the molecule is reacted with a compound having a functional group capable of reacting with said functional group and a reactive silicon containing group referring to the above method the reaction mode in which the compound having a reactive silicon containing group is reacted at the terminus of the organic polymer is preferred  the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b may be straightchain or branched assuming that the molecular weight is constant use of a straightchain polymer imparts a greater elongation at break to the cured product as compared with the use of a branched polymer but causes an increase in viscosity of the uncured composition so that the composition tends to become less easy to handle referring to the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b its lower limit is preferably  more preferably  still more preferably  the upper limit is preferably   more preferably   still more preferably  if the number average molecular weight is less than  the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group tends to give a brittle cured product if it exceeds  the functional group concentration is so low that the curing speed is sacrificed the additional disadvantage is that the viscosity of the polymer is increased to make handling difficult particularly from the standpoint of viscosity of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group the number average molecular weight is preferably between  and   along with the recent prolongation of the quality assurance period of housings sealing materials are required to be free from the aging of performance with time under the circumstances the composition of the invention can be used in weatherresistant sealing material and other applications with advantage inclusive of architectural sealing materials sealing materials in general are required to have high elongation at break sealing materials for ceramic siding boards which undergo marked shrinkage with time in particular are required to have high elongation at break  by way of illustration the test for sealing materials for ceramic sidings as established by the japan association fiber reinforced cement siding manufacturers institutes that the elongation at break should be at least  however counting on aging of performance with time among others the elongation at break is preferably double this value namely not less than  and further preferably not less than  the cured product available from a composition comprising the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is satisfactory in weather resistance but has been found to be poor in elongation at break as compared with the composition not containing the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a use of a vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group giving only an insufficient elongation at break to a cured product is disadvantageous in that the freedom of formulation is limited for a plasticizer must be used in a large quantity in order to obtain a sufficient elongation at break for instance  the inventors of the present invention discovered that the most effective method of improving the elongation at break of the cured product available from a curable composition comprising a vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is to specify the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b to be not less than   to improve the elongation at break of the cured product it is more efficient to increase the molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b than increasing the molecular weight of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a generally speaking assuming that the kind of reactive silicon containing group and its amount per mole of the polymer are the same increasing the molecular weight of the polymer results in a decreased density of the reactive silicon containing group and it is therefore reasonable to predict that the reaction rate of the reactive silicon containing group is decreased and the curing speed of the curable composition is also decreased however in the composition according to the invention increasing the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b to  or more results in little loss of curing speed  furthermore increasing the molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b causes a decrease in the number of crosslinking sites and hence tends to sacrifice the weather resistance but the composition of the invention is advantageous in that substantially no aging of weather resistance was noted even after at least   hours of sunshine weatherometer exposure from the standpoint of elongation at break the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is preferably not less than  further preferably not less than  particularly preferably not less than  in consideration of the viscosity of the composition the upper limit of molecular weight is   further preferably   particularly preferably   when the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer b is to be increased to   or more for improving the elongation at break of the cured product the polyoxyalkylene polymer is preferably a straightchain polymer having substantially no branches in order that a sufficient elongation at break may be expressed  furthermore the reactive silicon containing group of the polyoxyalkylene polymer b is preferably a group such that two hydrolyzable groups are attached to one silicon atom for example dimethoxymethylsilyl group  the number average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b in the context of the invention is the molecular weight meeting the following definition  thus the number average molecular weight of said polymer b is defined herein to be the number average molecular weight endgroup molecular weight determined by measuring terminal group concentration with direct titrimetry according to the principles of the hydroxyl value determining method as specified in jis k and the iodine value determining method as specified in jis k and taking the polyether oligomer structure into account it can also be determined by plotting the polystyrene equivalent molecular weight found by the gpc analysis which is a common relative method of determining the number average molecular weight against the above endgroup molecular weight to construct a calibration curve and converting the measured gpc molecular weight to the endgroup molecular weight comparison of the molecular weight of the polymer prior to introduction of said reactive silicon containing group such as an unsaturated groupcontaining polyoxyalkylene with the molecular weight of the polymer into which said reactive silicon containing group has been introduced reveals that usually the molecular weight of the polymer into which said reactive silicon containing group has been introduced tends to be slightly larger but there is no remarkable difference  the reactive silicon containing group of the polyoxyalkylene polymer b for use in the invention should exist in the number of at least  preferably  to  for each mole of the polymer on the average if the number of reactive silicon containing groups in the polymer molecule is less than  on the average curability will be insufficient if the number is too large the polymer network structure will be too dense to express good mechanical properties  the reactive silicon containing group of the polyoxyalkylene polymer b for use in the invention may be present within the polyether molecular chain as a side chain or at the chain terminus when the reactive silicon containing group is present as a side chain the effective network chain amount in the ultimate cured product is smaller so that a rubbery cured product expressing high elastic modulus and low elongation at break is more likely formed on the other hand when the reactive silicon containing group is present in the neighborhood of the molecular chain terminus the effective network chain amount in the ultimate cured product is large so that a rubbery cured product expressing high strength high elongation at break and low elastic modulus is more likely formed particularly when the reactive silicon containing group is present at the molecular chain terminus the effective network chain amount in the ultimate cured product is maximized so that a cured product is suited for use as an architectural sealant desirably having large elongation at break in the sense of tensile properties and rubberlike elasticity in the sense of flexibility  specifically the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b includes but is not limited to the polymers proposed in japanese kokoku publication sho and sho japanese kokai publication sho sho sho sho sho japanese kokoku publication hei usp  usp  usp  usp  etc the polymers having reactive silicon containing groups such as dimethoxymethylsilyl groups as introduced by hydrosilylation for instance into polyoxyalkylene polymers having high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions namely number average molecular weights not less than   and mwmn values not over   which are proposed in japanese kokai publication sho sho sho and sho and the polymers having high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions as disclosed in japanese kokai publication hei  the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a largely contributes to the viscosity gain of the final composition and hence tends to degrade the workability but by using a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b having a mwmn value of not more than   preferably not more than  it is possible to suppress the viscosity gain of the final composition and improve the workability such a polymer can be prepared from a polyoxyalkylene polymer synthesized by using a double metal cyanide complex catalyst even if a polymer with such a narrow molecular weight distribution is used as said polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b it is likely that the use of a straightchain polymer with a number average molecular weight of not less than  and as the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a a polymer prepared by the radical polymerization technique other than the living radical polymerization technique such as a meth acrylic random copolymer will result in a remarkable increase in the viscosity of the composition however the viscosity will still be of the order of about  pa·s or  pa·s which permits use of the composition as a sealing material composition therefore it will be unnecessary to use an extraordinary formulation including a solvent and an excessive amount of a plasticizer for viscosity reduction for instance or if formulated these need be used only in minor amounts  regarding the formulating ratio of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a to the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b the lower limit of ab by weight is preferably  more preferably  still more preferably  the upper limit is preferably  more preferably  if this ratio is reduced to less than  that is to say the relative amount of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is increased the weather resistance tends to become insufficient when the weather resistance of a modified silicone sealing material showing no aging after  hours of sunshine weatherometer exposure is regarded as a standard on the other hand if the ratio exceeds  that is to say the relative amount of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a is increased the weather resistance will be improved but the composition tends to gain so much in viscosity as to degrade the workability  in the case where an alkyl acrylate polymer andor alkyl methacrylate polymer having a reactive silicon containing group is used as the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and a polyoxypropylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group is used as the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b the ab ratio is preferably within the range of  to  particularly when a polyoxypropylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group with a number average molecular weight of not less than  preferably not less than  especially preferably not less than  and a molecular weight distribution mwmn  not more than  is employed the ab ratio is preferably within the range of  to  when the ab ratio is  to  both sufficient weather resistance and workability can be well achieved the more preferred range is  to   the plasticizer having an acrylic component c for use in the invention includes polymers of acrylic monomers such as acrylates and acrylamides the preferred are polymers inclusive of acrylate copolymers and copolymers of acrylates with other monomers as specific acrylates the acrylates indicated for use in the production of the a component of the invention can be mentioned by way of example the preferred are alkyl acrylates particularly alkyl acrylates having alkyl groups of  to  carbon atoms such as butyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate by adding such a plasticizer not only the viscosity and slump of the curable composition and the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and elongation at break of the cured product obtained by curing the composition can be adjusted but also a good weather resistance can be maintained for a long time as compared with the use of a plasticizer not containing an acrylic component within the molecule furthermore the use of the plasticizer having an acrylic component c particularly the acrylic polymer synthesized by the sgo process to be described hereinafter results in a greater elongation at break of the cured product as compared with the use of any plasticizer other than the plasticizer having an acrylic component therefore in manufacturing a sealing material with a large elongation at break of the ultimate cured product which is especially required of sealing materials for siding boards by using a polymer with a number average molecular weight of not less than  as the polyoxyalkylene polymer b as mentioned above a plasticizer having an acrylic component c functions as a very suitable plasticizer  the number average molecular weight of said plasticizer having an acrylic component c is preferably  to  more preferably  to  still more preferably  to   if the molecular weight is too low heat and rain tend to cause release of the plasticizer with time to prevent longterm maintenance of initial physical properties and expression of improved weather resistance on the other hand if the molecular weight is too large the viscosity tends to be increased to degrade the workability since the plasticizer having an acrylic component c acts as a plasticizer its viscosity is usually lower than the viscosity of either one or both of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b particularly the viscosity of the plasticizer having an acrylic component c is preferably lower than the viscosity of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b referring to number average molecular weight too the number average molecular weight of the plasticizer having an acrylic component c is preferably lower than the number average molecular weight of either one or both of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b by not less than  more preferably not less than   still more preferably not less than  the number average molecular weight of the plasticizer having an acrylic component c can be determined by gpc as the polystyrene equivalent the molecular weight distribution mwmn can also be determined by gpc polystyrene equivalent method  specifically the plasticizer having an acrylic component c includes but is not particularly limited to the methacrylic polymer with a molecular weight distribution of not more than  as prepared by the living radical polymerization technique proposed in inter alia japanese kokai publication  the polymers made via sgo process which are produced by toagosei co ltd and johnson polymer corporation as reported in the august  issue p  of kogyo zairyo can also be utilized the sgo polymers can be produced by subjecting acrylate monomers to continuous bulk polymerization at high temperature and pressure usually the polymers which are liquid at room temperature and have no functional group are employed these may be used each independently or in a combination of two or more species where necessary these may be used in combination with a low molecular plasticizer within the range not adversely affecting physical properties  these plasticizers having an acrylic component may be acrylic polymers not having a reactive silicon containing group or acrylic polymers having a reactive silicon containing group by utilizing the hydroxyl group of a hydroxyl groupcontaining polymer made via sgo process the reactive silicon containing group can be introduced by the same method as the abovedescribed method of introducing a reactive silicon containing group for the production of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b the acrylic polymer having a reactive silicon containing group functions as a reactive plasticizer helping to eliminate bleeding of a plasticizer from the cured product among other effects when the reactive silicon containing group exists in the number of more than  per mole of the polymer on the average the tensile properties of the cured product are greatly affected the plasticizer having an acrylic component c such as an acrylic polymer which has a reactive silicon containing group in the number of not more than  on the average per mole is preferred as said reactive plasticizer  regarding the amount of use of the plasticizer having an acrylic component c relative to a combined total of  weight parts of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b the lower limit is preferably  weight parts more preferably  weight parts still more preferably  weight parts the upper limit is preferably  weight parts more preferably  weight parts still more preferably  weight parts if the upper limit is less than  weight parts the plasticizing effect tends to be scarcely expressed if it exceeds  weight parts the mechanical strength of the cured product tends to be insufficient and such a plasticizer may be formulated in the stage of synthesis of the polymer  for curing the composition of the invention a curing catalyst need not necessarily be used

relative to a combined total of  weight parts of the vinyl polymer having a reactive silicon containing group a and polyoxyalkylene polymer having a reactive silicon containing group b is preferably about  to  weight parts more preferably about  to  weight parts too low amount of use of the curing catalyst is not preferable because the curing speed is decreased and the curing reaction does not proceed sufficiently on the other hand too high amount of use of the curing catalyst is not preferable because local exothermic reaction and foaming take place in curing and a good cured product cannot be easily obtained  for the purpose of enhancing the activity of the condensation catalyst the curable composition of the invention may be supplemented with a silicon compound having no silanol

vinylidene chloride resin microballoons and resin powders such as pvc powder and pmma powder fibrous fillers such as asbestos glass fibers and filaments and so forth  when it is desired to obtain a cured product of high hardness by using such a filler it is advantageous to use a filler selected chiefly from fumed silica precipitated silica crystalline silica fused silica dolomite silicic anhydride hydrous silicic acid carbon black surfacetreated microfine calcium carbonate calcined clay clay activated zinc white among others and satisfactory results are obtained when such a filler or

fillers may be used each independently or as a mixture of two or more different species  for the purpose of improving the workability knifereleasability and other properties of the composition and giving a matte effect on the surface of the cured product addition of organic balloons or inorganic balloons is preferred these fillers may be surfacetreated and can be used each species independently or as a mixture of two or more different species for improving the workability knifereleasability and other properties the particle size of balloons is preferably not more than  mm for imparting a matte effect to the surface of the cured product the preferred size is  to  µm  by virtue of the satisfactory weather resistance of the cured product the composition of the invention can be applied with advantage to the joints of exterior walls of houses such as siding boards particularly ceramic siding boards but it is preferable to match the sealing material design to the siding design as exterior walls in particular those with a deluxe feeling created by spatter coating or incorporation of colored aggregates are used these days when a scaly or particulate substance not less smaller  mm preferably about  to  mm in diameter is formulated into the composition of the invention the cured product matches up well with such deluxefinished exterior walls and in addition shows good weather resistance thus the composition is enabled to give a cured product capable of retaining the attractive appearance over years when a particulate substance is formulated a pebbled or sandstonelike coarse surface texture can be expressed when a scaly substance is formulated an irregular surface resulting from its scaly shape can be expressed  the preferred diameter formulating amount constituent material etc of such scaly or particulate substances are described in japanese kokai publication hei as follows  the diameter is not less than  mm preferably about  to  mm and a suitable size is

inorganic organic and composite balloons can be employed the balloons for use may be balloons of one and the same material or a mixture of balloons of different materials furthermore balloons having a processed or coated surface can be used and even otherwise balloons surfacetreated with various finishing agents may also be used for example organic balloons coated with calcium carbonate talc titanium dioxide or the like and inorganic balloons subjected to a surface treatment with a silane coupling agent can be mentioned  in order to obtain a pebbled or a sandstonelike coarse surface the diameter of individual balloons is preferably not less than  mm balloons measuring about  to  mm or about  to   mm in diameter can also be used if the diameter is less than  mm formulating a large quantity of balloons tends to cause only a viscosity gain of the composition not contributing to the expression of a coarse texture the formulating amount of balloons can be easily selected according to the desired degree of coarseness of the pebbled or sandstonelike texture it is usually recommendable to formulate balloons not smaller than  mm in diameter in a proportion of  to  vol  based on the volume of the composition if the volume concentration of balloons is less than  vol  no coarse texture can be obtained if it exceeds  vol  the sealing material will gain too much in viscosity to obtain sufficient workability and the modulus of the cured product will be increased so that the fundamental performance as a sealing material tends to be impaired the volume concentration which is particularly preferred for achieving a balance with the fundamental performance required of a sealing material is  to  vol   in using balloons the composition may be supplemented with an antislip

according to claim  description background of the invention field of the inventionthe present invention relates to a binder resin for a toner used for development of an electrostatic image in electrophotography electrostatic printing and the like and a toner containing the binder resin for electrophotography also the present invention relates to a binder resin for a toner and a toner containing a polyester resin background of the related artwith the progress of office automation the demand for electrophotographybased copying machines and printers has increased rapidly and performance requirements for such equipment have become higherthere is a generally used method which comprises forming an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive material then developing the image using a toner transferring the toner image onto a fixing sheet such paper or the like and heatpressing the transferred toner image using heat roll a heat roll fixing method in this heat roll fixing method in order to achieve enhanced economical efficiency in powder consumption and increased photography speed and to prevent papers from being curled a toner superior in fixing properties is needed which can be fixed at a lower temperature on the other hand there is such a problem a socalled offset phenomenon in the heat roller fixing method that since a toner is contacted with the surface of the heating roll in the melt state of the toner the toner is transferred by adhering on the surface of the heating roll and the transferred toner is transferred again on the next sheet to be fixed to contaminate it even without causing this offset phenomenon high performance requirements are demanded as one of the important performance requirements for the toner meanwhile as copiers and printers have come to employ a higher speed high performance requirements in electrified portions have increased that is a higher durability is required for a toner and a longerterm stability in printing is neededin the conventional technique there has been proposed a method to improve the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of a binder resin for a toner concretely it has been tested to have a binder resin of a lowmolecular weight and to lower the fixing temperature however the melting point has been lowered owing to the lowered molecular weight whereas the cohesive force of a resin was also deteriorated simultaneously therefore an offset phenomenon occurs to the fixing roller in order to prevent such a problem its has been attempted to use a binder resin having a wide molecular weight distribution by mixing a high molecular weight resin and a lowmolecular weight resin or further to crosslink the high molecular weight portion of the binder resin or the like with this method however it is difficult to satisfy the fixing properties owing to the increased viscosity of the resin as a binder resin for a toner using the above method in general a styrene acrylic resin eg b and jp b us pat no  etc a polyester resin eg jpa jpa jpa specification of us pat no  or a polyol resin eg jpa etc is mainly usedhowever the toners obtained by these techniques cannot be fully effective in highspeed copiers or small copiers in which the amount of heat from the heat fixing roll is not sufficiently transmitted that is when a polymer having a high weightaverage molecular weight or a crosslinked polymer is used in order to prevent the offset phenomenon the viscosity of a resin increases so that the fixing properties are deterioratedin order to achieve these requirements there is a method to add paraffin waxes lowmolecular weight polyolefin or the like as a mold release agent to a toner in jpa jpa jpa or the like is disclosed a technique to use a styrene type binder resin however block resistance and the development properties have been deteriorated whereas an offset phenomenon has been improved it is also confirmed that the effects of a mold release agent are small when applied to a polyester resin and the developing agent is rapidly depleted when its amount is increasedin order to provide a developing agent having sufficient fixing properties and offset resistance and being capable of providing high image quality of copying images it needs to give a sufficient electrophotographic features to the developing agent many methods have been attempted heretofore in order to achieve high image quality and high resolution of copying images however no perfect methods could be obtained heretofore to fully overcome the above defectsmeanwhile in recent years an increase in population has increased the amount of energy and has depleted resources in connection therewith resources saving energy saving recycling of resources etc have been claimed as to polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles individual municipalities have started a recycling activity and pet bottles have come to be utilized as clothes or containers in addition development of newly recycled items is desired thus a toner using a polyester resin has become a strong candidatesummary of the inventionthe present invention has an initial purpose of providing a binder resin for a toner and a toner satisfying various features that are required for toners from the pastthat is an object of the present invention is to provide a binder resin for a toner and a toner that an offset is prevented without coating an offset preventive solution and which can be fixed at a lower fixing temperature in the heat fixing methodan object of the present invention is to provide a binder resin for a toner and a toner superior in chargeability and grindabilityanother object of the present invention is to provide a binder resin for a toner and a toner to be able to obtain highdensity development images which are always stable even at a high temperature and high humidity or at a low temperature and low humiditya further object of the present invention is to provide a binder resin for a toner and a toner to be able to form stable development images for a long perioda further object of the present invention is to provide a binder resin for a toner and a toner having a weightaverage particle diameter less than  micrometers while suppressing a fine powder of less than  micrometers in a small amount from the viewpoint of superior durabilityin order to solve the above problems the present inventors have found a superior binder resin for a toner that cannot be realized by any of conventional techniques as a result of extensive review thus completing

curability even after storage under ° c conditions for  weeks delay in skin formation time degradation of curability is small and can be preferably used over a long term the curable composition of example  shows low change ratio ba of skin formation time good storage stability low viscosity superior workability and superior depth curability as compared to the curable composition of comparative example  using a conventional phthalatebased plasticizer diisodecyl phthalatetriethylene glycol bisethylhexanoate has good compatibility with conventional phthalatebased plasticizers and as shown in the results of example  triethylene glycol bisethylhexanoate and conventional phthalatebased plasticizers diisodecyl phthalate can be used in combinationa curable composition containing a reactive silicone groupcontaining acrylatebased polymer as component a had a low workability due to high viscosity and delayed depth curability as compared to curable compositions containing a reactive silicone groupcontaining polyoxyalkylenebased polymer however as is clear from the comparison of example  and comparative example  in one or more embodiments workability and depth curability of a curable composition containing a reactive silicone groupcontaining acrylatebased polymer can be improved by using component b in the present inventionas is clear from the comparison of example  using reactive silicone groupcontaining polyoxypropylenebased polymer a alone as component a and example  using reactive silicone groupcontaining polyoxypropylenebased polymer a and reactive silicone groupcontaining acrylatebased polymer a use of a reactive silicone groupcontaining acrylatebased polymer as component a can improve adhesiveness to rigid polyvinyl chloride the results show that component b in the present invention is preferably used in combination with a reactive silicone groupcontaining acrylatebased polymeras shown in example  component b in the present invention can be preferably used as a plasticizer for a curable composition containing polyoxypropylenebased polymer a having a urethane bond in the main chain and trimethoxysilyl group on the terminal the curable composition of example  has a change ratio ba of skin formation time which is  and was free of curing retardation due to the storage however the cured product obtained from the curable composition of example  was hard and inferior in the adhesiveness to a substrate possibly because polymer a has a comparatively small number average molecular weight and the amount of the silyl group introduced into the terminal is highthe cured products obtained from the curable compositions of examples  and  which are the curable composition of example  further added with an epoxy groupcontaining silane coupling agent γglycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane or glycidoxyoctyltrimethoxysilane showed improved adhesiveness to a substrate under wet conditions example  using glycidoxyoctyltrimethoxysilane showed more superior adhesiveness under wet conditions than example  using γglycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane the results reveal that an epoxy groupcontaining silane coupling agent and having a greater number of carbon atoms between glycidoxy group and silyl group provides more superior improvement effect on the adhesiveness to a substratea comparison of examples  and  reveals that when reactive silicone groupcontaining polyoxypropylenebased polymer a is used the adhesiveness to a substrate can be improved by using an amidine compound phenylguanidine solution as component c instead of a dioctyltinbased compound dioctyltin dilauratea comparison of examples  and  reveals that the depth curability of a curable composition can be improved by using an ethylene glycol structurecontaining silane coupling agent a small improving effect on the depth curability is considered to be attributable to a small amount of an ethylene glycol structurecontaining silane coupling agent usedin the curable composition of example  containing polyoxypropylenebased polymer a having a methoxymethyldimethoxysilyl group the amount of the amidine compound phenylguanidine solution was small but the skin formation time was short in addition the curable composition of example  was also superior in the properties other than the skin formation timethe curable composition of comparative example  containing diethylene glycol as a plasticizer was superior in depth curability but showed a high change ratio ba of the skin formation time and markedly lowered curing rate after storagethe curable composition of comparative example  containing bisethylhexyl adipate which is a plasticizer frequently used for polyvinyl chloride resins also showed a high change ratio ba of the skin formation time and markedly lowered curing rate after storagethe curable composition of comparative example  containing polypropylene glycol having a number average molecular weight of  as a plasticizer showed high viscosity as compared to the curable composition of example the curable composition of comparative example  containing polyoxyethyleneoxypropyleneglycol monoether having a number average molecular weight of  as a plasticizer showed a high change ratio ba of the skin formation time and tended to show lowered curing rate after storage these are assumed to be the effect of the high hydroxyl value  mg kohg of the plasticizer polyoxyethyleneoxypropyleneglycol monoether used in comparative example the cured products formed from the curable composition of comparative example  containing polyoxyethyleneoxypropyleneglycol monoether having a number average molecular weight of  as a plasticizer showed a phenomenon of liquid leak when the curable composition of comparative example  containing polyethylene glycol having a number average molecular weight of  as a plasticizer was spread with a spatula to a thickness of about  mm on corrugated board and the surface thereof was observed  hr later it exuded a liquidfrom the results of the aforementioned examples and comparative examples it is clear that the molecular weight of the plasticizer used and the amount of oxyethylene contained therein influence compatibility with component a among many ester compounds a diester compound obtained from polyethylene glycol and aliphatic monocarboxylic acid andor alicyclic monocarboxylic acid is particularly suitable as a plasticizer for a onecomponent curable composition using component aindustrial applicabilityin one or more embodiments the curable composition of the
