with activita desk lamps it’s not just where you sit it’s the environment in which you work what do we know about daylight⋯⋯ it is clear that daylight has the power to energise us at midday in clear weather conditions daylight measures at a colour ‘temperature’ of  kelvin at such high colour temperatures the brain will begin to release the hormone serotonin which actively brightens your mood and helps to increase concentration in simple terms daylight will trigger activity in the brain leaving people feeling much more energised and alert so can daylight help us to be more efficient when we’re at work too a study by the green building council would suggest that this is the case it found that staff members in an office that were exposed to more daylight were  more productive however ensuring that sufficient daylight is available to everyone in order to achieve this can be problematic the right light for everyone managers strive to provide an environment that will help employees increase their output whilst supporting the health and wellbeing of their team members reducing absenteeism where possible generally employees want to work in a bright clear and comfortable environment they also want to avoid eye strain and fatigue that is so often caused by dull overhead fluorescent office lighting these aims can be achieved by increasing the quality and amount of light available in the working environment everyone will react differently to light levels and it can be incredibly difficult to provide light conditions that suit everyone and boost overall efficiency a solution that works rexel has developed a personal lighting solution to overcome these hurdles – the activita daylight desk lamps the innovative affordable and contemporary lamps bring the benefits of daylight into offices providing a muchneeded boost in energy levels the daylight lamps are available in three models each with a life of over  years  hours with low levels of energy consumption models in the range can be adjusted for different purposes including ‘daylight’ that aims to boost alertness ‘warm’ that helps the mind to relax for activities such as reading and ‘cool’ to brighten the workspace lcd panels on the activita pod and strip display a calendar clock and temperature with the added benefit of a usb port for charging mobile devices on the strip in ‘daylight mode’ activita’s blue leds emit a colour temperature of  kelvin the allimportant level that causes serotonin to be released in the brain users are able to adjust their desk lamp to position the light wherever they need it call your
