venture port  nakacho koganei city tokyo product name microfluidic chipflow cytometer onchip flowmicrofluidic chipcell sorter onchip sort description of manufacturer onchip biotechnologies coltd is a life science analysis equipment development company and the first in the world to use microfluid chips in order to develop the flow cytometer and the cell sorterin both devices fluids are contained in a disposable microfluidic chip that does not requirea sheath or waste tank and is maintenancefree both devices are compact enough to fit inside a biosafety cabinet furthermore with the cell sorter the company brought to fruition the technology to sort cells without inflicted damage product description what is the flow cytometer and the cell sorterthe flow cytometer measures the light scattered when a laser beam is sent through particles such as cells in a liquid flowing at a high speed and for fluorescence emitted by particles labeled beforehand with fluorescent substances a cell sorter is a type of flow cytometer that can sort particular cells both devices are essential in cytology technology description of onchip biotechnologies coltd micro flow path technology sterile and contaminationfree due to disposable chips disposable and interchangeable microfluidic chips are used for cell analysis and sorting in both onchip flow and onchip sort the acrylic chips have a flow path width of μm and depth of ～μm formed on a base plate of  cm x  cm all of fluids and reservoirs are placed in these interchangeable microfluidic chips so there is no contamination among samples as well as no contamination to the equipment neither device requires a sheath tank and both are compact enough to fit inside a regular sized biosafety cabinet chips for cell analysis and sorting are available in sterilized or non sterilized form chips for cell analysischips for cell analysissortinghighcapacity chips for cell sorting onchip biotechnologies theory of cell sorting onchip biotechnologies has developed its own technology flow shift method for controlling cell flow on microfluidic chips in onchip sort cells flow on microfluidic paths via pneumatic control identification of an object cell is made in the same way as for the previous cell sorters by identifying scattered light or fluorescence emitted by a laser beam irradiated on the cells on the other hand for the flow shift method sorting mechanism is completely different from the method in the conventional equipment according to this new method at the instant the object cell crosses the microfluidic path air pushes and pulls the fluid to force target cells into the sorting reservoir while letting nontarget cells flow down and be collected into a waste reservoir sorting cells without damaging them damagefree cell sorting has been achieved with microfluidic chips with onchip sort the company adopted its original flow shift method in order to achieve sorting with incredibly minute pressure without the use of ultrasonic sound waves or electrical charges this technology allowe for cells easily susceptible to damage such as nerve cells to be sorted as shown in the following pictures nerve cell b that had been sorted with a traditional sorter was killed by damage while nonsorted nerve cell a and nerve cell c that had been sorted with onchip sort showed a characteristic unique to nerve cell by extending its axon flow cytometer onchip flow the flow cytometer is easy to operate and maintenancefree and biohazardfree due to that the microfluidic chips are disposable all fluids are replaceable for every measurement taken product name product no laser no of fluorescence detectors onchip flow hs f blue red violet  onchip flow ms f blue red  onchip flow ms f blue violet  onchip flow ls f blue  onchip flow ls f blue  the company’s flow cytometer has the following advantages easy to operate it is easy to operate and does not require proficiency you can use the flow cytometer in the same manner you would use a spectrophotometer all you have to do is to prepare a sample and sheath fluid and set them on the equipment ideal for analyzing biohazardous samples all fluids retained in the microfluidic chips and the chips are disposable therefore you can analyze even biohazardous samples such as pathogenic bacteria and virusinfected cell without worrying about fluidic contamination compact enough to be fit inside a biosafety cabinet because the equipment is compact you can install it within a biosafety cabinet you can take measures easily against dispersal of samples and for the operators safety it works with microscale samples it can analyze microscale samples from μlµ it is ideal for analyzing your precious samples maintenancefree because the company’s microfluidic chips are disposable there is no need to clean instrument and maintenance is easy cell sorter onchip sort the world’s first microfluidic chip method that provides safe highprecision

blue  our cell sorter based on microfluidic chips has the following advantages sterile cell sorting all fluids are contained in disposable sterile microfluidic chips because the chips are disposable there is no contamination between samples and no aerosols are generated cell sorting can be done in culture fluid you can sort cells not only in the sheath solution but also in the sample buffer solution and culture fluid it can correspond to a microscale sample you can sort microscale samples from ～ ideal for your precious samples compact and maintenancefree it is compact and can be installed in a biosafety cabinet because its microfluidic chips are disposable there is no need for cleanup and maintenance is easy main specifications of equipment   onchip flow onchip sort lasers
