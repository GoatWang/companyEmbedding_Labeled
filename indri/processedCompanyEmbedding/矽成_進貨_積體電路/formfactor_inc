technology papers mems devices for biomedical applications by dr ramesh ramadoss formfactor san jose ca microelectromechanical systems mems are a class of miniature devices and systems fabricated by micromachining processes mems devices have critical dimensions in the range of  nm to  µm or  mm mems technology is a precursor to the relatively more popular field of nanotechnology which refers to science engineering and technology below  nm down to the atomic scale occasionally mems devices with dimensions in the millimeterrange are referred to as mesoscale mems devices figure  shows relevant dimensional scale alongside biological matter     figure  dimensional scale of mems and nanotechnology adapted from nguyen et al  initially mems technology was based on silicon using bulk micromachining and surface micromachining processes figure  shows an sem image of a surface micromachining based polysilicon mems device an electrostatic motor which consists of twelve fixed stator electrodes and a rotor that spins around the pivot at its center gradually other materials such as glass ceramics and polymers have been adapted for mems especially polymers are attractive for biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility low cost and suitability for rapid prototyping other micromachining processes employed for fabrication of mems include dry plasma etching electroplating laser machining micromilling micromolding stereolithography and inkjet printing   figure  an sem image of a mems electrostatic motor source httpswwwmemsexchangeorg mems devices can actuate or sense on a microscale mems devices can function individually or in combination with other devices to generate effects of meso or macro scale some advantages of mems devices include small size light weight low power consumption and high functionality compared to conventional devices further mems technology offers cost reduction due to batch processing techniques similar to semiconductor integrated circuit ic manufacturing initially mems technology emerged as an offshoot of the semiconductor industry and eventually established itself as a specialized field of study with a significant market share according to yole développement the mems industry market in  was  billion which is a  percent growth from the previous year mems applications mems applications in various functional domains are shown in figure  the term “functional domain” is used to refer to a domain in which the mems device performs a function such as sensing or actuation in the early stages mems proved to be a revolutionary technology in various fields of the physical domain such as mechanical eg pressure sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes microfluidics eg inkjet nozzles acoustics eg microphone rf mems eg switches and resonators and optical mems eg micromirrors gradually mems technology has demonstrated unique solutions and delivered innovative products in chemical biological and medical domains as well mems have penetrated into consumer electronics home appliances automotive industry aerospace industry biomedical industry recreation and sports  figure  mems applications in various functional domains typically electronics are used to interface mems devices from its functional domain ie physical chemical or biological to the electrical domain for signal transduction andor recording it should be pointed out that the term mems was originally coined to refer to miniature sensors and actuators operating between electrical and mechanical domains gradually the term mems has evolved to encompass a wide variety of other microdevices fabricated by micromachining for example a micromachined electrochemical sensor is referred to as a mems device even though there is no functional role played by this device in the mechanical domain similarly the term “biomems” is used to refer to the science and technology of microdevices fabricated by micromachining for biological and medical applications biomems may or may not include any electrical or mechanical functions biomems application areas include biomedical transducers microfluidics medical implants microsurgical tools and tissue engineering as shown in figure  the global biomems market is expected to almost triple in size from  billion in  to  billion in   figure  biomems market forecast by yole développement

article a mems pressure sensors the first mems devices to be used in the biomedical industry were reusable blood pressure sensors in the s mems pressure sensors have the largest class of applications including disposable blood pressure intraocular pressure iop intracranial pressure icp intrauterine pressure and angioplasty some manufacturers of mems pressure sensors for biomedical applications include cardiomems freescale semiconductors ge sensing measurement specialties omron sensimed ag and silicon microstructures according to world health organization who glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world after cataracts mems implantable pressure sensors are used for continuous iop monitoring in glaucoma patients a normal eye maintains a positive iop in the range of  mmhg abnormal elevation   mmhg and fluctuation of iop are considered the main risk factors for glaucoma glaucoma often without any pain or significant symptoms can cause an irreversible and incurable damage to the optic nerve this initially affects the peripheral vision and possibly leads to blindness without timely lifetime treatment therefore it is critical to accurately monitor iop and provide prompt treatments at the early stages of glaucoma development sensimed’s triggerfishtm implantable mems iop sensor is shown in figure  it consists of a disposable contact lens with a mems straingage pressure sensor element an embedded loop antenna golden rings and an asic microprocessor mmxmm chip the mems sensor includes a circular active outer ring and passive strain gages to measure corneal curvature changes in response to iop the loop antenna in the lens receives power from the external monitoring system and sends information back to the system figure  sensimed’s triggerfishtm implantable mems iop sensor source httpwwwsensimedcom b      mems inertial sensors mems accelerometers are used in defibrillators and pacemakers some patients exhibit unusually fast or chaotic heart beats and thus are at a high risk of cardiac arrest or a heart attack an implantable defibrillator restores a normal heart rhythm by providing electrical shocks to the heart during abnormal conditions some peoples’ hearts beat too slowly and this may be related to the natural aging process or a genetic condition a pacemaker maintains a proper heart beat by transmitting electrical impulses to the heart conventional pacemakers were fixed rate modern pacemakers employ mems accelerometers and are capable of adjusting heart rate in accordance with the patient’s physical activity medtronic is a leading manufacturer of mems based defibrillators and pacemakers figure  shows a mems accelerometerbased medtronic’s surescantm pacemaker and implantation of a pacemaker inside the body next to the

transducer a hearingaid is an electroacoustic device used to receive amplify and radiate sound into the ear the goal of a hearing aid is to compensate for the hearing loss and thus make audio communication more intelligible for the user in the us hearing aids are considered medical devices and are regulated by the fda according to nih approximately  percent  million of american adults report some degree of hearing loss there is a strong relationship between age and reported hearing loss also about  to  out of every  children in the united states are born deaf or hardofhearing  according to statistics  of those who could benefit from a hearingaid chose not to use one the reasons include reluctance to recognize hearing loss and social stigma associated with common misconceptions about wearing hearing aids thus it is highly desirable to miniaturize hearingaids without compromising performance mems technology enables reduction of form factor cost and power consumption compared to conventional hearingaid solutions figure  shows analog devices small size  mm mems microphone suitable for hearingaid applications figure  analog devices mems microphone for

and adjustments we believe that the presentation of nongaap net income nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share and free cash flow provides supplemental information that we believe are important to understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met certain targets and thresholds management uses nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items indicated herein for which the amounts or timing may vary significantly depending upon the companys activities and other factors facilitates comparability of the companys operating performance from period to period we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business as an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows many investors also prefer to track free cash flow as opposed to only gaap earnings free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and therefore it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows we have chosen to provide this nongaap information to investors so they can analyze our operating results closer to the way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our company we compute nongaap net income and nongaap fullydiluted earnings per share by adjusting gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per fullydiluted share to remove the impact of certain adjustments and the tax effect of those adjustments these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be materially different from other nongaap measures including similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to net income loss or earnings per fullydiluted share prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we may expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the nongaap adjustments described above and exclusion of these items from our nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual infrequent or nonrecurring for more information on the nongaap adjustments please see
