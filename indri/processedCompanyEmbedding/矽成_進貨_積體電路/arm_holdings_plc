otherwise and tablet computers the company is one of the bestknown silicon fen companies processors based on designs licensed from arm or designed by licensees of one of the arm instruction set

historyedit nameedit the acronym arm was first used in  and originally stood for acorn risc machine acorn computers first risc processor was used in the original acorn archimedes and was one of the first risc processors used in small computers however when the company was incorporated in  the acronym was changed to advanced risc machines in light of the companys name advanced risc machines ltd at the time of the ipo in  the company name was changed to arm holdings often just called arm like the processors foundingedit the company was founded in november  as advanced risc machines ltd and structured as a joint venture between acorn computers apple computer now apple inc and vlsi technology the new company intended to further the development of the acorn risc machine processor which was originally used in the acorn archimedes and had been selected by apple for their newton project its first profitable year was  the companys silicon valley and tokyo offices were opened in  arm invested in palmchip corporation in  to provide system on chip platforms and to enter into the disk drive market in  the company changed its name from advanced risc machines ltd to arm ltd the company

valuing the company at £ billion the transaction was completed on  september  operationsedit business modeledit unlike most traditional microprocessor suppliers such as intel freescale the former semiconductor division of motorola now nxp semiconductors and renesas a former joint venture between hitachi and mitsubishi electric arm only creates and licenses its technology as intellectual property ip rather than manufacturing and selling its own physical cpus gpus socs or microcontrollers this model is similar to fellow british design houses arc international and imagination technologies who have similarly been designing and licensing gpus cpus and socs along with supplying tooling and various design and support services to their licensees facilitiesedit the company has

lund in sweden sophia antipolis in france grasbrunn in germany budapest in hungary sentjernej in slovenia yokohama in japan  china taiwan an arm processor in a hewlettpackard psc printer technologyedit a characteristic feature of arm processors is their low electric power consumption which makes them particularly suitable for use in portable devices in fact almost all modern mobile phones and personal digital assistants contain arm cpus making them the most widely used bit microprocessor family in the world as of  arms accounted for over  of all bit embedded cpus arm processors are used as the main cpu for most mobile phones including those manufactured by apple htc nokia sony ericsson and samsung many pdas and handhelds like the apple ipod and ipad game boy advance nintendo ds ds and switch game park gp and gamepark holdings gpx as well as many other applications including gps navigation devices digital cameras digital televisions network devices and storage the wlan processor of sonys playstation portable is an older arm licenseesedit arm offers several microprocessor core designs that have been publicly licensed  times including  times for their newer application processors nonmicrocontroller used in such applications as smartphones and tablets three of those companies are known to have a licence for one of arms most powerful processor core the bit cortexa some including arms other bit core the cortexa and four have a licence to their most powerful bit core the cortexa cores for bit architectures include cortexa cortexa cortexa cortexa cortexa cortexa cortexa and cortexa and older classic arm processors as well as variant architectures for microcontrollers that include these cores arm cortexr arm cortexr arm cortexr arm cortexm arm cortexm arm cortexm arm cortexm and arm cortexm for licensing the three most popular licensing models are the perpetual implementation license term license and per use license companies often license these designs from arm to manufacture and integrate into their own system on chip soc with other components such as gpus sometimes arms mali or radio basebands for mobile phones in addition to licenses for their core designs arm offers an architectural license for their instruction sets allowing the licensees to design their own cores that implement one of those instruction sets an arm architectural license is more costly than a regular arm core license and also requires the necessary engineering power to design a cpu based on the instruction set processors believed to be designed independently from arm include apples architecture license from march  a ax a and all subsequent apple processors used in iphone  ipad and iphone s qualcomms snapdragon series used in smartphones such as the us version of the samsung galaxy s and samsungs exynos mongoose m cores there were around  architectural licensees in  including marvell apple qualcomm broadcom and some others arm core licenseesedit
