spectacularly omnidirectional led products are able to reveal the quality and beauty of led lighting therefore they become manufacturing emphasis in the industry commonly companies use glass as lighting substrates and thin film as circuit glass is characterized by translucence however its heat dissipation coefficient is about wmk which makes junction temperature of led too high and thus decreases lighting efficiency and life cycle of products also the use of thin film as circuit raises manufacturing costs an appropriate solution comes from cwt is that the use of sapphire substrates sapphire has several characteristics such as high translucence good intensity and better heat dissipation coefficient than glasses wmk which make it as a good replacement of filament to be applied to omnidirectional led productson circuit manufacturing cwt provides our customers with lowcost and highefficient product processing for making of led lighting engines cwt offers custmized substrates to
