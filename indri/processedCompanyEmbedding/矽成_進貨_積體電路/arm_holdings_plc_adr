closing price friday softbank gets the premium mobilechip design house in the world arm designs the processor chips used in the apple inc nasdaqaapl iphone and many other devices and has been a thorn in the side of intel corporation nasdaqintc for years the deal could close as early as next month because it represents a huge premium for armh shareholders making an overbid unlikely and while the british government could protest the capture of its biggest tech asset over the pound’s postbrexit weakness it is unlikely to stop it softbank is promising to increase uk employment after the deal is done  stocks to buy in the healthcare sweet spot arm can use new investments to expand beyond its niche in mobile processor design to the larger market known as the internet of things in which wireless processors are embedded in all sorts of industrial and consumer products this brings a host of new potential customers with new relationships to both design and production what is softbank’s game as the majority owner of sprint corp nyses and softbank mobile softbank has networks through which it can do deals that involve far more than mere chip sales and the expertise acquired in making that happen should bring it deals in other geographies on the conference call son said sprint is becoming selfsufficient and sprint shares fell on the news while softbank will have to reduce its financial stake in alibaba group holding ltd nasdaqbaba over time to make this deal work it retains enormous goodwill within that market and china’s government is heavily invested in making iot work in both consumer and business markets on the conference call announcing the deal which he called the most important event in softbank’s history son predicted that  iot processors will be working for every person in the world  years from now those connections can now redound to arm’s benefit armh does now own a fabrication plant it sells designs that other companies then customize and have produced asneeded softbank can now do deals for chinese production and distribution of arm designs that consume very little power in short it has opportunities but needs capital to take advantage the deal has to represent a transformation in softbank and it made the first move in that direction last year selling its stake in supercell a finnish designer of social games like clash of clans to china’s tencent holdings ltd otcmktstcehy it is also possible that stakes in softbank mobile and sprint could come to market as softbank focuses capital on armh stock what bernstein’s optimistic sp  outlook didn’t tell you the deal represents a great payday for those who have seen arm settle into a trading range from  to share since  and the possibility of future deals could bring sprint new bids over time although the initial reaction of that stock was negative softbank is down  from its early  high but if you buy son’s new vision now may be the time to get in if i were  years younger i would

microchips deployed in tiny consumer devices such as tablets and handsets permit multiple functions such as memory and logic control adc converters to be integrated on a single circuit this results in giving the devices the opportunity to be smaller however it ramps up the complexity of devices a main trend in the consumer technology area via wearables as well as mobiles virtual prototypes are made before the expensive need of having a design fabricated in silicon material it’s a great way eliminate bugs and boost the quality of chip design prior to the design arriving at the foundry for
