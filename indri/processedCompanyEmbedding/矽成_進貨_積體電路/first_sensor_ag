avalanche photodiodes featuring increased sensitivity in the nir wavelength range up to  nm due to its fast rise time and very low dark current the photodiodes are ideal for applications with low light intensities and high modulation frequencies such as laser range finding and laser scanning the slow increase of the amplification with the applied reverse bias voltage of the series  allows for easy and precise adjustments of high gain factors they provide a quantum efficiency of  percent in the  to nm range and have the option of equipping different bandpass filters the very flat leadless ceramiccarrier surfacemount package is suitable for reflow soldering in industrial printed circuit board assembly other housing options are available upon requestvisit company
