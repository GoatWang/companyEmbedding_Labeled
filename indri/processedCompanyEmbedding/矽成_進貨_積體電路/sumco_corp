informationproduct lineup product lineup sumco provides highquality silicon wafers supporting the semiconductor industry at the leading edge raw materials with the highest level of quality are used as the silicon wafer material the wafers are produced under the strictest quality control to create products meeting customer needs in all kinds of ways made from the finest raw materials for quality that can be counted on monocrystalline ingot the silicon wafers provided by sumco are made from highpurity monocrystalline silicon ingots manufactured by the cz czochralski crystal growth process ingots up to mm in diameter are manufactured under the highest level of quality control if required by customers we also make use of the mcz magnetic czochralski technique applying a strong magnetic field to the molten silicon or the fz floatzone technique whereby monocrystalline ingots are grown at low oxygen levels without using a quartz crucible ultraflat ultraclean wafers produced under strict quality control polished wafer pw a monocrystalline ingot is sliced to thicknesses of around mm and the surfaces are polished to a mirror finish as a result the wafers are exceptionally flat and clean sumco can also add gettering capability to the wafer by which heavy metal impurities that can degrade electrical properties are captured wafers with improved surface crystal perfection thanks to hightemperature annealing annealed wafer aw a polished wafer undergoes hightemperature annealing in an atmosphere of hydrogen or argon removing oxygen near the wafer surface the resulting wafer has improved crystal perfection wafers with a vapor phase growth layer of monocrystalline silicon epitaxial wafer ew for superior quality the surface layer of the polished wafer is formed from monocrystalline silicon using vapor phase growth or epitaxy wafers with a layer for embedding integrated circuits junction isolated wafer jiw first the customer’s design is followed to form an embedding layer for integrated circuits on the surface of the wafer employing photolithography ion implantation and thermal diffusion techniques an epitaxial layer is then formed on top of this layer wafers with an oxide layer under the active layer for higher integration silicononinsulator soi wafer an oxide layer with high electric insulation is sandwiched between two polished wafers which are then bonded together this enables devices with high integration low power consumption high speed and high reliability a diffusion layer of arsenic as or antimony sb can also be formed in the active layer at the wafer surface wafers can be recycled on request reclaimed polished wafer rpw on customer request used wafers can be taken back and recycled for reuse specifications of silicon wafers
