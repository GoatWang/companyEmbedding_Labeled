printable version email frost  sullivan award commends thin film for new product innovation the  frost  sullivan global new product innovation award in printed electronic memories is presented to thin film electronics asa thinfilm the company is commended for its unique nonvolatile printable polymerbased memory products thin film electronics has a clear edge over its competitors in terms of product design based on an innovative technique notes frost  sullivan research analyst sunanda jayanth a key characteristic of the innovative technology is that it is fully printable in high volume rolltoroll machines another advantage of the technology used by thinfilm is that it is based on nontoxic materials the company has developed a specific group of printable polymers that are bistable and thus used as the active material in thinfilms rewritable nonvolatile memory these polymers are smart to the extent that functionality is built into the material itself like switchability addressability and charge store says jayanth this is different from silicon and other electronic materials where such functions typically are only achieved by complex circuitry such smart materials open up tremendous opportunities in the electronics world thinfilms innovative allprinted rewritable memories find utilisation in standalone consumer applications such as interactive personalised toys and onlineenabled cards and games they can also be integrated with batteries displays logic and sensors for the development of all printed radio frequency identification rfid tags other suitable application areas include authentication brand protection in logistics and supply chain automation and as a general purpose memory the prime focus for thinfilm has been consumer markets and in particular the toy and game industry thinfilms product offerings for this market include the thinfilm memorytm a bit nonvolatile rewriteable memory printed in a highvolume rolltoroll process and the thinfilm memory controllertm the thinfilm memory controllertm is an applicationspecific integrated circuit asic it will enable toy manufacturers to design smaller more cost effective readerwriter units while accelerating the market launch of smart toys powered by thinfilm the new thinfilm memory controllertm is expected to further increase the cost efficiency of thinfilm printed memory compared to alternatives such as magnetic cards and flash on a perchipperdevice basis remarks jayanth another key advantage is negligible power consumption during read and write and none during standby these advantages combined with environmentallyfriendly production make it well suited for application with other printed electronics the novel thinfilm toy development kit includes instructions for programming and other tools needed to efficiently design smart products using thinfilm memory it contains a handheld readerwriter for memorylabeled cards samples of the newly developed thinfilm memory controller and tags with thinfilm memory thinfilm also recently announced that it is developing prototypes of higherdensity addressable printed memories thinfilm adressable memorytm these prototypes which combine thinfilm memory with printed logic will be ready later this year transfer to production for the addressable memory is expected in  each year frost  sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in the following categories innovative element of the product leverage of leading edge technologies value added featuresbenefits increased customer roi and customer acquisitionpenetration potential frost  sullivan best practices awards recognise companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership technological innovation customer service and strategic product development industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through indepth interviews analysis and extensive secondary research in order to identify best practices in the industry about thin film electronics thin film electronics headquartered in oslo norway is involved in the development of rewritable nonvolatile memories based on functional polymers the companys patented memory technology utilizes a ferroelectric polymer as the functional memory material currently being adopted by players in the games and toys industry the technology has demonstrated significant potential in its early stages of commercialization thinfilms current main product offering is a bit nonvolatile rewriteable memory printed in a highvolume rolltoroll process about frost  sullivan frost  sullivan the growth partnership company enables clients to accelerate growth and achieve

california united states thin film electronics asa thinfilm produces rewriteable nonvolatile memories based on ferroelectric polymers using rolltoroll printing and labels based on near field communication nfc technology thinfilm has been developing memories based on polymer materials since  first as part of opticom asa and then as an independent company for the first ten years the focus was on hybrid memory devices with polymerbased memory and siliconbased control circuitry as developed jointly with intel from  thinfilm has concentrated its efforts on printed electronics thinfilm successfully demonstrated rolltoroll printed organic memory in  and was awarded idtechex technical development manufacturing award the same year in september  thinfilm was selected by web  blog gigaom as one of its top  mobile companies that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape in a significant way in january  thinfilm acquired the assets of kovio and opened the thinfilm nfc innovation center in san jose a printed sensor label used to record the storage temperature of a food product contents  technology  partnerships  awards  references  external links technologyedit the ferroelectric polymer is sandwiched between two sets of electrodes in a passive matrix each crossing of metal lines is a ferroelectric capacitor and defines a memory cell this gives a nonvolatile memory comparable to ferroelectric ram technologies and offer the same functionality as flash memory thinfilms patented passive matrix dispenses with the need of active circuitry within the memory cell it allows the memory to be separate from the readwrite electronics enabling stand alone application without integration with printed logic the passive array memory architecture also enables high density memories as well as the possibility to stack memory layers on top of each other the printed memory technology was licensed to xerox in december  and marketed as of june  as xerox printed

production in  partnershipsedit thinfilm is working with parc a subsidiary of xerox to combine its memory technology with parcs printed transistor technology to enable fully printed memory systems in october  thinfilm together with parc announced a working prototype of the worlds first printed nonvolatile memory device addressed with complementary organic circuits the organic equivalent of cmos circuitry thinfilm and parc announced in june  that they will jointly manufacture a printed temperature sensor tag using thinfilms addressable memory technology both parties are also working together to develop electronic displays that would combine printed sensors memory modules and batteries other printed systems currently in development with thinfilm and its partners will be used in food manufacturing to monitor temperature of temperaturesensitive fresh produce the first temperature sensor packaging project to be announced by thinfilm is a partnership with us packaging giant bemis
