electronics corp a leading fabless semiconductor supplier providing innovative usbtolan solutions recently announced two new additions to the axx family for embedded ethernet applications  the axa and axa for usbtoethernet and usbtomii chips respectively the axxa is the latest series in asixs highspeed usbtolan product portfolio by combining the axxa with a usb host microcontroller designers can provide ethernet connectivity for embedded systems to distribute data and control remotely over a network recent innovations in multimedia socs systemonchip have been based on decreasing the physical form factor to reduce costs the most efficient method of miniaturization is to decrease the pin count and utilize a serial interface including spi flash and usblan solutions in favor of a parallel localmemory bus furthermore usbs pin serial interface provides transfer speeds up to  mbps making it an ideal solution for miniature and mobile devices to quickly connect to networking peripherals asix electronics has released the axx series usblan chips to satisfy the market demands for networking applications using multimedia socs the axxa features a usb interface to communicate with a usb host controller and is compliant with usb specification v and v the axxa implements mbps ethernet lan function based on ieee and ieeeu standards with kb of embedded sram for packet buffering in addition it integrates an onchip mbps ethernet phy simplifying system design the axxa has a wide array of features including support for hp automdix wakeonlan power management and ieee xbackpressure flow control optional serial interfaces such as ic spi and uart are provided as a control channel from the usb host controller to communicate with the external mcu chip the axa lowpincount pin lqfp usb  to m fast ethernet controller is a high performance and highly integrated asic which enables a low cost small form factor and simple plugandplay fast ethernet network connection capability for desktops notebook pcs umpcs cradlesport replicatorsdocking stations game consoles digitalhome appliances and any embedded system using a standard usb port the axa usb  to mii controller provides an optional external media interface emi for an external phy or an external mac depending on different application purposes the emi can be a mediaindependent interface mii for implementing basefx ethernet or homepna functions the emi can also be a reversemii or reverse reducedmii reversermii for glueless mactomac connections to any mcu with ethernet mac mii or rmii interface to help customers evaluate and develop applications with the axxa product family asix provides comprehensive technical support including hardware and software application notes user guides schematics pcb layout guides and drivers for windowslinuxwincemacos operating systems in addition asix has already received complete usbif whql and rohs compliant certifications limited samples of the axxa are available now and
