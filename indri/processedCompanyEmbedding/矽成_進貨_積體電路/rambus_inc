historyedit rambus a california company was incorporated in  and reincorporated in the state of delaware in  the company was listed on nasdaq in  under the code rmbs as of february  rambus derived the majority of its annual revenue by licensing patents for chip interfaces to its customers according to the wall street journal history of rambus has been marked by litigation including patent battles with numerous chip makers rambus share price has ranged between a high of nearly  in  to a low of approximately  in  with a  split on june   rambus share price in the first quarter of  was between  and  giving the firm a market capitalization value of around  billion technologyedit plaques on a wall at the rambus headquarters then in los altos in  with the caption license to speed each representing a us patent issued to the company an early version of rdram base rdram was used in the nintendo  that was released in  the first pc motherboards with support for rdram were released in  they supported pc rdram which operated at  mhz but presented data on both the rising and falling edge of the clock cycle resulting in effectively  mhz and delivered  mbs of bandwidth over a bit bus using a pin rimm form factor this was significantly faster than the previous standard pc sdram which operated at  mhz and delivered  mbs of bandwidth over a bit bus using a pin dimm form factor some disadvantages of rdram technology however included significantly increased latency power dissipation as heat manufacturing complexity and cost pc rdram operated with a minimum latency of  ns compared to  ns for pc sdram rdrams can also be told to increase their latencies in order to prevent the possibility of two or more chips transmitting at the same time and causing a collision however sdram latency depends on the current state of memory so its latency can vary widely depending on what happened earlier and the strategy used by the sdram controller while rdram latency is constant once it has been established by the memory controller rdram memory chips also put out significantly more heat than sdram chips necessitating heatsinks on all rimm devices rdram also includes a memory controller on each memory chip significantly increasing manufacturing complexity compared to sdram which used a single memory controller located on the northbridge chipset rdram was also two to three times the price of pc sdram due to manufacturing costs license fees and other market factors with the introduction of the intel  chipset dualchannel support was added for pc rdram doubling bandwidth to  mbs by increasing the bus width to bit this was followed in  by the intel e chipset which introduced pc rdram increasing total dualchannel bandwidth to  mbs also in  intel released the e chipset which introduced dualchannel ddr support for a total bandwidth of  mbs but at a much lower latency than competing rdram in  intel released the p chipset and along with it dualchannel ddr with a total bandwidth of  mbs it marked the end of rdram as a technology with competitive performance rambus also developed and licensed its xdr dram technology notably used in the playstation  and more recently xdr dram lawsuitsedit in the early s rambus was invited to join the jedec rambus had been trying to interest memory manufacturers in licensing their proprietary memory interface and numerous companies had signed nondisclosure agreements to view rambus technical data during the later infineon v rambus trial infineon memos from a meeting with representatives of other manufacturers surfaced including the line one day all computers will be built this way but hopefully without the royalties going to rambus and continuing with a strategy discussion for reducing or eliminating royalties to be paid to rambus as rambus continued its participation in jedec it became apparent that they were not prepared to agree to jedecs patent policy requiring owners of patents included in a standard to agree to license that technology under terms that are reasonable and nondiscriminatory and rambus withdrew from the organization in  memos from rambus at that time showed they were tailoring new patent applications to cover features of sdram being discussed which were public knowledge jedec meetings are not secret and perfectly legal for patent owners who have patented underlying innovations but were seen as evidence of bad faith by the jury in the first infineon v rambus trial the court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc rejected this theory of bad faith in its decision overturning the fraud conviction infineon achieved in the first trial see below patent lawsuitsedit in  rambus began filing lawsuits against the largest memory manufacturers claiming that they owned sdram and ddr technology seven manufacturers including samsung quickly settled with rambus and agreed to pay royalties on sdram and ddr memory in may  rambus was found guilty of fraud for having claimed that it owned sdram and ddr technology and all infringement claims against memory manufacturers were dismissed in january  the cafc overturned the fraud verdict of the jury trial in virginia under judge payne issued a new claims construction and remanded the case back to virginia for retrial on infringement in october  the us supreme court refused to hear the case thus the case returned to virginia per the cafc ruling in january  rambus filed four more lawsuits against memory chip makers hynix semiconductor nanya technology inotera memories and infineon technology claiming that ddr  gddr  and gddr  chips contain rambus technology in march  rambus had its claim for patent infringements against infineon dismissed rambus was accused of shredding key documents prior to court hearings the judge agreed and dismissed rambus case against infineon this led rambus to negotiate a settlement with infineon which agreed to pay rambus quarterly license fees of  million and in return both companies ceased all litigation against each other the agreement ran from november  to november  after this date if rambus had enough remaining agreements in place infineon may make extra payments up to  million in june  rambus also sued one of its strongest proponents samsung the worlds largest memory manufacturer and terminated samsungs license samsung had promoted rambuss rdram and currently remains a licensee of rambuss xdr memory in february  micron technology sued rambus alleging that rambus had violated rico and deliberately harmed micron on april   the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a ruling vacating the order of the us district court for the eastern district of virginia saying the case with samsung should be dismissed saying judge robert e paynes findings critical of rambus were on a case that had already been settled and thus had no legal standing on january   a delaware federal judge ruled that rambus could not enforce patents against micron technology inc stating that rambus had a clear and convincing show of bad faith and ruled that rambus destruction of key related documents spoliation of evidence nullified its right to enforce its patents against micron in july  the united states patent and trademark office uspto rejected  claims by rambus against nvidia on november   the uspto rejected all  claims in three rambus patents that the company asserted against nvidia in a complaint filed with the us international trade commission itc however the itc has announced that out of five patents nvidia did violate three of them due to this ruling nvidia is facing a us import ban on some of its chips used in the nforce quadro geforce tesla and tegra series graphics products—nearly every video card type manufactured by nvidia on june   rambus went to trial against micron and hynix in california seeking as much as  billion in damages for “a secret and unlawful conspiracy to kill a revolutionary technology make billions of dollars and hang onto power” rambus lawyer bart williams told jurors rambus lost on november   in the jury trial and its shares dropped drastically from  to  per share on november   rambus lost the antitrust case against micron technology and hynix semiconductor the san francisco county superior court jury ruled against rambus in a  vote in a statement posted on the companys website rambus ceo harold hughes said we are reviewing our options for appeal on january   a uspto appeals board declared the third of three patents known as the barth patents invalid the first two had been declared invalid in september  rambus had used these patents to win infringement lawsuits against nvidia corp nvdao and hewlettpackard hpqn on june   the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed the uspto and the  barth patents validity was reinstated in conclusion the board’s determination that all  claims of the ’ patent are invalid as anticipated by farmwald is not supported by substantial evidence accordingly this court reverses httpwwwmololamkencomassetshtmldocumentsrambusopinionpdfpdf federal trade commission antitrust suitsedit in may  the united states federal trade commission ftc filed charges against rambus for antitrust violations specifically the ftc complaint asserted that through the use of patent continuations and divisionals rambus pursued a strategy of expanding the scope of its patent claims to encompass the emerging sdram standard the ftcs antitrust allegations against rambus went to trial in the summer of  after the organization formally accused rambus of anticompetitive behavior the previous june itself the result of an investigation launched in may  at the behest of the memory manufacturers the ftcs chief administrativelaw judge stephen j mcguire dismissed the antitrust claims against rambus in  saying that the memory industry had no reasonable alternatives to rambus technology and was aware of the potential scope of rambus patent rights according to the company soon after ftc investigators filed a brief to appeal against that ruling on august   the ftc overturned mcguires ruling stating that rambus illegally monopolized the memory industry under section  of the sherman antitrust act and also practiced deception that violated section  of the federal trade commission act february   the ftc issued a ruling that limits maximum royalties that rambus may demand from manufacturers of dynamic randomaccess memory dram which was set to  for ddr sdram for  years from the date the commissions order is issued and then going to  while sdrams maximum royalty was set to  the commission claimed that halving the ddr sdram rate for sdram would reflect the fact that while ddr sdram utilizes four of the relevant rambus technologies sdram uses only two in addition to collecting fees for dram chips rambus will also be able to receive  and  royalties for sdram and ddr sdram memory controllers or other nonmemory chip components respectively however the ruling did not prohibit rambus from collecting royalties on products based on ddr sdram gddr and other jedec postddr memory standards rambus has appealed the ftc opinionremedy and awaits a court date for the appeal on march   the jury of the us district court for the northern district of california determined that had rambus acted properly while a member of the standardsetting organization jedec during its participating in the early s finding that the memory manufacturers did not meet their burden of proving antitrust and fraud claims on april   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit overturned the ftc reversal of mcguires  ruling saying that the ftc had not established that rambus had harmed the competition on february   the us supreme court rejected the bids by the ftc to impose royalty sanctions on rambus via antitrust penalties european commission antitrust suitedit july   the european commission launched antitrust investigations against rambus taking the view that rambus engaged in intentional deceptive conduct in the context of the standardsetting process for example by not disclosing the existence of the patents which it later claimed were relevant to the adopted standard this type of behaviour is known as a patent ambush against this background the commission provisionally considered that rambus breached the ec treatys rules on abuse of a dominant market position article  ec treaty by subsequently claiming unreasonable royalties for the use of those relevant patents the commissions preliminary view is that without its patent ambush rambus would not have been able to charge the royalty rates it currently does recent settlementsedit in  and  rambus settled and agreed on licensing terms with several of the companies involved in longrunning disputes on december   rambus entered an agreement with micron to let the latter use some of its patents in exchange for  million worth of royalties over seven years in june  the company settled with sk hynix with hynix paying  million to settle the disputes in march  rambus and nanya signed a year patent licensing agreement settling earlier claims rambus said these deals were part of a change in strategy to a less litigious more collaborative approach distancing themselves from accusations of patent trolling ronald black rambus’s ceo said “somehow we got thrown into the
