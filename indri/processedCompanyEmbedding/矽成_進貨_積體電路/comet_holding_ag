sterilization of threedimensional surfaces the technologies of the comet group help industry master the challenges of manufacturing and quality inspection reliability safety and performance the more industry pushes materials to their limits the greater the importance of precise reliable processes in production and quality inspection the technologies of the comet group help find the most minute flaws in materials and components and make processes more competitive ecofriendliness and resource efficiency natural resources are limited energysaving resourceefficient production processes are therefore vitally important the technologies of the comet group help protect the environment and conserve resources  comet holding ag annual report  trends our core technologies xray technology in these times of lean manufacturing the safety and reliability of components is an absolute must even the tiniest defects need to be found that makes powerful technologies for nondestructive testing all the more critical the comet group has succeeded time and again in setting new standards with its innovative highquality xray sources xray systems and d imaging software components requiring inspection are always getting smaller and more complex such as in mobile communication with stateoftheart easytouse computed tomography systems the comet group equips its customers to inspect even the most minute parts exactly and rapidly for defects thus streamlining and safeguarding quality assurance in production processes radio frequency technology comet s radio frequency rf technology is the basis for the manufacturing of advanced touchscreens and memory chips used in smartphones tablets and other devices the production of storage media requires ever more rapid and precise plasma deposition to power the development and fabrication of new d chip structures that demands highperformance products like comet s vacuum capacitors impedance matching networks and rf generators similarly resourcesaving technologies such as solar cells and leds are only made possible by deposition processes using the latest radio frequency technology which the comet group develops and markets ebeam technology the innovative compact ebeam technology from the comet group helps realize significant savings in resource consumption such as when sterilizing beverage packaging and the group not only enables valuable resourcesaving alternatives to conventional manufacturing processes but also helps make these processes more profitable this is also the aim of additional ebeam applications now being developed by the comet group including the treatment of seeds curing of printing ink conversion and improvement of materials and sterilization of various surfaces  comet holding ag annual report  trends xray technology accident prevention through highly advanced imaging the need for safety and security inspection is constantly rising everywhere from passenger screening at airports to the construction of buildings new measures and processes are being introduced to improve security and safety this is also true in automotive manufacturing where the key aim of greater vehicle safety is achieved mainly through improvements in technology and materials additionally subsectors like the tire industry seek ways of optimizing manufacturing costs one possible source of cost savings is in materials but using less material whether in tires or elsewhere means the material that is used must stand up to greater stresses this is where extremely reliable testing and examination of materials is indispensable as even the smallest defects can have farreaching consequences their effective elimination requires advanced powerful imaging technologies that afford full insight into the quality attributes of the products tested in developing such solutions the comet group can draw on its decades of experience in xray and computed tomography thus a ct system from yxlon allows tires to be scanned at power levels of up to  kv and imaged threedimensionally this ct inspection is possible even while the tires are under load during simulation of the forces and stresses of road use the behavior of the material can thus be analyzed even during simulated driving a unique capability it lets manufacturers achieve ideal combinations of product quality and material efficiency and contribute to traffic safety  comet holding ag geschäftsbericht  trends quality and efficient use of materials with yct tire from yxlon tire makers achieve the ideal combination of quality and material efficiency stefan moll president xray systems zero defects view inside a tire   all truck tires made worldwide must be xrayed and inspected for defects by the manufacturer on passenger tires

technology from comet innovation in components for electronic devices from desktops and laptops to tablets smartphones and recently phablets is hurtling along at a breathtaking pace gadgets are becoming ever faster smarter and above all more compact but ultimately even miniaturization in electronics runs into limits imposed by the laws of physics this is now the case in conventional flat memory chips where power densities have reached the maximum possible yet big data and the internet of things demand continuing growth in storage capacity a promising solution are novel d chips with vertically stacked memory structures which far outperform conventional chips major companies like samsung and intel are working in overdrive on such models producing these highly complex chips also requires much faster and more exact vapor deposition methods while the coating necessary for a conventional chip took four repeated deposition passes a d chip needs as many as  to manufacture these nextgeneration chips competitively the deposition techniques must be made significantly faster that in turn necessitates powerful reliable radio frequency solutions this is where the comet group has much to offer its partners in close collaboration with suppliers in the electronics industry the company develops solutions and products to advance the fabrication of d integrated circuits with new rf fasttuning solutions pioneered by comet the development of d chips should take another big leap forward  comet holding ag annual report  trends d chips do more more demanding fabrication rf solutions from comet many times more power in the same space credits intel  up to  deposition passes are needed in the production of d chips compared to four passes for conventional chips d chips are the future of the electronics industry and they require powerful fast radio frequency solutions michael kammerer president plasma control technologies  comet holding ag annual report  trends ebeam technology fit for the future with blue technology the world s population is growing fast over  billion people now live on earth every year this number swells by about  million while humanity wants ever better food clothing transportation and entertainment the resources which the planet as an ecosystem can supply are finite and the resource deficit is alarming time is short for finding a way out of this dilemma but changes in individual consumer behavior or new laws are difficult to push through globally and much too slow the answer lies in revolutionary new technologies that help satisfy the growing consumer needs with fewer resources green technologies such as solar and wind energy are steps in the right direction yet they are in many cases too expensive even with government subsidies more beneficial are socalled blue technologies which not only help conserve resources but also boost productivity and are thus highly appealing economically as well one such blue technology is ebeam developed by the comet group thanks to converting to ebeam comet s partner tetra pak is able to significantly lower co  emissions from the sterilization of beverage packaging cut energy consumption and eliminate chemicals what is more ebeam also helps drive a vast improvement in productivity leading to a compelling cost reduction of  for the consumer in other words ebeam is instrumental in lowering resource consumption and raising competitiveness the future belongs to blue technologies like ebeam predestined to play a key role in resolving the global bottleneck of resource overuse  comet holding ag annual report  trends we have liftoff with tetra pak blue is the new green tetra pak has launched the rollout the future belongs to blue technologies they not only save the planet s
