operates with a small signal resistant to vibration impact and excellent moisture resistance ・excellent in environmental characteristics with no noise specifications  operating principle  ssr for ac loads zerocross type the zerocrossing ssr uses a phototransistor or photo trial coupler to isolate the input from the output see fig when the input signal is activated the internal zerocrossing detector circuit triggers the trial to turn on as the ac load voltage crosses zero the load current is maintained by the trial’s latching effect after the input signal is deactivated until the trial is turned off when the load voltage crosses zero resistive loads since resistive loads cause no phase shift between the voltage and current the trial turns on when the ac load voltage crosses zero after the input signal is activated the ssr turns off when the ac load voltage crosses zero and the load current is turned off after the input signal is subsequently deactivated inductive loads the ssr turns on when the load voltage crosses zero after the input signal activated it turns off when the loads current subsequently cresses zero after the input signal is deactivated a phase difference between the voltage and current may supply a transient spike to the ssr when it is turned off while the snuffer circuit allsorts this spike an excessively large spike may result in a dvdt error in the ssr’s internal triad capacitive loads when the input voltage applied approximates the ac supply voltage peak value no current will flow to the ssr output circuit immediately as the ac supply voltage falls close to zero the ssr output circuit triac turns on to pass current to the load circuit when this occurs the load current will have a phase lead of up to  degrees relative to the ac supply voltage phase then the ssr will not turn off until the load current falls to less than or below the triac holding current not immediately after the input voltage turns off please note that due to the capacitive load a voltage which is twice the supply voltage peak value may be applied to the ssr as the voltage from the charge stored in the capacitor is added to the supply voltage we recommend using an ssr for v when used with a supply voltage of v  for dc loads transistor output input and output are isolated by the photo coupler the output side comprises the waveform shaping circuit amplifier circuit and output element transistor when switched on current flows to the photo trial coupler led and the opticallycoupled phototransistor turns on driving the output element transistor through the shaping circuit and amplifier circuit in this way the load current flows when the transistor is turned on when switched off the phototransistor and then transistor turn off shutting off the load current fet output input and output are isolated by the photo coupler the output side comprises the driving circuit and output element mosfet when switched on current flows to the photo trial coupler led and electromotive force is generated in the opticallycoupled photodiode array this electromotive force drives the output element mosfet gate in this way the load current flows when the mosfet is turned on when switched off the electromotive force from the photodiode array disappears the electrical charge stored in the mosfet gate is discharged through the driving circuit the mosfet turns off shutting off the load current resistive loads when the input voltage is applied current flows to the load immediately when the input voltage is turned off the load current immediately becomes zero inductive loads when the input voltage is applied current begins flowing to the load in this case as it is an inductive load time lags occur until the load current returns to the steady state when the input voltage is turned off the load current gradually decreases to zero  application circuits  solid state relay ssr driving circuit example when operated by limit switches and the like when the contacts are on the ssr is on when operated by npn transistors when the transistor is on the ssr is on when operated by npn transistors when the transistor is off the ssr is on when operated by pnp transistors when the transistor is on the ssr is on when operated by pnp transistors when the transistor is off the ssr is on ac driving driving ssrs for dc input with ac power supply is possible by external attachment of a rectifier circuit please check that the ripple is within the ssr operation voltage range when operated by ttl or dtl when the ic output is at l level the ssr is on when operated by cmos ic when the ic output is at l level the ssr is on when operated by cmos ic when the ic output is at h level the ssr is on when operated by cmos ic when the ic output is at l level the ssr is on  control examples of various loads light bulb flashing control because a large inrush current approximately ten times the steady state flows to a light bulb when it is lit please use within the range of the respective surge current properties electric furnace temperature control solenoid valve driving in solenoid load inrush current flows in initial operation with steady current flowing after several cycles please use within the range of the respective surge current properties miniature relay driving circuit miniature relay operation current is small with some operating at several ma miniature relays may operate with the leak current flows when an ssr is off to avoid this it is necessary to connect a shunt resistor r in parallel with the load and shunt the leak current when an ssr is off neon lamp flashing control please connect a shunt resistor r in parallel with a neon lamp to prevent leak current causing glow discharge from the neon lamp when an ssr is in the off state onoff control of singlephase inductive motor because inrush current flows to a motor in initial operation please use within the range of the respective surge current properties forward and reverse operation of singlephase inductive motor the voltage between the ssr load terminals of whichever of ssr  or ssr  is turned off is approximately twice as high as the power supply voltage due to the properties of the motor lc circuit therefore please be sure to use an ssr with a rated voltage of twice the supply voltage please provide for a time lag in switchover at least ms is necessary selection of protective resistance r protective resistance r protects the ssr from damage due to over current the resistance value is derived from the maximum surge current rating non repetitive of the power supply voltage and the ssr r  √ x power supply voltage ÷ maximum surge current rating non repetitive the power resistance p is derived from the load current and protective resistance r values p  load current x r when making a selection we recommend leaving a buffer by selecting models of at least twice the calculated value onoff control of threephase inductive motor because inrush current flows to a motor in initial operation please take care when selecting ssrs two ssrs are inserted into two of the three threephase lines in this circuit the motor and power supply are always connected and the motor being electrically charged requires caution concerning the motor’s insulation degradation and risk of electric shock to ensure safety it is ideal to connect a nofuse breaker at the stage before the ssr and to disconnect the power supply when not in use onoff control of threephase heater please apply sufficient voltage to the ssr input side within the input voltage range when using a threephase star connection with the neutral point earthed over voltage may be applied to the ssr if the neutral point is disconnected leading to malfunction be sure to make connections securely precautions contact us ＞ ssr products product discontinuation and replacement notification precautions ＞ ac power controller ＞ sensor ＞ crystal device ＞ energy  cost saving
