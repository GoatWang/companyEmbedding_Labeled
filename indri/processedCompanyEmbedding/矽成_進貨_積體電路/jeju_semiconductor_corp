competitiveness emlsi has gained its prestige as a company specialized in memory chips now we focus more on mobile memory chips based on successful advancements high speed high density and low power technologyunlike a dram requiring accumulated electric charge in capacitor an sram consists of flipflop circuits and two transistors only hence no need for refreshment and electricity for refreshment process therefore an sdram eats up less electricity to retain data an ideal quality for mobile phones since active diodes in sram memory cells allow fast data transfer they can also be aptly used as cache memory for highcapacity highpowered computers such as engineering workstations or super computers technical reliability of our powersaving srams has already been proven in many field tests by major clients emlsi has a production system that can provide customers with complete lineup of m  m lowpower srams armed particularly with full cmos process technology which excels in lowpower activation and saving electricity we also adopt bga ball grid array method to our chips to shorten data transfer routes cut down on powerconsumption even further increase transfer speed and thus cater
