corporation nec tse  today announced that it provided faraday technology corporation a major fabless ic vendor in taiwan with cyberworkbench® a design tool capable of synthesizing application specific integrated circuit asicfield programmable gate array fpga circuits from the c programming language faraday is utilizing cyberworkbench cwb to design fpga for communication control the fpga are designed as an asic prototype for communication control with the scope of the products application scheduled to be extended to asic sales of cwb to faraday were conducted by necs partner avant technology inc cwb is an integrated design environment consisting of a highlevel synthesis tool as well as dynamic and static verification capabilities that shorten the design period by automatically converting the large scale integrated circuit lsi functions written in c language into circuits that satisfy both the circuit size area and performance needs cwb has been used for design control lsi for equipment that requires high reliability such as satellites communications equipment and backbone servers since its launch in  cwb has been introduced internationally to more than  companies in the manufacturing industry the physical communication layer is required to have low delay high frequency and low latency short operation cycle circuits due to the complex functions including error correction it is not easy even for an experienced register transfer level rtl designer to design a circuit that meets these two strict conditions this product offers a variety of synthesizing options to synthesize low delay and low latency circuits from the functions written in c language the use of these options facilitates  faraday to synthesize a circuit that satisfies the low delay and low latency specifications in the physical layer of highperformance communications equipment the function to be implemented in the circuit is written in c language in the initial design phase when designing a low latency circuit it is necessary to change the function written in c language into the contents that implement highperformance processing in conventional manual rtl design these changes require a great deal of fixing work and pose difficulties in terms of preventing errors from occurring as the use of this product facilitates faraday to automatically reflect the changes made in the functions written in c language in the circuits the company is now able to reduce the manual hours for design to one sixth and to help prevent errors from occurring nec has been focusing on the solutions for society business and it will contribute to the enhancement of corporate competitiveness by leveraging its experience in providing cwb to faraday and by increasing the sales of the product to the diverse manufacturers involved in lsi design said aritomo ishikawa general manager embedded business sales division nec corporation  about nec corporationnec corporation is a leader in
