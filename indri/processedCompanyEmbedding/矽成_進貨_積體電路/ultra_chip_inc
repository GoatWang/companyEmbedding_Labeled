pulsers tr switch ics cw transmitter ics resources training data sheets support sales product change notification medical ultrasound imaging system the ultrasound image is formed by applying the electrical pulses to the ultrasound transducers the transducers convert the electrical pulses to ultrasound waves by applying the acoustic coupling agents such as ultrasound gel between the ultrasound transducer probe surface and the skin the sound waves propagate into the tissue beneath and to the parts that need to be imaged when the sound waves hit a boundary between tissues part of the sound waves get reflected back to the transducer while some sound waves propagate further until they hit another tissue boundary and get reflected by receiving and processing the echoes the d image of the internal organs and structures can be formed medical ultrasound imaging systems provide a noninvasive way to diagnose a variety of diseases and conditions without the use of radiation in the past decade the medical ultrasound imaging systems had been evolved from the traditional large size trolleybased system to more lightweight  portable system the new lightweight and portable systems are
