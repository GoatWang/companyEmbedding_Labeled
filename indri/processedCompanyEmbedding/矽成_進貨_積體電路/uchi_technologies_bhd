module such as that of coffee machine and saturated paper for pcb lamination   another fully owned subsidiary company uchi optoelectronic m sdn bhd is involved in design research development and manufacturing of touch screen advance display high precision light measurement optoelectronic equipments mixed signal control system for centrifugelaboratory equipments mixed signal microprocessor based application and system integration products   the electronic control modules segment particularly the artofliving products ie highend consumer electrical appliances was the highest contributor to the group’s income at approximately  meanwhile biotechnology products ie laboratory and industrial equipment which contribution has been negligible in the past have started increasing its contribution to  in the last financial year and set to increase further to  in the future  of the total revenue is derived from exports to europe   uchi’s past financial performance table  below shows the performance of uchi for the last  years   table  revenue and profit of uchitech year          revenue in million          net profit million          eps sen          dividend  sen            uchi’s revenue and net income dropped drastically from its peaks of m and m in  to m and m in  respectively due to the us sublime financial crisis it attempted and succeeded to recover somewhat in  but the recovery was stunted due to the slow recovery of the european economy however uchi’s business remains highly profitable with positive earnings and good cash flow every year including during the financial crisis this shows the durability of its business model however i must say many do not  like this type of performance especially those who dont see the so called profit growth in the last few years it is understandable we are talking about potential in the future though   the secret weapon uchi has been paying more than  of its earnings as dividend each year its balance sheet remains healthy with more than m cash in bank and zero debt all these years cash has depleted a little the last  years but it is mainly because it spent a lot of money in capital expenses improving its edge of its core business within its circle of competence m in all the last three years where did the money come from   yes the secrets lie in its margins uchi’s gross margin has been consistently in the high  every year for at least the last  years that itself demonstrate the high quality o fits business   “in business i look for economic castles protected by unbreachable ‘moats’”warren buffet    company which earns a gross margin of above  consistently must have an economic moat uchi’s net profit margin has also been consistently way above    the high margin provide it with another secret the high return on capital is it a secret i thought i have been talking about the importance of high return on capital when we want to invest in a company its return on equity roe was  in  and dropped to its lowest of  last year not because of the competition driving down its margin but lower revenue due to the economic crisis in its main market in europe nevertheless the  roe without any debt is still way above its cost of equity if the european economy recovers uchi would be able to recover to its former glory yes uchi just need to have more business so what is the chance that uchi will recover and is able to continue to pay high dividend   how does the market value uchi at the close of rm and a trailing twelve month eps of  sen as at th june  uchi is trading at a pe ratio of  and an enterprise value of  times its earnings before interest and tax these valuations are undemanding considering its highly efficient operations business stable earnings and cash flows a healthy balance sheet and high dividend yield   what the future entails for uchi “mario draghi president of the european central bank has finally announced that the bank plans to engage in a form of quantitative easing” forbes magazine   httpwwwforbescomsitesjonhartleydraghiscaseforecbquantitativeeasing   is uchi ready for a probability of the recovery of the european economy below is an abstract from its  annual report   “in  we continued our practice of investing substantially in rd further cementing our technological leadership position in the marketplace our successful bid for pioneer status will see our product mix expand to include touch screen advanced displays high precision light measurement optoelectronic equipment and mix signal control systems for centrifugelaboratory equipment according to the incentive scheme  of the statutory income derived from the design  development and manufacture of these products will be exempted from income tax for a period of five years commencing from the day of production however arguably the most significant development particularly in terms of environmental impact comes from the group’s contribution in the design and manufacture of energysaving modules for household and office equipment which comply with european ecodesign requirements… in accordance with a new directive that will take effect from january   the group continued to invest heavily in our rd endeavours in  it therefore gives us great pleasure to announce that we have expanded our rd product lines that are scheduled to be launched in  in embracing green technology aside from the new energysaving compliant projects that will be launched under the art ofliving product line we are also developing inverter technology and its extended application to further improve the energy efficiency and wakeup time of products among others our formidable rd team is well equipped with the technology and knowhow to offer practical and innovative solutions in the shortest timeframe” a technology company consistently spending money for research and development from its internally generated fund and yielding positive results is what is needed to be successful if phillip fisher is still alive uchi would have got him drooling   second quarter report ended th june  uchi reported its second quarterly report for the financial year  on th august  its revenue still remains subdue but net profit for the two quarters has improved by about  to rmm one interesting thing is its capital expenses has reduced to just  so with the low capital expenses required for it near future it would have abundant free cash flow which will continue to sustain its high dividend payout policy uchi also reported a very important development that the application for the pioneer status for their new products namely touch screen advance display high precision light measurement equipment and mix signal control system for centrifugelaboratory equipment has been approved by mida the tax saving will enhance the profitability and free cash flow of the company and hence its divided is uchi going to reap its fruits in the near future the future is unknowable and unpredictable i can only base on the information i can gather and provide a novice opinion   conclusion uchi has demonstrated that it is a great company with high quality and durable business with an economic moat with its consistent high margins and high return on capital there also seems to be a good future growth story to tell with its attaining the investment pioneer status from mida and its success in research and development meeting stringent client and regulatory requirements placing it ahead of its competitors thanks to the good capital allocation of the management the most recent quarterly report appears to prove the plausibility of the turnaround story most of all it is selling at a beaten down price and hence good value in my opinion investors looking for high dividend

people like this   screwdriver thanks kc for highlighting this company   stockoperator i wonder why kc should look at possibly turnaround story at this stage where as there are so many winners in your portfolio with so much good business value i remember when warren first closed down his funds in s and reinvested back few years later and he never did that again in the next  years until today and he was only at the buy side on each crisis  crisis is no different again know why the experience taught him well we are so amazed how fast the stocks with good business value bounced back and even higher and he was so right in every crisis till now he knows the what the winners will do he knows what good business is what can destroy the good business value inflation recession currency devalue nothing has proven the case so far this is not what i say but the market has said so i have  trust in your portfolio and stock selection surely it will go higher and keep performing   kcchongnz posted by stockoperator  oct    am  report abuse i wonder why kc should look at possibly turnaround story at this stage where as there are so many winners in your portfolio with so much good business value stockoperator you are not the only one doubtful of my pick here just like one big market player who thought the same and i believe many others also think so but you must state exactly which part of my analysis is wrong i am sure there are many there is only that much i know the company has been having negative growth in earnings and profit for the last few years an hence the dwindling of its share price but it has a moat a moat clearly shown in its return on invested capital it has spent quite some money in rd the lifeblood of its technology business this is the case i used to talk about head i win tail i dont lose much i could be wrong but at least for now its share price at rm has not gone down despite the recent steep decline of the whole market   comment           activegainerslosers top
