solutions by vertically integrating the entire process from epi wafers chips packages modules blu light for leds making a leap toward becoming a global led leader we impress our customers by gaining recognition for reliability through strict qualitycontrol of all led production processes and offering highly efficient and safe products that have acquired standards such as the ce and ul leds are ecofriendly sources of light as they do not contain hazardous materials such as mercury and lead and use less power thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions with semipermanent lifetime leds have a long replacement cycle and thus reduce waste discharge if two compounds a ptype semiconductor with positive electric properties and an ntype semiconductor with negative properties are connected to allow an electric current to flow an led emits light some leds emit infrared and ultraviolet rays as well as visible rays as to visible rays red green and blue leds are mixed to create the color of the desired light making it possible to express all colors from white to red and violet a white led emitting more natural light is achieved by combining the three primary colors of red green and blue or by applying a fluorescent substance to a blue light source high efficiency a highly efficient source of light converting about  of electric energy to light energy an led consumes less power saving more than  of electric charges than a fluorescent lamp long lifetime the life of leds is  hours which is longer than those of fluorescent  hours and incandescent  hours lamps due to their long replacement cycle leds are costsaving ecofriendliness unlike previous fluorescent and incandescent lamps leds are environmentfriendly light sources without hazardous materials such as mercury and lead less powerconsuming and highefficient led products can reduce carbon dioxide emissions ultra slim it is possible to design an ultraslim led light source which enhances design freedom for product applications this in turn makes it possible to produce superslim digital products such as tvs notebooks and mobile phones and to design an innovative structure for lights that go beyond the design limitations of traditional lamps safety an led is a safe light source which withstands impact and is easily designed to resist damage based on its core led technology and stateoftheart facilities lg innotek has vertically integrated the entire led production process and maximized synergy effects between business areas thereby launching itself as a global led leader manufacturing wafers by growing compound semiconductors on a sapphire substrate forming epi wafer electrodes and cutting the wafer into individual chips protecting chips from external forces and processing them for each application area for commercialization attaching an led package to a specific frame considering the characteristics and combination properties required for each application lg innoteks led products are used in
