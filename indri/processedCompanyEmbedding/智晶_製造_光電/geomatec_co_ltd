and the negative electrode collector layer are formed by a sputtering method description technical fieldthe present invention relates to a thinfilm solid secondary cell and more particularly to a thinfilm solid secondary cell which can be reduced in thickness and size background artat the present day a lithiumion secondary cell is extensively used mainly in electronic devices eg a portable device that is because the lithiumion secondary cell has a high voltage and high chargedischarge capacity but does not have a problem in a memory effect as compared with a nickelcadmium cell and others further a further reduction in sizeweight has been advanced in electronic devices and others and development for a reduction in sizeweight has also been promoted in the lithiumion secondary cell as a battery which is mounted on the electronic devices and others for example a lithiumion secondary cell which can be mounted in an ic card a medical small device and others and reduced in thicknesssize has been developed furthermore demanding a further reduction in thicknesssize in the future can be expected in a conventional lithiumion secondary cell a metal piece or a metal foil is used for a positive electrode and a negative electrode and these electrodes are immersed in an electrolytic solution and covered with a container to be used therefore there is a limit in a reduction in thickness or size in practice a thickness of approximately  mm and a volume of approximately  cm are considered as a limit however in recent years a polymer cell using a gel electrolyte not an electrolytic solution see eg patent document  or a thinfilm solid secondary cell see eg patent documents  to  using a solid electrolyte has been developed to enable a further reduction in thickness and size the polymer cell disclosed in patent document  is constituted by sequentially arranging a positive electrode collector a composite positive electrode containing a polymer solid electrolyte an electrolyte layer composed of an ionconducting polymer compound a composite negative electrode containing a polymer solid electrolyte and a negative electrode collector in an exterior body such a polymer cell can be reduced in thickness and size as compared with a regular lithiumion secondary cell using an electrolytic solution but its thickness is limited to approximately  mm because it requires a gel electrolyte a bond an opening sealing member and others and hence it is not appropriate to advance a further reduction in thickness or size on the other hand as disclosed in patent documents  to  the thinfilm solid secondary cell is configured by sequentially laminating a collector thin film a negative electrode active material thin film a solid electrolyte thin film a positive electrode active material thin film and a collector thin film on a substrate or by laminating these layers on the substrate in reverse order with such a configuration the thinfilm solid secondary cell can be reduced in thickness to approximately  µm except the substrate moreover when a thickness of the substrate is reduced or a solid electrolytic film having a reduced thickness is used in place of the substrate a further reduction in thickness or size is possible as a whole patent document  discloses a thinfilm solid secondary cell in which a lithium phosphate is used for a solid electrolyte layer and a vanadium oxide or a niobium oxide is used for a positive electrode layer and a negative electrode layer additionally in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to patent document  lithium is injected into a negative electrode side when lithium is injected into the negative electrode side in this manner since a negative electrode layer must be once taken out into the atmosphere after the negative layer is formed and lithium must be injected into this layer by using a lithium injection device the injection device is required and an injecting operation takes time and hence there is a problem that a formation time and a formation cost are additionally required further the negative electrode layer made of eg a vanadium oxide with lithium injected therein is apt to be oxidized and weak in moisture therefore degradation in properties of film eg oxidation or moisture absorbent is often caused when injecting lithium and there is a problem that the thinfilm solid secondary cell with excellent cell characteristics cannot be stably formed furthermore there is also a problem that processing a vanadium oxide is troublesome in a manufacturing process or during use of a cell since this material has poisonous properties moreover patent document  discloses a thinfilm solid secondary cell in which a lithium phosphate containing nitrogen is used for a solid electrolyte layer a metal oxide containing lithium is used for a positive electrode layer and a vanadium oxide is used for a negative electrode layer in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to patent document  as different from the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to patent document  since lithium is contained in a positive electrode material from the beginning a lithium injecting operation is not required a time and a cost required for this operation can be reduced and the thinfilm solid secondary cell with relatively good cell characteristics can be stably created however when a vanadium oxide is used for the negative electrode layer there is a problem that a voltage is rapidly reduced at the time of discharge and a capacity which can maintain a voltage equal to or above approximately  v required for driving a regular device is small as compared with a usual solution type secondary cell additionally as explained above there is a problem that the vanadium oxide is weak in moisture and processing this oxide is trouble since it has poisonous properties as explained above the vanadium oxide used as the negative electrode material has a problem in processing and cell characteristics however when a lithium phosphate which is stable and has relatively high ionconducting properties is used for the solid electrolyte layer a reaction occurs on an interface between any other negative electrode material and the lithium phosphate and another product is formed and hence a problem of degradation in cell characteristics occurs therefore when the lithium phosphate is used for the solid electrolyte layer the vanadium oxide is used as the negative electrode material on the other hand patent document  discloses a thinfilm solid secondary cell in which a lithiumion conductor a composite oxide composed of li ta nb n or o having a high ionconducting degree other than the lithium phosphate is used for a solid electrolyte layer a metal oxide eg licoo or limno containing lithium is used for a positive electrode layer and a material eg si or litio other than the vanadium oxide is used for a negative electrode layer patent document  japanese patent

japanese patent application laidopen no  pp  fig  disclosure of inventionproblem to be solved by the inventionaccording to the thinfilm solid secondary cells disclosed in patent documents  and  a cell which is of a type requiring injection of lithium has a problem that a creation time and a cost are additionally required and stable cell characteristics are hard to be obtained furthermore a cell which is of a type in which lithium is contained in an electrode material from the beginning has a problem that a voltage is reduced rapidly at the time of discharge moreover when the vanadium oxide is used for a negative electrode there is a problem that processing this material is troublesome since this material is weak in moisture and has poisonous properties on the other hand the thinfilm solid secondary cell disclosed in patent document  does not have a problem of the lithium injecting operation or use of the vanadium oxide however the thinfilm solid secondary cells disclosed in patent document  to  have a problem that the film is apt to be exfoliated when a film thickness is increased to heighten a chargedischarge capacity in particular in the thinfilm solid secondary cell disclosed in patent document  although an ionconducting material other than a lithium phosphate is used for the solid electrolyte to obtain excellent cell characteristics at least the positive electrode layer must be crystallized to acquire such excellent cell characteristics therefore the film is apt to be exfoliated it is an object of the present invention to provide a thinfilm solid secondary cell which can be readily processed rarely provokes film exfoliation and has excellent cell performance means for solving problemthe present invention provides a thinfilm solid secondary cell obtained by laminating a positive electrode collector layer a positive electrode active material layer a solid electrolyte layer a negative electrode active material layer and a negative electrode collector layer on a substrate wherein the positive electrode active material layer is a thin film formed of a metal oxide containing a transition metal and lithium the negative active material layer is a thin film formed of one of a semiconductor a metal an alloy and a metal oxide other than a vanadium oxide and the positive electrode active material layer the solid electrolyte layer and the negative electrode active material layer are amorphous thin films as explained above in the present invention of the positive electrode collector layer the positive electrode active material layer the solid electrolyte layer the negative electrode active material layer and the negative electrode collector layer formed on the substrate the positive electrode active material layer is the thinfilm composed of a metal oxide containing a transition metal and lithium whilst the negative electrode active material layer is the thinfilm composed of one of a semiconductor a metal an alloy and a metal oxide and hence lithium does not have to be injected on a later stage and a cell having excellent cell characteristics can be stably created with reduced manufacturing time and steps further since a vanadium oxide thin film is not included processing is not troublesome furthermore since the positive electrode active material layer the solid electrolyte layer and the negative electrode active material layer are amorphous the film is hardly exfoliated and stable cell characteristics can be maintained moreover it is suitable that a material forming the solid electrolyte layer is a lithium phosphate lipo or a lithium phosphate having nitrogen added therein lipon additionally it is suitable that a material forming the positive electrode active material layer is one of a lithiummanganese oxide a lithiumcobalt oxide a lithiumnickel oxide a lithiummanganesecobalt oxide and a lithiumtitanium oxide further a material forming the negative electrode active material layer is one of a lithiumtitanium oxide eg litio or litio  a niobium pentoxide nbo a siliconmanganese alloy simn a siliconcobalt alloy sico a siliconnickel alloy sini a nickel oxide nio a nickel oxide having lithium added therein nioli an indium oxide ino an indium oxide having tin added therein ito a tin oxide sno a tin oxide having antimony added therein ato a tin oxide having fluorine added therein fto a zinc oxide zno a zinc oxide having aluminum added therein azo a zinc oxide having gallium added therein gzo a titanium oxide tio a silicon semiconductor si a germanium semiconductor ge a lithium metal li a magnesium metal mg a magnesiumlithium alloy mgli an aluminum metal al and an aluminumlithium alloy ali further it was found that if a difference in electrode potential between the negative electrode active material layer and the positive electrode active material layer is  v or above a potential difference of  v or above is naturally produced between both the electrodes without charge from the outside when the thinfilm solid secondary film is discharged to nearly  v and then a period of time passes as a result the potential difference on a practical level is naturally produced and hence an electric device can be semipermanently driven furthermore it is suitable that an antimoisture film is laminated on the surface when the antimoisture film is formed on the surface in this manner the cell performance can be maintained for a long time moreover it is suitable that the positive electrode collector layer the positive electrode active material layer the solid electrolyte layer the negative electrode active material layer and the negative electrode collector layer are formed by a sputtering method effect of the inventionaccording to the present invention since at least the layers the positive electrode active material layer the solid electrolyte layer and the negative electrode active material layer other than the collector layers in the constituent thin films are amorphous a stress is small and film exfoliation hardly occurs even if the entire film thickness is increased to heighten the chargedischarge capacity additionally since a material containing lithium is used for the positive electrode active material layer lithium does not have to be injected on a later stage and the thinfilm solid secondary cell having excellent cell characteristics can be stably created with reduced manufacturing time and steps further the cell characteristics eg an increase in the chargedischarge capacity stabilization of cycle characteristics or a reduction in a speed of a voltage drop can be improved by specifying materials used for the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer furthermore since a vanadium oxide is not used for the negative electrode active material layer an influence of moisture is not given and poisonous properties do not become a problem and processing can be facilitated brief description of drawings fig  is a crosssectional view of a thinfilm solid secondary cell according to an embodiment of the present inventionfig  is a graph of chargedischarge

the positiveelectrodeside collector layer  and the antimoisture film  may be laminated on this order as the substrate  glass semiconductor silicon ceramics stainless or a resin substrate can be used as the resin substrate for example polyimide or pet can be used further a bendable thin film can be used for the substrate  if it can be processed without collapse of its shape as the collector layer  an electroconductive film having excellent adhesion for a positive electrode the positive electrode active material layer  and a negative electrode the negative electrode active material layer  and a low electric resistance can be used it is preferable for a sheet resistance of the collector layer  to be equal to or below  kω□ for the collector layer  to function as a fetch electrode when a film thickness of the collector layer  is set to approximately  µm or above the collector layer  must be formed of a material whose resistivity is equal to or below approximately × ω·cm as such a material for example vanadium aluminum copper nickel or gold can be used using such a material enables forming the collector layer  with a very small film thickness of approximately  to  µm which can reduce an electric resistivity as the positive electrode active material layer  a metal oxide thin film containing lithium and at least one or more of manganese cobalt and nickel which are transition metals enabling desorption and adsorption of a lithium ion can be used for example a lithiummanganese oxide eg limno limno a lithiumcobalt oxide eg licoo licoo a lithiumnickel oxide eg linio linio a lithiummanganesecobalt oxide eg limncoo limncoo or a lithiumtitanium oxide eg litio litio can be used although a film thickness of the positive electrode active material layer  which is as small as possible is desirable setting this film thickness to approximately  to  µm which enables assuring a chargedischarge capacity can suffice as the solid electrolyte layer  a lithium phosphate lipo or a lithium phosphate having nitrogen added therein lipon having excellent lithium ionconducting properties can be used as a film thickness of the solid electrolyte layer  a very thin thickness of approximately  to  µm in which occurrence of pin holes is reduced is preferable as the negative electrode active material layer  a semiconductor a metal a metal alloy or a metal oxide other than a vanadium oxide can be used as the semiconductor for example silicon si or germanium ge can be used as the metal or the metal alloy for example a lithium metal li a magnesium metal mg an aluminum metal

thereingzo or a titanium oxide tio can be used although a thickness film of the negative electrode active material layer  which is as small as possible is desirable setting this film thickness to approximately  to  µm which enables assuring a chargedischarge capacity can suffice further a surface of the thinfilm solid secondary cell  exposed to atmospheric air is covered with the antimoisture film  having an antimoisture effect adopting this structure enables maintaining cell performance as long as possible as the antimoisture film  a silicon oxide sio or a silicon nitride sinx can be used a film thickness of the antimoisture film  is reduced as much as possible and approximately  to  µm having the high antimoisture effect is preferable as a method of forming each of the thin films for example a vacuum film forming method such as a sputtering method an electron beam evaporation method or a heating evaporation method or a coating method can be used preferably it is good to use the vacuum film forming method which can uniformly form a thinner film more preferably it is good to use the sputtering method which can uniformly form a film with a reduced shift of an evaporation material and an atomic composition furthermore in this example in order to avoid crystallization of at least the layers other than the collector layer  at the time of film formation the films of all the constituent layers are formed without being heated and a temperature of the substrate at the end of film formation is maintained at °c or below as explained above in the thinfilm solid secondary cell  according to this example at least the layers other than the collector layer  are formed into amorphous layers and hence an internal stress is reduced and film exfoliation hardly occurs in the thinfilm solid secondary cell  when charging is carried out lithium is desorbed as an ion from the positive electrode active material layer  and it is adsorbed by the negative electrode active material layer  through the solid electrolyte layer  at this time electrons are discharged to the outside from the positive electrode active material layer  moreover at the time of discharge lithium is desorbed as an ion from the negative electrode active material layer  and it is adsorbed by the positive electrode active material layer  through the solid electrolyte layer  at this time electrons are discharged to the outside from the negative electrode active material layer  additionally in the thinfilm solid secondary cell  according to this example materials used for the respective layers are selected in such a manner that a difference in electrode potential between the positive electrode active material layer  and the negative electrode active material layer  becomes approximately  v or above here when materials used for the positive electrode active material layer  and the negative electrode active material layer  were selected to create the thinfilm solid secondary cell  in such a manner that a difference in electrode potential becomes large and this thinfilm solid secondary cell  was used to repeatedly perform charge and discharge an inventor of this application found that in the thinfilm solid secondary cell  according to this example a potential difference between both the electrodes becomes approximately  when discharge is performed and then the potential difference of  v or above naturally occurs between both the electrodes after both the electrodes are left for a while that is it can be considered that a force of returning to an electrically equilibrium state acts on the thinfilm solid secondary cell  when the electrodes are left after discharge a lithium ion naturally moves from the positive electrode side to the negative electrode side and a voltage is naturally increased examples and comparative examples according to the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings table  and figs  to  show structures and

fact that a diffraction peak does not appear was consequently confirmed as a result it was confirmed that all the constituent layers are amorphous then in order to evaluate the cell performance a chargedischarge measurement instrument was used to measure chargedischarge characteristics as measurement conditions currents at the time of both charge and discharge were  ma and voltages aborting

and it was confirmed that all the constituent layers in the thinfilm solid secondary cell are amorphous in the measurement of the chargedischarge characteristics it was confirmed that the thinfilm solid secondary cell repeatedly demonstrates a chargedischarge operation fig  shows a graph of chargedischarge characteristics in a th cycle stably demonstrating the chargedischarge operation a discharge start voltage and a charge start voltage in the th cycle in which the chargedischarge operation is stable were respectively  v and  v and a charge capacity and a discharge capacity were respectively  mah and  mah additionally a discharge capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above required to drive a regular device was approximately  mah comparing the chargedischarge characteristics of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and comparative example  in figs  to  it can be understood that a voltage at the time of discharge is rapidly reduced in comparative example  as compared with examples  to  further it can be revealed from table  that there is no large difference in charge and discharge capacities between comparative example  and examples  to  but a discharge capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above in comparative example  is  or below of those in examples  to  furthermore when the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to the comparative example charged to  v was used to drive a digital clock the digital clock was continuously driven for about  days this period is  or below of a period of one month or more where continuous driving is possible in examples  to  and it substantially corresponds to a period where a voltage of  v or above can be maintained moreover in the comparative example since a charge start voltage was approximately  v and the voltage was increased to  v only after discharge the digital clock was not able to be driven without being charged after discharge additionally a voltage immediately after creation was approximately  v and hence the digital clock was not able to be driven as it is comparative example  in comparative example  a thinfilm solid secondary cell having the structure depicted in fig  was created by a sputtering method layers other than a positive electrode active material layer  were formed with the same materials the same film thicknesses and the same film forming conditions as those in example  although the same lithium manganate limno as that in example  was used for the positive electrode active material layer  in this example the film was formed at a substrate temperature of °c a diffraction peak appeared in the xray diffraction measurement this diffraction peak can be identified from an limno spinel structure and it was confirmed that the positive electrode active material layer  formed of limno is crystallized in the measurement of the chargedischarge characteristics although it was confirmed that substantially the same chargedischarge characteristics as those in example  were demonstrated in the first five cycles but film exfoliation occurred in the subsequent cycles and the measurement was impossible comparative example  in comparative example  a thinfilm solid secondary cell having the structure depicted in fig  was created by a sputtering method layers other than a solid electrolyte layer  were formed with the same materials the same film thicknesses and the same film forming conditions as those in example  although the same lithium phosphate lipo as that in example  was used for the solid electrolyte layer  the film was formed at a substrate temperature of °c a diffraction peak appeared in the xray diffraction measurement this diffraction peak can be identified from a crystal structure of lipo and it was confirmed that the solid electrolyte layer  formed of lipo is crystallized in the measurement of the chargedischarge characteristics although it was confirmed that substantially the same chargedischarge characteristics as those in example  were demonstrated in the first three cycles but film exfoliation occurred in the subsequent cycles and the measurement was impossible in comparative example  a vanadium oxide vo is used as the negative electrode active material layer  on the other hand in examples  to  a lithiumtitanium oxide litio an simn alloy and the like other than the vanadium oxide vo are used as shown in table  and figs  to  in comparative example  a voltage is rapidly decreased at the time of discharge and a capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above with which a device can be driven is just  mah on the other hand in examples  to  and examples  to  a capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above is approximately  mah or above which is approximately three times that in comparative example  additionally in example  having a relatively small capacity a capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above is  mah or above which is approximately two or more times that in comparative example  further when each thinfilm solid secondary cell was charged to  v and then a digital clock which can be driven with a voltage of  v or above was driven the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to comparative example  was able to continuously drive the digital clock for about  days alone whereas the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to example  continuously drove the digital clock for about  days which is approximately double the value in comparative example  and the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and examples  to  continuously drove the digital clock for about  days which is three times the value in comparative example  as explained above since the lithiumtitanium oxide the simn alloy or the like is used for the negative electrode active material layer according to the examples a speed of a reduction in voltage at the time of discharge becomes moderate and the capacity which enables maintaining a voltage of  v or above required to practically drive a device can be increased as compared with the thinfilm solid secondary cell in which the vanadium oxide vo is used for the negative electrode active material like the comparative examples furthermore the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to the examples can be created without using the vanadium oxide which has a difficulty in processing because of its poisonous properties and weakness in moisture moreover in nearly half of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  as explained above after discharge a voltage is naturally increased to  v or above after a while as a result in each thinfilm solid secondary cell in which a voltage is naturally increased to  v or above after discharge a regular digital clock which is driven with a voltage of  v or above can be continuously driven by just leaving the cell for a while after discharge without charging the cell from the outside on the other hand in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to comparative example  a voltage is increased to just  v after discharge and it was not able to drive the digital clock without being charged from the outside as explained above in comparative example  the cell was not naturally charged to a voltage which enables driving a liquid crystal clock it can be considered that the thinfilm solid secondary cells enable a voltage to be naturally increased to  v or above after discharge so that each cell can be charged according to examples  to  because a potential difference between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer is large and each secondary cell is of a full solid thinfilm type that is when an electrolyte is of a solution type even if a potential difference between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer is large a reaction is produced on an electrode surface when discharge is performed to nearly  v and the cell cannot function it can be considered that there is no example of reports of solution type secondary cells which can be naturally charged without being charged from the outside because its cell function is lost when discharge is carried out to nearly  v however since each secondary cell according to the examples is of a fullsolid thinfilm type its inside is not transformed even though discharge is carried out to nearly  v and hence its cell function is not degraded as a result in each thinfilm solid secondary cell according to the examples charge and discharge can be repeatedly performed to nearly  v additionally since the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to the examples is created by using a combination of materials having a large potential difference between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer it can be considered that such a cell can be naturally charged to  v or above without being charged from the outside because a force of returning to an equilibrium state acts on each layer as explained above in the thinfilm solid secondary cell in which a voltage is naturally increased to  v or above after discharge in the examples a material forming each layer is selected in such a manner that a potential difference between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer becomes large and a voltage is naturally increased to an equilibrium state to charge the cell after discharge to nearly  v without charging the cell from the outside furthermore a practical digital clock which can be driven with a voltage of  v or above can be repeatedly driven without being charged from the outside moreover in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to comparative examples  and  the positive electrode active material layer or the solid electrolyte layer is crystallized a large stress is produced when a lithium ion moves during chargedischarge resulting in film exfoliation on the other hand in each of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  since at least the layers other than the collector layers are amorphous films a stress produced during chargedischarge can be suppressed film exfoliation does not occur even if chargedischarge is repeated and stable cell characteristics are demonstrated as explained above in each thinfilm solid secondary cell according to the examples since at least the layers other than the collector layers are amorphous a stress can be reduced and film exfoliation hardly occurs example  in example  a silicon nitride thin film sin as an antimoisture film  was formed on a surface exposed to atmospheric air by a sputtering method in each of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and comparative example  that is the silicon nitride thin film was formed on an exposed surface of a collector layer  on a negative electrode side the antimoisture film  was formed by an rf magnetron sputtering method using an si semiconductor target and introducing a nitrogen gas the film was formed with an rf power of  kw without heating as a result the silicon nitride thin film of  µm was formed when chargedischarge characteristics of a thinfilm solid secondary cell covered with the thus obtained antimoisture film  were measured immediately after production charge and discharge voltages and charge and discharge capacities which are respectively equivalent to those in each of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and comparative example  which are not covered with the antimoisture film  were obtained the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and comparative example  were left in a room as they are and chargedischarge characteristics of these cells were again measured after about one month as a result in each of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  which are not covered with the antimoisture film  the discharge capacity was reduced approximately  except example  in example  the discharge capacity was reduced approximately  moreover in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to comparative example  which is not covered with the antimoisture film  the discharge capacity was reduced approximately  these reductions in discharge capacity occur because cell characteristics are degraded when each thinfilm solid secondary cell absorbs moisture in atmospheric air the metal the alloy and the oxide used for the negative electrode in example  and comparative example  are materials which are apt to absorb moisture in particular in the thinfilm solid secondary cell according to comparative example  in which the vanadium oxide vo is used for the negative electrode active material layer it was revealed that the cell has weakness in resistance against moisture on the other hand in each of the thinfilm solid secondary cells according to examples  to  and comparative example  which are covered with the antimoisture film  a reduction in chargedischarge capacities was not observed in the measurement after one month as explained above it can be understood that the thinfilm solid secondary cell has durability against moisture in air and its cell characteristics are hardly degraded when the surface is covered with the

mold and particularly to a mold which has a porous alumina layer over its surface in this specification the “mold” includes molds that are for use in various processing methods stamping and casting and is sometimes referred to as a stamper the “mold” can also be used for printing including nanoimprintingbackground artdisplay devices for use in tvs cell phones etc and optical elements such as camera lenses etc usually adopt an antireflection technique in order to reduce the surface reflection and increase the amount of light transmitted therethrough this is because when light is transmitted through the interface between media of different refractive indices eg when light is incident on the interface between air and glass the amount of transmitted light decreases due to for example fresnel reflection thus deteriorating the visibilityan antireflection technique which has been receiving attention in recent years is forming over a substrate surface a very small uneven pattern in which the interval of recessed portions or raised portions is not more than the wavelength of visible light λ nm to  nm see patent documents  to  the twodimensional size of a raised portion of an uneven pattern which performs an antireflection function is not less than  nm and less than  nmthis method utilizes the principles of a socalled motheye structure the refractive index for light that is incident on the substrate is continuously changed along the depth direction of the recessed portions or raised portions from the refractive index of a medium on which the light is incident to the refractive index of the substrate whereby reflection of a wavelength band that is subject to antireflection is preventedthe motheye structure is advantageous in that it is capable of performing an antireflection function with small incident angle dependence over a wide wavelength band as well as that it is applicable to a number of materials and that an uneven pattern can be directly formed in a substrate as such a highperformance antireflection film or antireflection surface can be provided at a low costas the method of forming a motheye structure using an anodized porous alumina layer which is obtained by means of anodization of aluminum has been receiving attention patent documents  to now the anodized porous alumina layer which is obtained by means of anodization of aluminum is briefly described conventionally a method of forming a porous structure by means of anodization has been receiving attention as a simple method for making nanometerscale micropores very small recessed portions in the shape of a circular column in a regular arrangement an aluminum base is immersed in an acidic electrolytic solution of sulfuric acid oxalic acid phosphoric acid or the like or an alkaline electrolytic solution and this is used as an anode in application of a voltage which causes oxidation and dissolution the oxidation and the dissolution concurrently advance over a surface of the aluminum base to form an oxide film which has micropores over its surface the micropores which are in the shape of a circular column are oriented vertical to the oxide film and exhibit a selforganized regularity under certain conditions voltage electrolyte type temperature etc thus this anodized porous alumina layer is expected to be applied to a wide variety of functional materialsa porous alumina layer formed under specific conditions includes cells in the shape of a generally regular hexagon which are in a closest packed twodimensional arrangement when seen in a direction perpendicular to the film surface each of the cells has a micropore at its center the arrangement of the micropores is periodic the cells are formed as a result of local dissolution and growth of a coating the dissolution and growth of the coating concurrently advance at the bottom of the micropores which is referred to as a barrier layer as known the interval between adjacent micropores the distance between the centers is approximately twice the thickness of the barrier layer and is approximately proportional to the voltage that is applied during the anodization it is also known that the diameter of the micropores depends on the type concentration temperature etc of the electrolytic solution but is usually about ⅓ of the size of the cells the length of the longest diagonal of the cell when seen in a direction vertical to the film surface such micropores of the porous alumina may constitute an arrangement which has a high regularity periodicity under specific conditions an arrangement with a regularity degraded to some extent depending on the conditions or an irregular nonperiodic arrangementpatent document  discloses a method of producing an antireflection film antireflection surface with the use of a stamper which has an anodized porous alumina film over its surfacepatent document  discloses the technique of forming tapered recesses with continuously changing pore diameters by repeating anodization of aluminum and a pore diameter increasing processthe applicant of the present application discloses in patent document  the technique of forming an antireflection film with the use of an alumina layer in which very small recessed portions have stepped lateral surfacesas described in patent documents   and  by providing an uneven structure macro structure which is greater than a motheye structure micro structure in addition to the motheye structure the antireflection film antireflection surface can be provided with an antiglare function the twodimensional size of a raised portion of the uneven structure which is capable of performing the antiglare function is not less than  μm and less than  μmutilizing an anodized porous aluminum film can facilitate the manufacture of a mold which is used for formation of a motheye structure over a surface hereinafter “motheye mold” in particular as described in patent documents  and  when the surface of the anodized aluminum film as formed is used as a mold without any modification a large effect of reducing the manufacturing cost is achieved the structure of the surface of a motheye mold which is capable of forming a motheye structure is herein referred to as “inverted motheye structure”a known antireflection film production method with the use of a motheye mold uses a photocurable resin firstly a photocurable resin is applied over a substrate then an uneven surface of a motheye mold which has undergone a mold release treatment is pressed against the photocurable resin in vacuum whereby the uneven structure at the surface of the motheye mold is filled with the photocurable resin then the photocurable resin in the uneven structure is irradiated with ultraviolet light so that the photocurable resin is cured thereafter the motheye mold is separated from the substrate whereby a cured layer of the photocurable resin to which the uneven structure of the motheye mold has been transferred is formed over the surface of the substrate the method of producing an antireflection film with the use of the photocurable resin is disclosed in for example patent document the abovedescribed motheye mold can be fabricated using an aluminum base such as typically a substrate made of aluminum or a cylinder made of aluminum or an aluminum film formed on a support that is made of a nonaluminum material such as typically a glass substrate however in a motheye mold manufactured using an aluminum film formed on a glass substrate or plastic film the adhesive property between the aluminum film part of which is an anodized film and the glass substrate or plastic film deteriorates in some cases the applicant of the present application found that by forming an inorganic underlayer eg sio layer and a buffer layer containing aluminum eg alox layer on a surface of a base which is made of glass or plastic the abovedescribed deterioration of the adhesive property is prevented this is disclosed in patent document the applicant of the present application developed a method for efficiently producing an antireflection film using a motheye mold in the form of a cylinder roll according to a rolltoroll method eg wo  the motheye mold in the form of a cylinder can be formed by for example forming an organic insulating layer over an outer perimeter surface of a metal cylinder forming an aluminum film on this organic insulating layer and alternately and repeatedly performing anodization and etching on the aluminum film in this case also the adhesive property can be improved by forming the inorganic underlayer and the buffer layer disclosed in patent document according to further researches carried out by the present inventors an aluminum film formed on an organic insulating layer contains abnormal grains in many cases the abnormal grains are formed by abnormal growth of a crystal of aluminum the aluminum film is an aggregation of crystal grains whose average grain diameter average grain size is about  nm on the other hand the grain diameter of the abnormal grains is larger than the average grain diameter eg not less than  nm in some cases the organic insulating layer has a lower thermal conductivity than the other materials metal materials and inorganic insulating films and therefore the aluminum film readily reaches a relatively high temperature in the process of depositing the aluminum film eg sputtering or vapor deposition as a result it is inferred that abnormal growth of crystal grains is likely to occur ie abnormal grains are likely to be produced note that such a phenomenon can also occur when an aluminum film is directly deposited on a surface of an aluminum pipe eg the thickness is not less than  mmwhen a motheye mold is manufactured using an aluminum film in which abnormal grains are present structures corresponding to the abnormal grains are formed in the surface of a porous alumina layer of the motheye mold when an antireflection film is formed using such a motheye mold the structures corresponding to the abnormal grains are transferred to the surface of the antireflection film therefore light is scattered by the structures transferred to the surface of the antireflection film which are attributed to the abnormal grains that is the antireflection film has a haze in the case where the antireflection film is provided with an antiglare function as described above no problem occurs in some cases even when the antireflection film has a haze which is attributed to the abnormal grains however there is such a problem that an antireflection film which does not have an antiglare function cannot be producing further it is difficult to control the formation density frequency of occurrence of abnormal grains and therefore from the viewpoint of mass productivity preventing production of abnormal grains is preferredthe present inventors disclose in the international patent application pctjp wo  that an aluminum alloy layer which contains aluminum and such a metal element that the absolute value of the difference between the standard electrode potential of the metal element and the standard electrode potential of aluminum is not more than  v for example the metal element may be ti nd mn mg zr v and pb and the content of the metal element in the entire aluminum alloy layer is less than  mass  scarcely contains abnormal grains and as a result a mold can be obtained which is capable of producing an antireflection film that does not have an undesirable hazethe entire disclosures of patent

summary of inventiontechnical problemaccording to further researches carried out by the present inventors it was found that when occurrence of abnormal grains is prevented using the method described in the aboveidentified international patent application the resultant aluminum alloy layer has high specularity but stable formation of an aluminum alloy layer of higher specularity eg with the average reflectance to visible light being not less than  is not easy it was found that the reason for that is that when forming an aluminum alloy layer which has a thickness of not less than  nm the crystal grain diameter is likely to increase and as a result the surface roughness is likely to increase and voids are likely to be formed between crystal grainsthe present invention was conceived for

large raised portions are sparsely present it is seen from the right part of fig  that aluminum grains formed are relatively large the average surface roughness ra of this aluminum alloy layer is  nm the maximum surface roughness rmax of this aluminum alloy layer is × nm here the aluminum grains shown in fig  have an average grain diameter of greater than  nm see the scale of  nm at the right lower portion of the right part of fig as for fig  the aluminum alloy layer  was formed with the nitrogen gas mixed flow rate  sccm it is seen from the left part of fig  that the number of relatively large raised portions is smaller than in the case of fig  it is seen from the right part of fig  that aluminum grains formed are somewhat smaller than in the case of fig  the average surface roughness ra is  nm the maximum surface roughness rmax is × nm here the aluminum grains shown in fig  have a smaller average grain diameter than in the case of fig  and specifically have an average grain diameter of not more than  nmas for fig  the aluminum alloy layer  was formed with the nitrogen gas mixed flow rate  sccm it is seen from the left part of fig  that the number of relatively large raised portions is smaller than in the case of fig  it is seen from the right part of fig  that aluminum grains formed are somewhat smaller than in the case of fig  the average surface roughness ra is  nm the maximum surface roughness rmax is × nm here the aluminum grains shown in fig  have a smaller average grain diameter than in the case of fig  and specifically have an average grain diameter of not more than  nmas for fig  the aluminum alloy layer  was formed with the nitrogen gas mixed flow rate  sccm it is seen from the left part of fig  that the number of relatively large raised portions is smaller than in the case of fig  it is seen from the right part of fig  that aluminum grains formed are somewhat smaller than in the case of fig  the average surface roughness ra is  nm the maximum surface roughness rmax is × nm here the aluminum grains shown in fig  have a smaller average grain diameter than in the case of fig  and specifically have an average grain diameter of not more than  nmas for fig  the aluminum alloy layer  was formed with the nitrogen gas mixed flow rate  sccm in this case it is seen from the left part of fig  that the number of relatively large raised portions is greater than in the case of fig  the average surface roughness ra is  nm the maximum surface roughness rmax is × nm as seen from the comparison with fig  the variation in size of the grains increases and the uniformity deteriorates although the effect of decreasing the grain size is maintained therefore it is concluded that the nitrogen gas flow rate of  sccm is somewhat greater than the optimum valueas described above it is seen from fig  through fig  that when the aluminum alloy layer  is formed with the nitrogen gas mixed at a flow rate of not less than  sccm and not more than  sccm the diameter of aluminum grains decreases in this case the average grain diameter of crystal grains viewed in the normal direction of the aluminum alloy layer  is not more than  nm and the maximum surface roughness rmax is not more than  nm this configuration improves the optical reflectance of the surface of the aluminum alloy layer here in fig  the aluminum alloy layer  that is made of for example al—ti al—nd or the like is to be formed on the upper surface of the substrate  and the present invention excludes formation of a pure aluminum layer this is because it is already known that although decrease of the diameter of aluminum grains is achieved by addition of nitrogen even in the case of a pure aluminum layer occurrence of abnormally large grains cannot be avoided in that casefig  and fig  show the results of observation by afm and sem of a surface of a socalled pure aluminum layer formed on the upper surface of the substrate  as shown in fig  through fig  in fig  and fig  a is the result of afm where the scanning region is a square region of  nm on each side and b is the result of sem observation of the pure aluminum layer surface shown in a fig  shows the results of the case where the pure aluminum layer was formed with no nitrogen gas mixed fig  shows the results of the case where the pure aluminum layer was formed with the nitrogen gas mixed flow rate  sccmas seen from fig  in the case of the nitrogenfree pure aluminum layer the average surface roughness ra is  nm and the maximum surface roughness rmax is × nm it can be seen that these surface roughness values particularly the maximum surface roughness are large see fig b as seen from fig  even in the case of the nitrogencontaining pure aluminum layer the average surface roughness ra is  nm and the maximum surface roughness is × nm it can be seen that these surface roughness values particularly the maximum surface roughness are large see fig b as seen from these results from the viewpoint of globally decreasing the size of aluminum grains and thereby achieving high reflectance the aluminum alloy layer is preferable to the pure aluminum layerfig  is a graph that shows the reflectance  of the abovedescribed nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer  together with the reflectances of a nitrogenfree aluminum alloy layer a nitrogenfree pure aluminum layer and a nitrogencontaining pure aluminum

fig c show the reflectances of the abovedescribed layers of graphs a b c d e f and g for wavelength ranges of  to  nm  to  nm and  to  nm respectivelyas seen from fig  and figs a to c at least in the case of the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer as for the optical reflectances for the visible range wavelengths  to  nm even the lowest reflection characteristic graph e is not less than  on average that is achieved reflectances are higher than those of the nitrogenfree aluminum layer graph f particularly in a region near  nm note that however the reason that the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer e nitrogen gas flow rate during film formation  sccm exhibits lower reflectances than the nitrogenfree aluminum alloy layer a is not clear although as previously described with reference to fig  through fig  the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer nitrogen gas flow rate during film formation  sccm has better surface flatness and surface structure uniformity than the nitrogenfree aluminum alloy layer note that even in the case of the pure aluminum layer addition of nitrogen improves the reflectance see graph g but the previouslydescribed abnormal grains are more likely to occur than in the aluminum alloy layersfig  is a table that shows the nht hardness the vickers hardness hv converted from the nht hardness the youngs modulus and the maximum indenter depth of the abovedescribed aluminum alloy layer  for the cases where no nitrogen gas was mixed or the nitrogen gas was mixed at  sccm  sccm  sccm or  sccm in the sputtering gas ar gas flow rate  sccm in formation of the aluminum alloy layer  note that the nht hardness refers to a hardness which is measured using a nano hardness tester according to a method compliant with iso the vickers hardness number is  when no nitrogen gas is mixed while when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm  sccm  sccm and  sccm the vickers hardness numbers are    and  respectively that is the vickers hardness number increases according to the amount of the mixed nitrogen gas it can be seen from this that the aluminum alloy layer  has high hardness when nitrogen is containedthe youngs modulus is  gpa when no nitrogen gas is mixed while when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm  sccm  sccm and  sccm the youngs moduli are  gpa  gpa  gpa and  gpa respectively it can be seen that the youngs modulus generally increases according to the amount of the mixed nitrogen gasthe maximum indenter depth is  nm when no nitrogen gas is mixed while when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm  sccm  sccm and  sccm the maximum indenter depth decreases to  nm  nm  nm and  nm respectively it can be seen that the hardness of the aluminum alloy layer  increases according to the amount of the mixed nitrogen gasthus it can be seen that the aluminum alloy layer  has extremely high hardness and durability when nitrogen is containedthe table of fig  shows that the adherence test of the aluminum alloy layer  to the substrate  was carried out based on vickers indentations and scratches in every case no separation was foundfig  is a table that shows the relationship between the film thickness and the resistance

average film thickness of the aluminum alloy layer  is  the average resistance value is  and the specific resistance is  μωcmas clearly seen from this table the specific resistance of the aluminum alloy layer  is at least not more than  μω even when nitrogen is contained in the aluminum alloy layer  therefore the aluminum alloy layer  is sufficiently applicable to wiring layers or the like of electronic components and for example can be used as an electrode of an organic el electro luminescence devicefig  is a table that shows the results of composition analysis by esca electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis for the case where no nitrogen gas was mixed in formation of the aluminum alloy layer  the case where the nitrogen gas was mixed at  sccm the case where the nitrogen gas was mixed at  sccm the case where the nitrogen gas was mixed at  sccm and the case where the nitrogen gas was mixed at  sccm in fig  the subjects of the composition analysis are o ti n al and c in the measurement a photoelectron spectrometer jpsmc manufactured by jeol ltd was usedas seen from this table when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm the nitrogen content of the aluminum alloy layer is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm the nitrogen content of the aluminum alloy layer is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass thus a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer whose nitrogen content is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  has better flatness the maximum surface roughness rmax is not more than  nm and better surface structure uniformity the average grain diameter of crystal grains is not more than  nm than a nitrogenfree aluminum alloy layer see fig  through fig when the nitrogen gas is mixed at  sccm the reflectance of the resultant aluminum alloy layer is smaller than the others therefore when the film thickness of the aluminum alloy layer  is in the range of not less than  nm and not more than  nm it is preferred from the viewpoint of achieving higher reflectance that the nitrogen content of the aluminum alloy layer  is in the range of not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  see fig  and figs a to cas seen from the above table when ti is contained in the aluminum alloy layer as the nonaluminum metal element the content of ti is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  and this value is suitablein the above description the nonaluminum metal element added to the aluminum alloy layer is ti or nd although it is not limited to these examples it may be such a different metal element that the absolute value of the difference between the standard electrode potential of the metal element and the standard electrode potential of aluminum is not more than  v for example mn mg zr v and pb as disclosed in the aboveidentified international patent application pctjp containment of the metal element m prevents abnormal growth of crystal grains of aluminum and as a result the aluminum alloy layer  scarcely contains abnormal grains the metal element may be mo nb or hf the aluminum alloy layer may contain two or more of these metal elementsmold base mold base manufacturing

film as described above a motheye mold in the form of a cylinder roll is capable of efficiently producing an antireflection film according to a rolltoroll method an example of the mold base in the form of a cylinder will be described laterfirst a mold manufacturing method according to an embodiment of the present invention is describedthe mold manufacturing method of the embodiment of the present invention includes the step of preparing a mold base  which includes a metal base m an organic insulating layer  formed on the metal base m and an aluminum alloy layer  formed on the organic insulating layer  as shown in fig a the metal base m and the organic insulating layer  are sometimes integrally referred to as “support ” note that the metal base m may be replaced by a different base eg an insulative base such as a glass base the organic insulating layer  may be omitted however when using a base of a metal which is different from the aluminum alloy layer  the aluminum alloy layer  and the metal base m are preferably electrically insulated from each other in order to prevent occurrence of electrochemical corrosion between these elements therefore it is preferred to provide an organic insulating layer andor inorganic underlayer between the metal base m and the aluminum alloy layer  note that when an insulative base is used an organic insulating layer andor inorganic underlayer may also be provided the organic insulating layer andor inorganic underlayer provide the effect of improving the adhesive property between the aluminum alloy layer and the base providing a buffer layer between the inorganic underlayer and the aluminum alloy layer further improves the adhesive propertythe aluminum alloy layer  used herein is the same as the abovedescribed aluminum alloy layer  that is the aluminum alloy layer  contains aluminum a nonaluminum metal element m and nitrogenit is preferred that the average grain diameter of crystal grains that form the aluminum alloy layer  when viewed in the normal direction of the aluminum alloy layer  is not more than  nm and that the maximum surface roughness rmax of the aluminum alloy layer  is not more than  nm the content of nitrogen in the aluminum alloy layer  is preferably not less than  mass  and not more than  mass it is preferred that the absolute value of the difference between the standard electrode potential of the metal element m and the standard electrode potential of aluminum is not more than  v and that the content of the metal element m in the aluminum alloy layer  is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  the metal element m is ti or nd the metal element m is not limited to these examples but may be such a different metal element that the absolute value of the difference between the standard electrode potential of the metal element m and the standard electrode potential of aluminum is not more than  v for example mn mg zr v and pb the aluminum alloy layer may contain two or more of these metal elementsas will be described later with the illustration of an experimental example the aluminum alloy layer  which contains the abovedescribed metal element m and nitrogen has a reflectance of not less than  in the visible light range for example the wavelength range of  nm to  nm that is containment of the metal element m prevents abnormal growth of crystal grains of aluminum and containment of nitrogen leads to reduction in size of the crystal grains as a result the aluminum alloy layer  has small surface roughness and formation of voids between the crystal grains is preventedtherefore by forming the motheye mold  which has a porous alumina layer  such as shown in fig b with the use of the aluminum alloy layer  a mold  can be obtained which is capable of forming an antireflection film that does not have an undesirable haze a hazefree antireflection film or a hazecontrolled antireflection filmnow the reason of production of an antireflection film which has an undesirable haze is briefly described with reference to fig  and fig  fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer of a comparative example fig a is a surface sem image × the overall length of the bar shown in the image is  μm fig b is a crosssectional sem image this aluminum alloy layer is an al—ti layer and has a thickness of about  nm the composition of the target is al  mass  and ti  mass  this aluminum alloy layer was formed according to a method comparative example disclosed in pctjp as seen from these sem images voids are sparsely presentfigs a to d are schematic diagrams for illustrating the reason why presence of voids in the aluminum alloy layer leads to production of an antireflection film which has an undesirable hazewhen an aluminum alloy layer  which has a void b as shown in fig a is anodized a plurality of minute recessed portions are formed inside the void b as shown in fig b during formation of a porous alumina layer  which has minute recessed portions a the void b and the plurality of minute recessed portions formed inside the void b are herein generically referred to as “abnormal recessed portions b” thereafter the step of enlarging the minute recessed portions  by etching and the step of growing the minute recessed portions a by another anodization process are carried out as a result the abnormal recessed portions b enlarge as shown in fig cwhen an antireflection film is produced using a mold which has the porous alumina layer  such as shown in fig c coarse raised portions b which correspond to the abnormal recessed portions b are formed as shown in fig d minute raised portions a which correspond to the normal minute recessed portions a of the porous alumina layer  have for example a conical shape and perform an antireflection functionfig  shows examples of sem images of prototypal antireflection films × the overall length of the scale shown in the image is  nm fig a is an example of a sem image of an antireflection film which was produced using a motheye mold of an embodiment of the present invention fig b is an example comparative example of a sem image of an antireflection film produced according to a method disclosed in pctjpin fig b there are large raised portions which are considered to correspond to the coarse raised portions b shown in fig d the twodimensional size of the large raised portions when viewed in a direction normal to the film is approximately  nm the size of these large raised portions can be generally explained based on the model that has been described with reference to fig the thickness of the aluminum alloy layer is preferably not less than  nm and not more than  nm this is because the depth of recessed portions of a motheye mold configured for production of an antireflection film is not less than about  nm typically not less than  nm and less than about  nm about  μmhere the aluminum alloy layer  having a thickness of about  μm is preferably formed through a plurality of separate cycles rather than formed at once in one cycle specifically it is preferred to repeat the cycle of depositing aluminum to a certain thickness before an intermission of a certain time period and resuming the deposition after the intermission till the aluminum alloy layer  having a predetermined thickness eg  μm is obtained rather than to continuously deposit aluminum to the predetermined thickness for example it is preferred that the aluminum alloy layer  having a thickness of about  μm is obtained by forming  aluminum alloy layers each of which has a thickness of  nm in such a manner that every formation of the  nm thick aluminum alloy layer is followed by an intermission in this way the deposition of the aluminum alloy is carried out in a plurality of separate cycles whereby the quality of the finallyobtained aluminum alloy layer  eg the chemical resistance or adhesion can be improved this is probably because continuous deposition of the aluminum alloy increases the temperature of a base a base having a surface on which the aluminum layer is to be formed and as a result the distribution of thermal stress in the aluminum alloy layer  becomes nonuniform so that the film quality deteriorateshere it is preferred to provide an inorganic underlayer  between the organic insulating layer  and the aluminum alloy layer  as in the mold base  shown in fig a the inorganic underlayer  is directly provided on a surface of the organic insulating layer  and functions to improve adhesion between the organic insulating layer  and the aluminum alloy layer  the inorganic underlayer  is preferably made of an inorganic oxide or an inorganic nitride when an inorganic oxide is used for example the inorganic underlayer  is preferably a silicon oxide layer a tantalum oxide layer or a titanium oxide layer when an inorganic nitride is used for example the inorganic underlayer  is preferably a silicon nitride layer further the thermal expansion coefficient of the inorganic underlayer  may be adapted by adding an impurity to the inorganic oxide layer or inorganic nitride layer for example when a silicon oxide layer is used the thermal expansion coefficient can be increased by adding germanium ge phosphorus p or boron bthe thickness of the inorganic underlayer  is preferably not less than  nm and more preferably not less than  nm when the thickness of the inorganic underlayer is less than  nm the effects of provision of the inorganic underlayer  are not sufficiently produced in some cases the thickness of the inorganic underlayer  is preferably not more than  nm and more preferably not more than  nm if the thickness of the inorganic underlayer  is more than  nm the time required for formation of the inorganic underlayer  will be unduly long when the inorganic underlayer  is formed on a curved surface or a flexible surface cracks are more likely to be caused as the thickness of the inorganic underlayer  increasespreferably the mold base  further includes a buffer layer  interposed between the inorganic underlayer  and the aluminum alloy layer  the buffer layer  has the function of improving the adhesive property between the inorganic underlayer  and the aluminum alloy layer  in the example described herein the buffer layer  is directly provided on the inorganic underlayer  although the present invention is not limited to this example for example when an electricallyconductive layer preferably a valve metal layer is provided as a backing in order to uniformly anodize the aluminum alloy layer  the electricallyconductive layer may be provided between the inorganic underlayer  and the buffer layer  or between the buffer layer  and the aluminum alloy layer the buffer layer  preferably contains aluminum the metal element m and either of oxygen or nitrogen the buffer layer  preferably has such a profile that the contents of aluminum and the metal element m are higher in a portion which is closer to the aluminum alloy layer  than in another portion which is closer to the inorganic underlayer  although the oxygen or nitrogen content may be uniform this is because the property values such as the thermal expansion coefficient exhibit excellent conformity the thickness of the buffer layer  is preferably not less than  nm and more preferably not less than  nm the thickness of the buffer layer  is preferably not more than  nm and more preferably not more than  nm if the thickness of the buffer layer  is less than  nm sufficient adhesion is not achieved between the inorganic underlayer  and the aluminum alloy layer  in some cases if the thickness of the buffer layer  is more than  nm the time required for formation of the buffer layer  will be unduly long thus this case is not preferredthe profile of the aluminum content in the buffer layer  along the thickness direction may vary stepwise or may continuously vary for example when the buffer layer  is formed of aluminum the metal element m and oxygen a plurality of aluminum oxide alloy layers which have gradually decreasing oxygen contents are formed and then the aluminum alloy layer  is formed on the uppermost aluminum oxide alloy layer the highest oxygen content in the buffer layer  is preferably not more than  at  this also applies to a case where the buffer layer  formed contains nitrogen instead of oxygenthe motheye mold  shown in fig b can be obtained by performing the step of partially anodizing the aluminum alloy layer  with the use of the mold base  shown in fig a in the same way as the conventional method thereby forming the porous alumina layer  which has a plurality of minute recessed portions  thereafter the step of bringing the porous alumina layer  into contact with an etching solution thereby enlarging the plurality of minute recessed portions  of the porous alumina layer  and thereafter the step of further performing anodization to grow the plurality of minute recessed portions the motheye mold  is suitably used in production of an antireflection film antireflection surface the crosssectional shape of the minute recessed portions micropores  of the porous alumina layer  that is to be used in production of an antireflection film is generally conical as overdrawn in fig b the minute recessed portions  may have a stepped lateral surface it is preferred that the twodimensional size of the minute recessed portions  opening diameter dp is not less than nm and less than  nm and the depth of the minute recessed portions  ddepth is generally not less than  nm and less than  nm  μm it is also preferred that the bottom portion of the minute recessed portions  is tapered with the deepest part of the bottom portion being pointed further it is preferred that the minute recessed portions  are in a closely packed arrangement assuming that the shape of the minute recessed portions  of the porous alumina layer  when viewed in a direction normal to the porous alumina layer  is a circle it is preferred that adjacent circles overlap each other and a saddle portion is formed between adjacent ones of the minute recessed portions  note that when the generallyconical minute recessed portions  adjoin one another so as to form saddle portions the twodimensional size of the minute recessed portions  dp is equal to the average adjoining distance dint thus the porous alumina layer  of the motheye mold  that is for production of the antireflection film preferably has a configuration in which the minute recessed portions  are in an irregular closelypacked arrangement the minute recessed portions  having such dimensions that dpdint is not less than  nm and less than  nm and ddepth is generally not less than  nm and less than  nm  μm note that strictly speaking the shape of the openings of the minute recessed portions  is not a circle dp is preferably determined from the sem image of the surface the thickness of the porous alumina layer  tp is not more than about  μmhereinafter a method for manufacturing a rollshaped mold with the use of a mold base in the shape of a hollow cylinder is describedthe rollshaped mold was manufactured by a method disclosed in wo  of the applicant of the present application here a metal sleeve which was made of stainless steel or nickel was used note that the metal sleeve refers to a hollow cylinder which is made of a metal and which has a thickness of not less than  mm and not more than  mm the entire disclosures of wo  are herein incorporated by referencea method for manufacturing a roll mold with the use of a metal sleeve used in an experiment is briefly described with reference to fig firstly a metal sleeve m is provided as shown in fig athen as shown in fig b an organic insulating layer  is formed on the outer perimeter surface of the metal sleeve m by electrodeposition for examplethe electrodeposition may be for example a known electrodeposition painting method for example firstly the metal sleeve m is washed then the metal sleeve m is immersed in an electrodeposition bath in which an electrodeposition solution that contains an electrodeposition resin is stored in the electrodeposition bath an electrode is installed when the insulative resin layer is formed by means of cationic electrodeposition an electric current is allowed to flow between the metal sleeve m and the anode where the metal sleeve m serves as the cathode and the electrode installed in the electrodeposition bath serves as the anode so that the electrodeposition resin is deposited on the outer perimeter surface of the metal sleeve m whereby the insulative resin layer is formed when the insulative resin layer is formed by means of anionic electrodeposition an electric current is allowed to flow where the metal sleeve m serves as the anode and the electrode installed in the electrodeposition bath serves as the cathode whereby the insulative resin layer is formed thereafter the washing step and the baking step are performed whereby an organic insulating layer  is formed the electrodeposition resin used may be for example a polyimide resin an epoxy resin an acrylic resin a melamine resin a urethane resin or a mixture thereof the organic insulating layer  can be formed by forming an insulative resin layer using a various coating method other than electrodeposition and when necessary curing the insulative resin layer the organic insulating layer  has a high surface flattening effect and can prevent scars or the like in the surface of the metal sleeve m for example being reflected in the surface shape of the aluminum alloy layer then as shown in fig c an inorganic underlayer  is formed on the organic insulating layer  for example a sio layer  which has a thickness of about  nm is formed the present invention is not limited to the sio layer for example a tao layer may be formed insteadthen as shown in fig d the buffer layer  and the aluminum alloy layer  are continuously formed the same target is used for formation of the buffer layer  and the aluminum alloy layer  therefore the proportion of aluminum and the metal element m is constant in the buffer layer  and the aluminum alloy layer  the thickness of the buffer layer  is for example about  nm the thickness of the aluminum alloy layer  is about  μm the process continuing from formation of the inorganic underlayer  to formation of the aluminum alloy layer  is carried out by a thin film deposition method eg sputtering the entirety of this process is preferably carried out in the same chamberthen anodization and etching are alternately and repeatedly performed on a surface of the aluminum alloy layer so as to form a porous alumina layer  which has a plurality of minute recessed portions whereby a mold a is obtained as shown in fig enext a method for forming the porous alumina layer  is described with reference to fig  in fig  as the mold base  shown the aluminum alloy layer  is directly provided on a support first the mold base  is provided as shown in fig a the mold base  includes a metal base an organic insulating layer  provided on the metal base and an aluminum alloy layer  deposited on the organic insulating layer then a surface of the mold base  a surface s of the aluminum alloy layer  is anodized to form a porous alumina layer  which has a plurality of minute recessed portions  micropores as shown in fig b the porous alumina layer  includes a porous layer which has the minute recessed portions  and a barrier layer the porous alumina layer  may be formed by for example anodizing the surface s in an acidic electrolytic solution the electrolytic solution used in the step of forming the porous alumina layer  may be for example an aqueous solution which contains an acid selected from the group consisting of oxalic acid tartaric acid phosphoric acid chromic acid citric acid and malic acid by modifying the anodization conditions eg the type of the electrolytic solution the applied voltage the interpore distance the depth of the micropores the shape of the micropores etc can be adjusted note that the thickness of the porous alumina layer may be changed when necessary the aluminum alloy layer  may be entirely anodizedthen the porous alumina layer  is brought into contact with an alumina etchant such that a predetermined amount is etched away whereby the pore diameter of the minute recessed portions  is increased as shown in fig c here wet etching may be employed such that the pore wall and the barrier layer can be generally isotropically etched by modifying the type and concentration of the etching solution and the etching duration the etching amount ie the size and depth of the minute recessed portions  can be controlled the etching solution used may be for example an aqueous solution of  mass  phosphoric acid or organic acid such as formic acid acetic acid citric acid or the like or a chromiumphosphoric acid mixture solutionthen the aluminum alloy layer  is again partially anodized such that the minute recessed portions  are grown in the depth direction and the thickness of the porous alumina layer  is increased as shown in fig d here the growth of the minute recessed portions  starts at the bottoms of the previouslyformed minute recessed portions  and accordingly the lateral surfaces of the minute recessed portions  have stepped shapesthereafter when necessary the porous alumina layer  may be brought into contact with an alumina etchant to be etched such that the pore diameter of the minute recessed portions  is further increased the etching solution used in this step may preferably be the abovedescribed etching solution practically the same etching bath may be usedin this way by repeating the anodization step and the etching step as described above the motheye mold a that includes the porous alumina layer  which has a desired uneven shape is obtained as shown in fig e by modifying the conditions the duration and the number of cycles of the anodization step and the etching step the lateral surfaces of the minute recessed portions  can have a stepped surface or can have a smooth curved surface or slope surfacenext a method for producing an antireflection film with the use of a rollshaped motheye mold of an embodiment of the present invention is described the rollshaped mold has such an advantageous that by spinning the rollshaped mold around the axis the surface structure of the mold can be continuously transferred to a work an object which has a surface over which an antireflection film is to be formedthe antireflection film production method of an embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of providing the abovedescribed mold providing a work irradiating a photocurable resin interposed between the mold and a surface of the work with light thereby curing the photocurable resin and peeling off the mold from an antireflection film which is formed by the cured photocurable resinwhen a rollshaped film is used as the work an antireflection film can be produced by a rolltoroll method it is preferred that the film includes a base film and a hard coat layer provided on the base film and the antireflection film is provided on the hard coat layer as the base film for example a tag triacetyl cellulose film may be preferably used as the hard coat layer for example an acrylic hard coat material may be usedthe metal sleeve m of the mold a shown in fig e readily deforms and therefore it is difficult to use the mold a as it is in view of such a core member  is inserted inside the metal sleeve m of the mold a as shown in fig  whereby a mold a is obtained which can be used in an antireflection film production method according to a rolltoroll method note that the mold a shown in fig  has a buffer layer  which is provided on the support next an antireflection film production method with the use of a mold of an embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to fig  fig  is a schematic crosssectional view for illustrating a method for producing an antireflection film according to a rolltoroll methodfirstly a motheye mold a in the form of a roll which is shown in fig  is providedthen as shown in fig  a work  over which a uvcurable resin ′ is applied on its surface is maintained pressed against the motheye mold a and the uvcurable resin ′ is irradiated with ultraviolet uv light such that the uvcurable resin ′ is cured the uvcurable resin ′ used may be for example an acrylic resin the work  may be for example a tac triacetyl cellulose film the work  is fed from an unshown feeder roller and thereafter the uvcurable resin ′ is applied over the surface of the work  using for example a slit coater or the like the work  is supported by supporting rollers  and  as shown in fig  the supporting rollers  and  have rotation mechanisms for carrying the work  the motheye mold a in the form of a roll is rotated at a rotation speed corresponding to the carrying speed of the work  in a direction indicated by the arrow in fig thereafter the motheye mold a is separated from the work  whereby a cured material layer  to which an uneven structure of the motheye mold a inverted motheye structure is transferred is formed on the surface of the work  the work  which has the cured material layer  formed on the surface is wound up by an unshown winding rollerin the example described hereinabove a metal sleeve is used as the metal base although an aluminum base in a bulk form may be used instead of the metal sleevenext a method for manufacturing a rollshaped mold base which is for use in formation of a cylindrical rollshaped motheye mold is described with reference to fig  and fig a cylindrical mold base manufacturing method according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the step of arranging a cylindrical base in a film formation chamber so as to be at least capable of rotating around its own cylindrical axis and the step of depositing an aluminum alloy layer over an outer perimeter surface of the base according to a dc magnetron sputtering method using a target that contains aluminum and a nonaluminum metal element in an atmosphere in the film formation chamber in which a nitrogen gas is mixed while the base is kept rotating around its own cylindrical axisalthough as a matter of course the cylindrical mold base can be manufactured on a onebyone basis manufacturing a plurality of mold bases at one time is preferred from the viewpoint of mass productivity figs a and b are schematic diagrams for illustrating a method of manufacturing a plurality of cylindrical mold basesfigs a and b schematically show an arrangement of cylindrical bases eg the metal sleeve m described above in a film formation chamber also referred to as “chamber” not shown in which sputtering is to be performedas shown in fig b nine cylindrical bases are arranged on a rotatable stage st along a circumferential direction with constant intervals the inside of the chamber is controlled to a predetermined vacuum degree and a sputtering gas ar gas and a nitrogen gas each can be supplied into the chamber at a predetermined flow ratethe cylindrical bases m are placed on substages sst which are rotatable independently or in synchronization with one another therefore the cylindrical bases m are arranged so as to be capable of rotating around their own cylindrical axes on the substages sst while orbiting along the circumferential direction of the stage stthe sputtering apparatus is for example a carousel sputtering apparatus and includes for example four targets t t t and t as shown in fig b materials can be supplied into the film formation chamber by opening and closing shutters s s s and s as for the abovedescribed inorganic layers formation of the sio layer and the taxoy layer is realized by rf sputtering and formation of the al—ti layer is realized by dc sputtering note that in formation of the al—ti layer the inside of the film formation chamber is an atmosphere which contains a nitrogen gas at a predetermined volume fraction so that a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer is formed the composition of the targets is for example al  mass  and ti  mass the directions of the rotation and the orbital movement of the cylindrical bases m are preferably identical here clockwise and the rotation speed and the orbital movement speed are preferably slowas shown in fig a there is no necessity to occupy all of the substages sst by the cylindrical bases m note that however as illustrated in fig a shield members are preferably provided at both sides of a cylindrical base m which is to be a final product the shield members are arranged such that the cylindrical bases m are uniformly exposed to the materials supplied from the targets the shield members may be a cylindrical base which is not to be used dummy d when all of the substages sst are occupied by the cylindrical bases m two cylindrical bases m which are adjacent to each of the cylindrical bases m function as the shield membersthe results of examinations as to specific film formation conditions are described with reference to figs  a to dalthough the carousel sputtering apparatus used in experiments is capable of housing twelve cylindrical bases m which have a diameter of  mm and a length of about  mm fig  shows the case of nine cylindrical bases for the sake of simplicity the substages sst are arranged such that when the cylindrical bases m have a diameter of  mm the shortest distance between the targets t to t and the cylindrical bases m is  cm the rotation period of the cylindrical bases m is about  seconds the orbital movement period of the cylindrical bases m is about  secondsfigs a to d schematically show arrangements of the cylindrical bases m used in the experimentsin fig a a cylindrical base m which has a diameter of  mm is placed at the center of the substage sst with no shield members at both sides of the cylindrical base this is referred to as “arrangement a”in fig b a cylindrical base m which has a diameter of  mm is placed so as to rotate at a position which is  cm closer to the targets than the center of the substage sst and dummy cylindrical bases d or simply “dummies d” which have a diameter of  mm are placed as the shield members at both sides of the cylindrical base m this is referred to as “arrangement b”in fig c a cylindrical base m which has a diameter of  mm is placed so as to rotate at a position which is  cm closer to the targets than the center of the substage sst as in fig b and instead of the dummies d of fig b shield plates  are placed at positions which are closer to the surfaces of the adjacent dummies d this is referred to as “arrangement c”in fig d a cylindrical base m which has a diameter of  mm is placed at the center of the substage sst and dummies d which have a diameter of  mm are placed at both sides of the cylindrical base m this is referred to as “arrangement d”in the experiment which will be described below the cylindrical base m used was an aluminum pipe the aluminum pipe was made of a material from the  series the thickness of the pipe was  to  mmfirst a sio layer having a thickness of  nm to  nm was formed on the surface of the cylindrical bases m and an aluminum alloy layer al—ti layer was formed on the sio layer in formation of the aluminum alloy layer the flow rate of the nitrogen gas supplied into the film formation chamber was varied so that a nitrogenfree aluminum alloy layer comparative example and nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layers of different nitrogen contents were formed the target used was such that al  mass  and ti  mass mold bases including the resultant aluminum alloy layers were visually evaluated and evaluated as to the etching property with phosphoric acid the structure of the motheye mold and the electrical resistancefirstly the results of examinations as to the effects of arrangements a to d that have been described with reference to fig  on the film quality of the aluminum alloy layer are shown in fig  among samples a to h shown in fig  sample a was formed with arrangement a sample b was formed with arrangement b samples c and d were formed with arrangement c and samples e to h were formed with arrangement d also the effects of presenceabsence of supply of the nitrogen gas nitrogen gas flow rate  sccm and the arrangement of the shield members dummies d shield plates  were examined further motheye molds were manufactured and the light scatterability of the surfaces of the motheye molds was evaluated the light scatterability was evaluated using a colorimetercolor difference meter cr manufactured by konica minolta inc specifically collimated light is provided in a direction inclined by ° with respect to the normal direction of the motheye mold surface and the light scatterability was evaluated based on the y value of light incident on a detector positioned in the normal direction of the motheye mold surface larger y values mean higher light scatterability note that the results of sample a arrangement a are not shown in fig  this is because sample a had poor specularity in the aluminum alloy layer surface so that the reflectance to light of  nm to  nm was approximately not more than  which was a very low value sample a looked opaque to human eye therefore sample a was determined to be ineligible before manufacture of a motheye moldthe manufacture conditions for the motheye molds are as followsanodization step oxalic acid aqueous solution  moll temperature ° c forming voltage  v anodization duration electric conduction duration  minutes and  secondsetching step phosphoric acid aqueous solution  moll temperature ° c etching duration  minutesthe abovedescribed anodization step and etching step were alternately repeated four times and thereafter the anodization step was carried out once at the endreferring to fig  as seen from the comparison between sample a and sample b the light scatterability of the surface of the aluminum alloy layer can be reduced by placing shield members dummies at both sides of a cylindrical base which is to be a final product further as seen from the comparison between sample b and samples c and d the effect of reducing the light scatterability of the surface improves as the distance between the base and the shield members decreasesfurther as seen from the comparison between samples e and f and samples g and h supply of nitrogen reduces the light scatterability of the surface samples c and d and samples g and h which were formed with supply of nitrogen not only have small y values but also have small variations in that value the variation between sample c and sample d and the variation between sample g and sample h as compared with samples e and f that is it can be seen that supply of nitrogen enables reduction of manufacture variationsnext the results of examinations as to the preferred range of the amount of supplied nitrogen are describedthe amount of supplied nitrogen was controlled by controlling the flow rate of the nitrogen gas supplied into the film formation chamber in the film formation step with the use of the abovedescribed sputtering apparatus the content of nitrogen in the aluminum alloy layer was controlled by adjusting the flow rate of the nitrogen gas to  sccm no nitrogen  sccm  sccm  sccm and  sccm in the sputtering gas flow rate  sccm while the film formation conditions for the aluminum alloy layer were the same as those described above and the vacuum degree was  pathe spectral reflectances of the surfaces of the aluminum alloy layers asgrown initial values and the spectral reflectances of the surfaces of the aluminum alloy layers immersed in a  moll phosphoric acid aqueous solution for  minutes were measured the results of the measurement are shown in fig  the measurement wavelength range was  nm to  nmas clearly seen from fig  the sample of the comparative example which was formed with no nitrogen gas mixed in the sputtering gas exhibited greatly decreased reflectance because of immersion in the phosphoric acid aqueous solution that is because of the phosphoric acid aqueous solution the surface of the aluminum alloy layer was etched so that the specularity greatly decreasedon the other hand it can be seen that the aluminum alloy layers which were formed with the nitrogen gas mixed in the sputtering gas still exhibited high reflectances over the almost entire measurement wavelength range even after immersion in the phosphoric acid aqueous solution particularly the aluminum alloy layers still exhibited high reflectances of not less than  over the almost entire measurement wavelength range except for the aluminum alloy layer formed with the nitrogen gas mixed at the flow rate of  sccm among others the aluminum alloy layers formed with the nitrogen flow rate of  sccm and  sccm exhibited high reflectances of not less than  both in the initial state and after immersion in the phosphoric acid aqueous solutionnext the decrease in size of crystal grains that form the aluminum alloy layer and the improvement in uniformity of the crystal grains which were achieved by supply of nitrogen are described with reference to figs a to c and fig figs a to c are sem images of a pure aluminum layer target purity not less than  mass  no nitrogen gas mixed and an aluminum alloy layer formed with the nitrogen gas mixed at the flow rate of  sccm target alloy aluminum  mass  ti  mass  which underwent one cycle of the anodization step and thereafter immersion in a phosphoric acid aqueous solution showing that minute recessed portions formed by anodization gradually enlarge due to the phosphoric acid aqueous solution fig  is a graph showing the relationship between the immersion duration et time in the phosphoric acid aqueous solution and the diameter of the recessed portions determined from the sem images pore diameter corresponding to dp described above the anodization step and the etching step with the phosphoric acid aqueous solution were carried out under the same conditions as those described above as seen from fig  even when nitrogen is contained in the aluminum alloy the etching rate does not greatly varyas seen from the sem images of figs a to c the size of crystal grains that form the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer is smaller than the size of crystal grains that form the pure aluminum layer and the crystal grains of the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer has high uniformity formation of recessed portions micropores by anodization advances more readily at the grain boundaries valleys and the etching also advances more readily at the valleys the nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer has small crystal grains and the uniformity of the crystal grains is high therefore the valleys are small shallow so that the etching advances uniformly as a result it is concluded that a plurality of recessed portions that form the inverted motheye structure are formed very denselynext motheye molds were produced through the abovedescribed process and the surfaces of resultant porous alumina layers were observed using sem in fig  through fig  a is a surface sem image of the aluminum alloy layer in the initial state b is a surface sem image after immersion in a phosphoric acid aqueous solution  moll for  minutes c and d are × and × surface sem images after formation of a motheye mold and e is a crosssectional sem image viewed in ° direction fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer of a comparative example formed without supply of nitrogen fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer with nitrogen supplied at  sccm during film formation fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer with nitrogen supplied at  sccm during film formation fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer with nitrogen supplied at  sccm during film formation fig  shows sem images of an aluminum alloy layer with nitrogen supplied at  sccm during film formationthe initial surface roughness of the aluminum alloy layers shown in part a of fig  through fig  was measured using afm when no nitrogen mixed or the nitrogen flow rate was  sccm  sccm  sccm and  sccm the average surface roughness ra was  nm  nm  nm  nm and  nm respectively and the maximum surface roughness rmax was  nm  nm  nm  nm and  nm respectively it can also be seen from this that when the nitrogen flow rate is  sccm to  sccm an aluminum alloy layer can be formed which has small surface roughness and high specularityas clearly seen from the comparison of parts c and d of fig  and parts c through e of fig  through fig  the recessed portions formed in the porous alumina layers shown in parts c through e of fig  and fig  are uniform and densenext the composition of porous alumina layers formed using aluminum alloy layers which have different nitrogen contents is described with reference to fig  the porous alumina layers were formed through the same process as that previously described with regard to the abovedescribed motheye mold manufacturing method here the composition of porous alumina layers formed using aluminum alloy layers formed under the same conditions as those employed for the aluminum alloy layers whose composition analysis results are shown in fig  was analyzed using esca in the same way as that previously described in consideration of the distribution along the thickness direction of the composition the composition analysis was performed while etching was carried out using an etching gun of the esca et sec in the graph in the measurement a photoelectron spectrometer jpsmc manufactured by jeol ltd was usedfig  shows the results of the composition analysis of the porous alumina layers without nitrogen the nitrogen flow rate  sccm  sccm  sccmit can be inferred from the results which were obtained when the etching duration was  seconds that the aluminum alloy layer underlying the porous alumina layer was exposed thus see the results which were obtained when the etching duration was  seconds to  secondsas seen from fig  the nitrogen content of a porous alumina layer formed using a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer nitrogen flow rate during film formation  sccm was not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  the nitrogen content of a porous alumina layer formed using a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer nitrogen flow rate during film formation  sccm was not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  and the nitrogen content of a porous alumina layer formed using a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer nitrogen flow rate during film formation  sccm was not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  that is it can be seen that a porous alumina layer formed using a nitrogencontaining aluminum alloy layer also contains nitrogen and the nitrogen content of the porous alumina layer is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass  particularly the nitrogen content of a porous alumina layer formed using an aluminum alloy layer which has a small surface roughness nitrogen flow rate during film formation  sccm to  sccm is not less than  mass  and not more than  mass in an antireflection film produced using a motheye mold which includes the thusobtained porous alumina layer as seen from fig a large raised portions which can cause scattering of light the twodimensional size viewed in the normal direction of the film is approximately  nm are not seen and the motheye structure is uniformly formed so that the antireflection film performs an excellent antireflection function note that the antireflection film shown in fig a was produced with the use of a motheye mold including the porous alumina layer shown in fig industrial applicabilitythe present invention relates to a mold base a mold base manufacturing method
