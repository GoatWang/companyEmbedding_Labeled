published november   content info  pages description abstract ‘global and china optical film industry report ’ of researchinchina chiefly covers the following  downstream market of optical film  optical film industry  blu industry and market  major players of polarizer optical film for blu and ito film optical film covers  categories polarizer optical film for blu and ito film for touch screen the total market scale is about usd  billion in  among which the polarizer market scales about usd  billion down  from last year polarizer market shows very high concentration and stability and top six major players occupy above  of the market the top three players are nitto denko sumitomo chemical and lg chem followed by chi mei materials of chi mei group benq materials of benq group and samsung cheil industries of samsung group the key for polarizer business lies in the supply of raw materials mainly including tac and pva tac also as a main material of film is monopolized by fujifilm and konica minolta with market share of about  and  respectively since the new production line of konica minolta was put into production in  the market share of konica minolta has increased rapidly to  from  pva is nearly monopolized by kuraray these upstream manufacturers are big enterprises with revenue of above usd  billion tac business accounts for about  of fujifilms total revenue tac and pva are not main products of these manufacturers therefore these big manufacturers have the strength to reduce the prices and put pressure on new entrants the market scale of optical film for blu is about usd  billion in  down  from  mainly due to the drastic decline of dbef sector optical film generally covers  categories  reflective film reflector  diffuser film  normal prism  multifunction prism  micro lens film  reflective polarizer dual brightness enhancement film dbef early lcd blu took ccfl as light source and used four optical films including two reflective films one bef and one diffuser film combination of bef and diffuser film as current development trend can reduce cost decrease blu thickness and shorten blu production process in the wake of high led price in early  manufacturers reduced led usage and adopted expensive dbef to compensate for the deficiency caused by less led usage however as the price of highbrightness led slumped in the second half of  manufacturers have increased led chip usage or adopted highbrightness led chip significantly reduced dbef usage and substituted cheap micro lens film for dbef because the threshold of blu optical film business is very low numerous manufacturers are faced with fierce price competition only by strengthening cooperation with upstream enterprises can a manufacturer gain a stable foothold pet film is a key material of blu optical film and is controlled by big petrochemical plants such as mitsubishi plastics toray industries teijin dupont films japan toyobo skc toray advanced materials korea kolon nan ya plastics shinkong materials technology most of which are japanese enterprises optical film performance depends heavily on raw materials another material of optical film is protection film which is mainly controlled by japanese manufacturers such as fujimori kogyo osung lst youl chon chemical sun a kaken nitto denko lintec japan is not only an electronic power but also a chemical giant and there is a gap between south korea and japan the chemical industry of taiwan region lags far behind south korea ito film is mainly applied to touch screens gff and gf touch screens need to use ito film the market growth rate hits  in  gg incell and oncell touch screens occupy the highend market but gff and gf touch screens being cheaper and slightly thinner though less transparent occupy the mid and lowend market moreover tablet pcs under inch prefer gf touch screens such as samsung galaxy tab and newest apple ipad mini japans nitto denko has monopolized the market of ito film for capacitive
