and selection procedure cannot fully unify the leds brightness and color onto a displayoptotech however has managed to bypass this challenge by developing the chromaticity measurement and correction system this system can adjust every unit of the led brightness and chroma and keep the difference below  so as to ensure optimum led uniformityon site calibrationwhy onsite color calibrationthe imbalance in uniform brightness and color shade of display might be caused by the following reasons• not performing factory calibration of each module during the manufacturing process • the maintaining reworking or repairing of display • led will be polluted or decayed by environmental condition or time virtual pixel sharing techlologyspecific rgb led design and accurate driver controlling technology improves the image caused by the edgeline effect optotechs virtual pixel technology enables every led pixel to be shared by the surrounded pixel increasing the resolution three or four fold hence delivering a higher quality image to the human eye this system is an economical way of increasing resolution with a controlled number of leds bit color depthwith the development of the driving system and gamma correction technology optotech is able to successfully diminish the flickering and interference in the lower scale of brightness and lightness area  bit from optotech is able to demonstrate more than  trillion colors grey scales on red green and blue brightness varies from nit nit nit nit in addition the  bit grey scale smoothly enhances the dim pixel image and enhances the picture quality of the displayvideo processing technolotyvideo processing technology provides a complete digital image product system through transforming the input signals to all
