applications lighting for security plastics exposure light for inspection factory automation about ushio lighting we generate synergy through our technologies products and ability to make proposals in the domains of light and industry we have continued improving our technological and product capabilities throughout our history of over half a centurycombining them with our strengths in making proposals in our own way we provide society and the market with solutions to open up the way to the next generation in the business domains expected to evolve further in the future we contribute to our customers and the development of society by making the most of our own abilities led bulbs we are very particular about our led production philosophy of maintaining the light quality brightness and image provided by traditional lamps as well as the atmosphere that it creates in addition we simulate the shape and the size our products offer high compatibility in the true sense that they can be used on existing infrastructure as is halogen lamps as a major manufacturer of halogen lamps we offer a wide selection of products including general lighting lighting for commercial facilities tv studio lighting stage lighting lightning for optical apparatus and specialist lighting our halogen lamps are compact and long lasting emitting an almost uniform brightness for their entire life and boasting the maximum possible color rendering and light emitting efficiency metal halide lamps due to offering a wide and even light with higher efficiency longer lifespan and lower power consumption than incandescent light bulbs metal halide lamps really bring their power to bear when used in commercial facilities outdoor facilities or as road illumination we meet all of the needs of our customers by providing metal halide lamps that expand upon freedom of light control and lamp design and ceramic metal halide lamps that are resistant to changes in color temperature xenon lamps a high luminance positional light source lamp that is the closest in quality to sunlight of all artificial light along with uses in situations that require a natural light such as stage and studio lighting xenon lamps are also widely used in optical devices such as projectors and for optical heating uv lamps we offer a complete lineup super high pressure uv lamps which have high intensity long life and stable radiant intensity high pressure uv lamps that are used in the field of photochemical reactions such as uv hardening and drying low pressure uv lamps used to promote oxidation reactions and deep uv lamps that offer both a wide spectrum and powerful energy infrared halogen heater the light from a halogen lamp to be used as a heat source in fact they are an extremely efficient source of energy with more than  of the input power turned into heat and instantly reaching °c they are characterized by swift activation simple control and by being clean safe small and light weight such heaters are widely used from household applications such as cooking and heating through to cutting edge fields such as space development led module  devices we have a complete selection of bullet lights surface mounted and modular types along with leds and photodiodes across all wavelengths in the infrared region we provide high power leds or super high output models to meet with our customer’ needs and respond to custom and madetoorder pieces including led elements with   nm uv visible light or infrared wavelengths lamps for marine use making use of more than  years of experience in the field of fishluring lights and our unique research and development into light we have created the following halogen metal halide and led fishluring lights that can be used under the harsh conditions found at sea the highly efficient light of ushio lighting meets with the demand for low energy consumption and reduction in required fuel lighting for general light illuminates many spaces and situationsat commercial facilities office and home light produces an effect as spot down and base light in stores light brings out the vibrancy warmth texture and shininess of foods clothing accessories and precious metals in restaurants and lounges light sets the tone for a relaxed atmosphere with our proposal to use “the required light in a required amount at a required time” for a user we work to offer color comfort and luxury along with energy saving lighting for entertainment this field requires spectacular and delicate effects a dynamic atmosphere and lighting that shows people objects and buildings to their best advantage we can meet the customers’ needs by offering our lighting applications and making the “faces” of objects people and nature more spectacular vibrant and excitingmoreover by providing high valueadded services including light planning sound design software and contents production we offer total solutions that combine light visuals and sound lighting for marine making use of more than  years of experience in the field of fishluring lights and our unique research and development into light we offer a line up that includes “floodlights” for use on land or sea for crime prevention accident prevention observation search and rescue and searching for or locating floating objects or obstructions “led fishluring lights” which achieve the same degree of fish luring power as current lights also contribute to reduction of fuel required for lighting lower energy consumption lightening of boat reduction in maintenance and improvement of working conditions and cautionary “warning lights” plant growth applications plans for the production of safe food products and farming factories seeking to improve selfsufficiency are in serious need of led lights that can be both suitably and freely controlled we have used our experience with fitting leds heating technology optical design technology and overall knowhow to create the first led lighting units in the world which are suited to the cultivation of grains lighting for security nfrared light is generally used for telecommunication sensing testing analysis and household remote controlsbased on the properties of infrared light eg invisibility to the human eye and high permeability we propose using it as a light source to provide security for facilities rivers harbors and airports as well as surveillance oftraffic and illegal dumping plastics products that support manufacturing plasticsbecause plastics have properties and functions that can match every purpose and use they have been used as the basis of various products in fields ranging from cuttingedge science industries and medicine to everyday items we offer solutions that support manufacturing in processes of handling plastic raw materials injectionmolding them and inspecting the products exposure doublesided and singlesided exposure equipment are available for rolltype work such as electromagnetic interference emi shields flexible print circuit boards and touch panels automated and manual exposure equipment are available for sheettype work such as leds microdevice manufacturing and print typesetting this diversity expands the use of light from manufacturing to research light for inspection we offer “light” that suits your purpose including inspections rd and measurements the equipment supports technological development as a light source that can integrate standardized parts and units such as lamps lenses and mirrors according to use moreover it facilitates inspections to detect defects that are hard to identify with the naked eye including expanded projection reflection permeation and direct viewing factory automation system that improves productivity factory automationwe offer products that cut total costs by automating work and production processes at factories and bolstering the efficiency and precision of quality management throughout the process from manufacturing to inspection
