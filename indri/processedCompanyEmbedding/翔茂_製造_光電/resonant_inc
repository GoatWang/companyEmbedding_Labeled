operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this annual report on form k in addition to historical financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly in risk factors and special note regarding forwardlooking statements overview resonant is a latestage development company creating innovative filter designs for radio frequency or rf frontends for the mobile device industry the rf frontend is the circuitry in a mobile device responsible for analog signal processing and is located between the devices antenna and its digital baseband we use a fundamentally new technology called infinite synthesized networksr or isnr to configure and connect resonators the building blocks of rf filters filters are a critical component of the rf frontend used to select desired radio frequency signals and reject unwanted signals we are using isn to develop new classes of filter designs we believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of delivering our solutions to the market our target customers make part or all of the rf frontend we intend to retain ownership of our designs and we expect to be compensated through license fees and royalties based on sales of rf frontend modules that incorporate our designs we do not intend to manufacture or sell any physical products or operate as a contract design company developing designs for a fee we are currently developing our first design a duplexer for our first customer a leading manufacturer of rf frontends for mobile devices duplexers are two filters combined into a single component which simultaneously selects both transmit and receive signals our customer has an option to license our duplexer design at already agreedupon royalty rates upon completion we recently delivered a completed duplexer design to the customer for consideration our design does not meet all the specifications in the development agreement however we believe our design delivers competitive performance and is competing with other products the customer is evaluating our design and there is no assurance that it has acceptable performance and therefore will be used even if it has acceptable performance there are a number of other considerations influencing the customers decision whether to use our design many of which are beyond our control there is no assurance that our design will be selected by the customer for use in its products on march   we announced a development project with a second customer for the design of our next singleband rf filter the goal of the project is to develop a new duplexer design for our customer to market to rf frontend manufacturers and mobile device oems the design which is estimated to take less than a year to develop is intended to replace a baw bulk acoustic wave filter with a less expensive saw surface acoustic wave filter the customer has not committed to use the resulting design and terms for a license have not been finalized we were founded as resonant llc on may   our inception date we commenced business on july   with initial contributions from our founders and superconductor technologies inc or sti the founders contributed  and agreed to work fulltime without pay until we secured adequate funding sti contributed a patent portfolio software equipment temporary office space and an early version of the development agreement with our first customer the founders loaned us an aggregate of  during the first quarter of  and we issued a series of warrants to the founders in connection with these loans we refer to the founder loans as bridge loans and the founder warrants as bridge loan warrants we repaid the bridge loans in the second quarter of  we changed our form of ownership from a limited liability company to a corporation in an exchange transaction on june   the founders exchanged all of their units and warrants of resonant llc for common stock and warrants of resonant inc sti exchanged all of its units of resonant llc for a  million subordinated convertible note of resonant inc or subordinated convertible note the subordinated convertible note was scheduled to mature on september   was interest free was secured by all of our assets and was subordinated to our senior convertible notes table of contents we closed our first financing on june   we issued  million of senior convertible notes or senior convertible notes in a private placement the senior convertible notes were scheduled to mature on september   bore interest at  per annum and were secured by all of our assets we paid mdb capital group llc or mdb which served as placement agent a commission of  and issued it warrants to purchase  shares of common stock which we refer to as the financing warrant we also issued mdb on june   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for business consulting services which we refer to as the consulting warrant we closed our initial public offering or ipo on june   we sold  shares of common stock which includes the exercise in full by the underwriter of its overallotment option at a price of  per share we received aggregate net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of  million our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol resn on may   our ipo date the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement relating to these securities on may   mdb acted as the sole underwriter for our ipo simultaneous with the funding of the ipo we issued the underwriter a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  per share the warrant is not exercisable until november   days from the date of the underwriting agreement we refer to this warrant as the underwriting warrant our senior convertible notes automatically converted into  shares of common stock effective upon the completion of the ipo we paid in cash the accrued interest of  similarly our subordinated convertible note automatically converted into  shares of common stock there was no accrued interest on this note the shares issued on conversion of the senior convertible note were subject to a day lockup that expired on november   and the shares issued on conversion of the subordinated convertible note are subject to a month lockup expiring may   we have earned no revenue since inception and our operations have been funded with the initial capital contributions and debt we have incurred accumulated losses totaling  million from inception through december   these losses are primarily the result of research and development costs associated with commercializing our technology combined with startup and financing costs we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves developing and licensing custom filter designs our consolidated financial statements contemplate the continuation of our business as a going concern however we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a new business we do not yet have the ability to earn revenue and have incurred significant losses from operations since inception at december   and  we had an accumulated deficit of  million and  million respectively and cash and cash equivalents of  million and  million respectively additionally as of december   we had  million in shortterm investments plan of operation we plan to commercialize our technology by creating filter designs that address the problems created by the growing number of frequency bands in the rf frontend of mobile devices first we plan to develop a series of singleband surface acoustic wave or saw filter designs for frequency bands presently dominated by larger and more expensive bulk acoustic wave or baw filters second we plan to develop tunable filter designs that replace multiple filters in order to succeed we must convince rf frontend suppliers that our filter designs can significantly reduce the size and cost of their products we plan to pursue filter design projects with potential customers and other strategic partners these types of arrangements may subsidize filter design costs as well as offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues to revenue however we intend to retain ownership of our technology designs and related improvements we expect to pursue development of multiple designs for multiple customers and grant each customer a royaltybearing license to a specific design with some limited period of exclusivity table of contents we are using the net proceeds from our ipo for product development to commercialize our technology research and development the development of our patent strategy and expansion of our patent portfolio as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes our anticipated costs include employee salaries and benefits compensation paid to consultants capital costs for research and other equipment costs associated with development activities including travel and administration legal expenses sales and marketing costs general and administrative expenses and other costs associated with a latestage publiclytraded technology company we anticipate significantly increasing the number of employees this year however this is highly dependent on the nature of our development efforts and our success in commercialization we anticipate adding employees for research and development as well as general and administrative functions to support our efforts we expect to incur consulting expenses related to technology development and other efforts as well as legal and related expenses to protect our intellectual property the amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the pace of progress of our commercialization and development efforts actual needs with respect to product testing development and research market conditions and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies in addition we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products technologies or businesses however we do not have plans for any acquisitions at this time we will have significant discretion in the use of any net proceeds investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of our common stock we cannot assure you that our technology will be accepted that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable we believe our current cash and investments of approximately  million will provide sufficient funding for planned operations into the first half of  if we do not generate adequate cash from revenues in  in order to reach positive cash flows we likely will be required to obtain additional financing to continue with our plan of commercialization furthermore since we have no committed source of financing we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations if we cannot raise funds as and when we need them we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company results of operations the consolidated statements of operations presented in our consolidated financial statements represent the activities of a resonant llc as predecessor company for the period from january   to june   and table of contents resonant llc resonant inc period from

december   and  research and development research and development expenses increased from  million in the year ended december   or  to  million in the year ended december   or  the increase of  million is the result of the increased payroll benefit costs stock compensation expenses consulting costs and development costs related to increased activity on our duplexer design under development there were no employees until late june  when we completed the senior convertible note financing and we have expanded our research and development employees to  as of the end of december   general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from  million in  to  million in  the increase of  million consists primarily of payroll and related expenses associated with increased staffing following our june  financing and our june  ipo the  period consisted primarily of a noncash charge of  for the fair value of the warrants issued for business consulting services the consulting services were completed in  and therefore we did not incur similar charges in  excluding the effect of the warrant charges from  general and administrative expenses for  increased by  million the increase was due primarily to increased payroll benefit costs do insurance finance costs stock compensation and accounting expenses we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of planned growth and the costs associated with operating as a public company depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased by  from  in  to  in  primarily as a result of our increases in fixed assets associated with our new corporate headquarters and increase in employees in  and our investment in patents interest income interest income increased by  from  in  to  in  primarily due to the increased cash balances from the net proceeds from the ipo we expect interest income to increase modestly in  as we earn interest on our increased cash balances interest expense interest expense increased by  million from  million in  to  million in  the increase consists primarily of amortization and writeoff of debt discounts and deferred financing costs due to the conversion of the convertible notes  million for the senior convertible notes  for the subordinated convertible note and  for the deferred financing costs we also incurred and paid  of interest on the senior convertible notes for  we repaid the bridge loans in june  the senior convertible notes and the subordinated convertible note were converted into common stock in june  in connection with our ipo debt discounts and deferred financing cost amortizations ceased upon conversion of these notes table of contents fair value adjustments to warrant and derivative liabilities we recorded all of our warrant and derivative liabilities at their fair value at issuance and adjusted the liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in their fair value periodic adjustments to the fair value of these liabilities generated noncash expense if they increased and noncash income if they decreased the fair value of these liabilities may have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter until the ipo date there was an increase of the fair value of the warrant and derivative liabilities as of december   resulting in noncash cost of  million for  for  the net fair value of all these liabilities increased resulting in noncash expense of  million for  the increase in the fair value of these liabilities in  is primarily due to our increasing share price and the related enterprise valuation due to the expiration of the redemption and put option features included in the bridge loan warrants financing warrant and consulting warrant as of the ipo date and the conversion of the senior convertible notes upon the ipo which terminated the derivative liability there will be no further fair value adjustments of such warrants and derivative liabilities in the future warrant expense we incurred bridge warrant expense of  in  and none in  this represents the noncash expense associated with the original issuance of the bridge loan warrants in the first quarter of  by resonant llc we repaid the bridge loans in june  consequently we did not incur any bridge warrant expense in  and will not incur further expense for these warrants other income other income consisted of a  million noncash gain from the writeoff of the derivative liability associated with our senior convertible notes due to the conversion of these notes the derivative liability balance was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with a portion recognized as a gain and classified in other income for  consequently we will not incur any further charges associated with fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative liability income taxes we have no revenues and are currently operating at a loss consequently our only tax liabilities for both periods were for minimum taxes in the states where we conduct business liquidity and capital resources financing activities we have earned no revenue since inception our operations have been funded with capital contributions debt and equity we began operations in july  with initial capital contributions from our founders and sti the founders contributed  and agreed to work fulltime without pay until we secured adequate funding sti contributed a patent portfolio software equipment temporary office space and an early version of our first development agreement the founders received class b units in resonant llc but later exchanged their class b units for common stock of resonant inc sti received class c units in resonant llc but later exchanged its class c units for the  million subordinated convertible note of resonant inc the bridge loans provided  of additional funding during the first and second quarters of  we raised  million of net proceeds from the sale of senior convertible notes in june  and we used part of the proceeds to repay the bridge loans in june  we sold  shares of common stock in an ipo generating net proceeds of  million we had current assets of  million and current liabilities of  at december   resulting in working capital of  million this compares to a working capital deficit of  million at december   the change in working capital is primarily the result of the net proceeds from our ipo and the related conversion of all outstanding notes to common stock our principal sources of liquidity consist of existing cash balances and investments of  million we believe our current resources will provide sufficient funding for planned operations into the first half of  if we do not generate adequate cash from revenues in  in order to reach positive cash flows we likely will be required to obtain additional financing to continue with our plan of commercialization there is no assurance that additional financing public or private will be available on acceptable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced new investors may demand rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock if we cannot raise any needed funds we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company table of contents our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern the factors described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty cash flow analysis the consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements represent the activities of a resonant llc as predecessor company for the period from january   to june   and operating activities used cash of  for the period from january   to june    million for the period from june   to december   and  million for the year ended december   the increase is primarily the result of increased expenses following our first financing in june  and an increase in costs associated with being a public company these cash uses were partially offset by noncash related costs for stockbased compensation fair value adjustments for the warrants and the derivative liability amortization of deferred financing and debt discount costs investing activities used cash of  for the period from january   to june    for the period from june   to december   and  million for the year ended december   the increase of  million in  consisted primarily of an  million investment of excess cash balances in a shortterm debt instrument the buildout of our new corporate headquarters the purchase of equipment and computers due to the increase in employees in  and our investment in patents financing activities provide cash of  for the period from january   to june    million for the period from june   to
