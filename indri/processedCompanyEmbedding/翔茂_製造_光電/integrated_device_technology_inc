selected as a ces  innovation awards honoree receiving high marks from judges in the embedded technologies product category idt will showcase the zmod during ces at its booth at sands halls ad  the idt® zmod family is a miniscule but highly sensitive gas sensor product line that can detect air quality total voc as well as selectively identify several volatile organic compounds including formaldehyde and ethanol with dimensions of  mm x  mm x  mm the chip features a unique silicon microhotplate with nanostructured sensing material that enables a highly sensitive measurement of gas the accompanying asic provides a flexible solution for integrating the sensor with various consumer devices including mobile phones wearables and appliances the zmod was among projects in the embedded technologies category selected by a threemember judging team comprised of an independent industrial designer an independent engineer and a member of the trade press judges looked at such attributes as engineering qualities aesthetic and design qualities and the products intended usefunction and user value we appreciate the judges recognition of the zmod which was developed to deliver outstanding reliability and flexibility in a very compact form said debra deininger director of gas sensing in idts consumer sensor division i look forward to meeting with attendees at ces this week to demonstrate how the zmod family of sensors can help differentiate their products about idt integrated device technology inc develops systemlevel solutions that optimize its customers applications idts

products idt offers highperformance and fullfeatured radio frequency rf products helping to address unwanted interference from an increasingly crowded radio spectrum today’s higher data rates drive the need for better radio signaltonoise ratios which translates to the need for idt’s higher linearity rf components idt’s patented rf solutions with unique technical innovations address the evolving needs of a wide range of applications including cellular g base stations communications systems microwave rfif catv test and measurement and industrial industryleading rf innovations glitchfree™ technology idt’s digital step attenuators dsa virtually eliminate transient overshoot that occurs during msb attenuation state transi­tions of standard dsas with glitchfree technology amplifier damage and loss of information at the adc are avoided flatnoise™ technology idt’s variable gain amplifier vga noise figure is kept virtually flat in the criti­cal region while gain is reduced this greatly eases design constraints for radio engineers by enhancing signaltonoise ratio snr zerodistortion™ technology idt’s rf mixers improve snr by reducing the noise floor and third order intermodulation distortion this is important for crowded spectrum envi­ronments as it enhances qualityofservice qos and frees up underutilized spectrum kz constant impedance technology idt’s rf switches maintain nearly constant impedance when switching between rf ports by controlling the impedance during the switching process voltage standing wave ratio vswr transients are minimized this improves switch reliability reduces voltage stresses on downstream components and improves overall system performance klin constant linearity technology idt’s variable gain amplifiers maintain constant high linearity as gain is adjusted as the gain is reduced the linearity oip remains constant in the critical region this prevents in­termodulation distortion from degrading as the gain is reduced parametric product
