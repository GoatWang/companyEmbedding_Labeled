and syria launched a surprise military campaign against israel the us supplied israel with arms in response to this the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries oapec consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria announced an oil embargo against canada japan the netherlands the united kingdom and the united states the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within nato some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents to address this the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights by january   us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march  graph of oil prices from – showing a sharp increase in  and again during the  energy crisis the orange line is adjusted for inflation independently oapec members agreed to use their leverage over the world pricesetting mechanism for oil to stabilize their incomes by raising world oil prices after the recent failure of negotiations with western oil companies the embargo occurred at a time of rising petroleum consumption by industrialized countries and coincided with a sharp increase in oil imports by the worlds largest oil consumer the united states in the aftermath targeted countries initiated a wide variety of policies to contain their future dependency the  oil price shock with the accompanying – stock market crash was regarded as the first discrete event since the great depression to have a persistent effect on the us economy the embargos success demonstrated saudi arabias diplomatic and economic power it was the largest oil exporter and a politically and religiously conservative kingdom background us oil production decline in  us oil production started to decline exacerbating the embargos impact following this nixon named james e akins as us ambassador to saudi arabia to audit us production capacity the confidential results were alarming—no spare capacity was available and production could only decrease usa oil production and imports as shown the import spike starts from the us production peak and the embargo has little effect the oil embargo had little effect on overall supply according to akins opec the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which then comprised  countries including iran seven arab countries iraq kuwait libya qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates plus venezuela indonesia nigeria and ecuador was formed at a baghdad conference on september   opec was organized to resist pressure by the seven sisters seven large western oil companies to reduce oil prices at first opec operated as an informal bargaining unit for resourcerich thirdworld countries opec confined its activities to gaining a larger share of the profits generated by oil companies and greater control over member production levels in the early s it began to exert economic and political strength the oil companies and importing nations suddenly faced a unified exporter bloc end of the bretton woods currency accord on august   the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar whose value was left to float rise and fall according to market demand shortly thereafter britain followed floating the pound sterling the other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time the industrialized nations increased their reserves by expanding their money supplies in amounts far greater than before the result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations currencies because oil was priced in dollars oil producers real income decreased in september  opec issued a joint communiqué stating that from then on they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold this contributed to the oil shock after  opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation from  to  the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year until the oil shock the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities opec ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions so their real incomes lagged the substantial price increases of – largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold yom kippur war on october   syria and egypt with support from other arab nations launched a surprise attack on israel on yom kippur this renewal of hostilities in the arab–israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices at the time iran was the worlds secondlargest oil exporter and a close us ally weeks later the shah of iran said in an interview of course the price of oil is going to rise certainly and how youve western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by  percent and the same for sugar and cement you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us refined as petrochemicals at a hundred times the price youve paid us its only fair that from now on you should pay more for oil lets say ten times more on october   us president richard nixon authorized operation nickel grass a strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to israel after the soviet union began sending arms to syria and egypt embargo in response to american aid to israel on october   opec raised the posted price of oil by  to  a barrel the following day oil ministers agreed to the embargo a cut in production by five percent from septembers output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met on october  nixon requested congress to appropriate  billion in emergency aid to israel including  billion in outright grants george lenczowski notes military supplies did not exhaust nixons eagerness to prevent israels collapsethis  billion decision triggered a collective opec response libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the united states saudi arabia and the other arab oilproducing states joined the embargo on october   at their kuwait meeting oapec proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the us as a principal hostile country price increases were also imposed greatly since shortterm oil demand is inelastic immediate demand falls little when the price rises thus market prices rose from  per barrel to  per barrel to reduce demand to the new lower level of supply the world financial system which was already under pressure from the bretton woods breakdown was set on a path of recessions and inflation that persisted until the early s with oil prices remaining elevated until  the price of oil during the embargo the graph is based on the nominal not real price of oil and so overstates prices at the end however the effects of the arab oil embargo are clear—it effectively doubled the real price of crude oil at the refinery level and caused massive shortages in the us over the long term the oil embargo changed the nature of

drastically the price of oil quadrupled by  to nearly us per barrel  usm this price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations for the countries of the middle east who had long been dominated by the industrial powers seen to have taken control of a vital commodity the oilexporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities amid shrinking western demand much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions particularly in the middle east saudi arabia spent over  billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam known as wahhabism throughout the world via religious charities such alharamain foundation which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as alqaeda and the taliban control of oil became known as the oil weapon it came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the arab states the weapon was aimed at the united states great britain canada japan and the netherlands these target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more proarab position production was eventually cut by  however the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes in the united states scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to  the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil further interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissingers dominance in the us production distribution and price disruptions have been held responsible for recessions periods of excessive inflation reduced productivity and lower economic growth the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to us energy security on an international level the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries such as automobiles macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies even in rugged terrain such as the arctic finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production gas stealers beware  opecmember states raised the prospect of nationalization of oil company holdings most notably saudi arabia nationalized aramco in  under the leadership of saudi oil minister ahmed zaki yamani as other opec nations followed suit the cartels income soared saudi arabia undertook a series of ambitious fiveyear development plans the biggest began in  funded at  billion other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs us retail price gas prices rose from a national average of  cents in may  to  cents in june  state governments requested citizens not to put up christmas lights oregon banned christmas and commercial lighting altogether politicians called for a national gas rationing program nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on saturday nights or sundays  of owners complied which produced long queues the embargo was not uniform across europe of the nine members of the european economic community eec the netherlands faced a complete embargo the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis while the other six faced partial cutbacks the uk had traditionally been an ally of israel and harold wilsons government supported the israelis during the sixday war his successor ted heath reversed this policy in  calling for israel to withdraw to its pre borders the eec was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the war it issued a statement on november  after the embargo and price rises had begun it was widely viewed as proarab supporting the francobritish line on the war opec duly lifted its embargo from all eec members the price rises had a much greater impact in europe than the embargo despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo the uk nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own—a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of – became a major factor in the change of government heath asked the british to heat only one room in their houses over the winter the uk germany italy switzerland and norway banned flying driving and boating on sundays sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil the netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity a few months later the crisis eased the embargo was lifted in march  after negotiations at the washington oil summit but the effects lingered throughout the s the dollar price of energy increased again the following year amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets price controls and rationing united states price controls exacerbated the crisis in the us the system limited the price of old oil that which had already been discovered while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment predictably old oil was withdrawn from the market creating greater scarcity the rule also discouraged development of alternative energies the rule had been intended to promote oil exploration scarcity was addressed by rationing as in many countries motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer  and increasing by summer  in  nixon named william e simon as the first administrator of the federal energy office a shortterm organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for  that each had consumed in  which worked for states whose populations were not increasing in other states lines at gasoline stations were common the american automobile association reported that in the last week of february   of american gasoline stations had no fuel oregon gasoline dealers displayed signs explaining the flag policy in the winter of – odd–even rationing allowed vehicles with license plates having an odd number as the last digit or a vanity license plate to buy gas only on oddnumbered days of the month while others could buy only on evennumbered days in some states a threecolor flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stations—green for unrationed availability yellow for restrictedrationed sales and red for out of stock gasoline ration stamps printed by the bureau of engraving and printing in  but not used rationing led to violent incidents when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in december  over the limited supplies simon had allocated for their industry in pennsylvania and ohio nonstriking truckers were shot at by striking truckers and in arkansas trucks of nonstrikers were attacked with bombs america had controlled the price of natural gas since the s with the inflation of the s the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves americas natural gas reserves dwindled from  trillion in  to  trillionclarification needed in  the price controls were not changed despite president gerald fords repeated requests to congress conservation and reduction in demand united

the federal  mph  kmh speed limit allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit yearround daylight saving time was implemented from january   to february   the move spawned significant criticism because it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise the prior rules were restored in citation needed gas stations abandoned during the crisis were sometimes used for other purposes this station at potlatch washington was turned into a revival hall the crisis prompted a call to conserve energy most notably a campaign by the advertising council using the tagline dont be

greater interest in renewable energy nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels according to peter grossman american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisismentality thinking promoting expensive quick fixes and singleshot solutions that ignore market and technology realities he wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient but whose prospects are doubtful the brazilian government implemented its proálcool proalcohol project in  that mixed ethanol with gasoline for automotive fuel israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo since it could extract sufficient oil from the sinai but to supplement israels overtaxed power grid harry zvi tabor the father of israels solar industry developed the prototype for a solar water heater now used in over  of israeli homes macroeconomy the crisis was a major factor in shifting japans economy away from oilintensive industries investment shifted to industries such as electronics japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis increased fuel costs allowed their small fuelefficient models to gain market share from the gasguzzling american competition this triggered a drop in american auto sales that lasted into the s western central banks decided to sharply cut interest rates to encourage growth deciding that inflation was a secondary concern although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers the policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo recent research claims that in the period after  the economy became more resilient to energy price increases the price shock created large current account deficits in oilimporting economies a petrodollar recycling mechanism was created through which opec surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the west to finance the current account deficits the functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of capital controls in oilimporting economies it marked the beginning of an exponential growth of western capital markets many in the public remain suspicious of oil companies believing they profiteered or even colluded with opeccitation needed in  seven of the fifteen top fortune  companies were oil companies falling to four in  international relations united states americas cold war policies suffered a major blow from the embargo they had focused on china and the soviet union but the latent challenge to us hegemony coming from the third world became evident in  declassified documents revealed that the us was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by underdeveloped countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late  although no explicit plan was mentioned a conversation between us secretary of defense james schlesinger and british ambassador to the united states lord cromer revealed schlesinger had told him that it was no longer obvious to him that the us could not use force british prime minister edward heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of us intentions which concluded america might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the us and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force intelligence warned the american occupation would need to last  years as the west developed alternative energy sources and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world nato western europe began switching from proisrael to more proarab policies this change strained the western alliance the us which imported only  of its oil from the middle east compared with  for the europeans and over  for japan remained staunchly committed to israel the percentage of us oil which comes from the nations bordering the persian gulf remained steady over the decades with a figure of a little more than  in  with the embargo in place many developed countries altered their policies regarding the arabisraeli conflict these included the uk which refused to allow the united states to use british bases and cyprus to airlift resupplies to israel along with the rest of the members of the european community canada shifted towards a more proarab position after displeasure was expressed towards canadas mostly neutral position on the other hand after the embargo the canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the arab position despite its low dependence on middle eastern oil japan although lacking historical connections to the middle east japan was the country most dependent on arab oil  of its imported oil came from the middle east in  on november   the saudi and kuwaiti governments declared japan a nonfriendly country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy it received a  production cut in december causing a panic on november  japan issued a statement asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the  territories advocating palestinian selfdetermination and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions by december  japan was considered an arabfriendly state nonaligned nations the oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a rightwing military coup in chile led by general augusto pinochet toppled socialist president salvador allende on september   the response of the nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales as a consequence an opposing latin american bloc was organized and financed in part by venezuelan oil revenues which quadrupled between  and  a year after the start of the embargo the uns nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a new international economic order under which nations within the global south would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their selfdevelopment arab states prior to the embargo the geopolitical competition between the soviet union and the united states in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources presented the arab states with financial security moderate economic growth and disproportionate international bargaining power the oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between arab countries and the us and ussr at the time egypt syria and iraq were allied with the ussr while saudi arabia turkey and iran plus israel aligned with the us vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers when anwar sadat became president of egypt in  he dismissed soviet specialists in egypt and reoriented towards the us concerns over economic domination from increased soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the  soviet invasion of afghanistan turning the persian gulf states towards the us for security guarantees against soviet military action the ussrs invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region also marked by increased american weapons sales technology and outright military presence saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues both states were competing for preeminence in the persian gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries by  saudi arms purchases from the us exceeded five times israels in the wake of the  iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism a reality which would quickly be revealed in the grand mosque seizure in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november  and a shiite muslim revolt in the oil rich alhasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year which was known as the  qatif uprising saudi arabia is a near absolute monarchy an arabic speaking country and has a sunni muslim majority while persian speaking iran since  is an islamist theocracy with a shiite muslim majority which explains the current hostility between saudi arabia and iran in november  wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the united states and its allies which revealed that the late saudi king abdullah urged the united states to attack iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program describing iran as a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination automobile industry this section may stray from the topic of the article please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page march  the oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come western europe after world war ii most west european countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports and as a result most cars made in europe were smaller and more economical than their american counterparts by the late s increasing incomes supported rising car sizes the oil crisis pushed west european car buyers away from larger less economical cars the most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks the only notable small hatchbacks built in western europe before the oil crisis were the peugeot  renault  and fiat  by the end of the decade the market had expanded with the introduction of the ford fiesta opel kadett sold as the vauxhall astra in great britain chrysler sunbeam and citroën visa buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to mediumsized hatchbacks virtually unknown in europe in  by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing saloons as the mainstay of this sector between  and  mediumsized hatchbacks were launched across europe the chryslersimca horizon fiat ritmo strada in the uk ford escort mk renault  volvo    opel kadett and volkswagen golf these cars were considerably more economical than the traditional saloons they were replacing and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles some  years after the oil crisis hatchbacks dominated most european small and

production by  the soviet union had become the worlds largest producer part of the decline in prices and economic and geopolitical power of opec came from the move to alternate energy sources opec had relied on price inelasticity to maintain high consumption but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand electricity generation from nuclear power and natural gas home heating from natural gas and ethanolblended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil the drop in prices presented a serious problem for oilexporting countries in

template message learn how and when to remove this template message a cartel is a group of formally independent producers whose goal is to increase their collective profits by means of price fixing limiting supply or other restrictive practices cartels typically control selling prices but some are organized to control the prices of purchased inputs antitrust laws forbid cartels however they continue to exist nationally and internationally openly and secretly formally and informally note that a single entity that holds a monopoly by this definition cannot be a cartel though it may be guilty of abusing said monopoly in other ways cartels usually occur in oligopolies where there are a small number of sellers and usually involve homogeneous products bid rigging is a special type of cartel contents  overview  examples  see also  bibliography  external links overviewedit people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices adam smith the wealth of nations  a survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last  years is citation needed private international cartels those with participants from two or more nations had an average price increase of  whereas domestic cartels averaged  less than  of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices in general cartel agreements are economically unstable in that there is an incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel see also game theory this has caused many cartels that attempt to set product prices to be unsuccessful in the long term empirical studies of th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from  to  years however once a cartel is broken the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be reformed publiclyknown cartels that do not follow this cycle include by some accounts the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec price fixing is often practiced internationally when the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty no antitrust actions may be initiated examples of such price fixing include oil whose price is partly controlled by the supply by opec countries also international airline tickets have prices fixed by agreement with the iata a practice for which there is a specific exception in antitrust law international price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of more than  countries examples of prosecuted international cartels are lysine citric acid graphite electrodes and bulk vitamins examplesedit the printing equipment company atf explicitly states in its  manual that its goal is to discourage unhealthy competition in the printing industry opec as its name suggests opec is organized by sovereign states it cannot be held to antitrust enforcement in other jurisdictions by virtue of the doctrine of state immunity under public international law however members of the group do frequently break rank to increase production quotas many trade associations especially in industries dominated by only a few major companies have been accused of being fronts for cartels although cartels are usually thought of as a group of corporations some consider trade unions to be cartels as they seek to raise the price of labor wages by preventing competition an example of a new international cartel is the one created by the members of the asian racing federation and documented in the
