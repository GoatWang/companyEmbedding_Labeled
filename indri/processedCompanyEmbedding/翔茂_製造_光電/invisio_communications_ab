communications launches secure headset for explosive environments and new customer segments supplemental file size   download pdf  kb stockholm april     invisio communications has developed a new version of the successful headset invisio m the new version called m ex has been developed to be absolute secure to use in situations where the tiniest spark could result in a fire or an explosion   — we are already established as a strong supplier within for example fire fighting but by being able to offer iecex and atex certified products we open new customer segments as mining and offshore operations where this kind of certification is a must says lars højgård hansen ceo of invisio communications   invision m ex is a new model in the m series specially developed for use in environments where there is risk for explosions typical examples can be in mines oilrigs and certain industries in these places it can be crucial that the equipment do not emit sparks through static electricity or loosely fit plugs or through extremely hot components that could ignite gas or explosive dust   invisio has now received iecex and atex ec certification which means that invisio m ex has gone through rigorous tests in order to make sure that it meets international directives for secure use in explosive environments   atex is an abbreviation of atmosphères explosives and invisio m ex meet both ec which dictates what an employer must do in order to have a safe production and ec which describes quality control qualification for use abovebelow ground what temperatures the equipment can take and what category of exposed environment that the product is purposed for   on top of the iecex and atexcertification invisio m ex has the same qualities as the previous versions that means among other things that it uses the patented technology invisio bone conduction which enables clear and undisrupted communication in demanding and extreme environments by picking up vibrations from the jaw bone instead of a regular microphone   — the requirements of the iecex and atex certifications are extremely high but for the men and women working under difficult conditions with the risk of fires and explosions it is obviously of highest importance to be able to fully rely on the equipment the fact that german tüv has tested and certified our headset invisio m ex feels of course tremendously good for us says lars højgård hansen   invisio m ex is based on the welltried invisio m certified by tüv in germany for iecex and atex ec developed for use in explosive environments including mines secure
