customers power device and cmos demands and offering one stopshopping services specifications of silicon episubstrate service type diameter mm epitaxial thickness μm resistivity range   ohm．cm silicon epitaxial wafer    buried epi service       crystal growth we use the czochralski cz method to grow both ptype and ntype dislocationfree silicon ingots with   or  orientation the diameters of the ingots are mm mm mm and mm the dopant types used and the matching resistivity ranges for each dopant are listed in the product tables for the ptype boron doped ingots the lowest resistivity that can be obtained for an ingot is  ohm．cm for an ntype ingot the lowest resistivity obtained by doping with redphosphorus is  ohm．cm to ensure high gettering ability and mechanical strength the oxygen contents of the ingots are regulated we also pay special attention to improve radial uniformity and to minimize the asgrown defects such as cop swirl and dislocation loops in an ingot    slicing slicing follows the process of cutting the ingot into thin wafer slices wafer works used cuttingedge wire and id saws that are operated by experienced and welltrained operators to produce high quality wafers the techniques with low kerf loss are applied to achieve thin wafers and help to ensure wafer flatness and total thickness variation ttv is controlled to minimum  edge grinding after slicing process edge grinding technology is used to create rounded edges on each wafer the purpose of this step is to minimize edge chipping breakage and thermal induced slip in the subsequent customers thermal processes for different epi thickness andor processes an optimized edge profile and length can be precisely processed to fulfill customers specifications  lapping lapping is the process to remove residual slicing damages on the wafer surface initial refinement on wafer flatness is also finished during this process  etching both acid and caustic etching are available for various customers requirements the damaged layers caused by the previous processes are removed during etching process we can also provide a residual damage layer during the caustic etching process for backside gettering purposes special shape control can be achieved with stateoftheart etching machines and techniques  backside treatment to satisfy customers detailed requirements wafer works is capable of adding lto polyback or backside damage bsd to the backside of wafers these treatments help to ensure high device yield for thick polyback wafer works has developed a unique patented process to ensure wafer flatness  polishing polishing techniques have a tremendous impact on the outcome of the wafer surface sophisticated polishing process has been used to produce worldclass silicon wafers in wafer works  cleaning the cleaning process removes surface metals and micro particles  from wafer surface an effective final cleaning process has been developed in wafer works to ensure the clean lines of output wafer products  epitaxy epitaxy is a cvd chemical vapor deposition proces a single layer or multiple layers of monocrystalline si is grown on the surface of a single crystal substrate since the characteristics of the epitaxial surface are superior to those of the polished si substrate it is more suitable for dence process our epitaxial process utilizes stateoftheart equipment with cuttingedge technologies  visual inspection in order to supply defectfree products to our customers we have conducted visual inspection on each wafer in the dark room with the assistance of the auxiliary light sources  wafer characterization after the wafer has undergone polishing and cleaning processes advanced equipment and cuttingedge technology are used to accurately measure the wafers resistivity thickness ttv stir bow and warp etc to fulfill customers requirements  wafer clearance inspection to ensure high quality wafers will be delivered to customers stateoftheart surface inspection equipments are used to accurately measure particle count on the wafer surface for final screening before packaging  package the wafers are desiccated with a nitrogen purge to
