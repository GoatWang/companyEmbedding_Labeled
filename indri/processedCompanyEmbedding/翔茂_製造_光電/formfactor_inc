about our nongaap net income and adjustments we believe that the presentation of nongaap net income nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share and free cash flow provides supplemental information that we believe are important to understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met certain targets and thresholds management uses nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items indicated herein for which the amounts or timing may vary significantly depending upon the companys activities and other factors facilitates comparability of the companys operating performance from period to period we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business as an additional way of viewing our liquidity that when viewed with our gaap results provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows many investors also prefer to track free cash flow as opposed to only gaap earnings free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and therefore it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows we have chosen to provide this nongaap information to investors so they can analyze our operating results closer to the way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our company we compute nongaap net income and nongaap fullydiluted earnings per share by adjusting gaap net income loss and gaap earnings per fullydiluted share to remove the impact of certain adjustments and the tax effect of those adjustments these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be materially different from other nongaap measures including similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to net income loss or earnings per fullydiluted share prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we may expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the nongaap adjustments described above and exclusion of these items from our nongaap net income and nongaap earnings per fullydiluted share should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual infrequent or nonrecurring for more information on the nongaap adjustments please see the table captioned reconciliation of nongaap net income included in this press release investor contact stan finkelstein investor relations   irformfactorcom source formfactor

applications  solid state technology subscribe  advertise  contribute    videos webcasts events technology papers mems devices for biomedical applications by dr ramesh ramadoss formfactor san jose ca microelectromechanical systems mems are a class of miniature devices and systems fabricated by micromachining processes mems devices have critical dimensions in the range of  nm to  µm or  mm mems technology is a precursor to the relatively more popular field of nanotechnology which refers to science engineering and technology below  nm down to the atomic scale occasionally mems devices with dimensions in the millimeterrange are referred to as mesoscale mems devices figure  shows relevant dimensional scale alongside biological matter     figure  dimensional scale of mems and nanotechnology adapted from nguyen et al  initially mems technology was based on silicon using bulk micromachining and surface micromachining processes figure  shows an sem image of a surface micromachining based polysilicon mems device an electrostatic motor which consists of twelve fixed stator electrodes and a rotor that spins around the pivot at its center gradually other materials such as glass ceramics and polymers have been adapted for mems especially polymers are attractive for biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility low cost and suitability for rapid prototyping other micromachining processes employed for fabrication of mems include dry plasma etching electroplating laser machining micromilling micromolding stereolithography and inkjet printing   figure  an sem image of a mems electrostatic motor source httpswwwmemsexchangeorg mems devices can actuate or sense on a microscale mems devices can function individually or in combination with other devices to generate effects of meso or macro scale some advantages of mems devices include small size light weight low power consumption and high functionality compared to conventional devices further mems technology offers cost reduction due to batch processing techniques similar to semiconductor integrated circuit ic manufacturing initially mems technology emerged as an offshoot of the semiconductor industry and eventually established itself as a specialized field of study with a significant market share according to yole développement the mems industry market in  was  billion which is a  percent growth from the previous year mems applications mems applications in various functional domains are shown in figure  the term “functional domain” is used to refer to a domain in which the mems device performs a function such as sensing or actuation in the early stages mems proved to be a revolutionary technology in various fields of the physical domain such as mechanical eg pressure sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes microfluidics eg inkjet nozzles acoustics eg microphone rf mems eg switches and resonators and optical mems eg micromirrors gradually mems technology has demonstrated unique solutions and delivered innovative products in chemical biological and medical domains as well mems have penetrated into consumer electronics home appliances automotive industry aerospace industry biomedical industry recreation and sports  figure  mems applications in various functional domains typically electronics are used to interface mems devices from its functional domain ie physical chemical or biological to the electrical domain for signal transduction andor recording it should be pointed out that the term mems was originally coined to refer to miniature sensors and actuators operating between electrical and mechanical domains gradually the term mems has evolved to encompass a wide variety of other microdevices fabricated by micromachining for example a micromachined electrochemical sensor is referred to as a mems device even though there is no functional role played by this device in the mechanical domain similarly the term “biomems” is used to refer to the science and technology of microdevices fabricated by micromachining for biological and medical applications biomems may or may not include any electrical or mechanical functions biomems application areas include biomedical transducers microfluidics medical implants microsurgical tools and tissue engineering as shown in figure  the global biomems market is expected to almost triple in size from  billion in  to  billion in   figure  biomems market forecast by yole développement  source httpwwwyolefr  biomems applications  in this section a few representative biomems applications are presented a survey of all products available on the market is beyond the scope of this article a mems pressure sensors the first mems devices to be used in the biomedical industry were reusable blood pressure sensors in the s mems pressure sensors have the largest class of applications including disposable blood pressure intraocular pressure iop intracranial pressure icp intrauterine pressure and angioplasty some manufacturers of mems pressure sensors for biomedical applications include cardiomems freescale semiconductors ge sensing measurement specialties omron sensimed ag and silicon microstructures according to world health organization who glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world after cataracts mems implantable pressure sensors are used for continuous iop monitoring in glaucoma patients a normal eye maintains a positive iop in the range of  mmhg abnormal elevation   mmhg and fluctuation of iop are considered the main risk factors for glaucoma glaucoma often without any pain or significant symptoms can cause an irreversible and incurable damage to the optic nerve this initially affects the peripheral vision and possibly leads to blindness without timely lifetime treatment therefore it is critical to accurately monitor iop and provide prompt treatments at the early stages of glaucoma development sensimed’s triggerfishtm implantable mems iop sensor is shown in figure  it consists of a disposable contact lens with a mems straingage pressure sensor element an embedded loop antenna golden rings and an asic microprocessor mmxmm chip the mems sensor includes a circular active outer ring and passive strain gages to measure corneal curvature changes in response to iop the loop antenna in the lens receives power from the external monitoring system and sends information back to the system figure  sensimed’s triggerfishtm implantable mems iop sensor source httpwwwsensimedcom b      mems inertial sensors mems accelerometers are used in defibrillators and pacemakers some patients exhibit unusually fast or chaotic heart beats and thus are at a high risk of cardiac arrest or a heart attack an implantable defibrillator restores a normal heart rhythm by providing electrical shocks to the heart during abnormal conditions some peoples’ hearts beat too slowly and this may be related to the natural aging process or a genetic condition a pacemaker maintains a proper heart beat by transmitting electrical impulses to the heart conventional pacemakers were fixed rate modern pacemakers employ mems accelerometers and are capable of adjusting heart rate in accordance with the patient’s physical activity medtronic is a leading manufacturer of mems based defibrillators and pacemakers figure  shows a mems accelerometerbased medtronic’s surescantm pacemaker and implantation of a pacemaker inside the body next to the heart this pacemaker is designed to be compatible with magnetic resonance imaging mri figure a mems inertial sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes were employed to develop one of the most unique wheelchairs the ibottm mobility system shown in figure  a combination of multiple inertial sensors in this system enables the user to operate the wheelchair and lift to a standing height just balancing on two wheels this allows the wheelchair user to interact with others facetoface the ibottm system

goal of a hearing aid is to compensate for the hearing loss and thus make audio communication more intelligible for the user in the us hearing aids are considered medical devices and are regulated by the fda according to nih approximately  percent  million of american adults report some degree of hearing loss there is a strong relationship between age and reported hearing loss also about  to  out of every  children in the united states are born deaf or hardofhearing  according to statistics  of those who could benefit from a hearingaid chose not to use one the reasons include reluctance to recognize hearing loss and social stigma associated with common misconceptions about wearing hearing aids thus it is highly desirable to miniaturize hearingaids without compromising performance mems technology enables reduction of form factor cost and power consumption compared to conventional hearingaid solutions figure  shows analog devices small size  mm mems microphone suitable for hearingaid

the surgical site minimally invasive surgical mis procedure aims to provide diagnosis monitoring or treatment of diseases by performing operations with very small incisions or sometimes through natural orifices advantages of mis over conventional open surgery includes less pain minimal injury to tissues minimal scarring reduced recovery time shorter hospital visits faster return to normal activities and often lower cost to the patient common mis procedures include angioplasty catheterization endoscopy laparoscopy and neurosurgery mems based microsurgical tools have been identified as a

of blood vessels due to accumulation of plaque that can lead to heart attack stroke and other serious issues angioplasty is a procedure designed to restore normal blood flow through clogged or blocked arteries a cardiac stent is inserted into a blood vessel via a catheter and then expanded to enlarge the vessel there are two general types of stents metal stents and polymer stents metal stents are the conventional type two main types of polymer stents are resorbable and nonresorbable the former type is attractive as it may be absorbed or dissolved inside the body figure  shows a stent

decline substantially you should carefully consider the numerous risks and uncertainties described above and in other section of this annual report on form k part i item      business we design develop manufacture sell and support advanced semiconductor probe card products and are the largest supplier worldwide of those products semiconductor manufacturers use our probe cards to perform wafer test also known as wafer sort which is the testing of the semiconductor die or chips while those die are still constituted on the semiconductor wafer wafer test enables semiconductor manufacturers to determine whether chips will meet specifications and be saleable once the wafer is diced and the die are singulated and individually packaged the perdie costs of singulation and packaging processes are relatively high and some of the die on a wafer are typically expected to be defective consequently there is often a compelling economic reason to perform wafer test probe cards are a critical element in enabling that wafer test process during wafer test the probe card is mounted on a prober and electrically connected to automated test equipment or ate to form the overall test cell which is capable of automatically performing wafer test in a full production environment the probe card forms the electrical interface between the individual chips on a wafer and the ate allowing the ate to detect chip faults and verify chip functionality and performance because each probe card forms a custom interface between a standard ate system and a unique customer chip design a key part of our product offering is ensuring that our design and customization processes successfully and accurately match the specific chip and wafer designs of our customers we were incorporated in  and we introduced our first probe card in  for much of our history sales of probe cards for testing dynamic random access memory or dram devices made up the majority of our revenues in october  we completed the acquisition of astria semiconductor holdings inc including its subsidiary microprobe incorporated together microprobe the majority of microprobes sales consisted of probe cards for testing systemonchip or soc devices the acquisition of microprobe significantly diversified and broadened our customer and revenue base and enabled us to realize operational and cost efficiencies in the combined companies’ technology resources assets and teams partially as a result of this diversification and leveraging of resources we improved our financial and operational performance during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  in fiscal  our business continued to gain momentum through strong broadbased customer demand coupled with continued improvements in our operational execution during fiscal   we increased revenues by  million to  million  from  million in   our net loss decreased by  million to  million  from  million in   we generated net cash of  million in fiscal  making it the second contiguous fiscal year in which we achieved a yeartoyear increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as described in further detail below under the heading “ businesscascade microtech acquisition ” in february  we entered into a definitive agreement with cascade microtech inc “cascade microtech” under which we will acquire all outstanding cascade microtech shares in a cash and stock transaction cascade microtech is a leader in the field of probe cards for radio frequency “rf” semiconductor products and has important capabilities in engineering probes and test systems we believe that this combination will further diversify our customer and revenue base and enable efficiencies and value realization in the combined companies’ operations technology resources assets and teams by leveraging combined global support and channel investments across a product line that spans from engineering to production test applications the combined company will be uniquely positioned to solve many of our customers’ most difficult test challenges from engineering to production the transaction is expected to close mid subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the approval by cascade microtech’s shareholders of the merger products our products utilize a variety of technologies including microelectromechanical systems mems technologies automation systems various product architectures and design tools our mems technologies generally enable rapid and costeffective manufacturing of resilient multimaterial composite springlike electricallyconductive contact elements with characteristic length scales of a few microns these contact elements such as our microspring contacts optimize the relative amounts of force on and across a chip’s bond pad solder bump or copper pillar during the test process and maintain their shape and position over a range of compression in addition while maintaining these mechanical characteristics the contact  elements must achieve reliable and highfidelity electrical contact through wafer surfaces that are generally oxidized or otherwise contaminated and must maintain these attributes over hundreds of thousands and even millions of compression cycles this capability when paired with our automation systems enables us to rapidly produce customerdesign specific probe cards that deliver leading precision reliability and electromechanical performance our probe cards are customized for our customers unique wafer and chip design by modifying and adapting our standard product architectures to meet an individual customer’s design layout and electrical test requirements for many advanced applications our products must maintain tens of thousands of simultaneous highfidelity lowimpedance electrical contacts with the corresponding chip contacts on the wafer our present technologies enable probe cards to be populated with over  contact elements with contact element spacings as small as  microns distributed over extents as large as mm so that all die on the wafer can be tested simultaneously we have invested and intend to continue to invest considerable resources in proprietary probe card design tools and processes these tools and processes are intended to enable the rapid and accurate customization described above including automated routing and trace length adjustment within our probe cards greatly enhancing our ability to rapidly design complex structures in addition some of our customers test certain chips over a large range of operating temperatures as opposed to conducting wafer test at one predetermined temperature we select materials used in our products after careful consideration of the potential range of test operating temperatures and design our probe cards to provide for a precise match with the thermal expansion characteristics of the wafer under test as a result for many of our products our customers can use the same probe card for both low and high temperature testing without a loss of mechanical or electrical performance in addition for test situations for which a customer requires extreme positional accuracy at a specific temperature we have designed probe cards that are intended to be optimized for testing at such temperatures through ongoing investments in both our technology and operations we continue to innovate and improve so that our products will meet customers future technical roadmap performance quality and commercial requirements we also continue to leverage these ongoing investments across all advanced probe card markets to realize synergies and economies of scale to benefit our competitiveness timetomarket and overall profitability customers our customers include semiconductor chip manufacturers in the dram flash and soc markets our customers use our probe cards to test dram chips including lpddr lpddr lpddr ddr ddr ddr ddr sdram psram and graphic dram nor pcm

interconnection systemlevel design process a frontend process which may include wire bonding photolithography plating and metallurgical processes dry and electrodeposition pick and place assembly and a backend process which includes general assembly and test critical steps in our manufacturing process are performed in a variety of clean room environments including as stringent as a class  environment depending on the requirements of the specific manufacturing processes we depend on suppliers for some critical components of our manufacturing processes including ceramic substrates and complex printed circuit boards and for other materials used in our manufacturing processes we also rely on suppliers to provide certain contact elements and interconnects incorporated into our products some of these components and materials are supplied by a single vendor and some are subject to certain minimum order quantities generally we rely on purchase orders rather than longterm contracts with our suppliers which subjects us to risks including price increases manufacturing capacity constraints issues and component shortages we continually assess and evaluate alternative sources of supply for all components and materials our primary manufacturing facilities are located in livermore san jose and carlsbad california united states we also perform certain probe card

governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace we believe that we comply in all material respects with the environmental laws and regulations that apply to us including those of the california department of toxic substances control the bay area air quality management district the city of livermore water resources division county of santa clara department of environmental health county of san diego hazardous materials division and encino water district and the california division of occupational safety and health we did not receive any notices of violations of environmental laws and regulations in fiscal    or   in the future we may  receive notices of violations of environmental regulations or otherwise learn of such violations environmental contamination or violations may negatively impact our business we are also subject to sec rules that will require diligence disclosure and reporting on whether certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals used in our products originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries we have implemented a program in the effort to comply with these new rules which could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals we use in our products we will not only incur costs in relation to our compliance with such disclosure requirements but may also face difficulties in satisfying any of our customers who require that all of our products are certified as conflict mineral free competition the highly competitive probe card market comprises many domestic and foreign companies and has historically been fragmented with many local suppliers servicing individual customers in often differentiated applications our current and potential competitors in the probe card market include amst co ltd cascade microtech inc feinmetall gmbh japan electronic materials corporation korea instrument co ltd mn co ltd microfriend inc micronics japan co ltd mpi corporation nhk spring co ltd soulbrain engineering sv probe inc synergie cad technoprobe tse co ltd and willtechnology co ltd among others in addition to the ability to address probe card performance and capability requirements in differing applications the primary competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include product quality and reliability price total cost of ownership design and manufacturing lead times service capability geographic proximity field applications support and timeliness of delivery some of our competitors are also suppliers of other types of test equipment or other semiconductor equipment and may have greater financial and other resources than we do we expect our competitors may enhance their current products and may introduce new products that will be competitive with our probe cards in addition it is possible that new competitors including test equipment manufacturers may offer new technologies that reduce the value of our probe cards additionally semiconductor manufacturers may implement chip designs that include builtin selftest or bist capabilities or similar functions or methodologies that increase test throughput and reduce test content thereby eliminating some or all of our current product advantages our ability to compete favorably may also be adversely affected by delays in qualification of our

strategies that include low performance semiconductor testers and less complex probe cards intellectual property our success depends in part upon our ability to continue to innovate and invest in research and development to meet the testing requirements of our customers to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets trademarks and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have filed actions to enforce those rights against third parties and may pursue such actions in the future we have generated and continue to generate and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights covering innovations that are intended to create a competitive advantage and to support the protection of our investments in research and development we believe that we possess one of the most substantial patent portfolios relevant to probe card products many of our issued patents cover features of our products including inventions related to interconnect technologies probe cards and testing waferlevel packaging and test sockets and assemblies and microchips although we believe that our patents and other intellectual property rights have significant value we do not believe that maintaining or growing our business is materially dependent on any single patent due to the rapid pace of innovation within the markets that we serve it is possible that our protection through patents may be less important than factors such as our technological expertise continuing development of new products and technologies protection of trade secrets market penetration customer relationships and our ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide no assurance can be given that any patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a sustained competitive advantage in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technologies design around our patents or attempt to manufacture and sell infringing products in countries that do not strongly enforce intellectual property rights

on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which we agreed to acquire cascade microtech through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with and into cascade microtech subject to the terms of the merger agreement at the effective time of the merger each outstanding share of cascade microtech common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a  in cash without interest and b  shares of formfactor common stock cascade microtech is an oregon corporation that designs develops manufactures and markets advanced wafer probing thermal and reliability solutions for the electrical measurement and testing of high performance semiconductor devices  subject to the terms of the merger agreement at the effective time of the merger all of the outstanding and vested equity awards of cascade microtech will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash in respect of the merger consideration the shares of cascade microtech common stock underlying the awards would have received and all of the outstanding and unvested equity awards of cascade microtech will be assumed on substantially the same terms except that the number of shares of our common stock that will underlie the assumed award and the exercise price of any assumed option will be determined pursuant to a formula intended to preserve the intrinsic value of the original award completion of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions including approval by cascade microtech’s shareholders and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended among others and therefore has not been reflected in the financial statements included in this annual report on form k there is no financing condition to our obligations under the merger agreement we expect the merger to be completed in mid to finance a portion of the consideration for the proposed merger we entered into a commitment letter with certain lenders to provide a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of  million the funding of the term loan facility is subject to certain conditions including the execution of definitive financing documentation the consummation of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement the absence of a company material adverse effect as defined in the merger agreement a minimum liquidity condition and other customary closing conditions the above description of the merger agreement and the proposed merger is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement included as exhibit  to our current report on form k filed with the sec on february   item a     risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this annual report on form k in evaluating formfactor and our business if any of the identified risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form k are not the only ones we face additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be sufficiently important to describe here may also impair our business operations or the trading price of our common stock a delay in qualifying next generation products could result in higher development costs and loss of market share which could negatively impact our business and financial results we may suffer from delays in qualifying our nextgeneration products at our customers in  we increased our activities and spending on the development of a new nand flash probe card architecture which is incorporated into our vector nand flash memory probe card in  we successfully qualified our vector probe card at two customers if we are not able to continue to successfully qualify our vector product at other nand flash memory customers or if we are not able to realize material revenues from sales of the vector probe card in the future it could negatively impact our revenues and margins and harm our business we continue to invest in research and development activities around new product technologies and architectures in  we introduced new vertical mems products for subum pitch copper pillar probing and wirebond pads probing if we are unable to qualify and successfully introduce products incorporating new product technologies and architectures it may negatively impact our business we have announced a proposed acquisition and may make additional acquisitions and investments in the future which could put a strain on our resources cause ownership dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our financial results on february   we announced our proposed acquisition of cascade microtech which is expected to close in mid our proposed acquisition of cascade microtech will subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties including that • the process of integrating cascade microtech’s business additional lines of products or technologies into our company could put a strain on our resources be expensive and time consuming substantially reduce our cash reserves cause delays in product delivery and might not be successful • managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our business may be exposed to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets • we might lose key cascade microtech employees during or after the integration process  • we might not be successful in integrating cascade microtech’s business products or technologies and might not achieve the revenues and cost benefits we anticipate even if cascade microtech is integrated • our purchase of cascade microtech may require additional investment that we do not currently anticipate • customers of cascade microtech or us may become dissatisfied especially if we experience performance problems creating maintaining distributing or otherwise with cascade microtech’s products • we will issue new equity securities in connection with a transaction as part of the consideration paid to cascade microtech’s shareholders which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders • we will finance a portion of the consideration to be paid to cascade shareholders in connection with the merger through a new senior secured term loan facility for  million which will contain restrictive debt covenants • we may assume contingent liabilities experience possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or encounter other unanticipated events or circumstances upon completion of the acquisition of cascade microtech any of which could harm our business or • we will have less cash available for other purposes including for use in acquisitions of other technologies or businesses in addition to our proposed acquisition of cascade microtech we may in the future make other acquisitions or investments which may subject us to similar risks integrating any newly acquired businesses products or technologies into our company could put a strain on our resources could be expensive and time consuming could substantially reduce our cash reserves could cause delays in product delivery and might not be successful future acquisitions and investments could divert managements attention from other business concerns and expose our business to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets in addition we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations we might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses products or technologies and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits investments that we make may not result in a return consistent with our projections upon which such investments are made or may require additional investment that we did not originally anticipate in addition future acquisitions could result in customer dissatisfaction performance problems with an acquired company potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and restrictive debt covenants contingent liabilities possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances any of which could harm our business we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and we could continue to experience significant declines in our revenues if any major customer cancels reduces delays a purchase of or does not place a projected order for our products or does not pay us or delays or extends payment for our products past their original due dates a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues four customers represented  of total revenues in fiscal    customers represented  of total revenues in fiscal  and  customers represented  of total revenues in fiscal   in fiscal    and   our ten largest customers accounted for    and  of our revenues respectively we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues consolidation in the semiconductor industry may increase this concentration in the future the loss of any of these customers or cancellation reduction or deferral of even a small number of purchases of our products by these customers could significantly reduce our revenues cancellations reductions or deferrals could result from another downturn in the semiconductor industry or from manufacturing delays quality or reliability issues with our products or from interruptions to our customers operations due to fire natural disasters or other events furthermore because our probe cards are custom products designed for our customers unique wafer designs any cancellations reductions or delays can result in significant nonrecoverable costs in some situations our customers might be able to cancel or reduce orders without a significant penalty our customers could also fail to pay all or part of an invoice for our products if a customer fails to pay us or delays payment for our products we may be unable to recognize revenue our financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted and we may incur additional charges for uncollectable customer receivable it is also possible that if we make the decision to initiate legal proceedings against customers to seek payment of outstanding receivables it will negatively impact a customer relationship and result in lost revenues in the future as happened with our customer promos technologies customers with financial difficulties may be forced to materially reduce or discontinue operations file for bankruptcy or other relief or  may be acquired by one of our other customers any of which would further reduce our customer base andor result in the loss of revenues changes in customers test strategies equipment and processes could cause us to lose revenues the demand for probe cards depends in large part upon the number of semiconductor designs the pace of technology and architecture transitions in chip designs and overall semiconductor unit volume the time it takes to test a wafer depends upon the number of devices being tested the complexity of these devices the test software program and the test equipment itself as test programs become increasingly effective and test throughput increases the number of probe cards required to test a given volume of devices declines therefore advances in the test process could cause us to lose sales further many semiconductor manufacturers are implementing chip designs featuring builtinselftest or bist capabilities or similar design for testability or dft functions or methodologies that increase test throughput and reduce the cost of test these efforts include strategies to reduce the technical requirements on test equipment or to improve data about device performance early in the manufacturing process or to test the device later in the manufacturing process for quality assurance purposes in some cases bist or dft can create opportunities for our technologies in other cases bist or dft can reduce requirements for waferlevel test and reduce our opportunities although we seek to work with our customers to show ways that our technologies can be applied together with bist and dft approaches to create opportunities to further reduce the cost of test the overall impact of bist and dft technologies could slow the migration to wafer level testing and adversely affect our revenues similar results could occur if new chip designs are implemented which we are unable to test efficiently or if semiconductor manufacturers reduce generally the amount or degree of wafer test they perform we incur significant research and development expenses in conjunction with the introduction of new product architectures and platforms the introduction and adoption of new test equipment platforms can impact probe card requirements andor demand which could harm our revenues additionally because our customers require both test equipment and probe cards a delay or disruption in the introduction of new test equipment platforms could negatively affect our growth cyclicality in the semiconductor industry may adversely impact our sales in the future and as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reduced revenues and operating results the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time this industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product and technology cycles excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions the global economic and semiconductor downturns have caused and may in the future cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next our business depends heavily upon the development and manufacture of new semiconductors the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers make transitions to smaller nanometer technology nodes and implement tooling cycles the volume of production by semiconductor manufacturers and the overall financial strength of our customers which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products such as servers personal computers automobiles and cell phones that use semiconductors during industry downturns semiconductor manufacturers generally sharply curtail their spending including their equipment spending defer their adoption of emerging technologies and historically have lowered their spending disproportionately more than the decline in their revenues this is particularly true when there is a point during an industry cycle in which the semiconductor manufacturers costs related to semiconductor devices approach or exceed the sales price of the devices as a result we would experience reduced revenues due to the decreased demand for our probe cards by our semiconductor manufacturer customers accordingly if we do not adjust our levels of manufacturing and human resources or manage our costs and deliveries from suppliers in response to lower spending by semiconductor manufacturers our gross margin may decline and cause us to experience further operating losses changes in customers product roadmaps and the timelines associated with those roadmaps could negatively impact our product development effort and new product introductions which could in turn cause us to lose revenues the demand for probe cards depends in large part upon the demand for semiconductor devices and our customers product roadmaps for example the dram market was impacted negatively in fiscal  as secular changes in the personal computer markets significantly lowered demand for commodity dram we may be required to make changes to our operational or rd activities to reduce the breadth of our investments in certain of our products for example in the first quarter of fiscal  we suspended development activities specific to our next generation matrix platform and consolidated our technologies and development to extend the capabilities of the thencurrent matrix platform if this consolidation does not continue to be successful or does not extend the capabilities of our products as anticipated or if changes to our operational or rd activities impact our ability to introduce competitive products in the future we may lose sales and our financial results will be negatively impacted  the markets in which we participate are competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be harmed we are experiencing increased competition in the probe card market and we expect competition to intensify in the future increased competition has resulted in and in the future is likely to result in price reductions reduced gross margins or loss of market share competitors might introduce new competitive products for the same markets that our products currently serve these products may have better performance lower prices andor broader acceptance than our products competitive products may not have better performance lower prices andor broader acceptance than our products but may be able to meet shorter delivery times required by customers and result in the loss of revenue for us in addition for products such as probe cards semiconductor manufacturers typically qualify more than one source to avoid dependence on a single source of supply as a result our customers would likely purchase products from our competitors current or potential competitors include amst co ltd cascade microtech inc feinmetall gmbh japan electronic materials corporation korea instrument co ltd mn co ltd microfriend inc micronics japan co ltd mpi corporation nhk spring co ltd soulbrain engineering sv probe inc synergie cad technoprobe tse co ltd and willtechnology co ltd among others many of our current or potential competitors have larger customer bases more established customer relationships or greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resources than we do as a result they might be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development promotion sale and support of their products and reduce prices to increase market share some of our competitors also supply other types of test equipment those competitors that offer both advanced probe cards and needle probe cards might have strong existing relationships with our existing customers or with potential customers it is possible that one or more of our competitors may be able to increase their sales to mutual customers resulting in a loss of revenue share for us it is further possible that existing or new competitors including test equipment manufacturers may offer new technologies that reduce the value of our probe cards if we fail to protect our proprietary rights our competitors might gain access to our technology which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in our markets and harm our operating results if we choose not to protect our proprietary rights or fail in our efforts to protect our proprietary rights our competitors might gain access to our technology unauthorized parties might attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary others might independently develop similar or competing technologies or methods or design around our patents in addition the laws of many foreign countries in which we or our customers do business do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states as a result our proprietary rights could be compromised our competitors might offer products similar to ours and we might not be able to compete successfully we also cannot assure that • our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate • patents will be issued from our pending or future applications • our existing or future patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us • our patents or other intellectual property will not be invalidated circumvented or successfully challenged in the united states or foreign countries or • others will not misappropriate our proprietary technologies or independently develop similar technologies duplicate our products or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property or attempt to manufacture and sell infringing products in countries that do not strongly enforce intellectual property rights we spent and may be required to spend in the future significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights in certain cases our competitors have initiated reexamination proceedings in the uspto and invalidity proceedings in foreign patent offices against certain of our patents any litigation whether or not resolved in our favor and whether initiated by us or by a third party could result in significant and possibly material expense to us and divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel in addition while patents are territorial and a ruling on a certain given patent does not necessarily impact the validity or enforceability of a corresponding or related patent in a different country an adverse ruling in one country might negatively impact our ability to enforce the corresponding or related patent in other countries certain of our customer contracts contain provisions that require us to defend andor indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim an adverse determination could also negatively impact our ability to license certain of our technologies and methods to others and result in  our competitors being allowed to sell products with or add to their products features and benefits contained in our products thereby reducing our competitive advantages over these competing products if we do not innovate and keep pace with technological developments in the semiconductor industry our products might not be competitive and our revenues and operating results could suffer we must continue to innovate and to invest in research and development to improve our competitive position and to meet the testing requirements of our customers our future growth depends in significant part upon our ability to work effectively with and anticipate the testing needs of our customers and to develop and support new products and product enhancements to meet these needs on a timely and costeffective basis our customers testing needs are becoming more challenging as the semiconductor industry continues to experience rapid technological change driven by the demand for complex circuits that are shrinking in size are increasing in speed and functionality and also becoming less expensive to produce examples of trends driving demand for technological research and development include semiconductor manufacturers transition to  nanometer dram technology node flash and soc fabrication process nodes transition to higher gigabit density memory and lowerpower multicore processors and rapid adoption of advanced  ic packaging types such as waferlevel packaging flipchip devices devices incorporating copper pillar packaging and throughsiliconvia tsv technologies our customers expect that they will be able to integrate our probe cards into any manufacturing process as soon as they are installed therefore to meet these expectations and remain competitive we must continually design develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements with improved features we may also work collaboratively with one or more third parties in the development of new technologies or in improvements to our existing technologies it is possible that these collaborations may be delayed or even ultimately prove unsuccessful by matters outside of our control such as the financial condition of the third party it is possible that our internal development efforts and engagements with third parties regarding the development of manufacturing equipment having similar functionality may have a lengthy development and ramp up time and negatively impact our ability to complete new products and realize revenue from those products successful product design development and introduction on a timely basis require that we • design innovative and performanceenhancing product architectures technologies and features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors • in some cases engage with third parties who have particular expertise in order to complete one or more aspects of the design and manufacturing process • qualify with the customers the new product or an existing product incorporating new technology • transition our products to new manufacturing technologies • offer our products for sale at competitive price levels while maintaining our grossmargins within our financial model • identify emerging technological trends in our target markets • maintain effective marketing strategies • respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others and • adjust to changing market conditions quickly and costeffectively not only do we need the technical expertise to implement the changes necessary to keep our technologies current but we must also rely heavily on the judgment of our management to anticipate future market trends if we are unable to timely predict industry changes or industry trends or if we are unable to modify our products or design manufacture and deliver new products on a timely basis or if a third party with which we engage does not timely deliver a component or service for one of our product modifications or new products we might lose customers or market share in addition we might not be able to recover our research and development expenditures which could harm our operating results we have recorded significant restructuring inventory writeoffs and asset impairment charges in the past and may do so again in the future which could have a material negative impact on our business we recorded material restructuring charges related to our global workforce reductions in fiscal    and   and impairment charges related to our longlived assets in fiscal  and fiscal   as we continue to align our operations with our business requirements we may implement additional cost reduction actions which would require us to take additional potentially material restructuring charges related to employee terminations asset disposal or exit costs we may also be  required to write off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of inventory experience declines and such additional writeoffs could constitute material charges in addition significant adverse changes in market conditions could require us to take additional material impairment charges related to our longlived assets our longlived assets including intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using the straightline and accelerated methods and are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable the valuation of our longlived assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates other adverse changes in market conditions particularly if such changes have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use in our assessment of the recoverability of our longlived assets could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in future impairment charges we may also incur charges for factory underutilization depending upon the demand for our products and factory capacity any such additional charges whether related to restructuring asset impairment or factory underutilization may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements our recent restructuring plans may not have properly aligned our cost structure with our business needs and overall semiconductor industry requirements and even though completed may adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results in each of fiscal  through   we conducted reductions in our work force as part of companywide organizational restructurings or cost reduction plans these plans were intended to help focus our resources more strategically towards business needs and industry requirements we realized certain cost savings from these restructuring actions but our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if we experience unanticipated inefficiencies as a result of our restructuring activities unanticipated or product delivery or quality issues resulting in impaired customer relationships caused by reduced headcount or delay in ramping the manufacture of our products or delay in our development introduction and qualification of our new products and technologies we cannot ensure we will not undertake additional workforce reductions that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or future restructuring plans any of these issues could render our restructuring plan ineffective which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results if we do not continue to take steps to optimize the structure of our operations to position our company for longterm profitable growth we might not succeed the timing length and severity of the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry are difficult to predict this cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict our future operating results and plan our business and could also impair the value of our tangible and intangible assets we implemented global cost reduction plans in each fiscal year from  through  and are continuing to pursue measures to improve our operating efficiency such cost reduction plans and measures to improve operating efficiency have included workforce reductions the consolidation of manufacturing capacity the centralization of support functions to regional and global shared service centers and the combining of the technical and manufacturing teams across multiple product lines if we do not continue to implement measures for optimizing our financial model for prevailing market conditions our competitiveness could be seriously harmed our ability to invest in our business for future growth may be negatively impacted and our company might not succeed if we do not successfully structure our operations by for example strengthening our local application and service capabilities to improve customer responsiveness changing our manufacturing structure and processes for shorter cycle time and improved product delivery capabilities realigning our research and development efforts and continue to motivate and retain our key employees we may experience deterioration in our business and our company might not succeed in addition if we are unable to proactively and effectively manage our operations andor realign our controls systems and infrastructure to changing business conditions for example as the semiconductor industry moves past a cyclical downturn we may not be in a position to boost our personnel manufacturing capacity service capabilities and productivity and support growth in response to increasing customer demand for our products which would in turn have a negative impact on our operating results our pricing for our products could result in certain customers deciding to not purchase our products which could negatively impact our business and financial results we believe that our pricing guidelines are consistent with normal industry cost learning curves but certain customers may in the future react negatively to our pricing and elect to not purchase our products to purchase fewer of our products as compared to those of our competitors or to phase out the purchase of our products in which case our business financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted  if goodwill or other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the microprobe acquisition become impaired we could be required to take significant charges against earnings in connection with the accounting for the microprobe acquisition we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets have been impaired finitelived intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders equity in future periods similarly any goodwill we may record upon the completion of our proposed acquisition of cascade microtech could become impaired in future periods refer to note  to notes to consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets for further details relating to our annual goodwill impairment assessment periodic global economic and semiconductor industry downturns could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition global economic and semiconductor industry downturns have in the past negatively affected and could in the future negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition during a downturn we may experience declines in demand for our probe cards resulting from our customers taking steps to conserve cash by cutting production postponing the implementation of tooling cycles and delaying the ramp of new technology nodes in response to slow demand for consumer and other products incorporating devices tested with our probe cards we may also experience increased pricing pressure on certain of our products which may reduce our gross margins a protracted downturn could cause customers to become insolvent resulting in a loss of revenue andor the uncollectability of accounts receivable downturns have historically and may in the future cause customers to seek extended payment terms or delay payment for our products past their original due dates resulting in deferral of revenue and increasing our potential bad debt exposure it is also possible that one or more of our key suppliers may become insolvent leading to delays in the development and shipment of our products increased expense and loss of revenue in addition we may experience increased impairment charges due to declines in the fair values of marketable debt securities or charges based upon underutilization of our factory environmental and other disasters such as flooding earthquakes fires volcanic eruptions or leakage from nuclear reactors or a combination thereof may negatively impact our business our business is vulnerable to the direct and indirect impact of environmental and other disasters for example flooding in thailand in  negatively impacted the operations of several disk drive manufacturers which created a shortage of disk drives available for incorporation into personal computers this disk drive shortage resulted in a slowing of the manufacture of personal computers and for the dram incorporated into personal computers which created an oversupply of dram devices and caused price erosion for our dram probe cards it is possible that future acts of terrorism environmental events or natural disasters such as earthquakes and aftershocks and infrastructure events arising out of such occurrences and disasters could negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to supply components to us on a timely basis any such delays in supplying or delivering components to us could and any catastrophic loss suffered by our key suppliers would likely disrupt our operations delay production and shipments and adversely affect our revenues and business similarly any catastrophic loss at our california facilities such as from an earthquake would materially and adversely affect our business if we are unable to efficiently manufacture our existing probe card products and our new probe card products our business may be materially adversely affected we must continuously improve our manufacturing processes in an effort to increase yields and product performance lower our costs and reduce the time required for us to design manufacture and deliver our products in volume if we cannot do these things both our existing products and our new products may not be commercially successful our revenues may be adversely affected our customer relationships and our reputation may be harmed and our business may be materially adversely affected to improve our manufacturing processes we have incurred and may incur in the future substantial costs in an effort to optimize capacity and yields implement new manufacturing technologies methods and processes purchase new equipment upgrade existing equipment and train technical personnel we have experienced and may experience in the future manufacturing delays and other inefficiencies in connection with implementation of these improvements and customer qualifications of new processes which have caused and could cause in the future our operating results to decline we have also experienced and may experience in the future difficulties in manufacturing our complex products in volume on time and at acceptable yields and cost and installation issues in the field due to the complexity of customer design requirements including integration of probe cards with varying customer test cell environments and testing of semiconductor devices over a wide temperature range for example design and manufacturing delays related to our matrix architecture products resulted in qualification at certain customers taking longer than we anticipated once a new product or technology is  qualified if we are unable to timely and efficiently expand our manufacturing capacity and ramp volume production to meet customer demand our operating results will be negatively impacted delayed qualification has caused in the past and could continue to cause lost sales opportunities this increases our vulnerability to our competitors and the likelihood that our customers will seek solutions from other suppliers or to develop solutions themselves if demand for our products decreases we could have excess manufacturing capacity the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity could cause our operating results to decline if we are unable to achieve further manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions particularly if we are experiencing pricing pressures in the marketplace our operating results could suffer consolidation in the semiconductor industry and within the semiconductor test equipment market could adversely affect the market for our products and negatively impact our ability to compete which could cause a decline in our revenues consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products which could cause a decline in our revenues with consolidation the number of semiconductor customers in the industry has decreased in recent years consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power there has also been a recent move toward consolidation within the semiconductor test equipment market this consolidation trend could change our interactions and relationships with semiconductor tester and prober companies and negatively impact our revenue and operating results we depend upon the sale of our probe cards for substantially all of our revenues and the majority of our probe cards are utilized by semiconductor manufacturers for testing soc and dram devices if we experience a downturn in demand for our soc and dram products our revenues could decline we have historically derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our probe cards to manufacturers of dram flash memory devices and microprocessor chipset and other soc devices subsequent to the acquisition of microprobe in october  our revenues have substantially been derived from the sale of our probe cards to manufacturers of soc and dram devices for fiscal    and   sales to manufacturers of soc devices accounted for    and   respectively of our revenues sales to manufacturers of dram devices accounted for    and   respectively and sales to manufacturers of flash memory devices accounted for    and   respectively we anticipate that sales of probe cards will represent a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future our success depends in large part upon the continued acceptance of our products and our ability to continue to develop and introduce new products that meet our customers requirements on a timely basis resulting in gained market share in particular to continue to grow our business we need to gain additional market share with manufacturers of flash memory and soc devices to the extent that we are unable to realize cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies in the production of our probe cards or if we are not able to timely deliver our products our revenues and business operations could be adversely impacted and our ability to grow could suffer in  we increased our activities and spending on the development of a new nand flash probe card architecture which is incorporated into our vector nand flash memory probe card in  we successfully qualified our vector probe card at two customers if we are not able to continue to successfully qualify our vector product for other additional customers in the future or if customers do not qualify the vector product and purchase it for nand flash memory wafer test it could negatively impact our revenues and margins and harm our business as our next generation probe cards are used in greater volume in commercial production it is possible that we will identify certain areas of technical performance that require improvement and if we are unable to continually efficiently and in a timely manner improve our products we could suffer reduced demand for our products and our operating results could be harmed if chip manufacturers fail to make architecture node or technology transitions as we anticipate or if anticipated or announced transitions are delayed it could adversely impact our revenues and operating results in addition we might not be able to sustain or increase our revenues from sales of our probe cards particularly if the semiconductor market enters another downturn any decrease in revenues from sales of our probe cards could harm our business if our relationships with our customers and companies that manufacture semiconductor test equipment deteriorate our product development activities could be harmed the success of our product development efforts depends upon our ability to anticipate market trends and to collaborate closely with our customers and with companies that manufacture semiconductor test equipment our relationships with these customers and companies provide us with access to valuable information regarding manufacturing and process technology trends in the semiconductor industry which enables us to better plan our product development activities these relationships  also provide us with opportunities to understand the performance and functionality requirements of our customers which improves our ability to customize our products to fulfill their needs our relationships with test equipment companies are important to us because test equipment companies can design the use of our probe cards into their equipment and provide us with the insight into their product plans this cooperation allows us to offer probe cards for use with the test equipment companies products when they are introduced to the market as opposed to several months or more later which would negatively impact our revenues our relationships with our customers and test equipment companies could deteriorate if they • become concerned about our ability to protect their intellectual property • become concerned with our ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis • develop their own solutions to address the need for testing improvement • implement chip designs that include enhanced builtin selftest capabilities • regard us as a competitor in the case of testequipment company or in the case of a customer believe we are too closely aligned with a competitor of the customer • introduce their own probe card product • establish relationships with others in our industry • acquire or invest in a competitive probe card manufacturer or enter into a business venture with a competitive probe card manufacturer or • attempt to restrict our ability to enter into relationships with their competitors many of our customers and the test equipment companies we work with are large companies the consequences of deterioration in our relationship with any of these companies could be exacerbated due to the significant influence these companies can exert in our markets if our current relationships with our customers and test equipment companies deteriorate or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers and test equipment companies in the future our longterm ability to produce commercially successful products could be impaired because we generally do not have a sufficient backlog of unfilled orders to meet our quarterly revenue targets revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent upon customer orders received and fulfilled in that quarter our revenues are difficult to forecast because we generally do not have sufficient backlog of unfilled orders to meet our quarterly revenue targets at the beginning of a quarter rather a substantial percentage of our revenues in any quarter depend upon customer orders for our probe cards that we receive and fulfill in that quarter because our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed in the short term we might be unable to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues accordingly any significant shortfall of revenues in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results we manufacture substantially all our products at our facilities in livermore san jose and carlsbad california and any disruption in the operations of these facilities or our customers manufacturing facilities could adversely impact our business and operating results certain of our manufacturing processes and our customers processes require sophisticated and expensive equipment and specially designed facilities including semiconductor clean rooms we manufacture the majority of our probe cards at our facilities located in livermore san jose and carlsbad california any disruption in our manufacturing whether due to contamination in our manufacturing process technical or labor difficulties destruction or damage from fire or earthquake infrastructure failures such as power or water shortage or any other reason could interrupt our operations impair critical systems disrupt communications with our customers and suppliers and cause us to write off inventory thereby potentially resulting in the loss of revenues further current and potential customers might not purchase our products if they perceive our lack of a fully operational alternate manufacturing facility to be a risk to their continuing source of supply similarly any of these events such as contamination fire power or water shortage and labor strike could interrupt our customers operations thereby potentially resulting in the loss of revenues to our company  if we are unable to continue to reduce the time it takes for us to design and produce a probe card our growth could be impeded our customers continuously seek to reduce the time it takes them to introduce new products to market the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry coupled with changing demands for semiconductor devices requires our customers to be flexible and highly adaptable to changes in the volume and mix of products they must produce each of those changes requires a new design and each new design requires a new probe card for some existing semiconductor devices the manufacturers volume and mix of product requirements are such that we are unable to design manufacture and ship products to meet manufacturers relatively short cycle time requirements we have lost sales in the past where we were unable to meet a customers required delivery schedule for probe cards for a particular design if we are unable to reduce the time it takes for us to design manufacture and ship our products in response to the needs of our customers our competitive position could be harmed and we could lose sales if we are unable to increase design and manufacturing capacity in the event demand increases our ability to respond to customer requirements could be challenged and our revenues could be negatively impacted we obtain some of the components and materials we use in our products from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues we obtain some of the components and materials used in our products such as printed circuit board assemblies plating materials and ceramic substrates from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers alternative sources are not currently available for sole source components and materials because we rely on purchase orders rather than longterm contracts with the majority of our suppliers we cannot predict with certainty our ability to obtain components and materials in the longer term a sole or limited source supplier could increase prices which could lead to a decline in our gross profit our dependence upon sole or limited source suppliers exposes us to several other risks including inability to obtain an adequate supply of materials late deliveries and poor component quality in addition the ability of any of these suppliers to timely provide us with sufficient quality materials would be adversely affected if they are forced to reduce or discontinue operations due to financial difficulties disruption or termination of the supply of components or materials could delay shipments of our products damage our customer relationships and reduce our revenues for example if we were unable to obtain an adequate supply of a component or material we might have to use a substitute component or material which could require us to make changes in our manufacturing process and could also require us to requalify impacted product at certain customers from time to time we have experienced difficulties in receiving shipments from one or more of our suppliers especially during periods of high demand for our products if we cannot obtain an adequate supply of the components and materials we require or do not receive them in a timely manner we might be required to identify new suppliers we might not be able to identify new suppliers on a timely basis or at all we as well as our customers would also need to qualify any new suppliers the leadtime required to identify and qualify new suppliers could affect our ability to timely ship our products and cause our operating results to suffer further a sole or limited source supplier could require us to enter into noncancelable purchase commitments minimum volume purchases or pay in advance to ensure our source of supply in an industry downturn or in an environment in which growth is not at a level we projected or anticipated commitments of this type could result in charges for excess inventory of parts further if a customers needs for a particular probe card design and purchase orders for those probe cards are spread out over several months as opposed to being placed at one time in a single purchase order it may cause us to purchase excessive materials or components in light of minimum purchase requirements or to be unable to realize volume discounts for materials or components because of the lack of visibility into the customers overall purchase plan these purchase issues would require us to incur a greater cost of goods sold than we might otherwise realize these issues are also magnified in those situations in which the supplied material or component is a custom component for a unique customer probe card design additionally if we are unable to predict our component and materials needs accurately or if our supply is disrupted we might miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products probe cards that do not meet specifications or that contain defects could damage our reputation decrease market acceptance of our technology cause us to lose customers and revenues and result in liability to us the complexity and ongoing development of our probe card manufacturing process combined with increases in probe card production volumes have in the past and could in the future lead to design or manufacturing problems for example we have experienced the presence of contaminants in our plating baths which have caused a decrease in our manufacturing yields or have resulted in unanticipated stressrelated failures when our probe cards are being used in the manufacturing test environment this contamination problem caused a yield decline that in turn resulted in our inability to timely ship products to our customers manufacturing design errors such as the miswiring of a probe card or the incorrect placement of probe contact elements have caused us to repeat manufacturing design steps in addition to these examples problems might result from a  number of factors including design defects materials failure failure of components manufactured by our suppliers to meet our specifications contamination in the manufacturing environment impurities in the materials used and unknown sensitivities to process conditions such as temperature and humidity and equipment failures as a result our products have in the past contained and might in the future contain undetected errors or defects any errors or defects could • cause lower than anticipated yields and lengthen delivery schedules • cause delays in product shipments • cause delays in new product introductions • cause us to incur warranty expenses • result in increased costs and diversion of development resources • cause us to incur increased charges due to unusable inventory • require design modifications or • decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products the occurrence of any one or more of these events could adversely affect our operating results in addition if any of our products fail to meet specifications when installed in the customers test environment or have reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation could be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy our products which could result in a decline in revenues an increase in product returns or warranty costs and the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers for example in mid we experienced certain supply chain and manufacturing challenges that impacted critical deliveries for a key dram customer in japan these delays and manufacturing challenges not only impacted inquarter shortterm revenue but also resulted in our loss of future orders and increased warranty costs and required us to implement programs to reestablish ourselves as a key supplier to the customer these consequences negatively impacted our operating results our customers use our products with test equipment and software in their manufacturing facilities our products must be compatible with the customers equipment and software to form an integrated system while we have designed our test capabilities and standards to replicate the actual test environment of our customers and continually work to improve our capabilities it is possible that our probe card will perform differently in the customers actual test environments if our probe card does not function properly within a customers specific test environment we could be required to provide field application engineers to locate the problem which can take time and resources if the problem relates to our probe cards we might have to invest significant capital manufacturing capacity and other resources to correct it our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages if our ability to forecast demand for our products or the predictability of our manufacturing yields deteriorates we could incur higher inventory losses than we currently experience each semiconductor chip design requires a custom probe card because our products are designspecific demand for our products is difficult to forecast due to our customers short delivery time requirements we often design and procure materials and at times produce our products in anticipation of demand for our products rather than in response to an order our manufacturing yields particularly for new dram and flash memory probe cards have at times been unpredictable and consequently we have produced more components for probe cards or actual probe cards than forecasted demand if we do not obtain orders as we anticipate or if we produce additional inventory to compensate for unpredictable manufacturing yields we could have excess or obsolete inventory for a specific customer design that we would not be able to sell to any other customer which would likely result in inventory writeoffs or material charges for scrap if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud which may adversely affect our business and reputation in addition current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which may adversely impact the trading price of our securities effective internal and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our business and reputation may be harmed we regularly review and assess our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures as part of that process we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  in our internal controls as defined under standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board or pcaob that require remediation a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a significant deficiency is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for the oversight of the companys financial reporting as a result of weaknesses that may be identified in our internal controls we may also identify certain deficiencies in some of our disclosure controls and procedures that we believe require remediation if we discover weaknesses we will make efforts to improve our internal and disclosure controls however there is no assurance that we will be successful if we fail to maintain effective controls or timely affect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls we may not have accurate information to make management decisions our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations which could affect our ability to remain listed with the nasdaq global market ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to manage our business which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities we might be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights which could harm our business in the future as we have in the past we might receive claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights of others or inquiries about our interest in a license or assertions that we need a license to the intellectual property the semiconductor industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of these rights the resolution of any claims of this nature with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays in the event of an adverse ruling or settlement we might be required to pay substantial damages cease the use or sale of infringing products spend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology discontinue the use of certain technology andor enter into license agreements license agreements if required might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all the loss of access to any of our intellectual property or the ability to use any of our technology could harm our business finally certain of our customer contracts contain provisions that require us to defend or indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling or settlement we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel which could harm our business we believe our ability to manage successfully and grow our business and to develop new products depends in large part on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees particularly highly skilled technical sales management and key staff personnel competition for qualified resources is intense and other companies may have greater resources available to provide substantial inducements to lure key personnel away from us or to offer more competitive compensation packages to individuals we are trying to hire additionally we have implemented global cost reduction plans in which we have reduced our workforce which could make it challenging to retain key people and recruit new talent as needed while we implement programs to attract employees and we may grant additional equity compensation to certain employees outside of our annual equity grant program for retention purposes or implement retention bonus programs for certain employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit and retain the qualified personnel we require as part of our sales process we could incur substantial sales and engineering expenses that do not result in revenues which would harm our operating results our customers generally expend significant efforts evaluating and qualifying our products prior to placing an order the time that our customers require to evaluate and qualify our probe cards is typically between three and  months and sometimes longer while our customers are evaluating our products we might incur substantial sales marketing and research and development expenses for example we typically expend significant resources educating our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our probe cards and developing probe cards customized to the potential customers needs for which we might not be reimbursed although we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts we might never receive any revenues from a customer for example many semiconductor chip designs never reach production including designs for which we may have expended design effort and expense in addition prospective customers might decide not to use our probe cards or use our probe cards for a relatively small percentage of their probe card requirements after we have expended significant effort and expense toward probe card design development andor manufacture the length of time that it takes for the evaluation process and for us to make a sale depends upon many factors including • the efforts of our sales force and our distributor and independent sales representatives • the complexity of the customers fabrication processes • the internal technical capabilities of the customer  • the customers budgetary constraints • the availability of compatible product offerings and • the customers ability to devote resources to the evaluation process in addition product purchases are frequently subject to delays as a result our sales cycles are unpredictable if we incur substantial sales and engineering expenses without generating revenues our operating results could be harmed our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities and new laws and regulations or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly we are subject to various us federal state and local and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs civil or criminal fines or sanctions and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or noncompliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities these laws regulations and permits also could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental releases of hazardous substances in addition changing laws and regulations new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination at our or others sites or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to curtail our operations restrict our future expansion subject us to liability and cause us to incur future costs that could harm our operations thereby adversely impacting our operating results and cash flow because we conduct most of our business internationally we are subject to operational economic financial and political risks abroad sales of our products to customers outside north america have accounted for a significant part of our revenues our international sales as a percentage of our revenues were    and  for fiscal    and   respectively additionally certain of our south korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries in the future we expect international sales particularly in japan south korea and taiwan to continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues accordingly we will be subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business solely in north america these risks and challenges include • compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations • legal uncertainties regarding taxes tariffs quotas export controls export licenses and other trade barriers • political and economic instability or foreign conflicts that involve or affect the countries of our customers • difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles • difficulties in staffing and managing personnel distributors and representatives • reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries • currency exchange rate fluctuations which could affect the value of our assets denominated in local currency as well as the price of our products relative to locally produced products • seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries and • fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions any of these factors could harm our existing international operations impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets or materially adversely affect our operating results additionally we are required to comply with foreign import and export requirements customs and value added tax standards our failure to meet these requirements and standards could negatively impact our business operations as an example in the third quarter of  we received inquiries from a foreign jurisdiction tax authority regarding certain indirect tax matters we cooperated with these inquiries which related to our prior shipping process for new product qualifications and for products for certain of our repair center activities and resolved  the matter we regularly address our tax compliance and make submissions to the appropriate jurisdiction as appropriate in the future if our tax practices are questioned by authorities or found to be irregular it is possible that we could incur material expenses or charges which would negatively impact our financial condition the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and you might not be able to sell your shares at or above the price that you paid for them the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile and from december    the first business day of our fiscal  through march    our stock price nasdaq global market close price has ranged from  a share to  a share the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include • variations in our operating results • our forecasts and financial guidance for future periods • announcements of technological innovations new products or product enhancements new product adoptions at semiconductor customers or significant agreements by us or by our competitors • reports regarding our ability to bring new products into volume production efficiently • the gain or loss of significant orders or customers • changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock • rulings on litigations and proceedings • seasonality principally due to our customers purchasing cycles • market and competitive conditions in our industry the entire semiconductor industry and the economy as a whole • recruitment or departure of key personnel and • announcements of mergers and acquisition transactions and the ability to successfully integrate the business activities of the acquiredmerged company in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business operating results or financial condition the trading price of our common stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous these provisions • establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time • provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of  of our stockholders • require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws • authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt • limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders • prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders • provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our bylaws and  • establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings in addition section  of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company in addition each of our named executive officers and certain other officers of the company have entered into change of control severance agreements which were approved by our compensation committee which could increase the costs associated with a change of control and thus potentially deter such a transaction regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses disrupt our supply chain processes and create additional compliance risks under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sec adopted regulations that require public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals and their derivatives referred to as conflict minerals to perform due diligence relating to conflict minerals have these procedures audited and file reports with the sec on these subjects we may incur additional costs in complying with these regulation and suffer compliance risks item b     unresolved staff

of this annual report on form k we were not involved in any material legal proceedings other than the proceeding summarized below in the future we may become a party to additional legal proceedings that may require us to spend significant resources including proceedings designed to protect our intellectual property rights litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial regardless of outcome intellectual property litigation in the ordinary course of business the company has been currently is and may in the future be involved in commercial litigation relating to intellectual property as well as third party initiated patent office proceedings in the united states and foreign patent offices in march  we filed a lawsuit against martek inc martek asserting breach of contract copyright infringement and related claims arising out of a licensing agreement we entered into with martek for the use by martek of certain intellectual property assets the “ip” martek asserted counterclaims against us for breach of contract and related claims regarding that license on july   we entered into an agreement with martek under which the parties agreed to dismiss the pending litigation and release each other from any and all claims relating to the license agreement as part of the agreement we agreed to sell the ip to martek for  million of which  million was received on july   and the remaining  million is in the form of a promissory note secured by the ip and scheduled to be repaid by martek in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversary of the settlement we recognized a net gain of approximately  million which was classified in our consolidated statement of operations under other income net from the agreement proceeds of  million received on july   other litigation in august  a former employee filed a class

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k in addition to historical consolidated financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forwardlooking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k overview we design develop manufacture sell and support advanced semiconductor probe card products and are the largest supplier worldwide of those products semiconductor manufacturers use our probe cards to perform wafer test also known as wafer sort which is the testing of the semiconductor die or chips while those die are still constituted on the semiconductor wafer wafer test enables semiconductor manufacturers to determine whether chips will meet specifications and be saleable once the wafer is diced and the die are singulated and individually packaged the perdie costs of singulation and packaging processes are relatively high and some of the die on a wafer are typically expected to be defective consequently there is often a compelling economic reason to perform wafer test probe cards are a critical element in enabling that wafer test process during fiscal   revenues increased by  million or  to  million from  million in   our net loss decreased by  million or  to  million from  million in   the net loss for fiscal  included restructuring charges of  million  gain from a business interruption insurance claim of  million and a net gain from sale of intellectual property of  million the net loss for fiscal  included restructuring charges of  million and impairment charges of  million our gross profit margins and operating profit margins also improved in fiscal  as a result of our increasing revenues and ongoing initiatives to reduce manufacturing overhead costs lower production material costs and reduce operating expenses overall we experienced an improvement in our financial and operational performance during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as our business continued to gain momentum through strong broadbased demand from our customers and continued improvements in our execution in fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to  million of our outstanding common stock from timetotime on the open market during fiscal  under this repurchase authorization we repurchased and retired approximately  million shares of common stock for approximately  million our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and restricted cash totaled  million as of december    as compared to  million at december    the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to higher revenues and improved operating results net of investments in working capital to grow revenues we generated cash after stock repurchases of  million in fiscal  as compared to  million for fiscal   there were no stock repurchases in fiscal  we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities if we are unsuccessful in maintaining or growing our revenues or maintaining or reducing our cost structure in an industry downturn or increasing our available cash through financing our cash cash equivalents andor marketable securities could decline in future fiscal years in february  we entered into a definitive agreement with cascade microtech inc “cascade microtech” under which we will acquire all outstanding cascade microtech shares in a cash and stock transaction cascade microtech is a leader in the field of probe cards for radio frequency “rf” semiconductor products and has important capabilities in engineering probes and test systems we believe that this combination will further diversify our customer and revenue base and enable efficiencies and value realization in the combined companies’ operations technology resources assets and teams by leveraging combined global support and channel investments across a product line that spans from engineering to production test applications the combined company will be uniquely positioned to solve many of our customers’ most difficult test challenges from engineering to production the transaction is expected to close mid subject to customary closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the approval by cascade microtech’s shareholders of the merger we believe the following information is important to understanding our business our financial statements as well as the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year w e operate on a  week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the last saturday of december the fiscal years ended december    december   and december   included  weeks each  revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of probe cards revenues from our customers are subject to fluctuations due to factors including but not limited to design cycles technology adoption rates competitive pressure to reduce prices cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold and market conditions in the semiconductor industry historically increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products the introduction of new more complex products the penetration of new markets and through acquisition we expect that revenues from the sale of probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials payroll shipping and handling costs manufacturingrelated overhead and amortization of certain intangible assets our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products some of which are a sole source we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues we expense all warranty costs inventory provisions and amortization of certain intangible assets as cost of revenues we design manufacture and sell custom advanced probe cards into the semiconductor test market which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations our probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design of a customer and must be delivered on relatively short leadtimes as compared to our overall manufacturing process as our advanced probe cards are manufactured in low volumes it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our probe cards we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated excess obsolete and nonsellable inventories based on assumptions about future demand past usage changes to manufacturing processes and overall market conditions research and development research and development expenses include expenses related to product development engineering and material costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to improve and enhance existing product technologies and to develop new technologies for current and new products and for new applications selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales marketing administrative personnel sales commissions market research and consulting and other sales marketing administrative activities amortization of certain intangible assets and provision for doubtful accounts these expenses also include costs for protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and regulatory compliance costs restructuring charges restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits cost of longlived assets abandoned or impaired as well as contract termination costs impairment of longlived assets asset impairment charges include charges associated with the writedown of assets that have no future expected benefit or for assets that have been determined to be impaired as well as adjustments to the carrying amount of our assets held for sale use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates may change as new information is obtained we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition fair value of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for product warranty valuation of obsolete and slow moving inventory assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations legal contingencies valuation of goodwill the assessment of recoverability of longlived assets valuation and recognition of stockbased compensation provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  reported in our financial statements and related disclosures we have identified the following accounting policies as being critical because they require our management to make particularly difficult subjective andor complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our management has discussed the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology which have not been material to date are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed since our acquisition of microprobe in fiscal  we had historically operated in one reportable segment consisting of two operating segments and for the purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis we had two reporting units all of which related to our formfactor and microprobe product groups during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we now operate in one reportable segment consisting of one operating segment and for the purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis we further concluded that we now have one reporting unit all of which relates to the design development manufacture and sale of high performance advanced probe cards as a result of the successful integration of the microprobe business into our overall consolidated operations we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test if an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the performance of the quantitative impairment test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its aggregate carrying value including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach that includes the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach guideline company approach valuation methodologies if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit we perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test prior to and subsequent to the change in our reporting unit structure by assessing qualitative factors and we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december    our qualitative review included among other factors an assessment of our market capitalization which was significantly higher than our book value the evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment in the event of future changes in business conditions we will be required to reassess and update our forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates a material impairment charge may result at that time refer to note  to notes to consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets for further details impairment of longlived assets   we test longlived assets or asset groups such as property plant and equipment and intangibles for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable circumstances that could trigger a review include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset or asset group and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market groupings of assets discount rates and terminal growth rates in addition significant  estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our intangible assets and tangible longlived assets including replacement cost economic obsolescence and the value that could be realized in an orderly liquidation changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our longlived assets thereby requiring us to write down the assets restructuring charges   restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits longlived assets impaired or abandoned and contract termination costs the determination of when we accrue for employee termination benefits depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under a onetime benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement for restructuring charges recorded as an ongoing benefit arrangement a liability for postemployment benefits is recorded when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated for restructuring charges recorded as a onetime benefit arrangement we recognize a liability for employee termination benefits when a plan of termination approved by management and establishing the terms of the benefit arrangement has been communicated to employees the timing of the recognition of onetime employee termination benefits is dependent upon the period of time the employees are required to render service after communication if employees are not required to render service in order to receive the termination benefits or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period a liability for the termination benefits is recognized at the communication date in instances where employees will be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period the liability for employee termination benefits is measured initially at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date and is recognized ratably over the future service period we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives we record charges related to longlived assets to be abandoned when the assets cease to be used when we cease using a building or other asset with remaining noncancelable lease payments continuing beyond our use period we record a liability for remaining payments under lease arrangements as well as for contract termination costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to us at the ceaseuse date given the significance of and the timing of the execution of such activities this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sublease rents although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans actual results may differ thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions inventory valuation   we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis or market value we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess inventory and product obsolescence based upon assumptions about forecasted future sales past usage and market conditions on a quarterly basis we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under noncancelable purchase commitments in comparison to our past usage and estimated forecast of product demand for the next six to twelve months to determine what inventory quantities if any may not be sellable based on this analysis we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges at the point of loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis market conditions are subject to change and demand for our products can fluctuate significantly actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand and this difference could have a material impact on our gross profit and inventory balances based on additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventories or a benefit from the sale of inventories previously written down  results of operations the following table sets forth our

rather than north america the change in revenues from our geographical regions for fiscal   when compared to fiscal   were primarily driven by the following factors • south korea revenues increased driven primarily by a combination of market share increases at a major south korean customer based on the adoption of our smartmatrix product for dram applications and increased soc product shipments related to mobile processor demand • north america revenues decreased driven primarily by a shift of soc product shipments for personal computer processors to customers’ test facilities in europe • taiwan revenues increased driven primarily by a combination of increased soc product shipments and an increase in commodity or personal computer dram demand • asiapacific revenues decreased driven

restructuring activities i n the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan which resulted in the reduction of our global workforce by  employees across the organization in addition we reduced our temporary workforce by approximately  positions we also suspended development activities and engineering efforts for our next generation dram matrix platform and terminated development

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for fiscal  and  was  and  respectively other income net is comprised primarily of foreign currency impact and various other gains and losses the

and penalties of  million  million and  million in fiscal   and  respectively as of december   and december   we had accrued total interest charges and penalties of  million and  million respectively related to uncertain tax positions we anticipate that we will continue to record a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets we expect our future tax provisions during the time such

expansion into areas with varying country state and local income tax rates deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction liquidity and capital resources capital resources our working capital was  million at december   and  million at december    the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash due to improved operating results and decreased current liabilities cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits held at banks money market funds and us government agency securities that at the time of purchase had maturities of  days or less marketable securities consist of us government and agency securities we typically invest in highlyrated securities with low probabilities of default our investment policy requires investments to be rated singlea or better and limits the types of acceptable investments issuer concentration and duration of the investment our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  million at december   compared to  million at december    cash cash equivalents and marketable securities included  million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december    the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was primarily due to improved operating results and lower use of cash to support working capital we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities if we are unsuccessful in maintaining or growing our revenues or maintaining or reducing our cost structure in an industry downturn or increasing our available cash through financing our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may decline in fiscal    we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed as part of these strategies we indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional united states taxes less applicable foreign tax credits day sales outstanding days sales outstanding from receivables or dso were  days at december   compared with  days at december    our dso calculation is determined using the count back method and is based on gross accounts receivable including accounts receivable for amounts in deferred revenue the decrease in dso in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to changes in customer mix   fiscal    fiscal    fiscal    in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities            net cash provided by used in investing activities         net cash used in provided by financing activities            cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  was primarily attributable to improved operating results from increased revenues and decreased costs and lower working capital necessary to support the increased revenues the company had a net loss of  million and noncash expenses of  million  including  million of depreciation and amortization  million of stockbased compensation  million of provision for excess and obsolete inventories  million of restructuring activities and which was partially offset by  million gain on disposal and writeoff of longlived assets and  million gain on foreign currency transactions the net change in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal  resulted in a net use of cash of  million comprised of  million of cash used for inventory build a  million decrease in deferred revenues due to recognition of previously deferred revenues for which the revenue recognition criteria have been met and a  million decrease in accounts payable driven by the timing of our payments on vendor obligations the above use of cash was offset in part by an increase of  million in accounts receivable from strong collections  million in income tax refunds and a  million decrease in other assets the net change in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal  resulted in a net use of cash of  million and which was comprised of cash used of  million in accounts receivable due to higher sales  million of cash used for inventory due to inventory build a decrease in income tax payable of  million due to the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions an increase of prepaid expenses and other current assets of  million and a  million decrease in deferred revenues due to recognition of previously deferred revenues for which the revenue recognition criteria have been met the above use of cash was offset in part by an increase of  million in accrued liabilities due to incentive compensation accrued payroll and warranty an increase of  million in accounts payable driven by the timing of our payments on vendor obligations and a  million increase in deferred rent and other liabilities due to additional operating lease obligations cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal  was primarily related to  million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and  million of proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling  million and cash used in the acquisition of property and equipment of  million  we carefully monitor our investments to minimize risks and have not experienced other than temporary investment losses   net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal  was primarily related to  million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and  million of proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling  million and cash used in the acquisition of property and equipment of  million cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities for fiscal  included  million used for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock offset by  million from proceeds received from purchases under our  employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal  included  million from proceeds received from purchases under our  employee stock purchase plan offset by payments of  million made on capital leases  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by  million in fiscal   we continue to focus on improving our operating efficiency to increase operating cash flows we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to the extent necessary we may also consider entering into short and longterm debt obligations raise cash through a stock issuance or to obtain new financing facilities which may not be available on terms favorable to us our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned however if we are unsuccessful in maintaining or growing our revenues or maintaining or reducing our cost structure in an industry downturn or increasing our available cash through financing our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline in future fiscal years contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant commitments to make future payments in cash under contractual obligations as of december   in thousands   payments due in fiscal years            after    total   in thousands operating leases                   purchase obligations          —    total                                          these amounts do not include our obligations under our agreement to acquire cascade microtech which was entered into on february   purchase obligations are primarily for purchases of inventory and manufacturing related service contracts for the purposes of this table purchase obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december    timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations the table above excludes our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits which totaled approximately  million as of december    the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors accordingly the timing of payment cannot be estimated and has been excluded from the table above as of december    the changes to our uncertain tax positions in the next  months that are reasonable and probable are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations offbalance sheet arrangements historically we have not participated in transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december    we were not involved in any offbalance sheet arrangements indemnification agreements we may from time to time in the ordinary course of our business enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations under these contractual arrangements we have agreed to defend indemnify andor hold the third party harmless from and against certain liabilities these arrangements include indemnities in favor of customers in the event that our probe cards infringe a third partys intellectual property and our lessors in connection with facility leasehold liabilities that we may cause in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers and our bylaws contain indemnification obligations in favor of our directors officers and agents these indemnity arrangements may limit the type of the claim the total amount that we can be required to pay in connection with the indemnification obligation and the time within which an indemnification claim can be made the duration of the  indemnification obligation may vary and for most arrangements survives the agreement term and is indefinite we believe that substantially all of our indemnity arrangements provide either for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make or for limitations on the types of claims and damages we could be obligated to indemnify or for both however it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations the history of prior indemnification claims the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable we have not had any requests for indemnification under these arrangements we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification arrangements on our consolidated balance sheet as of december    recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers and in august  the fasb issued asu  “ revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date of asu  by one year asu  requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance also requires expanded disclosures relating to the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers additionally qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition methods this guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in united states generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective which for us will be at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  using one of the two prescribed transition methods early adoption of one year prior to the required effective date is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our ongoing results and operations as well as in the transition methods prescribed above in july  the fasb issued asu  which requires entities to measure most inventory “at the lower of cost and net realizable value” thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market market in this context is defined as one of three different measures the asu will not apply to inventories that are measured by using either the lastin firstout lifo method or the retail inventory method rim the asu is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein early application of the asu is permitted upon transition entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the accounting change we do not believe adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in november  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  related to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the asu requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position thereby simplifying the current guidance that requires an entity to separate deferred assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts the asu will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  though early adoption is permitted we have earlyadopted the asu as of december   prospectively and our statement of financial position as of this date reflects the revised classification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent no prior periods were retrospectively adjusted there is no other impact on our financial statements of earlyadopting the asu in january  the fasb issued asu   recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities this asu will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we are evaluating the effects of the adoption of this asu to our financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu  leases  asu  requires that lease arrangements longer than twelve months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability the updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted we have not evaluated the impact of the updated guidance on our consolidated financial statements item a     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk  we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion but not all of existing foreign currency denominated amounts gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in other income net in our consolidated statements of operations because the effect of  movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we recognized a net loss of  million and a net gain of  million  respectively for fiscal  and   from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts interest rate sensitivity  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes money market funds and commercial paper we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer except us treasuries and us agencies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates a hypothetical  basispoint one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at december   and december   would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than  million and  million  respectively

limitations on the effectiveness of controls control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems objectives are being met further the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate

december    and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive loss stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december    we also have audited the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december    based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso the company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item a our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of formfactor inc and subsidiaries as of december   and december    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december    in conformity with us generally

policies basis of consolidation and foreign currency translation the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our whollyowned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated the functional currencies of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies and accordingly all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated to us dollars at current periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated to us dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period the gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries financial statements are included as a separate component of stockholders equity under “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” certain other of our foreign subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency accordingly monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period revenues and costs in local currency are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are remeasured using historical exchange rates the resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates may change as new information is obtained we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition fair value of marketable securities allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for product warranty valuation of obsolete and slow moving inventory assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations legal contingencies valuation of goodwill the assessment of recoverability of longlived assets valuation and recognition of stockbased compensation provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates business acquisitions our consolidated financial statements include the operations of an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired intangibles including inprocess research and development iprd be recorded on the balance sheet also transaction costs are expensed as incurred any excess of the purchase price over the assigned fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits and financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of  days or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than  days when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date  formfactor inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued of acquisition as availableforsale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in other income net in the consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in other income net in the consolidated statements of operations all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale investment is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where  we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or  a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment charge equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value fair value of financial instruments we have evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and valuations as provided by thirdparty sources the use of different market assumptions andor estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts the fair value of the companys cash cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these items estimates of fair value of our marketable securities are based on quoted market prices from active markets or third party marketbased pricing sources which we believe to be reliable these estimates represent the third parties good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale whenever possible the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows • level  valuations are obtained from realtime quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets • level  inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices near the reporting date in markets that are less active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and • level  valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value foreign exchange management we transact business in various foreign currencies we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency balance sheet exposures gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements on forward foreign exchange contracts designated to offset certain foreign currency balance sheet exposures are recognized as other income net in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the exchange rates change these gains and losses are intended to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged we record the fair value of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period in the consolidated balance sheet we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes restricted cash under the terms of one of our facility leases we provide security to the landlord in the form of letters of credit as of december   and december    restricted cash included  million  respectively for letters of credit secured by a certificate of deposit inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market value the provision for potentially excess and obsolete inventory is made based on managements analysis of inventory levels and forecasted future sales on a quarterly basis we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under  formfactor inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued noncancelable purchase commitments in comparison to our past usage and estimated forecast of product demand for the next six to twelve months to determine what inventory quantities if any may not be sellable based on this analysis we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges once the value is adjusted the original cost of our inventory less the related inventory writedown represents the new cost basis of such products reversal of these write downs is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations we design manufacture and sell a fully custom product into a market that has been subject to cyclicality and significant demand fluctuations probe cards are complex products custom to a specific chip design and have to be delivered on short leadtimes probe cards are manufactured in low volumes but for certain materials the purchases are often subject to minimum order quantities in excess of the actual underlying probe card demand it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and commence production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our probe cards these factors result in normal recurring inventory valuation adjustments to cost of revenues aggregate inventory write downs were  million   million and  million for fiscal    and   respectively when our products have been delivered but the revenue associated with that product is deferred because the related revenue recognition criteria have not been met we may defer the related inventory costs the deferred inventory costs do not exceed the deferred revenue amounts the deferred inventory costs are classified as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet property plant and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is provided on a straightline method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets  to  years for machinery and equipment  to   years for computer equipment and software and  to   years for furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset constructioninprogress assets are not depreciated until the assets are placed in service upon sale or retirement of assets the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed since our acquisition of microprobe in fiscal  we had historically operated in one reportable segment consisting of two operating segments and for the purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis we had two reporting units all of which related to our formfactor and microprobe product groups during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we now operate in one reportable segment consisting of one operating segment and for the purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis we further concluded that we now have one reporting unit all of which relates to the design development manufacture and sale of high performance advanced probe cards as a result of the successful integration of the microprobe business into our overall consolidated operations the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test if an entity determines as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the performance of the quantitative impairment test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its aggregate carrying value including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting unit using a combination of the income approach that includes the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach guideline company approach valuation methodologies if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit we perform the second step of the quantitative impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test prior to and subsequent to the change in our reporting unit structure by assessing qualitative factors and we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december    our qualitative review included among other factors an assessment of our market capitalization which was significantly higher than our book value no impairment charges associated with our goodwill were recorded during fiscal  and   refer to note  to notes to consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets for further details  formfactor inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued intangible assets intangible assets consist of acquisition related intangible assets and intellectual property the intangible assets are being amortized over periods which reflect the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized over  to  years we perform a review of intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable such facts and circumstances include significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the intangible assets and current expectation that the intangible assets will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of their estimated useful lives we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets impairment of longlived assets we test longlived assets or asset groups such as property plant and equipment and intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset or asset group and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value refer to note  to notes to consolidated financial statements  impairment of longlived assets  for additional information concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities and trade receivables our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held

established guidelines relative to credit ratings diversification and maturities that seek to maintain safety and liquidity deposits in these banks may exceed the amounts of insurance provided on such

intensely competitive semiconductor industry including the dynamic random access memory or dram flash memory and systemonchip or soc markets which have been characterized by price erosion rapid technological change short product life cycles and heightened foreign and domestic competition significant technological changes in the industry could adversely affect our operating results we are exposed to nonperformance risk by counterparties on the currency forward exchange contracts used in hedging activities we seek to minimize risk by diversifying our hedging program across multiple financial institutions these counterparties are large international financial institutions and to date no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to us  formfactor inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued certain components for our wafer probe card products that meet our requirements are available only from a limited number of suppliers the rapid rate of technological change and the necessity of developing and manufacturing products with short life cycles may intensify our reliance on such suppliers the inability to obtain components as required or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured in instances where final acceptance of the deliverable is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology which have not been material to date are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled warranty obligations we offer warranties on certain products and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims at the time revenue is recognized the warranty liability is based upon historical experience and our estimate of the level of future costs while we engage in product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures as we sell new products to our customers we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized warranty costs are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cost of revenues a reconciliation of the changes in our warranty liability is as follows in thousands   fiscal years ended   december     december   balance

multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world in order to monitor potential credit losses we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of all accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed and assessed for adequacy on a quarterly basis we take into consideration  any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations and  our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers if circumstances change and the financial condition of our customers is adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations we

benefits cost of longlived assets abandoned or impaired as well as contract termination costs the determination of when we accrue for employee termination benefits depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under a onetime benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement for restructuring charges recorded as an ongoing benefit arrangement a liability for postemployment benefits is recorded when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated for restructuring charges recorded as a onetime benefit arrangement we recognize a liability for employee termination benefits when a plan of termination approved by management and establishing the terms of the benefit arrangement has been communicated to employees the timing of the recognition of onetime employee termination benefits is dependent upon the period of time the employees are required to render service after communication if employees are not required to render service in order to receive the termination benefits or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period a liability for the termination benefits is recognized at the communication date in instances where employees will be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period the liability for employee termination benefits is measured initially at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date and is recognized ratably over the future service period we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives we record charges related to longlived assets to be abandoned when the assets cease to be used when we cease using a building or other asset with remaining noncancelable lease payments continuing beyond our use period we record a liability for remaining payments under lease arrangements and contract termination costs that continue for the remaining term without economic benefit to us at the ceaseuse date given the significance of and the timing of the execution of such activities this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sublease rents although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans actual results may differ thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions the company recorded restructuring charges of  million   million and  million for fiscal years    and   respectively refer to note  restructuring charges in notes to consolidated financial statements for further details income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to determine whether there is a need for a valuation allowance with respect to such deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income and commensurate with objective verifiability the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for  formfactor inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability caption line in the consolidated balance sheet we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash stockbased compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stockbased awards based

maturities our marketable securities are financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis the accounting standards for fair value defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance the accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs the first two of which are considered observable and the last unobservable we apply the following fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows • level —quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level —inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices near the reporting date in markets that are less active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and • level —unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities we obtain the fair value of our level  investments in certain money market funds at the expected market price these investments are expected to maintain a net asset value of  per share we determine the fair value of our level  financial instruments from several third party asset managers custodian banks and the accounting service providers independently these service providers use professional pricing services to gather pricing data which may include quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly we utilize the market approach to measure the fair value of our fixed income securities the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the fair value of our fixed income securities is obtained using readilyavailable market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers large financial institutions and other thirdparty sources for the identical underlying securities our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded such controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent

when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are labeled as level  investments because fair values of these investments are based on similar assets without applying significant judgments in addition all of our

compensation expense and adjust our estimates of forfeitures over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized as a change in estimate in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods the following
