wireless cell site optimization intelligent site management and outside plant solutions to telecommunication service providers cell tower operators and other network operators to reduce operating costs and improve network performance recent positive developments have gone unnoticed while the stock has slowly drifted to the share area near the yearlow i believe westell offers a significant upside potential for several reasons  recent product launches have been very successful  carrier spending is expected to recover the remainder of   the company seems serious about diversifying its currently limited customer base and  new ceo gruenwald is focused on increasing gross margins to  the latest product launch was announced on june   according to company executives this product platform will be a gamechanger in the inbuilding wireless ibw space in my opinion wstl is a couple of quarters away from returning to sustainable profitability the downside is limited because westell has cshare cash and no debt westell reported revenues of  million in fiscal q  up  from  million in fiscal q  fiscal q  ended march   was the first quarter under the lead of new ceo tom gruenwald during the q  conference call ceo gruenwald gave a few clues suggesting that q  to be reported in july will continue the positive trends seen in q here are a few q  highlights extracted from the earnings release and the conference call bookings quartertodate are ahead of prior quarter suggesting a solid start of fiscal q  gross margins will improve as a result of not selling as much excess and obsolete inventory sales of das and tma equipment will continue the uptrend established in q the expanded sales force is showing initial signs of success as demand for some products have increased during the quarter westell hired new personnel to go after the latin american and african market the company expects to launch a new gamechanging ibw product during q  severance charges taken in q  will not reoccur in q  wstl hinted that carrier spending patterns are improving from the end of  but that spending is very targeted verizon was the only  client during the quarter westell is working hard on several fronts to increase gross margins to a sustainable  in the interim wtsl expects to gaap breakeven in the  to  million revenue range the company ended fiscal  with  million in cash and investments or cshare and no debt i will now elaborate on why i believe the positive sings seen in q  will continue at least through the end of fiscal  increased carrier spending trends in a may  john celentano in his carrier capex allin for  article gives projections for carrier spending for the rest of  and fy  he expects spending to increase  in the quarter ended june   compared to calendar q  mr celentano expects calendar q  ending june   to grow close to  compared with q  to nearly  billion he expects a jump to  billion in q  to meet the estimated yearly forecast of  billion overall he expects  spending to exceed s despite a relatively weak q  please note that calendar q  corresponds to westells q  in his article he illustrates that the largest spenders will be verizon with  and att with  followed by sprint and tmobile verizon and att have historically been two of the largest westell clients in q  verizon was westells only  customer there have been quarters where att constituted over  of westell revenues the june   announcement that the the federal communications commission fcc plans to fine att mobility  million for misleading customers about its unlimited data plan offering this might be one reason that would prompt att to step up spending to remove bottlenecks its a fact that there is an everincreasing appetite for faster and faster speeds and capacity not only in the us but also globally this will force service providers to buildup their infrastructure to cope with demand thus benefiting telecom suppliers like westell inbuilding wireless spending one of the areas in telecom equipment expected to enjoy the largest gains is in inbuilding wireless ibw spending both globally and in the us in the june   article inbuilding wireless  big market big money john celentano projects that ibw spending in the us alone will reach  billions by  so the market is there the question is what does westell have to offer to address the growing ibw market ceo gruenwald partially answered this question during the q  conference call as follows revenue for the ibw segment was  million in the quarter up  from  million last quarter the sequential revenue increase was driven by record quarterly sales of our active das conditioner or udit westell launched udit the clearlink universal das interface on may   in the announcement scott goodrich president of cellular specialties inc a westell subsidiary explained inbuilding wireless deployments are growing rapidly as mobile device users demand quality and reliable services inside large venues such as office buildings airports and stadiums the introduction of the clearlink udit solution allows wireless service providers and integrators active monitoring of their das and small cell networks with the ability to troubleshoot problems remotely significantly reducing site visits and ultimately overall operating costs also in the q  conference call ceo gruenwald boasted we are excited about a new product being developed by our manchester engineering team for our ibw business we are on target to announce more details about this product in the next couple of months and why we believe it is a gamechanger in the inbuilding wireless ibw market we did not have to wait long to get an announcement about this new product on june   westell officially launched this product named clearlink® das the company claims that this product was designed to enhance cellular coverage within buildings while simultaneously addressing the evergrowing das nearfar problem much has been written about the das nearfar problem in ibw installations but i could not find another solution that addresses this problem as robustly as clearlink® das does what is the nearfar problem westell asserts one critical issue not normally considered when designing or selecting equipment for an inbuilding das is nearfar nearfar is a term describing performance reduction when a mobile device is operating within a das coverage area but is being serviced by a distant macro cell tower the nearfar performance reduction which includes degraded voice and data service reduced battery life andor complete loss of service can be experienced by das participants as well as nonparticipants this video depicts very clearly how the nearfar problem affects cellular reception inside buildings for all occupants this problem affects users and also providers cellular clients frustrated with poor reception may opt to change providers not fully understanding the nature of the problem westells new clearlink® das solution to the nearfar problem and to address ibw optimization can best be explained in this video when asked a question about this new product commercial prospects ceo gruenwald mentioned that a couple large prospects are interested my guess is that these two large prospects are att and verizon  two of westells historically largest and most loyal clients i expect that clearlink® das will start generating meaningful revenues in the latter part of  after the prospective clients complete successful testing and verification trials judging by the success achieved with two of the largest revenue contributors in q  the new udit das conditioner and tower mounted amplifiers tma i feel confident that clearlink® das will be a hot product in the future on august   westell received the  lte visionary award for its tmas westell has focused most of its rd dollars on developing a comprehensive set of ibw solutions the clearlink inbuilding wireless technology platform is designed to improve network performance while minimizing operating and capital costs the solution includes the following antennas bidirectional amplifiers bdas clearlink das digital repeaters das rf conditioners and other system components global expansion primarily into africa and latin america latin america and africa will grow faster than the us in terms of new smartphone subscriptions according to the following graphic source    ericsson mobility report without significant investments carriers globally will not be able to keep up with the demand being put on wireless networks this is particularly true in buildings where the growth and need is starting to get out of control this is the area where westells comprehensive set of ibw solutions should gain market share going forward if everyone believed that westell is an undervalued stock with significant upside the share price should be a lot higher than it is today as with any investment in the market there are potential headwinds some obvious and some unforeseen i will now discuss potential stumbling blocks in westells path to profitability and growth companys history of underperformance westell is trading near the year low this can be caused by several reasons the most obvious one for me has been managements poor decisions and their inability to seize opportunities in my opinion the biggest management flaw has been westells historical dependence on att and verizon and a few other minor us clients to address this problem new ceo gruenwald effective starting february   has laid out a plan to diversify its us customer base and to expand into highgrowth areas such as latin america and africa as part of this plan westell recently hired several new sales people with exceptional skills great industry knowledge and solid industry relationships in target markets according to ceo gruenwald on may   westell announced the hiring of chuck bernstein as senior vp of worldwide sales according to ceo gruenwald  chuck is an outstanding sales leader with a record of significant success in our industry he is also an exceptional team builder and will raise the level of performance of our entire sales team we are thrilled to have chuck as a key member of our executive leadership team as chuck is a results driven leader sound good right but former ceo richard gilbert mentioned customer and geographic diversification several times before over the years and nothing came out from all that rhetoric this time however ceo gruenwald was a lot more specific than previous expansiondiversification chatter we will know soon if this time the company succeeds in these endeavors companys inability to effectively integrate acquired companies when kentrox was acquired in may  one of the benefits seen at the time was to leverage kentroxs large international presence to sell a wide range of westells products that goal never materialized and for this reason i call it a failure to execute heavy dependence on two or three large clients this was mentioned several times before westells fortunes depend heavily on att and verizon spending and other few us clients to a lesser extent until the company gains traction in attracting a more diversified client base and until the time when westells fortunes dont depend on us carrier spending alone the potential upside will be limited potential problems doing business in developing countries doing business in developing countries can be very important to fuel growth as demand for telecom equipment is expected to surpass that of the us there are however significant risks doing business in those countries one in particular is getting paid for products and services rendered take ceragon networks for instance the company was forced to take a charge of  million in its fiscal q  because the venezuelan government makes it hard for companies to own dollars to pay their bills other countries in latin america and africa are also risky because of economic and financial instability conclusions westell is making progress in several fronts  technical leadership in the dasibw area with new gamechanging products  expansion into highgrowth latin america and africa  customer diversification  launching strong products in sectors other than ibw such as tmas and complimentary products for these reasons and the forecasted increase in us carrier spending i expect that revenues will start to ramp in h  and will accelerate in  and beyond the flat revenueincome estimates for  and  by the one analyst covering the stock seem too conservative and should be easily beaten this analyst has a  target on the stock a  gain from the current share institutions continue to maintain about  ownership in the company insiders have been buying stock with the last purchase being made by cfo tom minichielo k shares the  million cash cshare no debt balance sheet provides downside protection i will give new ceo tom gruenwald the benefit of the doubt i believe he will execute his growth and profitability goals more effectively than previous managements failed efforts his profitability plan involves revenue and gross margin growth through improved products and services targeted to a more diverse customer base in the us and overseas investors considering wstl stock should carefully review all the risks and uncertainties detailed in the companys most recent k filings besides the risks specified in the filings the following are potential risks that could cause significant losses  the company is unable to increase gross margins  competitive products make westells products obsolete  lack of success in latin america and africa  price wars with lowcost competitors from asia  loss of talent to the competition  larger system vendor integration could reduce the need for certain westell products please also consider the potential stumbling blocks to westells path to profitability and growth that ive discussed above disclosure i amwe are long wstl i wrote
