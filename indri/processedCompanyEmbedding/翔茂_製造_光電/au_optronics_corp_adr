optronics corp auo or the company taiex  nyse auo will exhibit at  intersolar in munich germany from june  to showcase a series of innovative solar technologies after the integration of vertical supply chain in just over a year auo has achieved many industryleading technologies in solar upstream and downstream value chains it is the only manufacturer that can integrate all outstanding technologies at the same time in the solar industry the products auo will showcase at intersolar include highefficiency ecoduo monocrystalline solar modules ecoduo pmp multicrystalline solar modules and first debut of smart module intersolar founded by estif european solar thermal industry federation bsw german solar industry association and ises the international solar energy society in  has become the largest solar technology and product trade show in europe attracting many wellknown global manufacturers to join every year auo will debut the industryleading smart module that can increase the power generation at intersolar this year a particular layer of thinfilm is coated on the surface of the smart module which can reduce reflection to increase ray transmission and the power generation of pv modules besides this thinfilm has selfcleaning ability to dissolve foreign particles on the pv module so that the surface of the pv module keeps clean therefore it can reduce reflection to increase ray transmission when light is incident as well as have the obvious antireflection effects for incident light with different angles this effect not only can increase module power but also can reduce the frequency of manual cleaning and the longterm maintenance cost specifically the pv system using smart module during the initial operation can increase power generation by about  three months after installation the power generation can increase by about  auo solar is the only total solutions provider offering many industry leading technologies in the vertical supply chain in terms of polysilicon auo now collaborates with m setek to obtain highquality polysilicon and solar wafers on the upstream side to produce the solar cell wafers with the highest efficiency with the advanced wire saw slicing technology m setek has already established the mass production ability of  um ultrathin wafers meanwhile m seteks innovative technology to recycle silicon has been approved for epitaxy which takes leading place in the world auos upstream product processing can conform to a green promise as well with the strategy of providing the total solutions auo will continually cooperate closely with partners in the industrial value chain to rapidly develop the solar market globally auo has entered into a joint venture agreement with sunpower to invest in a solar cell manufacturing facility in malaysia through the collaboration in technology and intellectual property auo aims to produce solar cells with the highest conversion efficiency rate globally and offer the best services to our clients auos solar module plant in brno is the first automated module plant in europe among taiwanese companies the equipment movein was completed in april and the module plant plans to enter into mass production in june of this year the total capacity is expected to reach mw in  the production line is built with a highly integrated automation system which significantly increases product precision the quality of the solar modules is therefore assured offering the best choice of products designed by taiwan and made in europe for european customers in addition auo aggressively participates in larger projects and pv investments expecting to execute openfield pv system projects in italy it is estimated the total power generation can reach  mwp the project in verona in northern italy for the power generation of kwp will be finished in june  auo will also tightly cooperate with local agents in each country to jointly develop a whole sales network of pv modules it is expected that global sales offices will be established by the end of  offering great and timely energy services to global clients about au optronics au optronics corp auo is a
