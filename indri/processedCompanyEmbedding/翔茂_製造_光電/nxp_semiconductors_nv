analysis of mergeredit both have deep roots stretching back to when they were part of philips nv in the case of nxp and motorola freescale each has comparable revenue figures usb and usb for nxp and freescale respectively in  nxp primarily focuses on near field communication nfc and highperformance mixed signal hpms hardware freescale focuses on its microprocessor and microcontroller both companies possess roughly equal patent portfolios certainly each company brings core strengths to the combined organization nfc from nxp and microcontrollers from freescale also both companies have been actively involved in litigation over the years as both plaintiff and defendant so a larger and more importantly a more geographically diverse patent portfolio could likely prove useful in such
