can implement your own packets on this profile simply but unfortunately it does not support pairing method for secure  reproducible build environment for nrf using rebuild rbldio as you probably know having a build environment you can replicate and deploy with ease has the potential to save a lot of rd time if you can also control its versioning so you would be able to get back in time for a build
