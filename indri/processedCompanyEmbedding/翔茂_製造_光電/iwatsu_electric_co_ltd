focus is on the following three business domains business communication systems including cti and voip devices to pbxs and office digital phones test and measurement equipment ranging from oscilloscopes to various other network testing systems reprographic systems including digital reprographic systems with which the company claims to have top share iwatsu electric is a member of the mitsubishi ufj financial group mufj keiretsu contents  history  seiichi iwasaki founder  s  s  s  s  s  major subsidiaries and affiliates  references  external links historyedit originally starting up as a telephone manufacturer iwatsu had been a longtime supplier to the public nippon telegraph and telephone company the company has enjoyed growth along the public ntt expanding its products to radio communication equipment oscilloscopes and in the year  their first reprographic system seiichi iwasaki founderedit seiichi iwasaki was born in  in shimane japan as a teenager he moved to tokyo without his family he worked by day to support himself and went to school by night whilst in school he became the leader of a circle of likeminded friends which they called hatenkai together they vowed to succeed in the future iwasaki dropped out of school in  and began his military service in  in okayama—which he completed in three years then he moved to hokkaidō where he started his career as an entrepreneur his ventures in hokkaidō stretched from railroads to coal mines until the year  when he changed his course and came back to tokyo again sedit seiichi iwasaki was running a small business called iwasaki kogyo in the yoyogi neighborhood of tokyo for manufacturing and selling cables iwasaki realized that in order to stay in business he needed to follow the national policy and produce what the country needed at the time the first focus was on antiinduction telephones in the s the telephone infrastructure in japan was primarily used by the railroad industry the police the utility industry and the mining industry the telecommunications infrastructure was so poor that it had to rely on power lines and railway cables—upon which telephone signals were superimposed because the telephone signals were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much signal loss normal telephone conversations were difficult iwasaki kogyo set out to develop an antiinduction telephone to solve this problem whilst running the cable manufacturing operations similarly iwasaki kogyo focused on secure antitapping telephones motivated by these opportunities he started looking for engineers luckily he knew engineers from the members of hatenkai minoru tokoha and motosaburo hashimoto when he talked to them they both showed strong interest with the help of these two engineers he set up a lab in his own house in yoyogi to develop the two kinds of specialpurpose telephones after six months tokoha and hashimoto introduced iwasaki to kokichi hayakawa the television research chief at the faculty of electrical engineering at waseda university with the addition of hayakawa the development of specialpurpose telephones speeded up and the antiinduction telephone and then the antitapping telephone were completed by the middle of  hayakawa later became the first chief engineervice president of iwatsu the sales of antiinduction telephones started in october  and the police the ministry of railway the power industry the railroad industry and the mining industry welcomed the product demand quickly outstripped capacity forcing iwasaki to extend the factory iwasaki knew that a privately owned business was not enough to meet such high demands and decided to incorporate a company on august   the inauguration ceremony of iwasaki tsushinki communication instruments was held at iwasakis own house the name iwatsu became the official abbreviation for iwasaki tsushinki in  initially there were  employees they were manufacturing the said telephones and carriercurrent telephones plus components relays transformers capacitors etc necessary for making the telephones because the small factory though extended couldnt handle the increasing orders anymore a new bigger factory was built in  in karasuyama tokyo the production department was moved to this new factory leaving the other operations in yoyogi around this time the number of employees increased to approximately  sedit iwatsu was one of the three companies including hitachi and nec ordered by the army to develop a radar warning system because the karasuyama factory was already running at full capacity iwatsu had no choice but to build even bigger factories kugayama tokyo was selected as the site to build new factories along with the headquarters which were completed in  kugayama is the location of the current iwatsu headquarters the development of the radar warning system was led by chief engineer hayakawa and after excruciating efforts by the engineers a prototype was completed in  the prototypes from the three companies were tested by the army and iwatsus prototype got the honor of being the best in performance iwatsu was ordered to massproduce the systems which were installed across the country as a highschool dropout seiichi iwasaki knew the importance of education iwatsu began building schools on the corporate campus providing young factory workers with education the schools also served as a training center for future engineers of iwatsu the end of world war ii was a huge turning point for iwatsu seiichi iwasaki laid down the companys future plan and gave the devastated employees a new hope the plan was to make a quick transition to manufacturing consumer goods starting with commonbattery telephones however the transition did not go smoothly starting the development of new products of which iwatsu had no experience from scratch was hard enough rampant inflation and constant lack of materials did not help either when iwatsu finally got the first approval for the commonbattery telephone among other three products from the ministry of communications and made delivery in  the employees excitement reached its peak it gave them hope in the days of confusion and starvation however the companys livelihood was in danger iwatsu was deep in debt frequent demonstrations were held by a newly formed labor union and many jobs had to be cut faced with the severe financial difficulties seiichi iwasaki and other company officials decided to give up the fight to save the company on march   tadashi adachi and takao yoshida were brought in to be the president and the senior executive vice president respectively in hopes of reviving the company drastic changes had to be made such as selling off assets and properties and laying off employees in order to lay the groundwork for a solid business base sedit after world war ii rebuilding the devastated communications infrastructure was ordered by the general headquarters of the allied forces ghq and became one of the countrys top priorities iwatsu took full advantage of the situation and focused on developing and manufacturing telephones iwatsus production facilities made significant advancements with the introduction of quality control and belt conveyors the foundation for increasing production was laid iwatsu established its position as a telephone manufacturer iwatsu delivered magneto telephones and dial telephones to the ministry of telecommunications and aircraft radio communications accessories to the japanese ministry of defense nippon telegraph and telephone ntt public corporation founded by the japanese government in  opened a big market for subscriber telephones and became iwatsus biggest client ntt also allowed telephone sets and pbx systems to be commercially available in japan iwatsu opened one branch office after another across japan over four years to build a nationwide sales network iwatsu was ready to venture into new challenges again the far east air material command feamcom in tachikawa tokyo was in need of more oscilloscopes which were scarce and not so advanced at the time for testing their radar systems the feamcom cooperated with iwatsu in developing japans first oscilloscope this oscilloscopes greatest advantage was its ability to hold a waveform still on the crt making it easier for the user to observe and measure the waveform iwatsu named it synchroscope and the first model was delivered to the ministry of defense in  tv broadcasting started in japan in  nhk or japan broadcasting corporation requested iwatsu to develop a new oscilloscope for tvs because oscilloscopes were essential for measuring tv signals and iwatsu was the only domestic oscilloscope manufacturer at the time iwatsus synchroscope continued to evolve in response to new demands such as larger crts and higher frequency ranges president adachi accepted his new position as the president of radio tokyo and resigned his position at iwatsu yoshida became the third president and kanichi ohashi became the executive vice president of iwatsu in  during this highgrowth period iwatsus capital increased from  yen in  to  yen in  iwatsus stock price kept rising and started to get attention iwatsu went public in  and became listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange in  president yoshida who had been the driving force behind iwatsus revitalization ever since he became part of the company was also asked to serve as the president of fuji heavy industries where he originally came from it became extremely hard for him to look after two companies at the same time because fuji heavy industries started their production of motor vehicles in full swing so he remained as the president of fuji heavy industries and became the chairman of the board of iwatsu in effect stepping down from his active role at iwatsu kanichi ohashi assumed his position as the fourth president of iwatsu in  ohashis inauguration marked the end of iwatsus long postwar reconstruction period and the beginning of a new era president ohashi visited the united states in  to see the trends in the american telephone industry he found out key telephone systems were already in actual use and was convinced that the key telephone system was the next new thing in the telephone market in japan iwatsu had been working on the development of a key telephone system and the first practical system with five trunks and ten stations was delivered to ntt public corporation that year sedit iwatsu was seeking the third signature product following telephones and oscilloscopes after years of research in europe and the us iwatsu took notice of rcas electrostatic printer and copier technology electrofax iwatsu signed a patent license with rca and began research and development of what was seemingly unrelated to iwatsus thenexisting technologies the idea behind this decision was that there wasnt much difference in terms of communications whether electronic or on paper iwatsus first drytype electronic reprographic machine elefax pc  was introduced at tokyo business show in  the next model elefax pc  was shown at international trade fair and officially released in  iwatsu was the th company in the world to undertake the research of electrophotographic technology but iwatsu came in fourth to actually release a product based on such technology a new platingandcoating plant was built in  in order to modernize and streamline the platingcoating processes of everincreasing telephone production with the help of fujikasui engineering the plant was designed with a proactive approach to prevent pollution namely an innovative wastewater treatment system the plant became a model for such facilities and thousands of people from various industries came to visit president ohashi placed emphasis on research and development while former president yoshida had focused on increasing production capacity ohashis belief led to the completion of a technical research lab in hachioji tokyo in  still iwatsus production facilities kept expanding in order to meet growing demands for subscriber telephones the iwatsu telephone production hit the  sets per month mark in june  an accumulated total of  sets were manufactured by october  an accumulated total of  sets were manufactured by june  in december  iwatsu was producing  sets per month and the number of employees increased to  the current kugayama main building at the iwatsu headquarters was completed in march  replacing the old wooden building the reinforced concrete building is five stories high with one basement level it took strong determination and efforts to build such a building in the middle of a recession the new main building was a testament to the endurance of employees who supported the company throughout postwar uncertainty iwatsu started branching out into overseas markets doing business with southeast asian countries kenya dominican republic and ireland iwatsu took part in trade shows in the united states south korea switzerland germany and so on the trade department was established in february  to diversify export markets and expand overseas sales an international bid was conducted by the kuwaiti government in  as part of its plan to expand telephone services iwatsu won the yen bid beating strong competitors from england belgium yugoslavia germany etc iwatsu exported key telephone systems to kuwait it was iwatsus first massexport of key telephone systems iwatsu celebrated its th anniversary in  a commemorative exhibit showing all divisions historic products was held in tokyo it drew in over  people a big party was also held in tokyo inviting  prominent people from various fields seiichi iwasaki the founder of iwatsu died at the age of  on september   the corporate funeral for him was held four days later representatives from all walks of life came and paid their respects toshio iwata became the fifth president of iwatsu in november  ohashi became the chairman of the board sedit iwatsu continued to expand its production and export kyushu iwatsu and fukushima iwatsu were established for manufacturing key telephone systems and associated components iwatsu seimitsu was established for manufacturing and selling switches for measurement instruments iwatsu became partners with rex rotary of denmark and exported elefax to  countries iwatsu tied up with a taiwanese company to export telephone manufacturing technologies and start production in taiwan the trade department under the supervision of the sales division became independent as the international department in april  for promotion of export and expansion into international markets although export to the us marked a record high in  the year the energy crisis hit accurate information from the us distributors was not readily available which was a problem for planning new products in japan iwatsu decided to establish direct sales in america iwatsu america now iwatsu voice networks was established in new jersey in december  a wooded area of iwatsu headquarters premises was named iwatsu garden and opened to public in  as a contribution to the community it became a relaxationrecreation area for the people in the surrounding area major subsidiaries and affiliatesedit some of the major
