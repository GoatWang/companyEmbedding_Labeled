japan eleven years later in  he began to produce clocks under the name seikosha  seikōsha meaning roughly house of exquisite workmanship according to seikos official company history titled a journey in time the remarkable story of seiko  seiko is a japanese word meaning exquisite or success exquisite is usually written  from chinese jīngqiǎo while the meaning success is usually written  from chinese chénggōng the first watches produced under the seiko brand appeared in  in  seiko introduced the astron the worlds first production quartz watch when it was introduced it cost the same as a mediumsized car seiko later went on to introduce the first quartz chronograph in the late s seiko produced the first kinetic watch that combined the selfenergizing attributes of an automatic watch with quartz accuracy the watch is entirely powered by its movement in everyday wear in  orient and seiko established a joint factory the company was incorporated k hattori  co ltd in  and was renamed hattori seiko co ltd in  and seiko corporation in  after reconstructing and creating its operating subsidiaries such as seiko watch corporation and seiko clock inc it became a holding company in  and was renamed seiko holdings corporation as of july   seiko is perhaps best known for its wristwatches all of which were at one time produced entirely inhouse this includes not only major items such as microgears motors hands crystal oscillators batteries sensors lcds but also minor items such as the oils used in lubricating the watches and the luminous compounds used on the hands and the dials seiko watches were originally produced by two different subsidiaries one was diani seikosha conow known as seiko instruments inc and the other was suwa seikosha conow known as seiko epson corporation having two companies both producing the same brand of watch enabled seiko to improve technology through competition and hedge risk it also reduced risk of production problems since one company can increase production in the case of decreased production in the other party currently watch movements are made in shizukuishi iwate sii morioka seiko instruments ninohe iwate sii ninohe tokei kogyo shiojiri nagano seiko epson and their subsidiaries in china malaysia and singapore the fully integrated inhouse production system is still practised for luxury watches in japan brands and product linesedit seiko produces watches with quartz kinetic solar and mechanical watches of varying prices ranging from around ¥ us sold under the brand albawatch to ¥ us to separate the customer groups seiko has created many different brands in japan and the international market seiko has several lines such as the seiko  series the  reflects five key features of the watch namely automatic winding day and date display in a single window—rare at the time water resistant recessed crown at the  o’clock position and durable case and bracelet—ie steel and the luxury credor king seiko and grand seiko series grand seikoedit birth of grand seikoedit prior to  to challenge the status of swiss watches and change the perception of japanese watches daini seikosha and suwa began the discussion of a product line that can match the quality of swiss watches under the suggestion of the parent company at the time suwa seikosha co was in charge of manufacturing mens watches so it was decided that suwa would be producing the first grand seiko gs grand seiko sbga with r spring drive movement the first grand seiko was released in  it was based on seikos previous highend watch crown this grand seiko has a jewel manualwinding  calibre and only  units were produced this was also the first chronometer grade watch manufactured in japan and it was based on seikos own chronometer standard design styleedit the design language of the grand seiko was set in  with the creation of grand seiko gs the gs set the ground for all future grand seiko with nine elements these elements help improve the legibility of the watch under different situations and create a sharp crisp visual impression double width index at  oclock multifaceted rectangular markers highly polished bezel highly polished planes and two dimensional surface half recessed crown flat dial multifaceted hour and minute hands curved sideline reverse slanted bezel wall and case side movementsedit mechanical movementedit in  seiko introduced three  beat  ticks per second calibers the automatic caliber gs the manual winding gs and gs for womens watch the gs was japans first automatic  beat watch and it was the most accurate mechanical watch due to the high beat calibers the calibers are considered high beat because normal mechanical movements beat six to eight times per second and higher beat makes the watch more resistant to shock thus achieving the high accuracy in  seiko released the new  beat caliber s which is a completely new designed of the previous high beat caliber the new caliber also met the grand seiko standard a chronometer certification that is more strict than the chronometer certificate in switzerland list of seiko mechanical movements caliber vibrations per hour jewels accuracy sec

movementedit on december   seiko released the world’s first quartz watch the seiko quartz astron the watch uses a crystal oscillator at its core for accuracy where the crystal generate steady vibration when voltage is applied to it during the ten years of development period at suwa seikosha seiko manage to create many parts which enabled viable application of quartz on wristwatch for example seiko cut the crystal oscillator into the shape of a tuningfork developed integrated circuit and step motor to properly operate the signals from the crystal oscillator quartz wristwatch astron cal a seiko japan  additional to creating the parts that enabled quartz watch seiko did not monopolize the patent rights for the unique pieces but decided to open it in  seiko announced the world’s first lcd quartz watch with sixdigit digital display in  seiko launched the world’s first multifunction digital watch the  in  seiko released the twin quartz watch to address the impact of temperature on the frequency of the quartz crystal oscillator which put a limitation on the accuracy of quartz watch seiko put a second crystal in the watch thats linked with a processor that detects the change in temperature and signals the main oscillator to compensate the result was a huge improve in the watch’s accuracy from  seconds per month to  seconds per year in  seiko combined the automatic with electric watch making with seiko kinetic a movement thats powered by the user and convert the energy to electricity for the quartz movement spring driveedit in  seiko spring drive was announced it was developed by yoshikazu akahane and his team and inspired by yoshikazu’s vision “a watch wound by a mainspring and with onesecondaday accuracy a precision that only the finest electronic watches could deliver” this movement achieved high accuracy with  second per day long power reserve  hours with its special developed alloy fast winding with the “magic lever” design and glidemotion movement with the watch hands the movement uses a mainspring as a source of energy and transmits it through gear train just like a traditional mechanical watch but instead of an escapement and balance wheel seiko used the newly developed trisynchro regulator which acts like a quartz movement the trisynchro regulator has three main function controlling the mechanical energy of the mainspring generate electricity for the low consumption  nanowatts quartz crystal oscillator and generate a magnetic force to regulate the glide wheel by replacing the traditional escapement with magnetic brake the spring drive operates with lower noise and present a glide motion hand that shows continuous flow of time the spring drive movement was also used as the basis for the first ever watch designed to be worn by an astronaut during a space walk the aptly named seiko spring drive spacewalk seiko in the united states of americaedit seiko corporation of america is responsible for distribution of seiko
