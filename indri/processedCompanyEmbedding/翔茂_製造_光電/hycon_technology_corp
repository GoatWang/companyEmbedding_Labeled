market andes technology corporation today announced that hycon technology corporation based in taipei city taiwan selected the andes high performance low gate count low power architecture n bit processor core for hycons next generation highend bit analogtodigital converter adc  the andes core helps hycons higher resolution bit adc achieve a competitive advantage in the demanding and rapid growth health care device market of digital scales blood pressure and insulin monitors wearables and other devices that monitor chronic medical conditions outside the hospital “andes technology provided hycon with ontime and effective technical support and service that ensured our design teams schedule was maintained as we integrated the andes core into our new bit adc design” hsu wenyee senior director at hycon technology said “and their excellent support helped reduce our time to market while andes is a newer cpu ip supplier in the industry the companys strong and continued

significant demand for new systems and technology in medical” about the n cpu core soc designs for iot devices demand low cost and low power consumption in combination with high performance to handle compute intensive functions such as processing sensor data and wireless protocol stacks the efficient andestar™ instruction set architecture enables superior bit performance with lower power consumption than and gatecount equivalent to an older bit processor the threestage pipelined n works with separate flash acceleration ip called flashfetch that boosts performance without consuming added power the key component of flashfetch consists of a small amount of buffer near the processor core that enables repetitive functions to be executed efficiently thus eliminating power consuming flash memory accesses a threestage variant of the n the s features the andestar vm architecture with security extension micro profile which enables a secure microcomputer core with code and data protection from physical attacks and passwordprotected debugging  another variant of the n core called e is equipped with the unique andes custom extensionace  the e enables designers to create custom instructions that differentiate their designs from competitive offerings that are based on standard instruction set processors by adding special instructions not easily discoverable by hackers ace can provide even stronger security to a design  the e also delivers  dmips per mhz of performance while consuming far less power than bit competitive alternatives prev back to the list next top ask for
