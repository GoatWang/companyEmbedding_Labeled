expand to  of the group revenue before   said heng currently the companys traditional semiconductor business only contributes about  of globetronics revenue but quartz crystal and timing devices business make up as much as  while leds business and sensors business each contribute  of the groups revenue we have been building up our new product technology and customer base steadily over the
