technology of melfas we introduce you to melfas a leading touch input solution market company home  technologies  products  technologies features and merits of melfas rich experiences of the mobile market provision history of more than  million touch control ic in accumulation to the set enterprise holding various lineup development and yielding of the ic which can be applied with hightier  tablet from touch key simultaneous supply of addon  oncell·incell possible which is the only case in korea success in commercialization of ait advanced incell touch through the cooperation with lg display from q  provision of the optimal total solution suggestions of the optimal ic and melfas’s own pattern for the various customers melfas technologies  capacitive sensing circuit capacitive sensing circuit is the technique which converts the physical capacitance to the electrical signal that can be sensed electrically and is one of the technologies to design ic which becomes the core of the capacitive sensor the ac sensing circuit which is being widely used in general measures the responsive signal by the rc time constant which is decided by the r c components of the electrode after applying the ac signals to the sensing electrode in order to sense the capacitance in this type of method since it is affected by r resistance value among the parasitic components of the sensing electrode there is a limitation physically not to be able to extract c capacitance value onlyto overcome this kind of problem melfas designed the sensing circuit of the inventive fullyanalog electric charge this technology provides certain amount of the electric charge q to the sensing electrode and charge the electric charge at the both ends of the sensing capacitor c thus the principle is to measure the sensing voltage v which is decided by vqc accordingly through this c value can be measured regardless of the resistance component of the electrode part which guarantees the safe performance regardless of the deviation of the resistance value of the electrode part which can rise in the mass production which enhances the competitiveness of the products from the higher yield and the better product quality  design technology of the adc circuit the adc circuit which converts the analog signal to the digital data signal is the significant ip which conducts the core function of the sensor especially in the sensor that is implemented by the analog circuit the performance difference of the transistor could rise according to the temperature variation and the characteristic variation could rise from the user environment and products due to the performance changed by the lot variationour company which holds the temperature correction function which is appropriate for the capacitive sensor application that has unique characteristics and the performance compensation function due to the lot deviation developed and owns the stage adc structure of the original new temperature compensationthrough this melfas overcomes the chip performance variation due to the process variation in the mass production which led to securing the higher production yield and the better product quality  low power consumption to control the mechanical key which was generally used before melfas achieved wake on gpio technology it’s also needed the external interrupt function to sense the input of the mechanical key without any extra current consumption on the sleep mode  design technology of the mixedsignal touch screen needs the function part for filtering technology to convert the sensed input information to the coordination information after analyzing it as well as the analog sensing circuit to be immune to the various noises from the external environment this kind of functional logic needs to be implemented as the digital circuit and melfas designed this kind of functional logic applying the digital ip with mcu the memory etc also it holds the design technology of mixedsignal to materialize this  interface protocol among the interface ic uart spi slave  master jtag usb fshs high speed serial link the ic interface has the serial communication standard which supports the bidirection using the smallest number of signal line and is the universal communication method which the main controller of most cell phones supporttouch sensor has to either transmit the input information made by sensing the touch input to the main controller or be transmitted the command packet for the property setting of the touch sensor and this kind of communication is conducted using the ic communication standardmelfas designed the interface circuit and the packet structure which satisfy the ic standard and holds its own ip spi interfaceslavemaster supports the fastest transmission speed in the low price type of interface and is possible to the masternslave communication as the synchronous method but it is  communication once slave is selected by the master melfas has both the masterslave ip designed by itself jtag interface is the interface which can simply test in ic instead of mcu melfas has jtag ip as well usb  interface can give and take the data with the fastest transmission speed another high speed serial link is the interface which sends the image which was received at the mipi to the driver ic  analog filter as the block which belongs to touch afe analog front end it was designed to adjust the filter bandwidth in order to minimize the amount of the noise and avoid the certain noise after sensing  digital filter melfas has the various digital filter algorithms to remove the quantizationnoise digital noise and a certain or the residual noise after minimizing the noise at the analog path and passing through adc  voltage regulator technology due to the features of the analog sensing circuit the abnormal operation could occur from the abrupt power supply change caused by the power supply noise in order to prevent the deterioration of the circuit performance due to the power supply change like this the external voltage regulator is normally needed however melfas integrated this ip into the chip and secured the stable sensor performance without any cost increase  soc technology to implement the effective digital control circuit based on mcu  nonvolatile memory nvm integrated system instead of the hardwired control circuit which was applied in the stgeneration sensor mcu ip was applied from the ndgeneration sensor the integrated mcus are used from bit  type of mcu core ip widely provided to bit arm mcu core ip this includes memory interface rom control isp in system programming gpio control peripheral control  peripheral ip timer watchdog gpio pwm timer are operated to periodically inform the interrupt to mcu through the internal counter and watchdog which is similar to the timer has the function to reset the system in case the interrupt which was delivered to mcu is not processed properly also gpio can support the various interfaces with the external devices and it helps to improve the performance of the low power consumption through pwm  design technology of esd protection circuit unlike the ordinary sensor the capacitive touch sensor is generally located at the nearest to the set case outskirt due to the characteristics of an input device in accordance with this it is difficult to meet in the set condition only with general esd protection circuit of hbm kv of iec standard which is required at the general commercialized chip to overcome this melfas has not used the general esd protection circuit which is included in the standard io from the foundry but developed its own esd protection circuit based on it through this the competitiveness has been secured having the esd protection circuit performance of the hbm kv which is superior to other competitors  hover technology melfas has the technical patent to be possible to detect the fine cap changes and this technology was applied to the fingerprint sensor and the highend mobiletablet  the capture technology of dpi level image with the use of the melfas hover related technical patent the detection of the fine level of cap changes became possible which enabled to capture the image with dpi level that is required at the popular fingerprint specification also the algorithm for the security was additionally implemented  firmware with proprietary frequency hopping  in the environment with the various type of the noise it finds the frequency range of the noisefree and avoid any malfunction precise hover rejection  being recognized with the input without the finger’s touching the screen impacts the users’ feeling of the performance very badly we solved this by exactly calculating the input area of the recognized input and applying differently with the area palm rejection  in case the stylus of the contact area under phi is used the user can put hisher hands on or use the pen holding the touch screen with the other hand at this moment the algorithm can inform ap of whether each finger is the part of the palm touch or not in order to be recognized only stylus input finger separation  the  touches which were contacted closely are exactly recognized  of them by checking the form of the image when applying the multi touching gesture detection  recognition of the letters characters such as c w v m s z o e etc as well as the action of the double tap and leftrightupdown flick dynamic position filter  according to the input speed and the direction of the user the coordination stabilized logic is operated with the optimum the linearity of the input is secured without any delay phenomenon of the coordination through this signature detection  as a method to compare to the signature information which was put in advance and to match them it is a lock lift solution with the higher security melfas bd  pangyoyeokro bundanggu seongnamsi gyeonggido korea  tel  business registration no  copyright   by melfas
