largest display in its market category × business technology frost  sullivan commends gefran for developing a proportional integral derivative controller with the largest display in its market category   the  pid saves time reduces risks and enhances productivity for end users mountain view california april   prnewswire  based on its recent analysis of the proportional integral derivative pid controller market frost  sullivan recognizes gefran with the  global frost  sullivan award for product leadership gefrans pid controller the  has successfully addressed enduser pain points regarding display viewability by increasing the size of the display screen and offering customization based on enduser needs frost  sullivan recognizes gefran with the  global product leadership award the  has a large display area measuring  mm x  mm the biggest display area in its category which enables operators to easily read the settings alarms and messages said frost  sullivan research analyst archit kohli the controller has three displays the first shows the actual present value the second shows the set point and the third checks for direct and immediate interaction during the initial configuration and operation the  has an energy monitor function that can alert the user of a possible breakdown and helps prevent unexpected system shutdowns by giving operators ample time to schedule maintenance in advance similarly it also detects machine error and recommends remedial action to save users time meanwhile the controllers can be configured easily with the gfexpress programming tool for the computer gefrans pid controllers can be connected to a communication network using the modbus communication standard which is one of the most widely adopted industrial communication standards the company is one of the first to develop a pid controller with a message storage facility and can store up to  messages the solution is customized to the users needs and the operators can choose from three languages the temperature on the controller is visible at a distance due to its large numbers and a whiteonblack contrast on a large liquid crystal display lcd screen gefran has also ensured that the controller is a userfriendly human machine interface and highly configurable because the customer can require the desired frame color the  which has the largest display is supported by zapper a portable batterypowered configurator that allows the operator to save and store up to four programs additionally operators can copypaste parameters when the pid controller power supply is off the packaging of the controller is specifically studied to allow the configuration of the product on the shelf each year frost  sullivan presents this award to the company that has developed a
