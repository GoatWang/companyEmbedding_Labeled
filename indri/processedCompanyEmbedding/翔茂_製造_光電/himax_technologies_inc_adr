supplier to small caps himax technologies inc adr nasdaqhimx expected to be key dsensing supplier to apple inc nasdaqaapl byandy parker march    share on facebook tweet on twitter analysis reports indicate that shares of himax technologies inc adr nasdaqhimx have risen sharply in  largely based on the expectation that the firm has been picked to supply apple inc nasdaqaapl with d sensing components for the next version of the iphone but despite having appreciated by  this year analysts at morgan stanley insist that the stock could rise by an extra  the upside will be because more manufacturers of smartphones will also copy apple and introduce d sensing technology to their gadgets and this will translate to a bigger market for himax d sensing technology d sensing technology apple is believed to be planning to include d sensing technology in its upcoming iphone which is rumored to have an oled display it will also encompass some level of virtual reality and augmented reality some of the technology companies that have popularized d sensors include lenovo with its phab pro intel with its realsense and microsoft corporation nasdaqmsft with its kinect one of the benefits of d sensors is that they bring depth in a similar way to the human eye while there are many technology firms capable of supplying d sensing components to apple the choice of himax technologies by the cupertino californiabased tech giant is believed to be due to the fact that himax makes sensors that are smaller than competing companies this is because apple has as a tradition always preferred components with as small a technological footprint as possible “himax’s wafer level optics wlo technology can further reduce the size and fit the d sensing in smartphones” wrote charlie chan an analyst at morgan stanley in a research note kgi securities too news that apple would be introducing d sensing technology first came out last month through another research note from kgi securities’ analyst ming chikuo in his note kuo hinted that the d sensing technology would be provided by primesense an israeli firm that apple had acquired a couple of years ago primesense was
