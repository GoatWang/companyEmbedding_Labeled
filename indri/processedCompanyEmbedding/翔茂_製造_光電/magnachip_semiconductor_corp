directors the committee has overall responsibility for administering our compensation program for our named executive officers the committees responsibilities consist of evaluating approving and monitoring our executive officer and director compensation plans policies and programs as well as each of our equitybased compensation plans and policies for  our named executive officers were        youngjoon kim our chief executive officer        jonathan kim our chief financial officer executive vice president and chief accounting officer        theodore kim our chief compliance officer executive vice president general counsel and secretary        tae jong lee our executive vice president and general manager foundry services group and        woung moo lee our executive vice president and general manager standard products group the committee seeks to establish total compensation for executive officers that is fair reasonable and competitive the committee evaluates our compensation packages to ensure that        we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior executives in critical positions        our executives are incentivized and rewarded for corporate growth achievement of longterm corporate objectives and individual performance that meets or exceeds our expectations without encouraging unnecessary risktaking and        compensation provided to critical executives remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of companies in the semiconductor industry the committee believes that the most effective executive compensation packages align executives interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that exceeds specific annual longterm and strategic goals that are intended to improve stockholder value these objectives include the achievement of financial performance goals and progress on projects that our board of directors anticipates will lead to future growth as discussed more fully below the information set forth below in this compensation discussion and analysis describes the committees general philosophy and historical approach say on pay vote and stockholder input the committee also seeks to ensure that the compensation paid to the companys executive officers is aligned with the interests of the companys stockholders in that respect as part of its ongoing review of the compensation paid to the companys executive officers the committee considered the approval by approximately  of the votes cast for the say on pay vote relating to the compensation of our named executive officers at the companys  annual meeting of stockholders and determined that the companys executive compensation philosophy compensation objectives and compensation elements continued to be appropriate and did not make any changes to the companys executive pay program for  timing of compensation decisions at the end of each fiscal year our chief executive officer reviews the performance of the other executive officers and presents his conclusions and recommendations to the committee at that time and throughout the year the committee also evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer which is measured in substantial part against our consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of  the committee then assessed the overall functioning of our compensation plans against our goals and determined whether any changes to the allocation of compensation elements or the structure or level of any particular compensation element were warranted in connection with this process our committee generally establishes the elements of our shortterm cash incentive plan for the upcoming year with respect to newly hired employees our practice is typically to approve equity grants at the first meeting of the committee following such employees hire date we do not have any program plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with the release of material nonpublic information from time to time additional equity awards may be granted to executive officers during the fiscal year    role of executive officers in compensation decisions for named executive officers other than our chief executive officer we have historically sought and considered input from our chief executive officer in making determinations regarding executive compensation our chief executive officer annually reviews the performance of our other named executive officers our chief executive officer subsequently presents conclusions and recommendations regarding the compensation of such officers including proposed salary adjustments and incentive amounts to the committee the committee then takes this information into account when it makes final decisions regarding any adjustments or awards the review of performance by the committee and our chief executive officer of other executive officers is both an objective and subjective assessment of each executives contribution to our performance leadership qualities strengths and weaknesses and performance relative to goals set by the committee or our chief executive officer as applicable the committee and our chief executive officer do not systematically assign a weight to the factors and may in their discretion consider or disregard any one factor which in their sole discretion is important to or irrelevant for a particular executive the committees annual determinations regarding executive compensation are subject to the terms of the respective service agreements between us and the named executive officers as set forth in more detail below in addition to the annual reviews the committee also typically considers compensation changes upon a named executive officers promotion or other change in job responsibility neither our chief executive officer nor any of our other executives participate in deliberations relating to their own compensation role of compensation consultant the committee engages an external compensation consultant to assist it by providing information analysis and other advice relating to our executive compensation program and the decisions resulting from its annual executive compensation review for  the committee retained compensia inc compensia a national compensation consulting firm to serve as its compensation consultant this compensation consultant serves at the discretion of the committee during  compensia provided the following services        assisted the committee in determining the design and amount of equity awards for the key executives and board members and        assisted the committee in determining the appropriate pool of stock to grant to all employees in  in  compensia did not provide any services to us other than the consulting services to the committee the committee regularly reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice provided by its compensation consultant on executive compensation in  the committee considered the six specific independence factors adopted by the sec and reflected in the nyse listing standards and determined that the work performed by compensia did not raise any conflicts of interest elements of compensation in making decisions regarding the pay of the named executive officers the committee looks to set a total compensation package for each officer that will retain highquality talent and motivate the officer to achieve the goals set by our board of directors our  compensation package was comprised of the following elements        annual base salary        shortterm cash incentives        longterm equity incentives        a health and welfare benefits package that is generally available to all of our employees        expatriate and other executive benefits and        limited postemployment or change in control benefits pursuant to individual severance agreements determination of amount of each element of compensation general background the committee seeks to establish a total cash compensation package for our named executive officers that is competitive with the compensation for similarly situated executives in our compensation peer group subject to adjustments based on each executives experience and performance historically based on our review of industryspecific survey data and the professional and market experience of our committee members we measured total cash compensation for our    named executive officers against cash compensation paid to executives at similarly situated companies which we determined to be in our select peer group base salaries for our named executive officers would then be set at competitive levels as compared to similarly situated executives in the select peer group shortterm cash incentives would be put in place to provide for opportunities that may result in competitive levels of cash compensation as compared to our select peer group if and depending upon the extent to which our performance and that of our named executive officers exceeded expectations and the goals established by the committee for the applicable year competitive positioning for purposes of comparing our executive compensation against the competitive market the committee reviews and considers the compensation levels and practices of a group of comparable technology companies the companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us in size industry focus and geographic location in october  with the assistance of compensia the committee developed our compensation peer group based on usbased semiconductor companies we focused on usbased semiconductor companies because our highest ranking executives are us expatriates who have opportunities to work with usbased semiconductor companies the companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us based on the following criteria        industrysemiconductors        similar revenue sizex to x our last four fiscal quarter revenue of approximately  million approximately  million to approximately  billion        executive positions similar in breadth complexity andor scope of responsibility and        competitors for executive talent the committee approved the use of the market data from this peer group for our december  executive compensation market assessment which was used for setting executive compensation in    cirrus logic cypress semiconductor diodes fairchild semiconductor integrated device tech international rectifier intersil microsemi    omnivision technologies pmcsierra rf micro devices semtech silicon laboratories spansion sunedison semiconductor triquint semiconductor the committee used the market data from this peer group that was developed in  as a reference point in its  executive compensation decisions along with compensation data from the radford global technology survey as of july  for companies with annual revenues between  million and  billion with median revenues of  million the committee reviews our compensation peer group periodically prior to assessing executive compensation and makes adjustments to its composition taking into account changes in both our business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group the committee is currently reviewing and revising our peer group for  the committee historically makes annual determinations regarding cash incentive compensation based on our annual operating plan which we usually adopt in december preceding each fiscal year the determination takes into account our expected performance in the coming fiscal year the committee makes all equity compensation decisions for our officers based on existing compensation arrangements for other executives at our company with the same level of responsibility and based on a review of our select peer group with a view to maintaining internal consistency and parity equity awards are not tied to base salary or cash incentive amounts and will constitute lesser or greater proportions of total compensation depending on market practices and the committees determination of target grant values the committee relying on the professional and market experience of our committee members generally seeks to set equity awards at competitive levels based on both us and korean market practices and taking into account our equity plan share pool and projected dilution of our shares outstanding the committee does not apply a formula or assign relative weight in making its determination instead it makes a subjective determination after considering all information collectively    the committee may approve additional cash incentive payments or equity compensation grants from time to time during the year in its discretion annual base salary base salary is the guaranteed element of an employees annual cash compensation the committee seeks to set the base salaries of our named executive officers at competitive levels as compared to similarly situated executives in our select peer group but also takes into account the named executive officers skill set and the value of that skill set the committee makes a subjective decision regarding any changes in base salary based on these factors and the data from our select peer group the committee does not systematically assign weights to any of the factors it considers and may in its discretion ignore any factors or deem any one factor to have greater importance for a particular executive officer base salary adjustments generally take effect in the middle of our fiscal year after considering the factors described above in march  the committee increased the annual base salary for mr tj lee and mr wm lee by  korean won or an annual base salary of  based on the monthly average exchange rate for march  and  korean won or an annual base salary of  based on the monthly average exchange rate for march  respectively the committee did not make any other changes to the base salaries of our other named executive officers shortterm cash incentives shortterm cash incentives are typically designed as a percentage of base salary and may be awarded based on individual performance or our achievement of the annual longterm and strategic quantitative goals set by the committee in december  our board of directors implemented a cash incentive plan effective as of january   which we call the profit sharing plan the committee administers the profit sharing plan in  we provided shortterm cash incentive opportunities to our named executive officers under our profit sharing plan to encourage our named executive officers to achieve certain shortterm corporate performance goals for  the committee determined that consolidated adjusted ebitda would be the sole performance goal under the profit sharing plan which the committee believes is a key measure of our core operating performance consolidated adjusted ebitda is equal to our gaap net income loss before interest expense net income tax expenses benefits depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude i restructuring impairment and other gain ii equitybased compensation expense iii foreign currency loss gain net iv derivative valuation loss gain net and v restatement related expense in june  the committee approved an annual consolidated adjusted ebitda performance goal of  million based on the companys annual operating plan for  year in june  the committee also approved the target bonus amounts for each named executive officer the target bonus as a percentage of base salary but with the related dollar amount of bonus awards prorated for the number of months remaining in the  fiscal year as set forth below   named executive officer     target bonus of base salary     prorated  targetbonus    youngjoon kim               jonathan kim               theodore kim               tae jong lee               woung moo lee               achievement of  of the consolidated adjusted ebitda performance goal resulted in a maximum payout of  of the named executive officers target bonus while achievement of  of the consolidated adjusted ebitda performance goal resulted a payout of  of such target bonus achievement below  of the consolidated adjusted ebitda performance goal resulted in no bonus being earned for performance within the maximum and threshold range the percentage achievement would be determined based on a linear interpolation in february  the committee determined that the consolidated adjusted ebitda goal was achieved at  of target although the level of achievement resulted in the maximum payout of  of each named executive officers target bonus management recommended to cap the payout at each individuals target bonus in light of our financial situation and the need to maintain continued vigilance in managing expenses after taking into account managements recommendation the committee determined to exercise negative discretion and approved the payments set forth below   named executive officer    fiscal  bonus    youngjoon kim        jonathan kim        theodore kim        tae jong lee        woung moo lee           longterm equity incentives we offer longterm incentive compensation in the form of equity awards as a way to enhance the link between the creation of stockholder value and executive incentive compensation and to give our named executive officers appropriate motivation and rewards for achieving increases in stockholder value in  the committee granted a mix of stock options and timebased restricted stock units rsus to our named executive officers under our  equity incentive plan which replaced our  common unit plan immediately following our corporate conversion we believe that stock options which we grant with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant provide appropriate longterm incentive compensation for our named executive officers because they are rewarded only to the extent that our stock price appreciates following the grant date of the stock options which aligns with our stockholders interest in also seeing the value of their investment grow we believe that timebased rsus provide an appropriate balance to other forms of equity awards help us achieve our retention objectives and further align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders in  the committee granted stock options and rsus to all of our named executive officers in determining the value of each of these awards the committee considered competitive market data based on the compensation peer group data as well as its objective of creating a meaningful retention incentive for each named executive officer and providing rewards for the named executive officers if they successfully achieve increases in stockholder value stock options and rsus granted in  vest in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date health and welfare benefits our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans which are generally provided for all fulltime employees and on the same basis as all of our fulltime employees in the country in which they are resident these benefits include individual health insurance medical dental and vision group personal accident insurance and group business travel insurance perquisites and other benefits we provide the named executive officers with perquisites and other benefits including expatriate benefits that the committee believes are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions generally perquisites are determined based upon what the committee considers to be the most customary perquisites offered by our select peer group and are not based upon a median cost for specific perquisites or for the perquisites in aggregate the committee determines the level and types of expatriate benefits for the executive officers based on local market surveys taken by our human resources group these surveys are not limited to our select peer group but include a broad range of companies based outside of korea but with significant operations in korea attributed costs of the personal benefits for the named executive officers are set forth in the summary compensation table below mr yj kim mr j kim and mr t kim were expatriates during   and  and received expatriate benefits commensurate with market practice in korea these benefits which were determined on an individual basis included housing allowances relocation and repatriation allowances insurance premiums reimbursement for the use of a car home leave flights living expenses childrens tuition allowances tax equalization payments and tax advisory services each as the committee deemed appropriate and in accordance with internal policies approved by our board of directors in effect from time to time postemployment severance benefits each of our named executive officers is party to a severance agreement that provides certain payments upon his termination of employment and a change in control of the company please see the section below entitled agreements with executives and potential payments upon termination or change in control for further discussion of those benefits in addition pursuant to the employee retirement benefit security act certain executive officers resident in korea with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason for purposes of this section we call this benefit statutory severance the base statutory severance is approximately one month of base salary per year of service each of our named executive officers accrued statutory severance in     tax and accounting

committee has been an officer or employee of our company during the last fiscal year during  decisions regarding executive officer compensation were made by our compensation committee mr yj kim our chief executive officer participated in deliberations of our compensation committee regarding the determination of compensation of our executive officers other than himself for  and prior periods none of our executive officers currently serves or in the past has served as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors    table of contents executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy and objectives the compensation committee of our board of directors or the committee has overall responsibility for administering our compensation program for our named executive officers the committees responsibilities consist of evaluating approving and monitoring our executive officer and director compensation plans policies and programs as well as each of our equitybased compensation plans and policies prior to  compensation decisions were made by the entire board of directors and for the discussion that follows references to the committee during such period refer to the entire board of directors for  our named executive officers were      youngjoon kim our chief executive officer      jonathan kim our chief financial officer executive vice president and chief accounting officer      theodore kim our chief compliance officer executive vice president general counsel and secretary      tae jong lee our executive vice president and general manager foundry services group      woung moo lee our executive vice president and general manager standard products group and      tae young hwang our former chief operating officer and president the committee seeks to establish total compensation for executive officers that is fair reasonable and competitive the committee evaluates our compensation packages to ensure that      we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior executives in critical positions      our executives are incentivized and rewarded for corporate growth achievement of longterm corporate objectives and individual performance that meets or exceeds our expectations without encouraging unnecessary risktaking and      compensation provided to critical executives remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarlysituated executives of companies in the semiconductor industry the committee believes that the most effective executive compensation packages align executives interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that exceeds specific annual longterm and strategic goals that are intended to improve stockholder value these objectives include the achievement of financial performance goals and progress on projects that our board of directors anticipates will lead to future growth as discussed more fully below the information set forth below in this compensation discussion and analysis describes the committees general philosophy and historical approach role of executive officers in compensation decisions for named executive officers other than our chief executive officer we have historically sought and considered input from our chief executive officer in making determinations regarding executive compensation our chief executive officer annually reviews the performance of our other named executive officers our chief executive officer subsequently presents conclusions and recommendations regarding such officers including proposed salary adjustments and incentive amounts to the committee the committee then takes this information into account when it makes final decisions regarding any adjustments or awards the review of performance by the committee and our chief executive officer of other executive officers is both an objective and subjective assessment of each executives contribution to our performance leadership    table of contents qualities strengths and weaknesses and the individuals performance relative to goals set by the committee or our chief executive officer as applicable the committee and our chief executive officer do not systematically assign a weight to the factors and may in their discretion consider or disregard any one factor which in their sole discretion is important to or irrelevant for a particular executive the committees annual determinations regarding executive compensation are subject to the terms of the respective service agreements between us and the named executive officers as set forth in more detail below in addition to the annual reviews the committee also typically considers compensation changes upon a named executive officers promotion or other change in job responsibility neither our chief executive officer nor any of our other executives participates in deliberations relating to their own compensation say on pay vote and stockholder input the committee also seeks to ensure that the compensation paid to the companys executive officers is aligned with the interests of the companys stockholders in that respect as part of its ongoing review of the compensation paid to the companys executive officers the committee considered the approval by approximately  of the votes cast for the say on pay vote relating to the compensation of our named executive officers at the companys  annual meeting of stockholders and determined that the companys executive compensation philosophy compensation objectives and compensation elements continued to be appropriate and did not make any changes to the companys executive pay program in response to such stockholder vote role of compensation consultant the committee engages an external compensation consultant to assist it by providing information analysis and other advice relating to our executive compensation program and the decisions resulting from its annual executive compensation review for  the committee retained compensia inc compensia a national compensation consulting firm to serve as its compensation advisor this compensation consultant serves at the discretion of the committee during  compensia provided the following services      assisted the committee in determining the design and amount equity awards for the key executives and board members      assisted the committee in determining the appropriate pool of stock to grant to all employees in  and      assisted the committee in designing the shortterm incentive plan for the key executives in  compensia did not provide any services to us other than the consulting services to the committee the committee regularly reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice provided by its compensation consultant on executive compensation in  the committee considered the six specific independence factors adopted by the sec and reflected in the nyse listing standards and determined that the work of compensia did not raise any conflicts of interest timing of compensation decisions at the end of each fiscal year our chief executive officer reviews the performance of the other executive officers and present his conclusions and recommendations to the committee at that time and throughout the year the committee also evaluates the performance of our chief executive officer which is measured in substantial part against our consolidated financial performance in january of the following fiscal year the committee then assesses the overall functioning of our compensation plans against our goals and determines whether any changes to the allocation of compensation elements or the structure or level of any particular compensation element are warranted    table of contents in connection with this process our committee generally establishes the elements of its performancebased cash bonus plan for the upcoming year with respect to newly hired employees our practice is typically to approve equity grants at the first meeting of the committee following such employees hire date we do not have any program plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with the release of material nonpublic information from time to time additional equity awards may be granted to executive officers during the fiscal year elements of compensation in making decisions regarding the pay of the named executive officers the committee looks to set a total compensation package for each officer that will retain highquality talent and motivate executives to achieve the goals set by our board of directors our  compensation package was composed of the following elements      annual base salary      longterm equity incentives      a benefits package that is generally available to all of our employees and      expatriate and other executive benefits determination of amount of each element of compensation general background the committee seeks to establish a total cash compensation package for our named executive officers that is competitive with the compensation reflected in compensation data for similarlysituated executives in the peer group reviewed by the committee subject to adjustments based on each executives experience and performance historically based on our review of industry specific survey data and the professional and market experience of our committee members we measured total cash compensation for our named executive officers against cash compensation paid to executives at similarly situated companies which we determined to be our select peer group base salaries for our named executive officers would then be benchmarked to median levels for companies in the select peer group and adjusted upward or downward for performance shortterm cash incentives would be put in place to provide for opportunities that may result in higher than median levels of cash compensation as compared to our select peer group if and depending upon the extent to which our performance and that of our named executive officers exceeded expectations and the goals established by the committee for the year in question competitive positioning for purposes of comparing our executive compensation against the competitive market the committee reviews and considers the compensation levels and practices of a group of comparable technology companies the companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us in size industry focus and geographic location in october  with the assistance of compensia the committee developed our compensation peer group based on usbased semiconductor companies we focused on usbased semiconductor companies because our highest ranking executives are us expatriates who have opportunities to work with usbased semiconductor companies the companies in this compensation peer group were selected on the basis of their similarity to us based on the following criteria      industry  semiconductors      similar revenue size  x to x our last four fiscal quarter revenue of approximately  million approximately  million to approximately  billion    table of contents    executive positions similar in breadth complexity andor scope of responsibility and      competitors for executive talent the committee approved the use of the market data from this peer group for our december  executive compensation market assessment which was used for setting executive compensation in    cirrus logic    omnivision technologies cypress semiconductor    pmcsierra diodes    rf micro devices fairchild semiconductor    semtech integrated device tech    silicon laboratories international rectifier    spansion intersil    sunedison semiconductor microsemi    triquint semiconductor to analyze the compensation practices of the companies in our compensation peer group compensia gathered data from public filings primarily proxy statements and from the radford global technology survey as of july  for companies with annual revenues between  million and  billion with median revenues of  million this market data was then used as a reference point for the committee to assess our current compensation levels in the course of its deliberations on compensation forms and amounts the committee reviews our compensation peer group periodically prior to assessing executive compensation and makes adjustments to its composition taking into account changes in both our business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group the committee historically makes annual determinations regarding cash incentive compensation based on our annual operating plan which we adopt in the december preceding each fiscal year the determination takes into account our expected performance in the coming fiscal year the committee makes all equity compensation decisions for our officers based on existing compensation arrangements for other executives at our company with the same level of responsibility and based on a review of our select peer group with a view to maintaining internal consistency and parity equity awards are not tied to base salary or cash incentive amounts and will constitute lesser or greater proportions of total compensation depending on the fair value of the awards the committee relying on the professional and market experience of our committee members generally seeks to set equity awards at median levels of equity compensation at our select peer group companies the committee does not apply a formula or assign relative weight in making its determination instead it makes a subjective determination after considering all information collectively the committee may approve additional cash incentive payments or equity compensation grants from time to time during the year in its discretion base salary base salary is the guaranteed element of an employees annual cash compensation changes in base salary may be approved by the committee for an executive if the median levels of base salary compensation for similarlysituated executives in our select peer group have changed and may be further adjusted based upon the employees longterm performance skill set and the value of that skill the committee evaluates the performance of each named executive officer on an annual basis based on the accomplishment of performance objectives that were established at the beginning of the prior fiscal year as well as its own subjective evaluation of the officers performance in making its evaluation the committee makes a subjective qualitative assessment    table of contents of the officers contribution to our performance during the preceding year including leadership success in attaining particular goals of a division for which that officer has responsibility our overall financial performance and such other criteria as the committee may deem relevant including input from our chief executive officer the committee then makes a subjective decision regarding any changes in base salary based on these factors and the data from our select peer group the committee does not systematically assign weights to any of the factors it considers and may in its discretion ignore any factors or deem any one factor to have greater importance for a particular executive officer base salary adjustments generally take effect in the middle of our fiscal year the committee increased base salaries for three of our named executive officers mr yj kim mr j kim and mr t kim for the  fiscal year cash incentives shortterm cash incentives have historically comprised a significant portion of the total target compensation package and are designed to reward executives for their contributions to meeting and exceeding our goals and to recognize and reward our executives in achieving these goals incentives are typically designed as a percentage of base salary and are awarded based on individual performance and our achievement of the annual longterm and strategic quantitative goals set by our committee in december  our board of directors implemented a cash incentive plan effective as of january   which we call the profit sharing plan each of our employees is eligible to participate in the profit sharing plan and our board of directors intends for the profit sharing plan to incentivize our named executive officers officers and employees to exceed expectations throughout our entire fiscal year the committee administers the profit sharing plan under the profit sharing plan the committee reviews our business plan in december of each year and determines an annual consolidated adjusted ebitda target or the base target for the upcoming fiscal year and sets the targeted amount to be awarded to our named executive officers and employees or the profit share for meeting the base target and for achievement in excess of the base target for our  fiscal year the committee determined that it is in the best interest of the company to increase the target annual performance bonus percentages for three of our named executive officers mr yj kim mr j kim and mr t kim equity compensation in addition to our historical use of cash incentives we offer equity incentives as a way to enhance the link between the creation of stockholder value and executive incentive compensation and to give our executives appropriate motivation and rewards for achieving increases in enterprise value under our  common unit plan our board of directors previously granted options to acquire magnachip semiconductor llc common units and restricted unit bonus awards awards under our  common unit plan were converted into options for common stock and restricted common stock of magnachip semiconductor corporation upon our corporate conversion such options vest in installments over three years following grant with approximately onethird of the restricted unit awards vested at grant and the remainder vesting in two subsequent annual installments as set forth in more detail below under our  equity incentive plan which replaced the  common unit plan immediately following our corporate conversion the committee may grant participants stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units performance shares and units and other stockbased and cashbased awards stock options granted under the  equity incentive plan prior to  generally vest over three years following grant with thirtyfour percent of the common stock vesting and becoming exercisable on the first anniversary of grant date and eight or nine percent of the common stock subject to the options vesting on completion of each threemonth period thereafter stock options granted in  generally vest fifty percent on the date of grant with the remaining fifty percent vesting and becoming exercisable in three equal annual    table of contents installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date restricted stock units rsus granted under the  equity incentive plan generally vest fifty percent on the date of grant with the remaining fifty percent vesting in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date settlement of vested rsus generally occurs as soon as practicable following the vesting date in granting equity awards the committee may establish any conditions or restrictions it deems appropriate stock options and stock appreciation rights must have exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the stock at the time of their grant pursuant to the  equity incentive plan the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant will generally be the closing price of a share of stock as quoted on the national or regional securities exchange or quotation system constituting the primary market for the stock on the date any grant is made prior to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation or settlement of an award denominated in units the holder has no rights as a stockholder with respect to the stock subject to the award including voting rights and the right to receive dividends participants receiving restricted stock awards are stockholders and have both voting rights and the right to receive dividends except that dividends paid on unvested shares may remain subject to forfeiture until vested award vesting ceases upon termination of employment and vested options and stock appreciation rights remain exercisable only for a limited period following such termination the committee considers granting additional equity compensation in the event of new employment a promotion or change in job responsibility or a change in median levels of equity compensation for similarlysituated executives at companies in our select peer group or in its discretion to reward or incentivize individual officers the equity award levels vary among participants based on their job grade and position the committee generally seeks to award equity compensation at levels consistent with the median levels for executives at companies in our select peer group and will also make subjective determinations regarding adjustments to award amounts in light of factors such as the available pool individual performance and role of executives for example the committee may adjust the size of an award for an individual executive above the equity award level for his or her position if the committee determines that the executive has provided exceptional performance or may increase the equity award level for a position above the median level reflected in the select peer group if the position is considered by the committee to be more critical to our longterm success the committee will generally maintain substantially equivalent award levels for executives at equivalent job grades equity awards are not tied to base salary or cash incentive amounts as a result of our  reorganization proceedings all previously outstanding common and preferred units and options held by our named executive officers were cancelled in december  we granted new options to our executives with the option award amounts generally determined based upon the median levels of our select peer group thirtyfour percent of the common units subject to the options vested and became exercisable on the first anniversary of grant date with eight or nine percent of the common units subject to the options vesting on completion of each threemonth period thereafter in january  because the options granted in december  would vest by the end of that year the committee granted additional options to all of our named executive officers other than mr yj kim who joined the company in april  mr j kim who joined the company in march  and mr t kim who joined the company in october  in  mr j kim received grants of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares arising out of the commencement of his employment with the company in  the committee granted options and rsus to all of our named executive officers other than mr hwang who resigned his positions with the company effective as of april   upon the recommendation of our board of directors or chief executive officer or otherwise the committee may in the future consider granting additional performancebased equity incentives perquisites and other benefits we provide the named executive officers with perquisites and other benefits including expatriate benefits that the committee believes are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions generally perquisites are determined based upon what the committee considers to be the most customary perquisites offered by our select peer group and are not based upon a median cost for specific perquisites or for the perquisites in aggregate the committee    table of contents determines the level and types of expatriate benefits for the executive officers based on local market surveys taken by our human resources group these surveys are not limited to our select peer group but include a broad range of nonkorea based companies with significant operations in korea attributed costs of the personal benefits for the named executive officers are as set forth in the summary compensation table below mr yj kim mr j kim and mr t kim were expatriates during  and  mr yj kim and mr t kim were also expatriates during  mr yj kim mr j kim and mr t kim received expatriate benefits commensurate with market practice in korea these benefits which were determined on an individual basis included housing allowances relocation and repatriation allowances insurance premiums reimbursement for the use of a car home leave flights living expenses childrens tuition allowances tax equalization payments and tax advisory services each as we deemed appropriate in addition pursuant to the employee retirement benefit security act certain executive officers resident in korea with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment for any reason for purposes of this section we call this benefit statutory severance the base statutory severance is approximately one month of base salary per year of service mr yj kim mr j kim mr t kim mr tj lee mr wm lee and mr hwang accrued statutory severance in  certain tax considerations we consider tax implications when we design our equitybased and cash compensation programs and when we make awards or grants in particular section m of the internal revenue code generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation over  paid to covered employees which are defined as our named executive officers other than the chief financial officer however qualifying performancebased compensation is not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met although deductibility is a factor that the committee takes into account in determining awards of cash bonuses and equity grant the committee may award compensation that is not deductible under section m when in the exercise of the committees judgment it would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders to do so    table of contents summary
