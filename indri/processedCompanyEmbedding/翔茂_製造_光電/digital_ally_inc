reblogsharetweetsharelenexa ksmarketwired  mar    digital ally inc  nasdaq  dgly  which develops manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement homeland security and commercial applications today announced its operating results for the quarter and full year ended december   an investor conference call is scheduled for  am edt tomorrow march   see details belowhighlights for year ended december   we expanded our addressable market outside of law enforcement with the award of several large orders involving our incar event recorder and body camera products to nonlaw enforcement customers during  these orders demonstrate the importance of our solution to meet customer demands and our flexibility to adapt our hardware and software to handle unique requirements for a variety of industries and applications we introduced several new cloudbased and other recurring service offerings to our product suite including our revamped vuvaultcom cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the fleetvu manager our driver management training and asset tracking cloud systems for nonlaw enforcement customers our fleetvu manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters such as speed hard braking geofencing and erratic turns all of which are automatically uploaded to fleetvumanagercom without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events these recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us service and other revenues increased  during  compared with  we recently released our new dvm hd incar video system which provides the first full hd quality incar video system available on the market the dvm hd is the new standard in high definition p incar video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point  during  we were awarded a contract for the sale of firstvu hd bodyworn cameras to a nonlaw enforcement international customer the threeyear supply contract includes our firstvu hd bodyworn cameras storage systems and an extended service agreement the revenue from the initial orders delivered in  exceeded  with additional service revenues of  expected for  through  our international revenues increased to  representing  of total revenues during the year ended december   compared with  representing  of total revenues during the year ended december   in december  we completed a private placement of  million in principal amount of  secured convertible debentures and warrants exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock at  per share to two institutional investors this private placement resulted in gross proceeds of  million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction which totaled  we are using the net proceeds for general working capital purposes and to continue to execute our business plan during  we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors taser international inc and enforcement video llc dba as watchguard video we have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented autoactivation feature embodied in our vulink product we believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the groundbreaking nature of our autoactivation patents and are demanding this technology we believe that taser and watchguard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions we will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that taser and watchguard have willfully infringed our patents further we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for bodyworn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future during  we encountered excessive rework costs for our products due to nonrecurring supply chain issues with certain of our contract manufacturers the supply chain issues have been corrected however the effects of these issues impacted our revenues and gross margins for  total revenue decreased by  to approximately  million in  compared with approximately  million in the year ended december   gross profit margin decreased to  of total revenue in  compared with  in  the company reported an operating loss of  for the full year of  compared with an operating loss of  in the previous year operating loss in the fourth quarter of  was  compared with  in the prioryear period a net loss of  or  per share was recorded in the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or  per share in  on a nongaap basis the company recorded an adjusted net loss of  or  per share in  compared with a nongaap adjusted net loss of  or  per share in the year ended december   management commentswe were disappointed to report revenues for the year ended  that decreased  from the year prior even though we saw an increase in our servicebased revenues in  stated stanton e ross chief executive officer of digital ally inc we are concentrating on expanding our recurring servicebased revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis we are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers if successful we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in  and beyond we are testing a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings including the longterm lease of our bodyworn andor incar audiovideo hardware together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material we believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers in particular our commercial and other nonlaw enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment data storage and management services we recently announced the launch of the dvm hd incar video system which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel the dvm hd system provides full p high definition video at a cost effective price point which is a competitive market advantage for usour international revenues increased to  in  compared to  during  and were aided by approximately  of revenue from the sale our firstvu hd body worn cameras storage systems and extended service agreement to a nonlaw enforcement international customer that will continue for three years this order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our firstvu hd body cameras globally across various industries and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement marketwe entered  with a strong balance sheet and liquidity which should be able to support a higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming added ross unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled  million at december   and we had approximately  million in net working capital available at the end of  including  million of accounts receivable and  million of inventory our goal is to reduce inventory levels during  to provide additional funding for operations concluded ross operating results for the year ended december   our total revenue decreased by  to approximately  million compared with revenue of approximately  million in the year ended december   we attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by tasers misleading press release regarding our patents the reexamination of our patent commenced by taser with the uspto and our product quality control issues with our firstvu hd product in addition we believe that taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper unethical and unfair competition we expect firstvu hd sales to recover during  as we prosecute the patent lawsuits against taser watchguard and others and resolve our product quality issues we believe the vulink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented autoactivation technologyinternational revenue increased to  in  versus  in  our  revenues were aided by approximately  of revenue generated by an order from a nonlaw enforcement international customer for our firstvu hd body worn cameras storage systems and extended service agreement gross profit declined  to  in  versus  in  our gross margin decline is commensurate with the  decline in revenues for the year ended december   and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to  from  for the year ended december   we believe that gross margins will improve in  because we have corrected the workmanship and other issues affecting our firstvu hd product during recent quarters including the pcb contamination issue addressed in the second and third quarters  our goal is to improve our margins to  over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products in particular the dvm dvm hd and firstvu hd as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial market penetration in  in addition as revenues increase from these products we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing

 to  last year compared with  a year earlier the increase in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to higher litigation expenses related to the utility taser and watchguard lawsuits

from utility taser watchguard their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate executive support and administrative staff payroll expenses increased to  in the most recent year compared

products for law enforcement homeland security and commercial applications today announced its operating results for the second quarter and first half of  an investor conference call is scheduled for  am edt on monday august   see details below to discuss these operating results and other topics of interesthighlights for quarter ended june   gross profit margin approximated  of total revenue in the second quarter of  compared with  in the prioryear quarter and  in the first quarter of  the reduction in gross profit margin relative to the prioryear quarter was primarily due to charges taken to correct our contract manufacturers workmanship issues that resulted in contamination of the printed circuit boards pcb for our firstvu hd product we became aware of these issues during second quarter  total revenue decreased by  to approximately  million in the second quarter of  compared with approximately  million in the quarter ended june   we attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by a competitors misleading press release regarding our patents combined with delayed firstvu hd sales while we resolved the pcb board contamination issues the company shipped four orders in excess of  each during the most recent quarter for a total of  million compared with seven individual orders exceeding  each in the yearearlier quarter for a total of  million our sales mix continues to migrate to our dvm incar video system and firstvu hd bodyworn camera which contributed  of total sales for the three months ended june   versus  for the corresponding period of the previous year the company reported an operating loss of  for the quarter ended june   compared with an operating loss of  in the three months ended june   a net loss of  or  per share was recorded in the second quarter of

quarter compared with a nongaap adjusted ebitda loss of  or  per share in the three months ended june   on may   digital ally filed suit against watchguard alleging patent infringement involving the companys autoactivation technology utilized in its vulink product management commentsour second quarter revenues were down from prioryear levels stated stanton e ross chief executive officer of digital ally inc we believe our second quarter  revenues were negatively impacted by the ongoing confusion caused by a competitors misleading press release regarding our patents additionally our firstvu hd sales were hindered by the pcb board contamination issues we expect firstvu hd sales to recover during the remainder of  as we resolve the pcb board contamination matter and we prosecute the patent lawsuits against our competitors the autoactivation technology embodied in our vulink product is becoming a standard requirement for agencies utilizing bodyworn cameras we are encouraged by the progress of litigation instituted against our competitors to protect our patented technologyour bodyworn camera has received much media attention in recent months consequently many law enforcement agencies both domestic and international are actively testing and evaluating the firstvu hd and we expect demand to accelerate during the balance of  we have dramatically increased our production and delivery capabilities relative to the firstvu hd bodyworn camera and we continue to develop other new products we believe a shift occurring in the buying pattern of our customers as our patented vulink ecosystem that provides officers with autoactivation of incar and body camera systems has generated significant interest among law enforcement agencies agencies are recognizing the importance and value of collecting video evidence of interactions between law enforcement and civilians from multiple perspectives and automatically activating the recordings in highstress situations as policy and proper funding fall into place we are optimistic these evaluation programs will continue to culminate in sales as the potential customers evaluate our bodyworn and incar video camera solutionsthe companys gross margin decreased to  of revenue in the second quarter of  from  in the first quarter  this gross margin decline was primarily attributable to workmanship issues we became aware of in the second quarter  on the printed circuit boards used in our firstvu hd product the workmanship problems resulted in a higher than normal rate of contaminated pcb boards in our finished goods inventory as well as deployed units in the field that had to be replaced a contract manufacturer did not follow the companys specifications regarding the flux used in the soldering process for certain of the components utilized in the pcb board assemblies and the vendor is correcting its quality control procedures to address this issue we believe the firstvu hd connector upgrade program that effected previous quarters gross margins has been completed we have accrued the estimated costs associated with the workmanship issues on pcb boards that resulted in higher failure rates in the second quarter  and charged them to cost of sales as of june   therefore we believe that gross margins should return to more normal levels in future quarters we entered  with a stronger balance sheet and greater liquidity which should support a significantly higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming added ross unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled  million and we were debtfree at june   we had approximately  million in net working capital available at such date including  million of accounts receivable and  million of inventory we will work to continue reducing inventory levels during the balance of  to provide additional funding for operations concluded rossread moresecond quarter operating resultsfor the three months ended june   the companys revenue decreased  to approximately  million compared with revenue of approximately  million in the three months ended june   we attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by a competitors misleading press release regarding our patents combined with delayed firstvu hd sales while we resolve the pcb board contamination issues we expect firstvu hd sales to recover during the remainder of  as we resolve the pcb board contamination matter and prosecute the patent lawsuits against our competitors we believe the vulink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented autoactivation technology we believe our autoactivation technology is becoming a standard feature for agencies utilizing bodyworn camerasdigital ally shipped four orders in excess of  each during the most recent quarter which generated combined revenue of approximately  million during the second quarter of  the company shipped seven orders valued individually at greater than  which generated combined revenue of approximately  milliongross profit decreased  to   of revenue in the most recent quarter versus   of revenue in the prioryear quarter and   of revenue in the first quarter of  the reduction in gross profit margin relative to the prioryear quarter was primarily due to workmanship issues on pcb boards for our firstvu hd product that we became aware of during second quarter  the workmanship issues resulted in a higher than normal rate of contaminated pcb boards in our finished goods inventory as well as deployed units in the field the company incurred total charges to cost of sales approximating  during the three months ended june   related to this issue these charges result from the disassembly of the firstvu hd inspection of all pcb boards and replacement of pcb boards exhibiting contamination issues we are requesting and receiving deployed units for disassembly and inspection in order to identify contaminated pcb boards for replacement purposes this process was not complete as of june   therefore we have increased our warranty reserves to accommodate such future costs although there is no assurance that we have identified the complete population of potentially contaminated pcb boards and estimated cost to complete the process we will negotiate with the contract manufacturer responsible for the workmanship issues for reimbursement of some portion of the costs however it is too early to estimate the potential recovery if any from the ultimate resolution of this matter additionally we scrapped approximately  of cable assemblies and older versions of our products in the second quarter  which also increased our cost of revenues the companys goal is to improve gross margins to  of revenue over the longer term based on the expected margins of its newer products in particular the dvm and firstvu hd if they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and production of commercial products increases in addition as revenue from these products increases the company will seek to further improve gross margins through economies of scale and more efficient utilization of fixed manufacturing overhead components we plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production quantity purchases and more effective purchasing
