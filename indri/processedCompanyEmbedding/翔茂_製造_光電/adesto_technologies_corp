introduces new solution to enable smart home products jul   adesto technologies announced the dataflashl series a new family of memory products targeting a variety of smart home applications designed for low power operation and higher system efficiency dataflashl products can help optimize embedded systems in wireless edge devices the dataflashl atpe series offers a range of powersaving features including wide operating voltage range vcc and “ultradeep power down” mode with a vcc range of v to v the dataflashl family uses less power during active modes and offers designers the ability to operate the system in lower voltages  maximizing battery life and minimizing the need for onboard capacitors home control systems and other wireless devices using dataflashl can operate from unregulated battery supplies and may not require low drop out or boost regulators to manage the power supply rail during a powerfailure the embedded ultradeep power down mode allows the device to function with a standby current of less than  nanoamps far lower than competitive offerings and an important feature for batteryoperated devices to improve system efficiency the new products include a page erase feature and builtin intelligence to automatically manage internal programming and erase tasks reducing cpu overhead by offloading memory management tasks the product family also features comprehensive security and unique identification features to protect stored data and prevent outside tampering additionally the new dataflashl is a pin compatible alternative to micron’s mpe memory
