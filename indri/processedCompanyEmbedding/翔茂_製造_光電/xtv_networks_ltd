that’s where the big tech ideas – and the money to fund them – are to be found and xtv is his resultour track recordregular readers of our sites will be familiar with our longstanding interest in high potential tech stocksdid you see our next tech stock article on ziptel asxzip zip has been up as high as  since we first released our articlethe past performance of this product is not and should not be taken as an indication of future performance caution should be exercised in assessing past performance this product like all other financial products is subject to market forces and unpredictable events that may adversely affect future performancextv in the director’s chairin one instantaneous feed an xtv network can show whatever their client likes – from especially crafted segments to selections from youtube twitter news services weather accounts and much more all of it revolved around the clients’ needsxtv’s connected tv platform allows every stream of information a company creates to be seamlessly put together and displayed as an online tv network – content ready to be consumed by the billions of people connected to the internetit’s already delivered tv networks for these big namesin fact xtv has already created  online tv networks and  channels with  videos and  feedsthe company’s goal now is to monetise its product by signing on new clientsthe basic idea is that a company’s traditional text based website is replaced or augmented with an interactive online tv channel this has moving pictures and text just like a regular tv channel only it’s online – so the user drives the experiencethe online tv channel can be displayed at corporate hq or at a function on a regular tv – or on a smart phone tablet laptop wherevertake the new york times channel xtv has developedthe picture is from a video preview of a new hollywood movie embedded from youtube the bottom of the screen has a stocks ticker showing real time information and at the bottom right you can monitor the weatherthis is just one page of xtv’s new york times offering the newspaper’s full range of content is available as well as audio and video media to enhance the text articlesthis is a complete media experience provided by xtvso that’s the pointy end – what it looks like but what’s behind the scenesthere are several layers to xtv’s business model and the way it goes about creating these networks so let’s break them downfirst up creating the tv channels a company that signs up to xtv can tailor the content to its needs – marketing goals sales etcbig companies like microsoft have loads of inhouse content like adverts presentations and graphics ready to go and coming down the pipeline so xtv helps them assemble it all into an attractive easy to navigate online experience that fits in with the company’s marketing goalsbut for smaller and medium sized companies xtv can step in and deliver additional services to make the tv channels tip topxtv can supply a newsreader to deliver a news service telling of the latest developments and achievements of the company as well as presenting industry newspremium branded content can be assembled from national news sports entertainment and politics – and combined with in house material from a company to make a × news networkboth services can transform a company’s communication platform from a text based website and some press releases to slick online video that looks great and delivers a strong messagethe next step is for xtv to get the channel out there and it has three ways to do thatthe set top box sold by xtv can connect to any local network via ethernet cable or wireless signal and display the online tv channel on a laptop smart phone smart tv – all of it cloud based and interactivethis bit of kit can be used to display the online tv channel at a corporate function in the lobby of the office or at sales meetingthe video inbox developed by xtv is a marketing tool that allows companies with an online tv channel to push new content to their subscribers it can send push notifications of new content to android and ios smart phones and presents a company’s online content in a single online interactive tv destinationfinally the auto start tv service displays the online tv network without sound as well as a qr code that can be read by a smart phone when that’s picked up the channel’s sound turns on and interaction can begin – a method of pulling in interested usersfrom this infrastructure base xtv gives its clients many optionsthey can build one network or ten and they run automatically the networks can be split into channels dealing with different aspects of the business or the market it’s operating in and all of it can be tailored to suit a marketing plan with pushes going out to the full range of interactive mobile devicesthe reason video is so powerful is that people like watching it – and when you have captured eyeballs you can present marketing and sales messagesthis could be a very valuable service and as you’re about to see xtv is setting about making it pay…our track recordsince the next tech stock article on connexion media asxcxz tiny asx company to supply tech to gm

two recent m deals over  years with innovatv health and ust global may just be the beginning for xtvby locking in its first deal with innovatv health in the multibillion health care industry the entire healthcare vertical has been opened to the benefits on xtv’s servicesthis deal arose via the partnership with ustglobal – a major investor in xtv who will be rolling out xtv’s services to engage better with their employees – and pay xtv m to do itwe would expect a few more deals to arise via the xtv – ustglobal partnership shortlywith technology scalable across all industry sectors xtv has also established partnerships with these leading global brandsxtv has another  opportunities in the sales pipeline with more companies and brands includingaside from the us xtv is also looking toward the east…xtv’s china strategythe other big development for xtv is its move into china after a shenzhenbased tech incubator named inno valley invested  as an equity partnerxtv is planning to set
