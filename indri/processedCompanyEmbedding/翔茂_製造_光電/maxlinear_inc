maxlinear aligns with umc for production of worlds smallest silicon tuner device press center press releases photo gallery literatures press releases maxlinear aligns with umc for production of worlds smallest silicon tuner device mxl ic fabricated on umcs cmos process   hsinchu taiwan and carlsbad calif – july    umc nyse umc twse  and maxlinear inc a technology leader at the forefront of developing fully integrated broadband radio frequency rf systemsonachip for worldwide television standards today announced that maxlinear produced its breakthrough silicon tuner ic the mxl on umcs cmos process the mxl is the worlds smallest silicon tuner produced to date for mobile tv applications such as digital tv isdbt on cell phones this successful cooperation between umc and maxlinear has resulted in a technology that is poised to provide consumers with highquality digital tv on mobile applications without interfering with the size power or performance of end appliances said henry liu senior vice president of umcs new business development division our most recent fabrication alliance with maxlinear follows a series of other similar successful product developments for them including maxlinears silicon tuner for fixed and portable television applications that is currently in volume production at umc we are very excited about our cooperation with umc as we were able to produce the mxlon cmos rather than in sige an industry breakthrough noted kishore seendripu maxlinears ceo and president umc has continued to show us over and over again that it has the process technology the people and the support to help us deliver leading products to market we are looking forward to continuing our collaboration as we head toward volume production of the mxl and toward cooperating on a
