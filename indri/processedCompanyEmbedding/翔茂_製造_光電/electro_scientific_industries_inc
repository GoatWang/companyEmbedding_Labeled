in the unincorporated cedar mill area north of beaverton usa it is a developer and supplier of photonic and laser systems for microelectronics manufacturers founded in  it is the oldest hightech company in oregon along with tektronix and later intel it has spawned numerous technologybased companies in the portland area an area known as the silicon forest contents  history  annexation fight  operations  products  see also  references  external links historyedit framed photograph of douglas c strain on the wall of the science center named after him at pacific university esi was founded in  as brown engineering later becoming brown electromeasurement corporation beco in  becos douglas c strain and three other investors bought out strains partners at brown and formed a new company electromeasurements inc which used the brand name esi in marketing the acronym stood for excellent scientific instruments but the companys name remained electro measurements inc until  when it was changed to esi inc and finally in  to electro scientific industries inc esi prior to about  the company was usually referred to as having been founded in  douglas strain was the companys ceo and board chairman from  until  and remained on the board continuing as chairman until  then vice chairman until fully retiring in  in the s the companys specialty was the manufacture of highprecision resistance measuring instruments and related products in  esi began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits and soon became a leader in this field esis headquarters campus building  all facilities were located at se rd  stark in portland until  when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on macadam avenue in south portland was opened the new plant was destroyed by fire in  and had to be rebuilt in  esi announced plans to create a new development called sunset science park to be built in the cedar mill area of unincorporated washington county oregon designed to attract other technology companies with esi as an anchor the company moved its headquarters to the sunset science park location in  and the manufacturing facilities followed in  vacating the macadam avenue site the complex on nw science park drive which remains esis headquarters today has a portland mailing address but is not in the city of portland proper it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of beaverton esi became a publicly traded company in  the company opened its first foreign sales office in  in munich germany and later opened offices in several countries in southeast asia the company now has offices for direct sales in several european countries as well several small companies were acquired by esi in the late s including dynamotion corp of california in  chip star inc california in  applied intelligent systems inc aisi michigan in  and testec corp arizona in  a new manufacturing facility was opened in klamath falls oregon in early  the company acquired californiabased new wave research inc in  at the beginning of  electro scientific had around  employees about half of whom were located in oregon edward c grady was named as the president and ceo of esi in february  the company acquired fiber laser manufacturer eolite systems in june  the semiconductor systems business from gsi group in may  and chinese laser firm wuhan topwin optoelectronics technology co in january  in august  the company announced that michael burger formerly ceo of cascade microtech would succeed edward grady as ceo effective october   annexation fightedit in  esi joined columbia sportswear tektronix and other washington county companies in an effort led by nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of islands of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city the nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of beaverton in  under which the city had added more than  acres  km of unincorporated land including the headquarters of leupold  stevens located almost adjacent to esi but on the opposite side of the sunset highway freeway although the headquarters of esi and columbia are not on islands surrounded by beaverton both directly abut the city boundary and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the citys annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island the  oregon legislature enacted a law prohibiting beaverton from any forced islandtype annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning beaverton from forcibly annexing any of electro scientific industries property—whether an island or not—for at least  years operationsedit esi manufactures a variety of laserbased processing and micromanufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the

properly lastly we produce systems that use photonic technology to perform precision inspection for quality control and defect identification industry overview the microelectronics and semiconductor industries continue to be driven by demand for advanced features and improved functionality in increasingly smaller and smarter consumer devices the technologies for consumer electronic devices such as smart phones tablets personal computers mobile computing devices video game systems and highdefinition televisions have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that offer more functionality in smaller packages in addition semiconductor and other advanced technologies are being used in a broadening set of markets and applications including automotive aerospace medical security and general lighting these dynamics in turn are driving the need for faster smaller more complex less expensive and higherquality electronic devices and components to achieve these improvements component and other device manufacturers are increasing the circuit and feature densities in these devices and investing in new technologies for example smaller and lighter semiconductor devices are driving the need to shrink the physical dimensions of the semiconductor packaging and the high density interconnect hdi circuit board on which they are mounted higher operating speeds of computers and communication products require more input and output channels within packages and between the packages and the hdi circuit board these trends require smaller more accurate and precisely tapered or shaped holes known as vias to create connections between layers and interconnecting devices the continual trend toward smaller and smarter devices requires the use of an increasing amount of flexible interconnect material between pcbs and other components these flexible circuits require the smallest and most accurate vias to create the connections between these devices in addition the ability to shrink the actual dimensions of a device is becoming increasingly more difficult and producers are investing in new technologies such as stacking thin silicon wafers to create advanced three dimensional d chip packages we believe this trend may drive additional applications for laser processing including scribing and dicing of ultrathin wafers drilling of through silicon vias tsv and scribing of next generation thin films smaller and more complex devices also require more capacitance to be designed into the circuit this has resulted in an increase in the use of smaller highercapacitance passive components such as mlccs in calendar year  estimated production of mlccs was nearly  trillion units these mlccs must be tested electrically and optically to characterize  table of contents performance and ensure reliability automated equipment to test these mlccs in the manufacturing environment like our high capacitance tester can test and sort up to one million parts per hour on parts with dimensions as small as  by  millimeters a significant portion of our business is derived from specialized microfabrication applications any material that can be cut drilled marked or joined using a mechanical process can be microfabricated with greater precision and accuracy using a laserbased solution as consumer electronics and other products or devices become more compact mechanical processes will not be able to meet the stringent specifications demanded by producers we believe the capabilities of laserbased solutions for microfabrication will enable our customers to continue to move beyond the limitations of mechanical processes and generate significant growth for us in the future our solutions we believe our products address the needs of

these materials and components are being adopted in electronic devices sensors display and other technologies ubiquitously across many markets and applications including automotive aerospace medical communications appliances security general lighting energy and entertainment our strategy is to expand the number of applications we address in the areas of machining both the devices themselves and the components within them for example in  we introduced new capabilities for inline inspection of parts with realtime tailored laser machining ultrafast laser scribing of thin films on semiconductor wafers and singulation of next generation strengthened cover glass for touch panel displays we believe growth from consumer electronics applications will be driven by overall growth in the market for these devices new technologies and expanding our addressable applications identify and capitalize on broader laser machining applications laser microfabrication is a large and growing market and applications for its use extend far beyond the consumer electronics industry advancing technologies in products that serve the medical military automotive and security markets for example are creating the need for laser machining in the manufacture of devices and components our strategy is to leverage  table of contents our laser technology and understanding to address new applications in new industries which esi has traditionally not served in the past adding capability and scale to our sales channel will be a key component to successfully implementing this strategy leverage proprietary laser technology to create competitive advantage esi has been a pioneer in lasermaterial interaction and has developed deep expertise in the use of multiple types of laser technology to develop customer solutions over the last three years we have invested in proprietary laser technology through the acquisitions of pyrophotonics lasers inc eolite systems and the semiconductor systems business of gsi group inc these acquisitions combined with internally developed capability provide us with access to tailored pulse fiber technology high power uv nanosecond and low cost picosecond fiber lasers with a unique scalable architecture our strategy is to utilize these technologies to enable differentiated capability with our systems lower cost and generate incremental revenue for the company strengthen marketing capability and broaden customer focus the company’s close collaboration with key customers who are leaders in their respective industries has enabled esi to develop worldclass technologies that meet the emerging needs of these demanding customers our strategy is to modify our approach to product development so we can meet the needs of entire market segments as opposed to key customers only we believe this new approach will enable our products to serve the needs of a far larger portion of the laser microfabrication market we plan to strengthen our marketing capability and channel reach through external hiring employee training and development increased localization and use of channel partners leverage flexible platforms and technology for cost of ownership and time to market advantage our key technological capabilities include lasermaterial interaction laser beam positioning optics and illumination highspeed motion control systems small parts

ceramics we also offer laser ablation systems that ablate material for identification and analysis applications including forensics mineral analysis and research during  the company entered the glass cutting market for nextgeneration strengthened glass and shipped two systems for pilot production our incremental revenue opportunity in this emerging market will be paced by the rate of adoption of the new glass and the one glass solution manufacturing process by touch panel manufacturers in june  we acquired eolite systems a designer and manufacturer of unique highpower fiber lasers in pessac france the acquisition of eolite provides us access to high power uv nanosecond and low cost picosecond fiber lasers with a  table of contents unique scalable architecture we believe these lasers can be used internally in a variety of laser microfabrication applications as well as provide potential additional commercial revenue for the company with the ability to customize lasers to specific customer applications with differentiated capability and lower cost semiconductor group sg our semiconductor group products address multiple applications that utilize laser energy to process materials on waferbased substrates and semiconductor devices and packages applications include processing of silicon wafers mixed signal devices hybrid circuits sensors and resistors semiconductor systems in may  we acquired the assets of the semiconductor systems business from gsi group inc these products include industry leading wafer marking equipment wafer and circuit trim tools and lcd repair tools wafer marking equipment is used for serialization and wafer identification by both manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and within semiconductor fabs wafer and circuit trim tools are laser systems that adjust the electrical performance of semiconductor devices or hybrid circuits by removing a precise amount of material from one or more circuit components d semiconductor wafer processing the advent of d chip packaging technologies is driving the need for silicon wafers to become thinner in order to allow for stacking of wafers within the same packaging geometry as wafers become thinner they become more challenging to cut into discrete chips using traditional mechanical saws our model  uses a laser to dice ultrathin silicon wafers those with a thickness of  microns or below and to singulate interposers in addition this platform can be used to scribe next generation thin film materials that lend themselves to laser processing as d technologies are developed we believe the use of advanced laser technology will become increasingly important to productivity and performance lcd repair our laser lcd repair systems are critical to improving yields in the manufacture of flat panel displays during production individual pixels of a display may develop electrical defects that result in no light emission or the emission of only a steady white light to correct these defects flat panel display producers employ a laser repair process to isolate the electrical defects during production by cutting the inputs to the pixel our laser systems are primarily sold to the manufacturers of lcd repair tools as a key component of their products components group cg we design and manufacture products that combine highspeed small parts handling technology with realtime control systems to provide highly automated costeffective inspection solutions for manufacturers of mlccs and other passive components such as capacitor arrays inductors resistors varistors and hybrid circuits these components produced in quantities of trillions of units per year process analog digital and highfrequency signals and are used extensively in nearly all electronic products our mlcc test systems employ highspeed handling and positioning techniques to precisely load test and sort mlccs based on their electrical energy storage capacity or capacitance and their electrical energy leakage or dissipation factor our xx series is the most productive tester in the market today our latest  model enables high speed testing of the industry’s smallest metric  capacitors used primarily in advanced

cyclical and highly competitive the principal competitive factors in our markets are total cost of ownership product performance ease of use reliability service technical support product roadmap price proprietary technology manufacturing responsiveness and relationships with customers we believe that our products compete favorably with respect to these factors some of our competitors have greater financial engineering and manufacturing resources and larger distribution networks than we do some of our customers develop or have the ability to develop manufacturing equipment similar to our products competition in our markets may intensify and our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by competitors or customers or changes in electronic device processing technology our interconnect  microfabrication group competes with laser systems provided by hitachi via mechanics ltd eo technics co ltd lpkf laser  electronics ag mitsubishi electric corporation orbotech ltd innolas systems gmbh and several chinese and korean companies who compete within their local markets the principal competitors for our semiconductor group are disco corporation and laser solutions inc lcd repair competitors include quantel usa inc and hoya corporation for the components group our competitors include humo laboratory ltd as well as component manufacturers that develop systems for internal use manufacturing and supply our primary production facilities are located in singapore portland oregon chelmsford massachusetts and klamath falls oregon our singapore facility is our primary systems manufacturing facility and manufactures certain img sg cg and laser ablation products the portland facility primarily provides advanced manufacturing and prototype capability the chelmsford facility manufactures our semiconductor systems business wafer trim and circuit trim products the klamath falls facility manufactures cg consumable products our singapore and chelmsford operations are located in leased facilities as we continue our efforts to streamline the organization and improve efficiencies we expect a growing percentage of final systems will be shipped from singapore  table of contents we use qualified manufacturers to supply many components and subsystem modules for our products our systems use highperformance computers peripherals lasers and other components from various suppliers some of the components we use are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers an interruption in the supply of a particular component would have a temporary adverse impact on us we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good patents and other intellectual property we have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions relating to new products and improvements that are discovered or developed as part of our ongoing research development and manufacturing activities we owned  united states patents and  patents issued outside of the united states as of march    additionally as of march    we had  patent applications pending in the united states and  patent applications pending outside of the united states although our patents are important we believe that the competitiveness of our products also depends on the technical competence and innovation of our employees we rely on copyright protection for our proprietary software we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets employees as of march    we employed  people of whom  were permanent and  were temporary many of our employees are highly skilled and our success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees who are in great demand we have never had a work stoppage or strike and no employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good environmental compliance during fiscal  we retained iso  certification via surveillance assessment for our environmental management system for our portland oregon operations we do not expect compliance with international federal state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted related to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position item a risk factors the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact including without limitation statements containing the words “believes” “expects” and similar words constitute forwardlooking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties from time to time we may make other forwardlooking statements investors are cautioned that such forwardlooking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may differ materially the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements should be considered in light of these factors factors that may result in such variances include but are not limited to the following risks related to our competition and customers volatility of our customers’ industries our business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of microelectronics semiconductors computers wireless communications and other electronic products the capital equipment market for microelectronics semiconductor and consumer electronics manufacturers has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand due to a number of factors including capacity utilization timing of customers’ new product introductions and demand for their products inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital the timing severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult or impossible to predict as a result business levels can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year significant volatility in investment cycles in the market for microelectronics and semiconductors used in electronic devices or in the market for consumer electronics reduce demand for our products and may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example starting in the second half of fiscal  we experienced the negative impact of an uncertain economic environment slower market growth and overcapacity in several of our markets which resulted in overall lower order and revenue levels as a result of these circumstances our total order volume declined in  compared to  and continued to decline in  the degree of the impact of any downturn on our business depends on a number of factors including the strength of the global and united states economies the overall level of demand for consumer electronics products the stability of global financial systems and the overall health of the microelectronics semiconductor and consumer electronics industries  table of contents highly competitive markets we face substantial competition from established competitors throughout the world some of which have greater financial engineering manufacturing and marketing resources than we do those competitors with greater resources may in addition to other things be able to better withstand periodic downturns compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology or more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products that compete with the products we manufacture and market new companies may enter the markets in which we compete or industry consolidation may occur further increasing competition in those markets we have also experienced new entrants to our markets offering aggressive price and payments terms in an attempt to gain market share some competitors particularly in china also develop low cost products employing processes or technology developed by us we believe that to be competitive we must continue to expend significant financial resources in order to among other things invest in new product development and enhancements we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and increased competition may result in price reductions reduced profit margins and loss of market share increased price pressure we have experienced and continue to experience pricing pressure in the sale of our products from both competitors and customers pricing pressures typically have become more intense during cyclical downturns when competitors seek to maintain or increase market share reduce inventory or introduce more technologically advanced products or lower cost products in addition we may agree to pricing concessions or extended payment terms with our customers in connection with volume orders or to improve cost of ownership in highly competitive applications our business financial condition margins or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by competitive pressure and intense pricebased competition revenues are largely dependent on few customers we depend on a few significant customers for a large portion of our revenues in   our top ten customers accounted for approximately  of total net sales with one customer apple inc and its affiliates accounting for approximately  of total net sales we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues consolidation between customers changes in technologies or solutions used by customers changes in products manufactured by customers or in enduser demand for those products selection of suppliers other than us customer bankruptcies or customer departures from their respective industries all may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue and reduced demand from any single major customer also business levels with several of our top customers are dependent on our winning new designs and features each product cycle and there is no guarantee of future business based on past design wins furthermore none of our customers have any longterm obligation to continue to buy our products or services and may therefore delay reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time the cancellation reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter for example revenues from apple inc decreased from  million or  of revenue in  to  million or  of revenue in  if we were to lose any of our significant customers or suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders revenue could decline and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected revenues are largely based on the sale of a small number of product units we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of products accordingly our revenues margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors in addition to those described above including • changes in the timing of orders and terms or acceptance of product shipments by our customers • changes in the mix of products and services that we sell • timing and market acceptance of our new product introductions and • delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers as a result of these risks we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance risks related to our supply chain and production variability of production capacity  table of contents to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries we serve we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity during periods of decreasing demand for our products we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our supply chain our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in nextgeneration product technology and to support and service our products conversely when upturns occur in the markets we serve we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our manufacturing capacity or procuring sufficient materials to meet sudden increases in customer demand that could result in the loss of business to our competitors and harm to our relationships with our customers if we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment our business financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected reliance on critical suppliers we use a wide range of components from numerous suppliers in the manufacture of our products including custom electronic laser optical and mechanical components we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers some key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term in addition some of the lasers we use in our products are difficult to manufacture and as a result we may not receive an adequate supply of lasers in a timely fashion to fill orders operations at our suppliers’ facilities are subject to disruption or discontinuation for a variety of reasons including changes in business relationships competitive factors financial difficulties work stoppages fire natural disasters or other causes any such disruption or discontinuation to our suppliers’ operations could interrupt or reduce our manufacturing activities and delay delivery of our products any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in addition when markets recover from economic downturns there is a heightened risk that one or more of our suppliers may not be able to meet our increased demand requirements adversely impacting our ability to fulfill orders and win business with our customers utilization of contract manufacturers we have arrangements with contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing of certain of our products or product subcomponents any significant interruption in our contract manufacturers’ ability to provide manufacturing services to us as a result of contractual disputes with us or another party labor disruptions financial difficulties natural disasters delay or interruption in the receipt of inventory customer prioritization or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed deliveries for certain of our products any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations charges for excess or obsolete inventory one factor on which we compete is the ability to ship products on schedules required by customers in order to facilitate timely shipping management forecasts demand both in type and amount of products and these forecasts are used to determine inventory to be purchased we also order materials based on our technology roadmap which represents management’s assessment of technology that will be utilized in new products that we develop certain types of inventory including lasers and optical equipment are particularly expensive and may only be used in the production of a single type of product if actual demand is lower than forecast with respect to the type or amount of products actually ordered or both our inventory levels may increase as a result there is a risk that we may have to incur material accounting charges for excess and obsolete inventory if inventory cannot be used which would negatively affect our financial results also if we alter our technology or product development strategy we may have inventory that may not be usable under the new strategy which may also result in material accounting charges for example during  we recorded  million of charges in cost of sales for inventory writtenoff associated with discontinued products uncertainties resulting from conflict minerals regulation on august   the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies filing public reports the new rule requires a disclosure report to be filed annually with the sec and this report will require companies to perform due diligence disclose and report whether such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tantalum tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our  table of contents products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities since our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so risks related to our organization operating a global business international shipments accounted for  of net sales in   with  of our net shipments to customers in asia we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future we also have significant foreign operations including manufacturing facilities in singapore research and development facilities in canada france and taiwan and sales and service offices in various countries under our globalization strategy we intend to increase our foreign operations in the future our nonus sales purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad many of which are outside our control including the following • periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions • price and currency exchange controls • fluctuation in the relative values of currencies • difficulty in repatriating money whether as a result of tax laws or otherwise • difficulties protecting intellectual property • compliance with labor laws and other laws governing employees • local labor disputes • shipping delays and disruptions • unexpected changes in trading policies regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers and • difficulties in managing a global enterprise including staffing collecting accounts receivable and managing suppliers distributors and representatives our business and operating results could also be impacted directly or indirectly by natural disasters outbreaks of infectious disease military action international conflicts terrorist activities civil unrest and associated political instability many of our facilities including our portland oregon headquarters are in areas with known earthquake risk some of these events or circumstances may also result in heightened security concerns with respect to domestic and international travel and commerce which may further affect our business and operating results in particular due to these uncertainties we are subject to the following additional risks • future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of nonus engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new nonus employees in such facilities • more frequent instances of shipping delays • demand for our products may not increase or may decrease and • our customers or suppliers may experience financial difficulties or cease operations implementation and modification of globalization strategy we are continuing to implement and expand our globalization strategy in which we are moving certain operational resources and capabilities to different countries in asia to be closer to many of our significant customers to reduce costs and to develop low cost followon solutions to our products we believe this strategy will enhance customer relationships improve our responsiveness reduce our manufacturing costs for certain products and allow us to compete with low cost competitors who develop systems employing processes developed by us we opened a manufacturing facility in singapore in the fourth quarter of  which manufactures certain img sg cg and laser ablation products and is now our primary system manufacturing facility our globalization strategy is subject to a variety of complexities and risks many of which may divert a substantial amount of management’s time these risks include • challenges in designing facilities that can be scaled for future expansion replicating current processes and bringing new facilities up to full operation • unpredictable costs redundancy costs and cost overruns for developing facilities and acquiring equipment • building local management teams technical personnel and other staff for functions that we have not previously conducted outside of the united states • technical obstacles such as poor production or process yield and loss of quality control during the ramp of a new facility • requalifications and other procedures that may be required by our customers • our ability to bring up local suppliers to meet our quality and cycletime needs  table of contents • our ability to reduce costs in the united states as we add costs elsewhere • rapidly changing business conditions that may require plans to be changed or abandoned before they are fully implemented and • challenges posed by distance and by differences in language and culture these and other factors could delay the continuing development expansion and implementation of our strategy as well as impair our gross margins delay shipments and deliveries cause us to lose sales require us to write off investments already made damage our reputation and harm our business financial condition and results of operations if we decide to change our globalization strategy we may incur charges for certain costs incurred acquisitions and divestitures we may make acquisitions of or significant investments in other businesses with complementary products services or technologies such as our june  acquisition of eolite systems and may  acquisition of the semiconductor systems business from gsi group inc acquisitions involve numerous risks many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control including • difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of personnel operations technologies and products of the acquired businesses • implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp system into the acquired company’s operations • diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters • the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company • lack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition • acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worsethanexpected performance by the acquired company • difficulties establishing satisfactory internal controls at the acquired company • risks and uncertainties relating to the performance of the combined company following the transaction and • acquiring unanticipated liabilities for which we will not be indemnified furthermore the accounting for an acquisition could result in significant charges resulting from amortization or writeoff of intangible assets we acquire our inability to effectively manage these risks could result in our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition on a timely basis or at all and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition all acquisition transaction costs must be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the means by which we finance an acquisition may also significantly affect our business or the value of the shares of our common stock if we issue common stock to pay for an acquisition the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders will be diluted and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be reduced if we use cash on hand to pay for an acquisition the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes if we borrow funds in connection with an acquisition we would be required to use cash to service the debt and to comply with financial and other covenants we may from time to time also make strategic investments in development stage companies investments in development stage companies are subject to a high degree of risk we could lose all or a portion of our investment in any such company or could be required to recognize an impairment charge with respect to our investment for example in  we recognized a  million impairment with respect to our investment in omniguide inc based upon a reduction in the companys estimated valuation hiring and retention of personnel our continued success depends in part upon the services of our key managerial financial and technical personnel the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract assimilate and retain qualified personnel could result in the loss of customers inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we have previously had to and may in the future have to impose salary reductions on employees during economic downturns in an effort to maintain our financial position on several occasions in recent years executives and other employees have received limited or no annual bonuses due to our financial performance relative to the performance parameters in our annual bonus plans these events may have an adverse effect on employee loyalty and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key personnel competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we compete is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel we may incur significant costs in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel which could affect our financial position and results of operations  table of contents our ability to retain key personnel and execute our strategy may also be adversely affected by the transition to a new ceo in february  edward c grady became our president and chief executive officer replacing nicholas konidaris who held the position since  risks related to technology markets characterized by rapid technological change the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation frequent new product introductions changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards our future performance will depend on the successful development introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes and the requirements of current and potential customers the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify develop manufacture market or support new or enhanced products successfully if at all or on a timely basis the introduction by us or by our competitors of new or enhanced products or alternative technologies may cause our customers to defer change or cancel orders for our existing products or cease purchasing our products altogether further we cannot assure that our new products will gain timely market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors technology changes or emerging industry standards if we are unable to develop new or enhanced products to address product or technology changes or new industry standards on a timely basis or at all or if our new or enhanced products are not accepted by the market or if our customers adopt alternative technologies our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected need to invest in research and development our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development our products could become less attractive to our current and potential customers or obsolete and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales decline in addition as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation our operating costs may increase in the future and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales need to broaden our marketing and channel capability the laser microfabrication industry is comprised of broad set of markets and applications and represents significant opportunities for growth in order to access these opportunities we need to broaden our approach from customer centric to being market based this will require the hiring development and application of new marketing capability and channel access our ability to successfully access and compete in these broader markets will be partially dependent on our development of these new skills and capabilities our inability to do so would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability products are highly complex our products are highly complex and our extensive product development manufacturing and testing processes may not be adequate to detect all defects errors failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us as a result we may have to replace certain components or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products after they are shipped the occurrence of any defects errors failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders product returns diversion of our resources legal actions by our customers and other losses to us or to our customers these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products loss of sales and increased expenses and warranty costs which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability risks related to legal matters protection of proprietary rights – generally our success depends significantly upon the protection of our proprietary rights we attempt to protect our proprietary rights through patents copyrights trademarks maintenance of trade secrets and other measures including entering into confidentiality agreements we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and to defend our intellectual property rights we rely upon the laws of the united states and foreign countries where we develop manufacture or sell our products to  table of contents protect our proprietary rights we may not be successful in protecting these proprietary rights these rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect or other parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent these rights protection of proprietary rights – foreign jurisdictions our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states many united states companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries which could result in reduced sales and gross margins intellectual property infringement claims several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products while we attempt in our designs to avoid patent infringement from time to time we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products as used by our customers may be infringing one or more of these patents competitors or others have in the past and may in the future assert infringement claims against our customers or us with respect to current or future products or uses and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur if we become subject to infringement claims we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position these licenses however may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we also defend our patent and intellectual property portfolio we initiated litigation in  against humo laboratory ltd in japan and against eo technics co ltd in south korea in may  for infringement of key patents there is no assurance that this litigation will be successful and we may incur significant legal fees to prosecute these claims tax audits and changes in tax law we are periodically under audit by united states and foreign tax authorities and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income and other tax liabilities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and the impact of changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws could result in material differences from what is reflected in historical income tax accruals if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an examination a material effect on our financial results tax positions or cash flows could occur in the period or periods in which the determination is made we currently benefit from a tax incentive program in singapore pursuant to which we pay no singapore income tax with respect to our manufacturing income the incentive commenced on july   and will continue through june   assuming we are able to satisfy applicable requirements the company has failed to meet certain of the associated requirements in the past however has obtained a waiver for certain periods there is no assurance we will be able to satisfy these requirements and failure to meet such requirements may lead to reduction in future or past tax benefits the company believes that it is more likely than not the company will continue to receive the associated tax incentives and there is no indication that past benefits received would be rescinded legal proceedings from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings including breach of contract claims and claims that involve possible infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties or by third parties it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of litigation matters and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management’s attention which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further adverse determinations in such litigation could result in loss of our property rights subject us to significant liabilities require us to seek licenses from others or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows provisions restricting our acquisition our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors our board of directors has also adopted a shareholder rights plan or “poison  table of contents pill” which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer in addition the oregon control share act and the oregon business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of our board of directors may deter efforts to obtain control of us and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our shareholders risks related to financial matters unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers which could result in lower net sales by us to those customers alternatively if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition some of our foreign sales are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations from time to time we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of accounts receivable primarily denominated in euros and other currencies however we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks which could adversely affect our results of operations fluctuations in effective tax rate as a global company we are subject to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation from one period to the next because the income tax rates for each year are a function of many factors including a taxable income levels and the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by esi and our subsidiaries in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates b our ability to utilize deferred tax assets c taxes refunds interest or penalties resulting from tax audits d the magnitude of various credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income and e changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in addition we currently have a valuation allowance against domestic tax assets as a result of historic losses recorded in the united states changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations impairment of intangible assets we held a total of  million in acquired intangible assets and  million in goodwill at march    we review our acquired intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value we performed a review of our acquired intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  including a review for impairment based on certain triggering events and no significant impairments of intangible assets were detected we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of  and determined that goodwill was not impaired if at any time management determines that an impairment exists the company may be required to record the impaired value as part of operating income which will result in a reduction in earnings and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value in the period such impairment is identified the assessment of whether goodwill is impaired is sensitive to stock price and the assumed control premium a significant deterioration in either may trigger impairment stock price volatility the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely during fiscal   our stock price fluctuated between a high of  per share and a low of  per share and subsequent to the end of the fiscal year and prior to june   has been as low as  consequently the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock factors affecting our stock price many of which are outside of our control may include • variations in operating results from quarter to quarter • changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations • changes in the market price per share of our public company customers • market conditions in the consumer electronics semiconductor and other industries into which we sell products  table of contents • general economic conditions • political changes hostilities or natural disasters • low trading volume of our common stock • change in our dividend policy • the number of analysts covering our common stock and • the number of firms making a market in our common stock in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of hightechnology companies like ours these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price

the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows as of march    we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities and the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend on the resolution of current and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following • revenue recognition • inventory valuation • product warranty reserves • allowance for doubtful accounts • accrued restructuring costs • sharebased compensation • income taxes including the valuation of deferred tax assets • fair value measurements • valuation of cost method equity investments • valuation of longlived assets and • valuation of goodwill  table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier revenue is recognized upon such delivery provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of substantially new products revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received for multiple element arrangements the relative fair values of any undelivered elements are deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met revenues are recorded net of taxes collected which are required to be submitted to government authorities installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment and installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete historically neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been material revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer which generally occurs upon customer acceptance revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are generally recognized upon shipment revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts inventory valuation we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory based on a combination of factors including but not limited to the following product lifecycle forecasted sales or usage historical usage rates estimated service period product endoflife dates estimated current and future market values service inventory requirements and new product introductions purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure inventory materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence obsolescence writedowns are typically caused by engineering change orders or product life cycle changes research and development product costs are generally expensed as incurred engineering materials that are expected to provide future value are generally classified as raw materials inventory finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying value exceeds market selling prices when necessary we record inventory writedowns as an increase to cost of sales based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities on hand product lifecycle and forecasted demand into our analysis additionally from time to time we make strategic decisions to exit or alter product lines which may result in an inventory writedown if circumstances related to our inventories change our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change the company recorded  million and  million of inventory writeoff related charges for discontinued products in  and  respectively product warranty reserves we evaluate obligations related to product warranties quarterly a standard oneyear warranty is provided on most products warranty charges are comprised of costs to service the warranty including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items as well as other costs incidental to the repairs warranty charges are recorded net of any cost recoveries resulting from either successful repair of damaged parts or from warranties offered by our suppliers for defective components using historical data we estimate average warranty cost per system or part type and record the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold upon recognition of the related revenue additionally the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty and any resulting changes in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales if circumstances change or if a significant change in warrantyrelated incidents occurs the impact of the change in the warranty accrual could be material accrued product warranty is included on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accrued liabilities allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer where appropriate we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers to establish and modify their credit limits on certain foreign sales we require letters of credit we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors when a customer’s account becomes past due we contact the customer to determine the cause if we determine that a customer may be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover based on all available information then available if circumstances change related to specific customers our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change we record estimated bad debt expense as an increase to selling service and administration expenses  table of contents accrued restructuring costs we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require us to make estimates in certain areas including expenses for severance and other employee separation costs because we have a history of paying severance benefits expenses and liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable for further discussion on the restructuring activities and related charges in   refer to our discussion of “restructuring costs” in the “results of operations” section above sharebased compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards granted to our employees and directors including employee stock options stocksettled stock appreciation rights sars nonvested restricted stock units and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date we use the blackscholes valuation model as our method of valuation for stock option and sar awards the use of the blackscholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option and sar awards requires us to make assumptions regarding the riskfree interest rate expected dividend yield expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates based on our historical data but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the recognition of expense could be materially different in the future compensation expense is only recognized on awards that are estimated to ultimately vest therefore based on historical forfeiture rates and patterns the estimated future forfeitures are factored into the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period we update our forfeiture estimates at least annually and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates our results of operations could be materially impacted income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we recognize interest and penalties if any related to the unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in july  the fasb issued asu  income taxes topic  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists which the company has adopted this asu requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss nol carryforward or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the nol or other carryforward under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction and the entity intends to use the deferred tax asset for that purpose deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized as a result at the end of fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance of  million against our us deferred tax assets and attributes should management’s assumptions and expectations be inaccurate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in future periods fair value measurements fair value is defined under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” asc topic  when determining fair value on the financial assets and liabilities we consider the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs valuation of cost method equity investments the company accounts for certain equity investments using the cost method the total carrying value of these investments were  million at march   and an additional investment of  million was made in the second quarter of  for a total investment of  million lifetodate representing a  interest at each reporting period we determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of our  table of contents investments if there are no events or circumstances identified that would adversely affect the fair value of the investments the fair values of the investments are not calculated as it is not practicable to do so as the omniguide inc series f preferred stock round of equity financing was priced below previous rounds it was considered a triggering event and the company recorded a  million impairment charge of series d and series e investments in the second quarter of  in the fourth quarter of  further triggering events were identified due to poor operating results through the end of the year combined with decreasing cash levels we performed an updated valuation of our investment in the fourth quarter and recorded an additional  million impairment for an ending carrying value of these investments of  million the net carrying value of our minority investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets valuation of longlived assets      the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines identified intangibles we assess the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate in the fourth quarter of  we identified intangible assets relating to acquired inprocess research and development programs that we no longer expect to derive value from and as a result recorded  million of accelerated amortization there were no other events or circumstances during  that would indicate the carrying value of our longlived assets may not be recoverable      we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset property plant and equipment property plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets valuation of goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired the carrying value of goodwill was  million as of march   and march   we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value in performing this assessment in  we concluded that goodwill was not impaired and we were not required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test the assessment of whether goodwill is impaired is sensitive to stock price and the assumed control premium a significant deterioration in either may trigger impairment our stock price has recently traded around or below our book value of equity thereby placing more emphasis on the determination of a reasonable control premium item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  table of contents the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity to meet operating needs to achieve these objectives we maintain an investment portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper corporate bonds and us government agency notes interest rate risk our investment securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase the majority of these securities are classified as availableforsale securities therefore the impact on fair value of interest rate changes is reflected as a separate component of shareholders’ equity due to the short duration of our investment portfolio an immediate  change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our invested assets investment risk our marketable securities are classified as availableforsale securities measured at fair value the market value of our investments is influenced by market risks liquidity risk and the credit worthiness of underlying issuers of our investment we strive to minimize the investment risk by investing in high quality securities and by utilizing experienced and high credit quality financial institutions to manage the investment portfolio foreign currency exchange rate risk we purchase derivative financial instruments on a limited basis and do not use them for trading purposes we do however use derivatives to manage welldefined foreign currency risks we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the value of material nonfunctional currency monetary asset and liability balances the net effect of an

of deposit and readily marketable securities investments are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and the credit exposure from any one institution or instrument is minimized see note  “fair value measurements” for further discussion on these investments the company sells a significant portion of its products to a small number of large semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers the top ten customers accounted for approximately    and  of total net sales in    and   respectively one consumer electronics manufacturer accounted for approximately    and  of total net sales in    and   respectively no other customer individually accounted for more than  of total net sales in    or   the company’s operating results may be adversely affected if orders and

highperformance computers peripherals lasers and other components from various suppliers the company obtains some of the components from a single source or a limited group of suppliers an interruption in the supply of a particular component would have a temporary adverse impact on the company’s operating results the company’s net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into us

including but not limited to those relating to the cyclicality of the microelectronics and semiconductor markets the effect of general economic conditions rapid changes in technology and international operations cash equivalents and investments all highly liquid investments with a maturity of  days or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents shortterm investments reflect marketable securities that have maturities of less than one year or are subject to immediate prepayment or call provisions these securities consist primarily of marketable debt securities and are classified as “availableforsale securities” and recorded at fair market value unrealized gains and losses on shortterm investments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss to determine whether any existing impairment is otherthantemporary and requires recognition of an impairment loss in the results of operations the company evaluates its marketable securities based on the nature of the investments and the company’s intent and ability to hold the securities until the securities are no longer in an unrealized loss position accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect and do not bear interest credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer where appropriate the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to establish or modify credit limits on certain foreign sales letters of credit are obtained the collectability of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer reputation and creditworthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms if it is determined or estimated that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered accrued restructuring costs the company has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require it to make estimates in certain areas including expenses for severance and other employee separation costs because the company has a history of paying severance benefits expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted see note  “restructuring and cost management plans” for further discussion inventories inventories are principally valued at standard costs which approximate the lower of cost firstin firstout or market costs utilized for inventory valuation purposes include material labor and manufacturing overhead shipped systems pending acceptance shipped systems pending acceptance relate to systems that have been ordered and shipped to the customer but have been deferred in accordance with the company’s revenue recognition policy shipped systems pending acceptance are recognized as cost of sales once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met and revenue is recorded shipped systems pending acceptance are valued at standard costs which approximate the lower of cost firstin firstout or market costs utilized in the valuation of shipped systems pending acceptance include material labor and manufacturing overhead and exclude costs of installation property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets expenditures for maintenance repairs and minor improvements are expensed as incurred major improvements and additions are capitalized when assets are sold or retired the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included as a component of operating expenses longlived asset impairment  table of contents longlived assets principally property plant and equipment and identifiable definitelived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets the company’s purchased patents are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally  to  years other purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization expense is recognized on a straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets which range from  to  years goodwill impairment the company accounts for goodwill pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic  as amended in september  by accounting standard update asu  “intangiblesgoodwill and other topic  testing goodwill for impairment” asc asu  asc topic  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually asc asu  permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the twostep goodwill impairment test the company tests goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach at least annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value goodwill was tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of  and it was determined that there was no impairment as of march    other assets other assets include consignment demonstration demo equipment minority equity investments and longterm deposits consignment demo and training equipment are recorded at the lower of standard costs or estimated market values until the assets are sold the company has minority equity investments in the preferred stock of omniguide inc omniguide a private company these investments are accounted for as cost method investments and the company does not have the ability to significantly influence omniguide at the end of each reporting period the company determines whether events or circumstances have occurred that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments if there are no identified events or circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments the fair value of the investments are not calculated as it is not practicable to do so the total carrying value of  million and  million at march   and march    respectively is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash equivalents and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the nature of the underlying transactions and shortterm maturities involved current and noncurrent marketable securities are recorded at fair value which is defined under financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” asc topic  asc topic  establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include the following • level   defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level   defined as inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data and • level   defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions see note  “fair value measurements” for further discussion and disclosure of fair value on our financial assets and investments derivative financial instruments the company’s primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency risk the company’s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet the company’s criteria for designation as hedging transactions either as cash flow or fair value hedges a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of an asset or a liability or of a forecasted transaction is referred to as a cash flow hedge a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair  table of contents value of an asset or a liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment is referred to as a fair value hedge the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the instrument’s effectiveness in risk reduction and in most cases a onetoone matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain shortterm monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the company does not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges the change in fair value of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is reported each period in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier revenue is recognized upon such delivery provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment or in the case of substantially new products revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received for multiple element arrangements the relative fair value of any undelivered elements is deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met revenues are recorded net of taxes collected which are required to be submitted to government authorities installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment and installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been material revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer which generally occurs upon customer acceptance revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are generally recognized upon shipment revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts product warranty the company evaluates obligations related to product warranties quarterly a standard oneyear warranty from the date of acceptance is provided on most products warranty charges are comprised of costs to service the warranty including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items as well as other costs incidental to the repairs warranty charges are recorded net of any cost recoveries resulting from either successful repair of damaged parts or from warranties offered by the company’s suppliers for defective components using historical data the company estimates average warranty cost per system or part type and records the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold upon recognition of the related revenue additionally the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty and any resulting changes in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales if circumstances change or if a significant change in warrantyrelated incidents occurs the impact of the change in the warranty accrual could be material accrued product warranty is included on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accrued liabilities research and development research and development costs which include labor and related employee expenses patent maintenance fees project materials costs development tool placement and installation costs project subcontractors depreciation of engineering equipment building costs and other administration expenses are generally expensed as incurred

report included in e below c limitations on effectiveness of controls our management including our ceo and cfo do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative  table of contents to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected d changes in internal control there has been no change in our internal control over
