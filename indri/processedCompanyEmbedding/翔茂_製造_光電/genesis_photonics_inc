supply chain window genesis photonics finds way to blue ocean through highpower flipchip led technology sponsored content tuesday  december  genesis photonics inc gpi which has been devoted to developing led epitaxial wafer and chip technology for over  years has made great strides in flipchip packaging gpi has developed match led and eutectic bonding technology both of which improve reliability of led lighting fixtures allowing them to meet stringent outdoor lighting requirements and reduce production and aftersales costsembracing a corporate philosophy that calls for one to mull the possibilities seek solutions and take actions when faced with problems gpi has extended from low to mediumpower led chips to highpower flipchip devices for nearly three years and has found the doors to blueocean markets of outdoor led lighting in a recent interview gpis package  new product division assistant vice president simon hsu and product  marketing division section manager yang shihyi talked about the companys new products and technology as well as its strategies that are designed around the goal of meeting clients demandgpi leads in flipchip technology among led makers in greater chinaq can you give us a brief introduction to genesis photonics current operations and productsyang genesis photonics has  of consolidated revenues coming from japanbased clients the highest proportion among taiwanbased fellow makers and  from chinabased ones as chinas th fiveyear plan emphasizes the conservation of resources and environmental protection infrastructure projects in china are expected to adopt a considerably large number of led street lamps and tunnel lamps therefore there will be huge demand for outdoor led lighting in the china marketflipchip without wire bonding is a technology for securing high reliability of led light sources and gpi was the first to start flipchip led production among taiwan and chinabased fellow makers outdoor led lighting products take up a large proportion of gpis shipmentsflipchip guarantees quality for outdoor led lightingq how is demand in the outdoor led lighting markethsu when led lights are switched on they are always on and the only problem is about luminance decay outdoor led lighting is faced with challenging environmental conditions such as highlow temperatures and highvoltage or highcurrent operations when a string of leds is run by a constant current the entire string will go off if one single led chip fails this will decrease the service life of led lighting and even result in failure of the entire lighting systemas year warranty is generally required in the emc energy management contract market any malfunction during the period may require the support of heavy machinery for repair the costly maintenance may turn an emc project into a failure in terms of profitability therefore it is necessary to maximize the reliability of led lights to enable high reliability led players have been keen to develop simplified led component design gpis flipchip technology is heading towards the same directionq can you give us a brief idea about gpis flipchip led productshsu our match led is a flipchip packaged on ceramic substrates using eutectic boning process the ma series match led in  specification for example can reach luminous efficiency of lmw for a single led chip and features nonwire bonding close arrays low thermal resistance and high luminous efficiency making it ideal for outdoor lightingq can you explain the flipchip technologyhsu a general flipchip packaging process involves soldering bonding and reflow procedures with reflow attaining  bonding coverage gpi adopts eutectic bonding technology which is characterized by direct bonding the technology places an eutectic layer of goldtin alloy – with thermal conductivity more than  times that for silver paste – between the led chips and substrate and with ultrasonic lamination technology the two can be firmly and evenly bonded such bonding minimizes bubbles and covers over  of the substrate this enables the high reliability of led chips when operated at high voltages and high currentsq what are gpis advantages over competitorshsu our ma series features nonwire bonding close arrays low thermal resistance and high luminous efficiency thanks to our vertical integration of led epitaxial wafer chip and flipchip packaging technologies based on lm testing the product life of the ma is comparable to products offered by leading international vendors in addition testing of luminous decay shows that the ma is well above the energy star outdoor lighting standard  after working for  hours at  ampere and  degrees celsiushigh cp ratio creates winwin situation for gpi and clientsq what makes gpi a priority choice for clientsyang our flipchip technology is mature and we have begun volume production and we are the only taiwanbased maker whose  amperedriven led chips have been widely adopted for led street lamps in terms of costperformance ratio the chips generally take up  of total cost for highpower led street lamps for the same level of luminous efficiency and operating voltage our match led is  less than competitions in terms of production cost which will translate into a  reduction in the total production cost for lighting fixtures this can shorten the time for return on investment for emc projects to sum up gpis competitiveness in the outdoor led lighting market lies in its high quality low cost and quick return on investmentgenesis photonics showcases led street lamps adopting its

the average cob product d cob has better lighting quality and has the advantages of greatly reducing lighting system costs and expanding the market for new lighting applications moreover using a combination of high powered blue led components with patented remote phosphor offers lighting fixture manufacturers additional patent protection successful application of genesis photonics d cob solution in candle lamps  bulbs  downlights  and bay lights  successful application of genesis photonics d cob solution in candle lamps  bulbs  downlights  and bay lights  comparison of light source solutions comparison of light source solutions d cob normal cob color uniformity extremely good average lumen maintenance excellent small differences in hotcold factor good hotcold factor slightly normal design options can be matched with many remote phosphor stimulation solutions phosphor painted on the package interior luminaire design components used flexible with low inventory risks standard specifications that are prone to inventory risks with changes in client demand gpi’s d cob integrated solution can be used with dimensional lighting or plane lighting remote phosphor solutions compared to single or group led packages where phosphor is placed very close to the die and receives near range concentrated light source stimulation the remote phosphor used in d cob are is located further away from the die and excited by long range light source the advantages provided by such an arrangement include excellent lumen maintenance small differences in hotcold factor and slight color shifts in addition by applying remote phosphors in gp’s high luminous efficacy match led it is also able to get improved color uniformity and diverse color temperature options for luminarie manufacturers these technological advantages open up a lot of opportunities for luminaire manufacturers to create more  flexible light fixture designsstandard specifications can cause inventory risks when client demand changes gpi’s d cob’s core light source employs the patented blue light match led component a technology developed by the company the component is constructed on the foundation of at chips and includes the following features wirebond free compact arrangement low thermal resistance and high light efficiency from the at die match led component to the d cob light source solution gpi has been cooperating with top international phosphor brands to provide sophisticated light efficiency levels and patent protection this also helped improve luminaries’ clients’ opportunities of entering the global market currently gpi’s d cob is being introduced to lighting manufacturers in the us japan europe and china the company is currently cooperating with a top global
