accelerators gdi were among the fastest in the lowend marketsegment outperforming competing vgachips from oak technologies trident microsystems and paradise western digital for example the cirrus gd  supported hardware acceleration for both bit color and bit color it was one of the lowestpriced svga controllers to support both by the mids when pcs had migrated to the pci bus cirrus had fallen behind s and trident microsystems when the announced release date of the gd mondello came and went cirruss reputation in desktop pcgraphics suffered mondello development took a back seat to the gd which was near completion and proved to be a much faster design with the use of rambus because of this mondello never got off the ground the companys final graphics chips the gdx laguna series of pciagp daccelerators were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use rambus rdram the patented use of tiled memory used by the gdx chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today however like many other dd chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time the feature set of perspectivecorrect texture mapping bilinear filtering singlepass lighting gouraud shading and alpha blending was incomplete compared to the next generation of d chips the gdx family was limited by cpu processing at the time cpus could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block the raw processing power of the gdx was nearly  million  pixel triangles per second much faster than competitors when intel announced they were entering the d market with the i cirrus logic exited the market which at the time for cirrus logic was worth  million dollars annually intel didnt catch up in performance for many years the i was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs emulated cirrus logic graphic cards are used in emulators qemu emulate the cirrus clgd  pci vgacard which is also emulated by bochs which in addition also emulates
