all for joining us on our second quarter and first half earnings conference call our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results by product group our outlook for the third quarter and our ambitions for the second half overall before beginning i want to welcome our deputy ceo jeanmarc chery to his new role which officially started on july nd i look forward to working even more closely with jeanmarc and with our strong executive team to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth lets start now with our financial review as you have seen we are putting together quarters of successive improvement in our financial results the second quarter delivered further improvement with strong sequential and yearoveryear revenue growth and with operating income and net income following the same trajectory revenues increased  sequentially a better than seasonal performance and  basis points above the midpoint of our guidance on a yearoveryear basis revenues increased  with growth coming from all product groups and sales channels in the internet of things and smartphones we continue to win business with our complete portfolio of microcontrollers sensors analog and power management connectivity and secure solutions and iot our distribution channel plays a key role with point of sales in the second quarter growing  yearoveryear distribution represented  of our revenues in q in smart driving we continue to capture opportunities both with products developed in our automotive and discrete group as well as with products such as sensors and general purpose analogs which are developed by other groups and fit the need of automotive customers with our present visibility we expect our overall automotive business to grow by about  in  for the first half of  sts quarterly revenues were  billion up  gross margin was  in the second quarter  basis points above the midpoint of our range on a sequential basis gross margin increased by  basis points positively impacted by favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by price erosion on a yearoveryear basis gross margin increased by  basis points reflecting manufacturing efficiencies improved fab loading and a favorable product mix partially offset by normal price pressure operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased to  million representing an operating margin of  thanks to our product and profit initiatives driving operating leverage better product mix and manufacturing efficiencies on a sequential and yearoveryear basis operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased by  million and  million respectively net income in the second quarter was up sharply to  million representing a sequential improvement of  million and on a yearoveryear basis a swing of  million first half  net income totaled  million free cash flow was  million in the second quarter and  million for the first half this means that we can support our higher level of capital investment in  from our improved cash flow from operations exiting the second quarter our net financial position was  million slightly up from the first quarter and higher by  million compared to one year ago after having distributed  million in dividends to strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility in july we raised  billion at an overall zero cost through a convertible bond offering additionally the combination of the net share settlement option and the ongoing repurchase of the underlining shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes including support for growth and the redemption of our  and  convertible bonds now lets move to a detailed review of our product groups beginning with automotive and discrete our adg adg revenues grew  sequentially performing better than the company average and grew  in comparison to the year ago quarter adgs operating income and operating margin improved sequentially driving adgs second quarter operating margin to  for the first half adg revenues increased  with its operating income up slightly and the operating margin substantially stable at  looking at our product portfolio for automotive we see the increasing silicon content of the latest generation of cars reflected in the number of st components present in new models for example in the new audi a we estimate that we will contribute up to  components coming from all areas of our broad portfolio in the automotive with our focus on technologies and solutions enabling greener driving we won important design wins related to car electrification these included wins for silicon carbide mosfets hightemperature silicon controlled rectifiers and ultrafast diodes from oems as well as from key automotive suppliers semiconductors content for hybrid and electric vehicles is growing fast and we see the potential for over  silicon carbide dice in todays typical electric car we also had a number of design wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience such as an important win for a new generation of airbag platform from a major carsafety technology leader we also won audioamplifier socket with a tier  and we were selected as a partner by a german company for the development of a nextgeneration rear led driver targeting major global carmakers moving to our power discrete business outside automotive here we had design wins for highvoltage super junction devices for battery chargers with leading smartphone makers wins with highvoltage igbts from many global leaders in home appliances and wins with the ultrafast series diodes at top airconditioning makers in our analog and mems groups amg we saw strong revenue growth both sequentially and yearoveryear on a sequential basis revenues increased  driven by both analog and mems products yearoveryear amg revenues were up  on sharply higher mems growth and also strong growth in analog similarly amgs second quarter operating margin saw strong sequential and yearoveryear improvement increasing to  from  and  in the prior and yearago quarters respectively for the firsthalf  amg revenues increased  its operating margin saw a significant turnaround reaching  up from breakeven in the yearago period moving to the amg products our mems sensors achieved a number of important design wins across a diverse range of applications these included motion sensors and magnetometers in pcs and tablet motion sensors for bike application in asia and a axis motion sensor for a top chinese smartphone manufacturer we also received first orders for waterproof pressure sensors for a smartwatch from a leading global brand and won socket for pressure sensors in multiple applications including drones and appliances in addition we enlarged our family of yearlongevity sensors with the introduction of a axis module targeting smart industry applications in sensors for our automotive telematics applications we grew more than  yearoveryear with customers across the globe in wireless connectivity we launched a new systemonchip bluetooth low energy certified and also won multiple designs for a subgigahertz and bluetooth low energy in a range of applications including wearable smart home and smart building automation the performance of our analog business was strong during the second quarter we achieved record quarterly sales in standard and high performance analog product families and we introduced new advanced operational amplifiers to reinforce our position both in industrial and in the automotive our stspin motorcontrol family won numerous sockets globally for a broad range of consumer and industrial motorcontrol applications including d printers textile machines for smart factories but also vacuum cleaners and fan controls wireless charging has been an area of recent investment and during the second quarter we landed a design win for fast wirelesscharging ics in smartphones as well as introducing new multistandard wireless charger ics now let me share some highlights on our microcontrollers and digital ics group mdg which has seen a strong overall improvement in operating result since the start of the year on a sequential basis mdgs revenues increased  and yearoveryear were up  on doubledigit growth of our general purpose microcontrollers offset in part by lower digital ic sales including products undergoing a phaseout mdgs operating margin was  in the second quarter showing sequential improvement and was up sharply compared to the year ago quarter on a yearoveryear basis this improvement reflects on the one hand our strong performance in microcontrollers and on the other our restructuring initiatives that have resulted in a substantial reduction of losses from digital ics first half mdg result further demonstrate the significant progress we have made with revenues increasing  operating income up  million and its operating margin reaching  from  in the first half of  on general purpose microcontrollers we have seen another record quarter in q to further strengthen the stm family product offer and ecosystem we introduced new parts for the stml and this family features advanced capabilities in terms of audio performance and also with this family we can provide the new iot discovery kit indeed to accelerate development of applications with direct connection to the cloud services we also increased our support for smart industry applications with a scalable industrial ethernet platform through a cooperative effort with a german automotive solution provider moving to security we started production of our latest highperformance near field communication controller targeting consumer and mobile security applications we launched a new stpay dualinterface banking solution and announced a solution for iot security based on stsafe trusted platform module in cooperation with security platform incorporation we gained wins for std dynamic rfid tags in washing machines and for str near field communication reader ics for pointofsales terminals from major oems while beginning production ramp of  kilobit eeprom at a top sportswear brand we also launched the stdv dynamic near field communicationrfid tag expansion board for the stm nucleo ecosystem in our custom silicon business we introduced the first european independent design platform dedicated to asics for space applications in lowpower cmos technology in cooperation with the european space agency and the french space agency cnes we also qualified a new fdsoi digital asic for a key networking oem and captured several design wins for optical ics at a key subsystem manufacturer for applications in data centers to complete the review of our products lets now discuss our imaging product division which we report in others as anticipated imaging revenues in the second quarter decreased slightly on a sequential basis to  million while we prepare for the ramp of new programs on a yearoveryear basis imaging revenues increased  in the second quarter and for the first half  rose  to  million driven by sts innovative timeofflight technologies in the second quarter we continue to gain design wins while delivering high volumes of our flightsense timeofflight proximity and ranging sensors to multiple smartphone oems we now have reached cumulative shipments of over  million timeofflight sensors and are in more than  smartphone models from  different oems moving now to our third quarter guidance we anticipate continued progress in revenue growth improvement in our operating performance and higher net income bookings are strong across all product groups and regions and we continue to see healthy inventory level and demand from our pointofsales data based on our current bookings activity and visibility we expect third quarter revenues to increase about  on a sequential basis this represents a yearoveryear growth of about  at the midpoint of our guidance we expect this growth to come from all our businesses regions and sales channels for our three product groups we anticipate revenue growth in the third quarter to reflect higher than normal seasonality in our imaging business we anticipate strong sequential growth as the key new program ramps in q followed by further revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter of this year looking at  overall and based on current visibility we expect our revenues to be at the highend of the range that we gave at the capital market day which was  yearoveryear revenue growth plus or minus  percentage points turning to gross margin we anticipate further expansion in the third quarter to about  at the midpoint leading to strong yearoveryear improvement in operating and net income with respect to our  free cash flow we continue to anticipate it well substantially – that will substantially match the level of our dividend additionally let me share some more specifics on our capital investment plans for  at our capital markets day in may we indicated we were reviewing our capital spending in  above our initial plans of up to  billion based upon a combination of new products and higher customer demand we now anticipate capital investment in  to be in the range of about  billion to  billion this investment will support both  revenues and our future growth programs to conclude at our capital markets day we shared with you our financial performance targets for the second half of  based upon our third quarter guidance and second half ambitions overall we believe st is very well positioned to reach these shortterm financial target my colleagues and i will now be happy to answer your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session the first question is from alex duval from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander duval  goldman sachs international yes good morning everyone many thanks for the question alex duval from goldman sachs just wanted to clarify exactly what automotive revenue you saw overall obviously that spread over several groups thats the first point and then the second one was just on some of the data points youve seen out of automotive semis globally particularly in the us weve seen some semi players and tier  suppliers have some weaker data points but you seem to be pointing to doubledigit growth in coming quarters so just wanted to understand your view on overall global auto end market and any specifics for st many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah with the visibility that we have today we will grow  in our automotive business and the backlog is very strong and its very strong across all technologies this is for our discrete sensors certainly for smart power products microcontrollers and all the complex digital asics for infotainment or the advanced safety and connectivity so its broad range and is strong and of course we understand that there are some fluctuations in the overall volumes but content is increasing and with the visibility that we have today and supported really unprecedentedly strong backlog in the automotive we plan to grow  yearoveryear alexander duval  goldman sachs international thats very clear and just to – i have one quick followup weve seen some data points around wafer pricing increasing yeartodate wondered if you could give a perspective on what that can mean for st to what extent we could see any impacts and how it controlled many thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo the manager of procurement carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah good morning everyone indeed at the end of second half of  it will be a period with some upside on the overall price for silicon substrate this will affect us its well incorporated in our gross margin roadmap and the visibility that we are sharing with you with some of this supplier we have early contract so i believe that perhaps it is a little bit less effect than other semiconductor companies because of this reason and overall at the end there are ingredients in our technology manufacturing roadmap that are exposed but clearly the millimeter the millimeter bulk wafers while there are other ingredients like for instance the sisubstrate that became important in our volume as you may expect in the second half of this year that are less exposed to this price evolution alexander duval  goldman sachs international very clear many thanks tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you alex next question please operator the next question is from sandeep deshpande from jpmorgan please go ahead sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi i have two questions if i may thanks for letting me on my first question is regarding your asic business carlo bozotti i mean do you have – are you working with any major smartphone vendors at this point on major asics – in any major asics i mean since last year when you did the restructuring in the settop box business you did move some employees into a power management business and whether you are going to work in power management asics for instance in the smartphone market and my second question carlo ferro is on the other revenues that you report your other operating income losses increased in the second quarter im not entirely sure why that happened given that your gross margin improved annual revenue improved so how do we model that going forward into the latter half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep yes we have asic development of course we have broad range of technologies and we can cover both smart power asics but also digital asics and indeed we have important developments in this area sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc are you talking about the smartphone market carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv no no no yes im talking about the smartphone yes absolutely yes sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv sandeep to take your second question help me please is your question about the other revenues in the pl or the revenues for the other group sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc no other group which is where you report imaging and where you historically reported losses associated with under utilization et cetera where it has increased from negative  million in q to negative  million in q as such really carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay okay i see the question of course there are two important ingredients there one is already very evident in our results is the substantial loading of the fab so you make expect that the second quarter result have really a very very minor effect of unused capacity on this line then the result of the imaging division is very much associated with the evolution of the product programs and time to ramp the program i believe its not a surprise that no new program has ramped in the course of the second quarter and this is the reason why revenues in q were sequentially lower than prior quarter and overall the combination of the top line and the network  to support the new program ready to start is the reason driving the operating income for the division in the second quarter we are very confident for the second half of the year for this line sandeep deshpande  jpmorgan securities plc understood so this was because of costs which are not covered on new projects understood carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv exactly carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you sandeep thank you next question please operator the next question is from achal sultania from credit suisse please go ahead sir achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd hi good morning thanks for my questions so if i look at your q guidance it implies that revenues are going to grow sequentially about  million can you help us understand like how much of that is going to come from the others category like i know you cant give a precise number but like just give us some sense whether its like  of that incremental growth is driven by others or is it less than  more than  any color around that would be helpful then i have a followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv carlo carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no where you want to go i would be thank to answer that from a news capacity fab loading – our revenues generation but im sure that your question is different and clearly we cannot be as you may understand very very specific on individual line and individual program carlo has already indicated the trend for both the imaging division and the other and overall three product groups – on the other overall three product groups we see a sequential revenues increase higher than normal seasonality and the normal seasonality for us is between  and  so higher means that higher than that and for the imaging division we see a strong increase in the quarter and furthermore increase in acceleration in the fourth quarter upon the view of starting new program and the acceleration of the program more loaded in the fourth quarter than in the third achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thats helpful color thanks and maybe a followup on your sales guidance for the full year obviously youve increased – youre saying now youll probably reach the high end of the range just trying to understand what are the key drivers that is making actually you more confident about that is it mainly autos because i also see that youve raised autos guidance from  to  and probably there is some fx tailwind on the top line as well because of weak dollar are there any other puts and takes around that or carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv to be candid in the answer in respect to what we told you in may i believe the only difference today is about the timing and to gain visibility over timing again we were very confident on the status of the business in may given still seven months to end the year we tend to be a little bit more prudent now we have a visibility with a very reasonable set of expectations to give us comfort towards the high end of this range nothing in particular in respect to specific businesses our area of applications have changed as order  remains quite strong carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv right right and inventory at our distributors really low so it is across the board so it is a good momentum in the three areas that we have the iot the smartphone for us is one area automotive as we said at  and also lets say all of this new applications in the mass market so we have a stronger lets say visibility pretty much across the board from a business point of view but also from a regional point of view achal sultania  credit suisse securities europe ltd okay great thanks a lot carlo and congratulations for strong results thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you achal next question please operator the next question is from david mulholland from ubs please go ahead david t mulholland  ubs ltd hi thanks for taking the question maybe similar to the vein of the last – first question but we had a fairly clear indication from another supplier into the product ramp in h that the phasing would be a bit more qweighted relative to q on when revenue benefit might be seen from the kind of d sensing in h i wonder if you can comment on whether you see similar trends kind of a bit more qbiased and then secondly on the analog and mems growth that youve seen – or if youd just comment you made a few comments on what have been the drivers behind this but could you help us understand distributionwise has this mostly been recovery in smartphones and the gains at a major asian smartphone oem or is it more diverse and broadbased than that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv again we already gave visibility on what we expect in q and we see then q moving into q now we said that in q our three groups are fast imaging  now they are growing more than seasonal and as we said our seasonality is  to  so this will be higher than that so there will be step of course important step a strong step in imaging and then see for this line an acceleration of the revenues in q now we cannot comment more than that if we go to – now to amg i think here we have a important traction in analog the traction is certain importance in distribution and i think it is either – it is both our general purpose analog on one side but also our more specific industrial and power conversion products including motion control products so this is pretty strong demand through the mass market and the distribution as far as mems is concern automotive is growing very rapidly as we said  but we are not yet at the level that we would like to be in this domain of the mems business i think it is important opportunity for us in the future to sell more of these products to automotive and industrial customers what we are doing on the other end on consumer is of course try to diversify our base clearly in terms of customers with more and more customers particularly in asia but also in terms of product and product categories so its – again its pretty broad i think for us in analog its important to keep going because its a great business both in general purpose highend analog the industrial and power conversion certain products also for computing – for computer peripherals so this for us is important and we have a pretty good visibility here and at mems as i said we want to do more in areas where margins are higher like industrial and automotive and remain well balanced in the smartphone in terms of customers and products david t mulholland  ubs ltd thats great thanks very much carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you david next question please operator the next question is from amit harchandani from citigroup please go ahead amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd good morning everyone amit harchandani from citi and thanks for taking my questions two if i may my first question is with respect to the demand in the quarter could you give us a sense – youve talked about inventories but could you give us a sense for lead times and how they have shaped up theyre stable getting stretched whether you have seen any component shortages and also potentially comment on the linearity of bookings during the quarter and then i have a second followup thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah but certainly lead time are stretchening i mean we have a strong demand the booktobill is very positive and we have seen an acceleration of the bookings in the month of june starting from a level that was already pretty high in april and in may and of course we also have the first three weeks of july i can say that the run rate is pretty good also in the first three weeks of july including last week so the booktobill is good lead time are stretchening and the inventory  distribution are low and the trend of bookings has increased in the month of june and in the month of july compared to the months of april and may amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you and as an unrelated followup could i maybe get some more insight into the design wins you have talked about on the silicon carbide side youve talked about diodes youve talked about mosfets we understand there is a strong win with an automotive customer could you give us a sense for whats driving this is it customers embracing it is it competitive positioning any sort of insight you could give with us which would help us better quantify the opportunity would be most welcome carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah no i think frankly that we are in a good leadership position with our silicon carbide i think we want to make silicon carbide an important industrial program for this year and i think in this respect my opinion of course is that we are leading the market and industrial is more spread and we certainly have opportunity in the industrial field both with diode and with power mos but the volumes and the volume potentials in the automotive are significantly higher so we have an aggressive plan to start i think in q sales contribution is limited however we have an aggressive plan and it is a very very important program for the company to move on from what we have now with inch  inch yields are improving we are moving up and there is a strong determination to make this a successful program during the second half of this year amit b harchandani  citigroup global markets ltd thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you amit next question please operator the next question is from janardan menon from liberum please go ahead janardan menon  liberum capital ltd hi good morning thanks for taking the question i had a question on gross margin for a very strong  quarteronquarter growth and carlo ferro you had previously indicated that you will get a significant benefit from the second half from the increased capacity of the millimeter fab where your cost of production goes down i was just wondering that the  seems a little bit on the low side when you put all that together are there any headwinds that you are facing right now on gross margin and how would you expect the gross margin progression to continue beyond q based on what you know at this point in time i have a followup carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay janardan thank you for the question since that help to highlight also two points around our  guidance on gross margin midpoint this point is again is if i do not mistake this is higher than consensus expectation for the second half and second is the opportunity of progression going forward at the end you have mentioned some of the driver weve discussed at capital markets day about our gross margin evolution through the year the wafer cost particularly millimeter is important as fab ramps there is always a continuing improvement on the learning curve and i believe the ability of taking a full advantage of the scale of the fab at around the  wafer per week will be more evident in the production in the course of the third quarter and as you know there is about a one quarter lag as operating cost manufacturing cost translates into margin out to the inventory cycle so at the end its early to anticipate a gross margin for the fourth quarter there are a number of ingredients and variable also depending clearly on product mix et cetera overall the visibilities that after the  in q the progression towards q will be on the positive direction janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood and just a brief followup on the timeofflight which is in your other division after a big jump in the second half of last year that revenue has sort of flattened out but you are continuously reporting higher number of models and oem on that particular product and now i understand that from the second half that revenue will increase sharply because of the d of the special program but just on the timeofflight itself can you give some reason why that revenue is not really rising as a number of model is that price pressure coming there or what are the dynamics which is happening there jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv hi its jeanmarc speaking thank you for the question we are simply executing timely and according to plan of record of the program and our assessment is consistent with that carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i think on the timeofflight we have enormous number of customers in our end of course we are also working on new technologies for the timeofflight so there would be a new wave but we are pretty happy that the growth is impressive in imaging and we are investing a lot for the new initiative this is visible of course in terms of expenses in the pl but we have now sort  the  million business of timeofflight that we want to keep going and we have the opportunity i think its pretty good and its a pretty good business i would say its very good business but in parallel we are investing on new things and this will make – will allow us to make another important step janardan menon  liberum capital ltd understood thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you janardan next question please operator the next question is from adithya metuku from bank of america please go ahead adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch yes good morning guys thanks for taking my questions i have a couple of admin questions firstly could you remind us of the proportion of costs in your business that have been hedged over the next four quarters especially given the recent moves in the eurodollar rate and also if you could remind us with the latest impact on your costs from the eurodollar move given all the restructuring and the changes in the business over the last  months or so and then secondly just a quick followup on the recent convertible bond offering if you could give us some color on how we should think about the diluted share count and the impact on buybacks going forward that would be really helpful thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv okay so i guess both questions are for me carlo the one on the hedging has – overall cogs and operating expenses eurodenominated at the current stage are hedged for the third quarter in the range of the  so on the  effective rate underlying our guidance at the end the margin of volatility is quite limited that will be not about one figure assuming exchange rates that stays at a decent level of  and for the fourth quarter we have now had over  of the overall exposure and on this basis based on current exchange rate at  you may expect for the fourth quarter an effective exchange range of about € per dollar sic  per euro  the second part of the question is an appreciated question as clearly our balance sheet at the end of the months of june still is subject to some evolution on july  we have closed the issuance of the new convertible bond then we are in the process of repurchasing  million shares and we are in the process of redeeming the  convertible bond in respect to this initiative the current status is clearly the issuance of the convertible bond is complete and this also give us the opportunity for an additional  million of financing if we take out the amount we are using to repurchase the underlying shares to convert assuming net share settlement at the end is  billion net amount that came with a zero cost and with zero dilution certainly strengthening the balance sheet of the company and the overall financial flexibility for the company then we have the second ingredient which is the execution of the buyback on the share buyback execution we are at about  of completion so i would expect that when i will talk at the end of q but before in the next month so the program which has been totally completed and in respect to the redemption of the  bond the  million has been – the full amount has been already noticed for conversion we are in the so called observation period which is a day period so by the end of august the redemption of this  million of tax will be reflected to make sure to the story you see  billion of available liquidity  billion in the balance sheet at the end of june on a pro forma basis including the new convert the repurchase of the shares and the redemption of the  bond at this level of liquidity would be about  billion and finally i guess on your question perhaps there is a question about the underlying shares for the shares count and given the utilization of treasury shares to redeem the  bond on one side and the buyback on the other side what you may consider is that at the end of june  million shares were outstanding as treasury shares at the end of september after all this process of refinancing being completed we estimate about  million treasury shares so not bigger changes in the overall effect of treasury shares on the shares count adithya metuku  bank of america merrill lynch okay very clear thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv youre welcome tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you adi next question please operator the next question is from jérôme ramel from exane bnp please go ahead jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas yeah good morning a question on your manufacturing could you give us what the capacity utilization rate was also what is the current capacity in call it millimeter and have you already completed the program and the capex increase for this year where is it going exactly thank you jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv so thank you jérôme jeanmarc speaking so to be specific about call it millimeter i have to say that all the equipment  has been basically installed and consigned now and the team is running full speed to reach a capacity about  to  wafer per week in the course of this second half of this year and overall okay the manufacturing machine of  carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and the capex this phase is broad they increase – the increase that we have given or that it was preannounced in fact in the month of may and today there is some form of quantification it is also covering area like our bcd for instance the smart power technologies the silicon carbide typically proprietary technologies because we see important opportunities for the future of course we also said however that this extra capex in terms of cash flow we would – it would be fully compensated by increased ebitda so the cash flow lets say anticipation that we had given would not change no we would certainly cover the distribution of dividends despite the increase in capex jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you and maybe another followup if you are fully loaded today and we should still see revenue growth in q and maybe lets say you have some growth next year how are you going to deal with that do you have extra capacity coming in or are you stretched from a capacity standpoint carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well first of all we have some ambition for q and we are starting to describe the ambition but certainly with what we have in our end in terms of capacity and in terms of the backlog customer programs we have moved quickly from a  billion company to a  billion company this is happening this is happening for real and of course we have opportunity inside st to grow but we also have opportunity with our lets say silicon foundry partners we are working internally as we described today but we are also working externally with a number of technologies traditionally this was on logic the fdsoi as you know embedded flash is also from outside and more recently the perimeter has become wider we have the bcd also now so you see the contribution of important programs with our silicon foundry partners and this increase of capacity internally and our really priorities to make sure that we can make another important step next year in terms of revenues jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you just to make clear carlo with this current capacity you have and your partner fleet with your foundry do you think you can deal with potentially a  billion revenue is that what you said carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv i didnt say exactly that i said that with the silicon foundry partners we can certainly exceed the  billion jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas okay thank you carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv if i can jérôme on a more i would say technical standpoint help on the subject i believe that we are not referring to any target of guidance for next year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv sure carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv which is clearly too early however certainly the initial question about the limitation of our revenues growth in respect to the current utilization of capacity we tried to put in the right context because there are a number of ingredients that will support and could support together with the demand expanding revenues as carlo said the sourcing of silicon from a foundry the fact that full use of capacity in full steam it moves  then takes one quarter to translate into wafers out in our cycle the fact that we are accelerating capital expenditure when you compare the  billion  billion guidance for the year to the about  million spent in the first half youll see that there is a lot that we are receiving in these days which clearly will increase capacity and then obviously there is also on the inventory cycle so its not so mathematical it certainly is not flex  jérôme ramel  exane bnp paribas thank you very much tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you jérôme next question operator the next question is from francois meunier from morgan stanley please go ahead francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc thanks for taking my questions yes just a bit more precisions around the silicon carbide mosfets socket wins in which region was that was that in germany and are you seeing the more traditional competitor there trying to come back on the silicon carbide thats the first question second question on the gross margin actually you know like that was a question you had earlier i think the guidance for q is pretty good it looks like its a  drop through on incremental revenues compared to  in q so thats pretty good so i think carlo you say that q would potentially be even better so is that basically because you expect the drop through to increase to  or above in q and just two other questions if i may any intent to use the  billion convert youve raised at a very very good price to increase you capabilities in vcsel and also – and im sorry thats the fourth question im really sorry have you heard of any double ordering taking place at the moment end of q beginning of q at any of your distributors or oems thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv okay so there are many question maybe carlo youll start carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv on the gross margin carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv so i think the one on the gross margin unfortunately francois with little ability of adding in respect to what we have already anticipated and saw the opportunity of a further progression in the fourth  quarter than to quantify it at this stage is a bit premature as you could expect it then the other of your questions was on utilization on the proceeds from the convertible bond for what was the question is francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc if you were willing to buy into vcsel capabilities for your d sensors jeanmarc chery  stmicroelectronics nv no no no no no we have always positioned ourselves very clear about vcsel you have many many vcsel type okay big one big  so its  like a strategic agreement with supplier and this is basically what we are doing and we have done to support our imaging growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv in general as you said francois thank you for saying that at the end we have raised money at very effective terms and this grant is the reason why we tapped the market and the philosophy that its better to go to take money from the market when its easily and the cheap as opposed of when you actually need so i would encourage not at all reading across the convert in to read the strategic or investment move in for the company really its been more opportunistic than strategically needed and of course financial flexibility in semiconductor is always a great asset to support the growth carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv and then i think the last part is on sic right francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc yes from which region and if you saw your more traditional competitor on power semis for autos reacting to your progress in silicon carbide carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv of course i believe that we will see well see we will  its no doubt i think this is a great opportunity for st but it is a great opportunity for some of our competitors and we need to keep that going with innovation the industrialization et cetera so i expect that there will be a strong effort from our competitors to be successful in this very very important business frankly we are working on the three regions i think its something that i can mention because it is publicly known and is about china in china we have signed an agreement to contribute this is with a consortium and they are carmakers battery maker also research centers research institution in china this is for the management of the battery for electric vehicles i believe this is something that i can mention because it is publicly known i think its a good opportunity of course with our bcd technology but also for our silicon carbide but we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in germany and we are working also in united states francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you and any sign of hearing on any double ordering in microcontrollers or any standard parts carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think there is more than double ordering i think what we see is anticipation of orders particularly on microcontrollers to make sure that the backlog is wellcovered also for instance for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year we know of course very well that on certain family the booktobill ratio that we are experiencing is not sustainable but i think what we see is an effort to make sure that there is a good coverage in the backlog of our customers not just for q or as part of q but on a longer frame of time francois a meunier  morgan stanley  co international plc okay thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thank you francois next question please operator the next question is from andrew gardiner from barclays please go ahead andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning gentlemen thank you for taking the question i had another one on the capex side of things yeah i take your point that demand is strong and so it is – the rise in capex is covered by sort of broadbased demand but if i go back to some of the comments you made earlier this year so when we first saw the initial increase in capex there were portions of the  budgets that were quite clearly allocated to a specific project im just wondering whether now that were in the middle part of the year were going to see some of these ramp in the back half how is your visibility into  improving for these particular areas and i go back to some of the points you made carlo ferro about sort of ensuring that you are going to get sort of multiyear returns on the investment being made just sort of further visibility into  would be helpful and ive just got a quick modeling followup carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv absolutely carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv yeah andrew at the end the capex level in  is clearly higher than what we have expected entering the year but also the revenues for the year are well higher than what we were expecting and we are really in a process of realigning capacity to demand and increasing sourcing from silicon foundry in parallel in order on one side to meet demand and on the other side to maintain or to increase flexibility for our manufacturing machine recognizing that clearly the semiconductor industry remains overall exposed to some level of silica  so this is i would say quite wise and wellbalanced move then as this evolution continues so far to be positive based on current visibility  could be another year important in term of overall capital expenditure however frankly its very very early at this stage to anticipate the way that capital sourcing is execute in this industry is always at the appropriate level of modularity in order to adjust up or down depending on the evolution of the demand depending on the design win clearly today also in carlos introduction you had a good picture of not only strong demand but the flow of design wins which is important in all and across the various technologies including in the area of analog and power technology and this is the reason for accelerating capital expenditure andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you and gentlemen just a quick followup in terms of opex modeling previously youd guided to the  million per quarter on average through the year can we assume that was the normal seasonality in opex sort of lower in q and then higher in q but does that average still hold for the year or is it moving a bit higher given the revenue growth carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv for the current quarter ill say no major surprise in respect to the gross operating expenses in sga and in rd clearly there is more activity the exchange rate is not as you noted in favor the seasonality plays in favor overall what you may expect is that this quarter is a level of operating income lower than what is the normal  million to  million we report each quarter carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not operating income carlo ferro  stmicroelectronics nv no other income sorry of other income and expenses sorry thank you carlo of other income and expenses here on other income and expenses at the end you may expect a few million dollar of contribution so overall at the end the net operating expenses for q would be slightly north of the  million of our target range then moving forward in q you may expect some increase due to seasonality and exchange rate on the gross expenses the other income and expenses to go back to the usual  million to  million and as a result of that we may be a few tenths of million dollar maximum above the  million reference andrew m gardiner  barclays capital securities ltd thats very clear thank you carlo tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv next question please operator the next question is from robert sanders from deutsche bank please go ahead robert sanders  deutsche bank ag yeah hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question i just wanted to come back to a previous question about capacity so if you were given a new order for a special program for second half  lets say at the end of this year how would you serve that if it was lets say an fdsoi ramp are you saying that you would serve that via foundries or are you saying that you would migrate embedded flash out of crolles and into foundries to clear the decks for that and i guess i have the same question for silicon carbide in the sense that thats currently on a inch line at catania is there clean room space to ramp that up or would you need to do something with the inch capacity thats there as well thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well lets start from the silicon carbide no the silicon carbide will stay inside okay we do not have any plan to outsource the silicon carbide at all so as you know at the end of last year we moved from  to  inches and we run this in our inch module in catania and we intend to continue the growth of this line in catania on the other hand on the inch in catania the intention is to move more and more production as we already described to asia to singapore for us on the first part of the question while its a combination of the two of course we are building up flexibility lets put in this way i mean you mentioned two important areas of flexibility on flexibility you mentioned flexibility on embedded flash and you mentioned flexibility on fdsoi and of course this is part of the whole manufacturing strategy we must work from this and we must increase this level of flexibility and it is exactly the same for bcd we want to have more flexibility also on the bcd so as we said before it would be a combination of internal investment but also a more extensive use of outsource okay so flexibility in fdsoi flexibility in embedded flash on a number of generational technologies flexibility on bcd but certainly lets say on a technology pack fdsoi particularly in this space everything is and will remain inside but flexibility to reduce the inch in catania moving the traditional production to singapore and making more space for the fdsoi in case its needed robert sanders  deutsche bank ag got it and just following up on that so then no plans for a new clean room anytime soon in order to expand your capacity internally carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv not for new buildings we have always opportunity to use our infrastructure better and our lets say ambition is of course to build up more when we need in terms of capacity using what we have that is i believe possible and of course to continue to drive down the wafer cost robert sanders  deutsche bank ag thanks a lot tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv thanks rob next question please operator the next question is from mr veysel taze from oddo please go ahead veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah hi good morning veysel taze from oddo most of the questions have been addressed maybe one question regarding your auto business and the seasonality in the second half of the year i mean your silicon carbide design win is ramping up in q so do you expect in q further seasonality growth in your auto business and then on your silicon carbide business can you share with us your design win potential of what you have right now similar to the auto microcontroller and how that has changed throughout the first half of the year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv so again on the silicon carbide the ramp is now the contribution to revenues in q is limited we expect to have an important step in q of this year and importantly we see lets say significant opportunities to grow next year i think more in general in the automotive as i was mentioning before we see also a good drive in the following areas number one on this smart power technologies okay number two our microcontrollers dedicated to automotive im talking about the microcontrollers that we have in adg and number three the complex digital asics that we now sell particularly for advanced safety applications so we see a good momentum on this three technology clients for automotive so we expect an acceleration of the performance of our specific automotive group that is part of adg – of course its apg the automotive product group now part of adg we see an acceleration of the growth in the second part of this year but across the board in terms of technology coverage this – i think it was probably is responding to all your questions veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag yeah the thing is also – i guess in q there will be another sequential growth versus q then on the silicon carbide really like in your auto microcontroller you have this  billion design win potential you mentioned but – and just to get a color on the silicon carbide as theres a lot of moving parts there what would you see your current design win there just to quantify that if its possible for you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv but its not possible for me i mean i made the project and example from china because i can mention there was a press release i can – unfortunately we are working in the three regions so we are working in asia we are working in europe of course we are working in europe and we are working in united states but i cannot give more color i mean i tried before to give more color to this initiative in china that is important initiatives there are six or seven  that are pooling on the electric cars initiative and really we have won them the battery management system and i believe we can contribute with our technologies including silicon carbide but i cannot say more on other customers because of course its confidential veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay and then just a quick followup on your distribution business i think in h it was  of revenues what is your growth expectations for the entire year in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well in q it was  in q its  so we said these two times  but in q it was  our distribution point pop the billing and our billing to distribution customers but more importantly of course is the evolution of pointofsales the pointofsale is sequentially moving from q to q improved by  percentage point and if i look yearoveryear q over q the pointofsales increased  well we want to keep going the inventory are low even too low so we want to keep going with the pointofsales i think we have two priorities in distribution one priority is to make sure that the stm is more and more sticky and we have more and more products around the stm and of course this is demand creation and cooperating with our distributors on the demand creation and the second priority is the expansion of the customer base to have more and more customers and of course we are consistent i believe we have a strategy in distribution that is very consistent and we want to keep going with this level of performance in the pos and hopefully contributing a little bit more to the replenishment of the inventory with our distributors that are too low veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag so to come back on that one what is in your  growth yearoveryear revenue in the distribution part what is your yearoveryear growth would you assume here in your distribution business carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv we prefer veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag i think you mentioned the  on first half but what would be for the entire year carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv well i think this is an area where of course we need to be careful to provide information because this is not only us but it is also the sales of our distribution our ambition is to keep growing with this level of growth across the board so thats one  what will be the growth at the year end last year was pretty positive it was certainly very solid doubledigits in  and we want to repeat the performance this year i think we do not have any sign of change and we want to keep going but i think it is – it will be not appropriate for us to give a pos forecast now a pointofsales forecast for our distributors veysel taze  oddo seydler bank ag okay thank you thanks a lot gentlemen tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv okay based on time well take one more question please operator the last question is from lee simpson from stifel please go ahead lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in most of my questions have been asked but maybe if i could ask a couple of future questions just as it relates to the investments for the technology cycle so okay question one really around that wide bandgap semi space obviously coming into power quite notably via silicon carbide including opportunities with china but it looks to us that the sweet spot is emerging right across the voltage range for the need for higher efficiency transistors even in appliance charging so im just trying to understand how far do your ambitions go maybe in the next three to five years with wide bandgap semis would gallium nitride feature at some point and what sort of ip datasets would you be looking for second question – sorry quick one just on digital optics for the datacenters you mentioned some uptick there i think in design wins could you maybe just elaborate on that are we talking about new transceiver products for gpon that sort of thing or are we talking about perhaps pivoting to new materials like indium phosphide thanks carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv yeah well for the first one yes i think we have important ambition we are also working on gallium nitride we are not at the level in gallium nitride as we are in the silicon carbide but it is an important program in rd you are perfectly right we talk a lot about automotive but this is broad i think we see particularly with in the area of home appliances air conditioning systems a lot of opportunities for this kind of technology so really a lot of opportunities and we see opportunities of course also in the industry  the industrial internet so i think it is an important pillar of our strategy and we want to do much more there and for us where our igbt presence is more limited i think the silicon carbide and the innovation in the silicon carbide it is a great opportunity to make a step forward in this area to respond to the second part of the question no i think the bulk of this design win it is more on very advanced bicmos technologies that are used by our customers as we mentioned i think in my address before to build up subsystems including optical subsystems to be used for instance in datacenters but it is very advanced bicmos technologies and with this kind of technologies we can certainly contribute and this is mostly asics we can certainly contribute in the optical application as we said or lets say datacenters for instance but also in the new areas like the g we have a wave of asic products again on bicmos technologies pretty advanced bicmos technologies for g applications so just to respond to your question lee simpson  stifel nicolaus europe ltd great thanks thats a very frank answer thank you carlo bozotti  stmicroelectronics nv thank you tait sorensen  stmicroelectronics nv
