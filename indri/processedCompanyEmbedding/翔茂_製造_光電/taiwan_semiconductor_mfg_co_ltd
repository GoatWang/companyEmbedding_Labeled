industry during upturns tsmc must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand however during downturns it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities as a result the companys financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years this is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth tsmcs business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in q and a low in q in  tsmc was at the forefront of the foundry industry for highperformance lowpower applications leading major smartphone chip companies such as qualcomm mediatek and apple to place an increasing amount of orders while the competitors in the foundry industry primarily globalfoundries and united microelectronics corporation have encountered difficulties ramping leadingedge  nm capacity the leading integrated device manufacturers such as samsung and intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications for most of  tsmc saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand primarily due to chips for smartphone applications tsmc raised its financial guidance in march  and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ firstquarter results for q  revenues came in at nt billion with  nanometer technology business growing more than  from the previous quarter lead times for chip orders at tsmc increased due to a tight capacity situation putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules and in august  it was reported that tsmcs production capacity for the fourth quarter of  was already almost fully booked a scenario that had not occurred for many years which was described as being due to a rippleeffect due to tsmc landing cpu orders from apple however monthly sales for  peaked in october decreasing by  in november due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers tsmcs revenue for  saw growth of  over the previous year while tsmc has forecast that revenue for  will grow by  to  percent from  thanks to strong demand for its  nm process new  nm finfet process technology as well as continuing demand for  nm and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its
