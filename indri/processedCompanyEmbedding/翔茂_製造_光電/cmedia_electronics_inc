report this post email this post permalink to this post  stars longevity and complication april      by jesus      by jesus    version cmedia cmi wdm driver windows xp  prosnew interface with lots of options for surround and multiple speakers consyou can not add micophone input in the playback lots of annoying setup options that lead only to sound distortion and ecchoes over complicated and buggy after a video clip finishes playing you hear an echo residue sound summarywell i had an old cmi card and driver from  and decided to upgrade to this newer driver instalation was easy without needing to delete the old one just clicked setup from the decompressed folder this driver drives your card like a racing engine on a car with worn tires it is hard almost impossible to achieve natural sound it is either a little echoed or too crisp you hear sounds you would not hear with an old driver it extends the capability of the card but my sound input from the tv card is playback from microphone in jack and i cannot controll it can not add and remove sliders the tools button offers little options i do not recomend it for the generic plug in and play sound users while it can be the tool for sounf enthusiasts who havent got enough havoc in their brains try it for yourself if you wished you had more options from the old cmi  revert to the old one from device manager if you are not satisfied
