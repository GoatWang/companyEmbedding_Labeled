launches  meter long modules with  watts output and easy to install design module to be showcased at solar power international in october thornton colo sep   business wire  ascent solar technologies inc nasdaqasti a developer of flexible thinfilm solar modules announced today the launch of its new wavesoltm series of five meter long modules to complement its current portfolio of building integrated bipv and building applied bapv photovoltaic product portfolio wavesoltm wslb  is the highest power  meter flexible and lightweight cigs module available and another example of ascent solars dedication to and heritage of producing flexible lightweight high power cigs modules with large format m x m high power  watts high voltage up to  volts and high specific power  wattskg this new series of products is enabled by recent advances in our cigs monolithic integration process resulting in our new  cm x  cm building blocks which are four times the size of the current building block submodules the module family consists of fewer parts that reduce overall internal power losses and significantly reduces manufacturing and testing operations this product is specifically designed to meet the needs of large commercial scale rooftop installations by providing unique attributes that reduce bos costs and ease of integration into roofing components in a way this industry has yet to experience ascent solar plans to showcase the product in october of this year during the solar power international conference to be held in los angeles ca ascent solar president and ceo farhad moghadam added we are proud of our heritage and unwavering dedication to flexible cigs solar module manufacturing we intend to maintain our leading position as the preeminent manufacturer of flexible lightweight cigs modules for bipvbapv solutions by translating advances in production into worldleading modules that will enable the proliferation of solar while making it a cost effective solution we look forward to showcasing this module to the world during the solar power international convention next month as well as planning several beta site installations with existing customers about ascent
