as had nintendo for the wii console which succeeded the atibased nintendo gamecube on december   nvidia acquired uli electronics which at the time supplied thirdparty southbridge parts for chipsets to ati nvidias competitor in march  nvidia acquired hybrid graphics in december  nvidia along with its main rival in the graphics industry amd which had acquired ati received subpoenas from the us department of justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry forbes magazine named nvidia its company of the year for  citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous  years on january   nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of portalplayer inc in february  nvidia acquired ageia developer of the physx physics engine and physics processing unit nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the physx technology into its future gpu products in july  nvidia took a writedown of approximately  million on its firstquarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and gpus produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects nvidia however did not reveal the affected products in september  nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty gpus had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by apple inc dell and hp in september  nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement on january   nvidia signed a sixyear  billion crosslicensing agreement with intel ending all litigation between the two companies in november  after initially unveiling it at mobile world congress nvidia released its tegra  arm systemonchip for

performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning while driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars opensource software supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software development kit  in  the gpus were also brought online at the riken center for advanced intelligence project for fujitsu the company’s deep

premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search nvidia corporations most disappointing product in  gpu sales are booming but the company has struggled to find outlets for its tegra mobile chips timothy green tmfbargainbin dec   at am graphics chip company nvidia nasdaqnvda generates most of its revenue from the graphics processing units that go into graphics cards and  was a great year for that business during nvidias fiscal third quarter gpu sales rose  year over year despite weak demand for pcs and gaming gpu sales jumped  while strong gpu sales drove nvidias revenue and profits higher in  sales of the companys tegra socs slumped during the third quarter tegra revenue declined by  year over year following a  yearoveryear decline during the second quarter during the first nine months of nvidias fiscal year tegra revenue has slumped by  compared to the same period last year that makes tegra nvidias mostdisappointing product of  source nvidia whats going on with tegra nvidias tegra line of armbased socs were originally designed for use in mobile devices like smartphones in addition to automobiles and nvidias own devices the tegra  which was launched in  found its way into a variety of mobile devices as did the tegra  which launched in late  the original microsoft surface was powered by a tegra  chip and tesla used the tegra  to power the infotainment panel in the model s fiscal  which ended in january of that year marked the peak of nvidias tegra business with annual revenue of  million and a  million operating profit tegra  was launched in  and while it found its way into some major devices like the surface  nvidia managed fewer design wins overall the tegra i a version with an integrated modem was launched in early  but the product was mostly a dud nvidia acquired modem designer icera in  in an effort to integrate modems into its chips but the company shut down the icera unit this year marking the official end of its efforts to power mainstream mobile devices two versions of tegra have been released since then  the tegra k and the tegra x  and the focus has shifted toward gaming and automotive applications the only devices powered by the x are nvidias own devices including the shield settop box with the exception of alphabets googles pixel c android tablet which is not exactly a highvolume device progress in the automotive market has been impressive with about  million cars on the road today with tegra chips and  million in the pipeline but the tegra business is both smaller than it was a few year ago and unprofitable this story continued to play out in  as the oem portion of the tegra business rapidly vanished nvidia now sells a few different devices that use tegra chips and the occasional thirdparty device pops up now and then but automotive has become the most important part of the business earlier this year nvidia launched two tegrapowered automotive platforms drive cx and drive px aimed at powering incar screens and advanced driverassistance features respectively source nvidia the good news for nvidia investors is that theres nothing really wrong with the tegra segment the business of providing app processors for mobile devices has become incredibly competitive and the superior graphics capabilities of nvidias processors simply dont give the company an edge in the mainstream device market the company was right to step away from the smartphone market and refocus tegra despite the revenue and profit declines that the move caused the tegra segment should now be close to bottoming out in terms of revenue and with automotive sales growing by  year over year during the third quarter growth shouldnt be too far away for the tegra segment if automotive sales continue to grow quickly tegra could return to profitability within a few years its always disappointing for investors to see a product with so much potential perform poorly but the silver lining for nvidia is that theres a good chance that tegra wont be disappointing for too much longer timothy green owns shares of nvidia the motley fool owns shares of and recommends alphabet a shares alphabet c shares and tesla motors
