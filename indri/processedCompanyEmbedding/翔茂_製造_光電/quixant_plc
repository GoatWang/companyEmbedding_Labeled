reduced customer concentration ·     commenced volume shipments of gaming monitors ·     completed the earnings enhancing acquisition of densitron technologies plc for £m financed by cash and debt which provides strong sales force with experience selling into markets outside gaming   nick jarmany ceo of quixant commented i am delighted with the strong growth we achieved in  with both revenue and profits at record levels our core business of computer gaming platforms grew market share with increased sales across a wide range of customers and our decision to move into the market for gaming monitors has proved very successful volume shipments started in the middle of the year and our pipeline of business is strong   we completed the acquisition of densitron in november our first acquisition in the ten years we have been operating densitron provides us with a geographically diverse sales team broadening our global footprint as well as a wide and loyal customer base providing the opportunity to sell quixant products into other markets   we have had a strong start to  in both our core business and also gaming monitors and with the potential opportunities densitron provides in other markets i am confident the group is well placed to deliver strong growth in  and beyond   for further information please contact quixant plc tel     nick jarmany chief executive   jon jayal general manager       nominated adviser and broker   finncap ltd tel      matt goode corporate finance grant bergman corporate finance simon johnson corporate broking       financial pr   alma pr   john coles tel      hilary buchanan tel            chairmans statement   i am pleased to report on another strong year of growth and business success for quixant in  delivering record results  through continued execution of our corporate strategy we have achieved significant growth in both revenue and profits and have also invested to ensure a robust foundation for growth into  and beyond   we have seen growth across a range of size of customer in  and reduced customer concentration we also have a healthy pipeline of designins which we believe sets us in good stead for future growth the designin step represents a lengthy period of collaboration between the engineering teams of quixant and the customer in order to develop the customers game and integrate quixants products into their machines     as well as continuing to grow our market share in our core business of computer gaming platforms in  we have also started to reap the benefits from our decision to establish a business in gaming monitors  we have the opportunity to sell typically two or more monitors for every one computer board we sell per gaming machine  we have grown our resources to build our gaming monitors business and have already seen further success in securing new business in early  for monitors   in september  we announced an offer to purchase densitron technologies plc for £m financed through a combination of the companys cash reserves and new banking facilities  we completed the acquisition on  november   densitron supplies standard and custom electronic display solutions to industrial markets globally and has around  staff located in north america europe and asia  we believe there are significant opportunities for quixants products to be sold into other vertical markets outside gaming and have already seen some evidence of this  densitron has an established and experienced global sales force which has long term trusted relationships with companies in a wide range of industrial markets  through leveraging these relationships quixant has a significant opportunity to sell products into these other markets as all display solutions require some type of computer or electronics to drive them  we expect the acquisition to be earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership    we paid a full year dividend of p per share in may  and aligned to our progressive dividend policy and continued strengthening in the balance sheet the board is pleased to propose a  full year dividend of p per share a growth of  on the prior period    quixant has significant headroom to grow its market share in the gaming industry and we are confident of our prospects for continued strong growth in this area  the acquisition of densitron brings further opportunities for diversification into other markets and possible enhancement of this growth  we have had a strong start to  and are well positioned to achieve our growth targets for the year       chief executives report   i am delighted to report on another year of robust growth in   adjusted pretax profits for the year were  million growth of  on the prior period on the back of revenues of  million   million  we have achieved this strong growth alongside investment into the business to position us well for continued success in  and beyond  during the year which marked the tenth anniversary since foundation of the company we reached several important milestones in the development of quixant business   broad based revenue growth   our growth in  was broad based  we saw increased sales to tier  customers which was the primary engine to growth  pleasingly we also saw strong performance from several tier  customers which we have been working with for several years  they have launched new products which have been well received by the market and as a result their rate of consumption of computer platforms has grown  this underlines the benefits quixant brings in enabling customers rd teams to focus on game development   we have continued to consolidate our position in several tier  customer projects where we are designed in but have yet to deliver volume  we expect to see continued strengthened sales to tier  customers in    our customer concentration diminished in  with ainsworth falling to  of total revenue over the year    in total we shipped just under  units in     based on a  independent industry survey conducted by g magazine which suggests that the annual newreplacement cycle for machines is  per annum this would imply quixant occupied a  market share in newreplacement machines   new product development   we launched qmax a new flagship computer platform and several new monitor products to the gaming market in   qmax represents a new tier of performance for allinone gaming platforms  by utilising an innovative design we have harnessed the power of games console level graphics into a compact package which combines all of quixants benefits including optimised gaming features longevity of supply and high reliability  we had a product ready to demonstrate before amd had publically announced the chipset on which it was based and formally launched qmax on the same day as amds public announcement  so far reception from customers has been positive towards qmax as a solution for their high end casino products    in february  at the ice exhibition in london we launched the qxi as successor to the midrange qxi  the qxi is well suited to customers who need a compact fanless solution high performance graphics and the capability to drive up to three screens  both qmax and the qxi are optimised for k ultra hd graphics and video   during the year we were granted two new patents in the uk and us  the technology described by these patents is incorporated into the majority of quixants current product range and therefore the uk patent helpfully enables us to take advantage of the uk patent box regime   monitor products   quixant was founded to design manufacture and supply computer platforms to the manufacturers of electronic gaming machines  in doing so we created a strong culture of innovation and exceptional engineering design capabilities which combined with our taiwanese manufacturing capabilities and understanding of the gaming market enabled us to create computer products which lead the market  we have become a trusted technology partner with many customers who see us not only as a supplier of computer products but also as an innovative technology solutions provider  some of these customers have publically communicated this message   as a result we have identified opportunities to supply our customers with other components which are connected with the computer platform  in particular we have developed our own range of gaming monitors which are also high value components in gaming machines  we developed our monitor products range with the underpinning principle that customers faced the same constraints in terms of regulation reliability and quality for monitor products as for computer platforms  by moving into this area quixant has been able to extend its advantages to customers for another component in their machines and has been able to introduce combined technology benefits we commenced volume shipments of monitors to our first customer around the middle of the year and have a strong order book into  based on this earlier success in  we invested in an expert sales team based in germany to lead our global gaming monitors business  we believe there are substantial opportunities for growth in this area both into quixants existing customers and into new customers  we believe there are also opportunities for us to innovate in gaming monitors in conjunction with our computer products    acquisition of densitron   over the last few years we have been approached by a number of customers outside gaming who have identified the strengths quixant can bring to their business in their markets  in the past we have elected not to pursue these opportunities in order to focus on our core business  however we have always believed that at the appropriate time we would seek to expand our business into other markets   the acquisition of densitron brings a global sales team with strong business and a broad base of customers who operate in a range of industrial markets  the team has proven expertise in the sale of complex electronic display solutions to these markets and has built a significant and stable business in doing so  we believe the acquisition provides a strong platform from which to develop our business in industrial markets outside gaming    prior to the acquisition densitron was an aim listed company with over  years experience in the electronic technology sector  densitron provides a range of solutions to its customers many of which are bespoke comprising a range of complex technologies  we believe the sales team have the skills to consult and identify customer requirements and expertise in the solutions available in the market to guide the customer in making the correct choice which has earned them the reputation of being a trusted partner   quixants skills and strengths particularly in its taiwanese procurement quality control and manufacturing management capabilities complements densitrons strength in sales  we believe this has the potential to enhance profitability product quality engineering design capability and purchasing power   densitrons business in  saw growth in revenue and operating profit in line with its budgets and following completion made a small positive contribution to quixants  financial performance    we have been working hard since completion of the acquisition to globally harmonise densitrons systems and policies  in  we will continue efforts in this area to create an enhanced global infrastructure on which to grow the business   investing for the future   excluding densitron our headcount increased by  from  to  in    of our staff at  december  were directly responsible for product development   of our overheads were directly attributable to rd activities representing reinvestment of  of revenue and  of gross profit into rd    when combined with densitron total group headcount at  december  was    in a business with operations which span  continents good communication and collaboration tools are essential to success  quixant invested in this area in  by rolling out a global video conferencing system and a collaborative digital whiteboard solution  the latter enables participants in two or more locations to engage in a common shared electronic whiteboard space to brainstorm and collaborate on ideas  users can also present annotate and modify a range of content interactively which enhances the product development process across the group by enabling remotely located colleagues to work as if they are in one location    outlook   quixants opportunity in its core gaming platforms business continues to strengthen as the trend for the largest of the gaming machine manufacturers to outsource gathers momentum  combined with a buoyant start in the gaming monitors business and the potential growth that densitron brings into other markets the group is well aligned to deliver strong growth in line with our expectations for  and beyond        financial review   revenue   quixant delivered record revenues of  million up  from   million the acquisition of densitron made a contribution of  million to revenue following completion   within quixants gaming business revenue growth was driven by the continuing development of our commercial relationships particularly in the tier  and tier  space with europe proving in aggregate to be a strong region for growth in addition to our established range of computer platforms we commenced volume shipments of our gaming monitors in  we have broadened our customer base both in number to    and across geographies   as a supplier of key components in gaming machines which are subject to heavy regulation we are required by customers to supply a consistent product over a period of several years  as a result we typically hold multiyear supply contracts with our larger customers  this provides us with a degree of repeatability and security to our revenue stream   profit   our gross profit for the year was  million   million representing a gross margin of    this reduction reflects the lower margins which can be earned on gaming monitors and densitrons display solutions   adjusted ebitda increased  to  million   million   adjusted profit before tax increased  to  million   million adjustments to ebitda and profit before tax are to add back share based payments and acquisition costs of  million   million   we continue to reinvest in the business to ensure our product offering remains a market leading proposition  excluding densitron gross expenditure on rd was  million   million or  of gross profit   these costs relate to our development activities undertaken in taiwan and italy  million of these development costs were capitalised   million with amortisation for the year on total capitalised development costs  million   million   balancing the investment requirements of the business to support future growth with careful management of increases resulted in an overhead spend of  million including exceptional costs of m   million  following completion densitron contributed  million to overheads our headcount increase to  people   was the biggest contributor to our increased spend     taxation   there is a tax charge for the year of  million   million this constitutes a corporation tax charge which includes prior period adjustments of  million   million and a deferred tax charge of  million   million the group continues to benefit from enhanced tax reliefs available in respect of qualifying rd expenditure   foreign exchange   to minimise foreign currency exposure the group transacts and reports in us dollars as far as is practicable with effect from  january  densitron have converted to accounting in us dollars where significant nonus dollar expenses can be forecast with respect to timing and value the board may take the decision to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate movements     earnings per share   basic earnings per share increased  to     fully diluted earnings per share increased  to      adjusted fully diluted earnings per share increased  to    the calculations of earnings per share are included at note    balance sheet   the group maintains a strong balance sheet with net assets of  million   million   tangible noncurrent assets have grown primarily because of the acquisition of our new office in italy and the inclusion of investment land owned by densitron which is valued at  million intangible noncurrent assets increased by  million to  million mainly due to goodwill arising on the acquisition together with the recognition of intangibles acquired with densitron   current assets mainly comprise inventory and trade receivables  excluding the impact of the acquisition we held inventory of  million   million this is consistent with our inventory strategy which is structured such as to hold buffer inventory of key product lines this is a competitive advantage quixant can offer over other suppliers the trade receivables of  million   million reflect the fact that our revenues are typically weighted towards the second half of the year   noncurrent liabilities now include the banking facilities of  million required to support the densitron acquisition as well as the longterm borrowings acquired all liabilities are within the groups payment profile   cash flow   the group continued to generate high levels of operating cash over the year the cash generated amounted to  million   million investment in our inventory strategy previously mentioned was first implemented in  which is a key reason current period operating cash is significantly higher than that of the prior period   to support our growth aspirations the group spent  million   million on investing activities this is primarily accounted for by  million  nil of costs relating to acquisitions   new financing cash flows for the period under review principally relate to an inflow of  million in respect of new banking facilities and an outflow in respect of repayment of borrowings   our overall cash outflow during the period was  million   million which gave a cash and cash equivalents balance at the yearend of  million   million  we are in the process of reviewing group treasury strategy following the acquisition    dividend   the board intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy whilst continuing to invest in and to develop the groups businesses as such the board proposes a dividend in respect of the year of p per share  p per share payable on  may  to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on  may   the corresponding exdividend date is  may    outlook   the  financial year has started well and we are confident of another year of strong growth in line with our expectations       consolidated statement
