bypassed it was reported that this backdoor had been present for some time computerworld reported in january  that zynos a firmware used by some dlink routers as well as zte tplink and others are

vulnerabilities and worse introducing new vulnerabilities in their fixed firmware updates on january   the federal trade commission sued dlink for failing to take reasonable steps to secure their routers and ip cameras as dlink marketing was misleading customers into believing their products were secure the complaint also says security gaps could allow hackers to watch and record people on their dlink cameras without their knowledge target them for theft or record private conversations dlink has denied these accusations and has enlisted cause of action institute to file a motion against the ftc for their baseless charges server misuseedit in  dlink was accused of ntp vandalism when it was found that its routers were sending time requests to a small ntp server in denmark incurring

is manually entered in your ip configuration settings you must enter the ip address subnet mask gateway primary dns server and secondary dns server your isp provides you with all of this information dhcp wan mode a method of connection where the isp assigns your ip address when your router requests one from the isps server some isps require you to make some settings on your side before your router can connect to the internet host name some isps may check your computers host name the host name identifies your system to the isps server this way they know your computer is eligible to receive an ip address in other words they know that you are paying for their service use unicasting this option is normally turned off and should remain off as long as the wanside dhcp server correctly provides an ip address to the router however if the router cannot obtain an ip address from the dhcp server the dhcp server may be one that works better with unicast responses in this case turn the unicasting option on and observe whether the router can obtain an ip address in this mode the router accepts unicast responses from the dhcp server instead of broadcast responses pppoe select

server dns stands for domain name system the dns servers act as a phonebook and translate the humanfriendly domain name into its corresponding ip address advanced dns services for dlink is powered by best path networks a subsidiary of opendns that provides antiphishing and dns services to partners like dlink opendns is the worlds largest and fastestgrowing provider of free security and dns infrastructure services advanced dns services makes your online experience safer and your internet overall faster and more reliable the dns platform is designed to not interfere with any specific protocol however a small subset of spam filtering solutions may be confused by receiving search responses for domains that do not exist it is recommended that the enhanced search experience be disabled for clients that operate an onsite mail server dns does not affect upload or download speeds these are controlled exclusively by your internet service provider dlink and best path networks do not collect or store any personally identifiable dns information about advanced dns services users your search results are powered by yahoo the search function provides you with a much more fluid browsing experience when a site cannot be reached or a site does not exist we will provide you with search suggestions instead of the generic error message displayed by your browser we also automatically correct some of the common typos users make in the address bar the typocorrection feature only works for top level domains that have been misspelled such cmo and ogr sometimes you might be misdirected to the search results page if you clicked on a link in a spam email it is quite possible that the site has been disabled for abuse because the site no longer exists you may receive our search page primary dns server secondary dns server enter the ip addresses of the dns servers leave the field for the secondary server empty if not used mtu the maximum transmission unit mtu is a parameter that determines the largest packet size in bytes that the router will send to the wan if lan devices send larger packets the router will break them into smaller packets ideally you should set this to match the mtu of the connection to your isp typical values are  bytes for an ethernet connection and  bytes for a pppoe connection if the routers mtu is set too high packets will be fragmented downstream if the routers mtu is set too low the router will fragment packets unnecessarily and in extreme cases may be unable to establish some connections in either case network performance can suffer mac address each networking device has its own unique mac address defined by the hardware manufacturer some isps may check your computers mac address some isps record the mac address of the network adapter in the computer or router used to initially connect to their service the isp will then only grant internet access to requests from a computer or router with this particular mac address this router has a different mac address than the computer or router that initially connected to the isp if you need to change the mac address of the routers wanside ethernet interface either type in an alternate mac address for example the mac address of the router initially connected to the isp or copy the mac address of a pc to copy the mac address of the computer that initially connected to the isp connect to the dlink router using that computer and click the clone your pcs mac address button the wan interface will then use the mac address of the network adapter in your computer wireless the wireless section is used to configure the wireless settings for your dlink router note that changes made in this section may also need to be duplicated on wireless clients that you want to connect to your wireless network to protect your privacy use the wireless security mode to configure the wireless security features this device supports three wireless security modes including wep wpapersonal and wpaenterprise wep is the original wireless encryption standard wpa provides a higher level of security wpapersonal does not require an authentication server the wpaenterprise option does require a radius authentication server enable wireless this option turns off and on the wireless connection feature of the router when you set this option the following parameters are in effect wireless network name when you are browsing for available wireless networks this is the name that will appear in the list unless visibility status is set to invisible see below this name is also referred to as the ssid for security purposes it is highly recommended to change from the preconfigured network name enable auto channel scan if you select this option the router automatically finds the channel with least interference and uses that channel for wireless networking if you disable this option the router uses the channel that you specify with the following wireless channel option wireless channel a wireless network uses specific channels in the wireless spectrum to handle communication between clients some channels in your area may have interference from other electronic devices choose the clearest channel to help optimize the performance and coverage of your wireless network  mode if all of the wireless devices you want to connect with this router can connect in the same transmission mode you can improve performance slightly by choosing the appropriate only mode if you have some devices that use a different transmission mode choose the appropriate mixed mode channel width the auto  mhz option is usually best the other options are available for special circumstances visibility status the invisible option allows you to hide your wireless network when this option is set to visible your wireless network name is broadcast to anyone within the range of your signal if youre not using encryption then they could connect to your network when invisible mode is enabled you must enter the wireless network name ssid on the client manually to connect to the network security mode unless one of these encryption modes is selected wireless transmissions to and from your wireless network can be easily intercepted and interpreted by unauthorized users wep a method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended to provide the same level of privacy as a wired network wep is not as secure as wpa encryption to gain access to a wep network you must know the key the key is a string of characters that you create when using wep you must determine the level of encryption the type of encryption determines the key length bit encryption requires a longer key than bit encryption keys are defined by entering in a string in hex hexadecimal  using characters  af or ascii american standard code for information interchange  alphanumeric characters format ascii format is provided so you can enter a string that is easier to remember the ascii string is converted to hex for use over the network four keys can be defined so that you can change keys easily a default key is selected for use on the network example bit hexadecimal keys are exactly  characters in length fa is a valid string of  characters for bit encryption bit hexadecimal keys are exactly  characters in length fbcdf is a valid string of  characters for bit encryption bit ascii keys are up to  characters in length dmode is a valid string of  characters for bit encryption bit ascii keys are up to  characters in length haloswin is a valid string of  characters for bit encryption note that if you enter fewer characters in the wep key than required the remainder of the key is automatically padded with zeros wpapersonal and wpaenterprise both of these options select some variant of wifi protected access wpa  security standards published by the wifi alliance the wpa mode further refines the variant that the router should employ wpa mode wpa is the older standard select this option if the clients that will be used with the router only support the older standard wpa is the newer implementation of the stronger ieee i security standard with the wpa option the router tries wpa first but falls back to wpa if the client only supports wpa with the wpa only option the router associates only with clients that also support wpa security group key update interval the amount of time before the group key used for broadcast and multicast data is changed wpapersonal this option uses wifi protected access with a preshared key psk preshared key the key is entered as a passphrase of up to  alphanumeric characters in ascii american standard code for information interchange format at both ends of the wireless connection it cannot be shorter than eight characters although for proper security it needs to be of ample length and should not be a commonly known phrase this phrase is used to generate session keys that are unique for each wireless client example wireless networking technology enables ubiquitous communication wpaenterprise this option works with a radius server to authenticate wireless clients wireless clients should have established the necessary credentials before attempting to authenticate to the server through this gateway furthermore it may be necessary to configure the radius server to allow this gateway to authenticate users authentication timeout amount of time before a client will be required to reauthenticate radius server ip address the ip address of the authentication server radius server port the port number used to connect to the authentication server radius server shared secret a passphrase that must match with the authentication server mac address authentication if this is selected the user must connect from the same computer whenever logging into the wireless network advanced optional backup radius server this option enables configuration of an optional second radius server a second radius server can be used as backup for the primary radius server the second radius server is consulted only when the primary server is not available or not responding the fields second radius server ip address radius server port second radius server shared secret second mac address authentication provide the corresponding parameters for the second radius server network settings router settings these are the settings of the lan local area network interface for the router the routers local network lan settings are configured based on the ip address and subnet mask assigned in this section the ip address is also used to access this webbased management interface it is recommended that you use the default settings if you do not have an existing network ip address the ip address of your router on the local area network your local area network settings are based on the address assigned here for example  subnet mask the subnet mask of your router on the local area network device name device name allows you to configure this device easily when your network using tcpip protocol you can enter the device name of the router instead of ip address into your web browser to access for configuration recommend to change the device name if theres more than on dlink devices within the subnet local domain name this entry is optional enter a domain name for the local network the aps dhcp server will give this domain name to the computers on the wireless lan so for example if you enter mynetworknet here and you have a wireless laptop with a name of chris that laptop will be known as chrismynetworknet note however if the aps settings specify dhcp dynamic address and the routers dhcp server assigns a domain name to the ap that domain name will override any name you enter here dns relay when dns relay is enabled the router plays the role of a dns server dns requests sent to the router are forwarded to the isps dns server this provides a constant dns address that lan computers can use even when the router obtains a different dns server address from the isp upon reestablishing the wan connection you should disable dns relay if you implement a lanside dns server as a virtual server dhcp server settings dhcp stands for dynamic host configuration protocol the dhcp section is where you configure the builtin dhcp server to assign ip addresses to the computers and other devices on your local area network lan enable dhcp server once your dlink router is properly configured and this option is enabled the dhcp server will manage the ip addresses and other network configuration information for computers and other devices connected to your local area network there is no need for you to do this yourself the computers and other devices connected to your lan also need to have their tcpip configuration set to dhcp or obtain an ip address automatically when you set enable dhcp server the following options are displayed dhcp ip address range these two ip values from and to define a range of ip addresses that the dhcp server uses when assigning addresses to computers and devices on your local area network any addresses that are outside of this range are not managed by the dhcp server these could therefore be used for manually configured devices or devices that cannot use dhcp to obtain network address details automatically it is possible for a computer or device that is manually configured to have an address that does reside within this range in this case the address should be reserved see dhcp reservation below so that the dhcp server knows that this specific address can only be used by a specific computer or device your dlink router by default has a static ip address of  this means that addresses  to  can be made available for allocation by the dhcp server example your dlink router uses  for the ip address youve assigned a computer that you want to designate as a web server with a static ip address of  youve assigned another computer that you want to designate as an ftp server with a static ip address of  therefore the starting ip address for your dhcp ip address range needs to be  or greater example suppose you configure the dhcp server to manage addresses from  to  this means that  to  and  to  are not managed by the dhcp server computers or devices that use addresses from these ranges are to be manually configured suppose you have a web server computer that has a manually configured address of  because this falls within the managed range be sure to create a reservation for this address and match it to the relevant computer see static dhcp client below dhcp lease time the amount of time that a computer may have an ip address before it is required to renew the lease the lease functions just as a lease on an apartment would the initial lease designates the amount of time before the lease expires if the tenant wishes to retain the address when the lease is expired then a new lease is established if the lease expires and the address is no longer needed than another tenant may use the address always broadcast if all the computers on the lan successfully obtain their ip addresses from the routers dhcp server as expected this option can remain disabled however if one of the computers on the lan fails to obtain an ip address from the routers dhcp server it may have an old dhcp client that incorrectly turns off the broadcast flag of dhcp packets enabling this option will cause the router to always broadcast its responses to all clients thereby working around the problem at the cost of increased broadcast traffic on the lan netbios advertisement check this box to allow the dhcp server to offer netbios configuration settings to the lan hosts netbios allow lan hosts to discover all other computers within the network eg within network neighbourhood learn netbios information from wan if netbios advertisement is swicthed on switching this setting on causes wins information to be learned from the wan side if available turn this setting off to configure manually primary wins server ip address configure the ip address of the preferred wins server wins servers store information regarding network hosts allowing hosts to register themselves as well as discover other available hosts eg for use in network neighbourhood this setting has no effect if the learn netbios information from wan is activated secondary wins server ip address configure the ip address of the backup wins server if any this setting has no effect if the learn netbios information from wan is activated netbios scope this is an advanced setting and is normally left blank this allows the configuration of a netbios domain name under which network hosts operate this setting has no effect if the learn netbios information from wan is activated netbios registration mode indicates how network hosts are to perform netbios name registration and discoveryhnode this indicates a hybridstate of operation first wins servers are tried if any followed by local network broadcast this is generally the preferred mode if you have configured wins serversmnode default this indicates a mixedmode of operation first broadcast operation is performed to register hosts and discover other hosts if broadcast operation fails wins servers are tried if any this mode favours broadcast operation which may be preferred if wins servers are reachable by a slow network link and the majority of network services such as servers and printers are local to the lanpnode this indicates to use wins servers only this setting is useful to force all netbios operation to the configured wins servers you must have configured at least the primary wins server ip to point to a working wins serverbnode this indicates to use local network broadcast only this setting is useful where there are no wins servers available however it is preferred you try mnode operation firstthis setting has no effect if the learn netbios information from wan is activated addedit dhcp reservation this option lets you reserve ip addresses and assign the same ip address to the network device with the specified mac address any time it requests an ip address this is almost the same as when a device has a static ip address except that the device must still request an ip address from the dlink router the dlink router will provide the device the same ip address every time dhcp reservations are helpful for server computers on the local network that are hosting applications such as web and ftp servers on your network should either use a static ip address or use this option computer name you can assign a name for each computer that is given a reserved ip address this may help you keep track of which computers are assigned this way example game server ip address the lan address that you want to reserve mac address to input the mac address of your system enter it in manually or connect to the dlink routers webmanagement interface from the system and click the copy your pcs mac address button a mac address is usually located on a sticker on the bottom of a network device the mac address is comprised of twelve digits each pair of hexadecimal digits are usually separated by dashes or colons such as d or d if your network device is a computer and the network card is already located inside the computer you can connect to the dlink router from the computer and click the copy your pcs mac address button to enter the mac address as an alternative you can locate a mac address in a specific operating system by following the steps below windows  windows me go to the start menu select run type in winipcfg and hit enter a popup window will be displayed select the appropriate adapter from the pulldown menu and you will see the adapter address this is the mac address of the device windows  windows xp go to your start menu select programs select accessories and select command prompt at the command prompt type ipconfig all and hit enter the physical address displayed for the adapter connecting to the router is the mac address mac os x go to the apple menu select system preferences select network and select the ethernet adapter connecting to the dlink router select the ethernet button and the ethernet id will be listed this is the same as the mac address dhcp reservations list this shows clients that you have specified to have reserved dhcp addresses an entry can be changed by clicking the edit icon or deleted by clicking the delete icon when you click the edit icon the item is highlighted and the edit dhcp reservation section is activated for editing number of dynamic dhcp clients in this section you can see what lan devices are currently leasing ip addresses revoke the revoke option is available for the situation in which the lease table becomes full or nearly full you need to recover space in the table for new entries and you know that some of the currently allocated leases are no longer needed clicking revoke cancels the lease for a specific lan device and frees an entry in the lease table do this only if the device no longer needs the leased ip address because for example it has been removed from the network reserve the reserve option converts this dynamic ip allocation into a dhcp reservation and adds the corresponding entry to the dhcp reservations list usb settings shareport select to share a usb printer scanner or storage device connected to the usb port behind the router with multiple users within your network support device drivers and the dlink usb network utility must be installed on each computer that will use the device wcn configuration select to configure your wireless network using windows connect now wcn wcn allows you to copy your wireless settings from the router to a usb flash drive and use to automatically configure the wireless settings on your computers or other wcncompatible devices        copyright   dlink corporation inc dir
