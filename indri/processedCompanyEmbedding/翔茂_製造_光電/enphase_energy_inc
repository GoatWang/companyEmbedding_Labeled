financials from enphase energy  enphase energy is a nasdaqlisted energy technology company headquartered in petaluma california enphase designs and manufactures softwaredriven home energy solutions that span solar generation home energy storage and webbased monitoring and control enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters primarily into the residential and commercial markets in north america europe and australia microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel dc directly into gridcompatible alternating current ac for use or export enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale and remains the market leader contents  history  products  legacy products  current products  references  external links historyedit a number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar microinverter concept through the s the basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel this so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel producing an ac panel such a system can be connected directly to the grid or to each other to produce larger arrays this contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the dcside and then run enmasse to a single larger inverter several products based on the microinverter concept were introduced in the s and especially the early s but none were widely successful due to a number of factors in the aftermath of the  telecoms crash martin fornage of cerent corporation was looking for new projects when he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch he formed enphase energy with another cerent engineer raghu belur in  backed by  million in private equity in  they released their first product the m to moderate success their nd generation product s m was far more successful with sales of about  units in  and early  enphase quickly grew to  marketshare for residential systems by mid aiming for  by yearend they shipped their th inverter in early  and their th in september of the same year the rd generation m was released in the summer of  and had sold over a million of all models in  bringing their installed base to  million inverters and  market share a th generation the m was released in  as of update their inverters captured  market share for residential installations in the us which represents  of the entire world microinverter market this makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer of any kind worldwide enphase has experimented with the european market starting in france and offering sales in france belgium the netherlands luxembourg and italy however they had considerably more success in the uk and later australia as of update approximately  of their sales is outside north america enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market in spite of several effects that should cause stability prices for inverters are predicted to fall  during  market leaders especially face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies most of them from the far east productsedit an enphase m mounted and grounded all enphase microinverters are basically the same internally with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models legacy productsedit the m was their first product released in  it was designed to output  watts of ac power but is capable of up to  over that the m was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twistlock connection a limited number of m models based on the same generation system were also available for a limited time due to a high level of failures the m was recalled and replaced by the m in  the m offers a slightly higher power rating of  watts peaking to  the system was packaged in a much smaller case this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation and builtin cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings the system was otherwise similar using the same connectors and cabling as the m and the two designs could be mixed in a string like its predecessor the m the m has also been plagued by a high failure rate around the same time the company also released the d which was essentially two ms in a single larger case for small inverters like the m the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out the d also introduced a new interinverter cabling system based on a drop cable system this placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it arrays were constructed by linking together up to three ds with a single drop cable and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twistfit connectors current productsedit in  the entire lineup was replaced with the rd generation m combining the features of the m and d like the m the m was a single inverter now in a much smaller box like the d the m used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters however instead of one or threedrop cable the ms engage system used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it the installer cuts the engage cable to the required length and then caps the open ends that result in  the m was released offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise nec  required external grounding conductor increased reliability and increased efficiency  along with a rating bump to w whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating the m actually refers to its peak power using the same convention the m would be called the m the m is otherwise identical to the earlier m and compatible with the same engage cabling system all enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the envoy communications gateway the envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year and when available allows enphases enlighten web service to download data approximately every  minutes customers and installers can review the data on the enlighten web site in  the company launched its fifth generation of products the s and s microinverters have the highest efficiency for modulelevel power electronics at  offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control and comply with regulatory requirements like electric rule  in california and rule h in hawaii the nextgen envoys offers revenuegrade metering of solar production consumption monitoring and integrated wifi the company also moved into home energy storage with its storage system featuring an ac battery a modular kwh lithiumiron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a home
