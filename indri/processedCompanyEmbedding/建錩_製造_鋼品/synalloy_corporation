universal stainless  alloy products inc nasdaqusap universal stainless and has presented the universal stainless board of directors with an initial proposal to merge the two companies  craig bram president and ceo of synalloy corporation said we believe that a combination of synalloy and universal stainless offers immediate as well as future value to both shareholder groups  product lines distribution channels end markets served and geographic proximity of manufacturing facilities provide opportunities for cost savings and new business development  additionally the elimination of duplicative corporate overhead and related public company costs is estimated at  million annually  bram shared in a normalized demand market the combined company would have annual revenue and ebitda of  million and  million respectively  the balance sheet would be substantially larger providing the resources to more aggressively pursue a growth by acquisition strategy  the market cap of the merged entity would easily place the company in the russell  providing the potential for additional share price appreciation and greater liquidity for shareholders  ultimately the metals segment of
