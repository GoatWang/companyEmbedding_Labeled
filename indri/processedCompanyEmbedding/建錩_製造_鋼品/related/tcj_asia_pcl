people with limited access to banking services photo reuterssingapore over the past two months some  parttime workers for dbs group holdings ltd have fanned out across singapore’s famed food courts trying to entice momandpop hawkers to use the bank’s digital payments service called paylah“hawkers need speed and they are afraid that using paylah may not be fast enough when the queues are very very long” yearold erica chiang who has signed up  food vendors in her seven weeks working for dbs said on a sweltering wednesday afternoon “once they know the product they become interested”chiang is on the front lines of a push consuming banks across southeast asia these days defending against jack ma’s alibaba group holding ltd and its payments affiliate ant financial which are targeting the region as a major growth marketsoutheast asia’s banks have long been spared the competitive onslaught that saw their peers in china cede that nation’s giant payments market to ant financial and tencent holdings ltd that’s about to change as ma lines up partnerships across the region to win over some of the estimated  million people with limited access to banking services—and then use that position to go after the lenders’ core customers“we view the ‘big techs’ with large platforms as the ones we should be more concerned with” said sandeep lal head of digital banking at dbsgovernment helpunderscoring the perceived threat singapore’s government on tuesday proposed new rules to make it easier for banks to invest in nonfinancial businesses including ecommerce and digitalpayment platforms in announcing the move finance minister heng swee keat cited “increasing competition from online and nonfinancial players”digital payments in southeast asia home to some 6 million people may reach  billion this year according to the research firm statista the transition to digital offerings will put pressure on other lucrative areas for banks like crossborder transactions said james lloyd a hong kongbased fintech specialist at consultancy ey“banks will not be making the same profit margins in this market in five years” lloyd saidchina stands as a looming reminder of what happens when banks don’t respond quickly enough alipay and an offering from tencent carved up more than  of the country’s  trillion mobile payments market between them in just four yearsant financial has set up partnerships in thailand indonesia and the philippines to offer services like lending and money transfers together with alibaba it is also piecing together a digital payments business in heavilybanked singaporeant financial’s tieup with ascend money a unit of bangkokbased retail and telecoms conglomerate charoen pokphand group illustrates its approach charoen pokphand runs the eleven franchise in thailand which has almost  outlets across the country thais can sign up for ascend money’s product—known locally as truemoney—in eleven outlets and use it to pay for online shopping or at a range of stores even if they don’t have regular bank accounts they can top up their truemoney accounts in elevens with cashthe eleven network dwarfs even thailand’s largest bank bangkok bank pcl which has about  branches across the country and ascend says it has more than  million users across southeast asia mostly in thailandtwo steps“we start by serving the underserved unserved customers similar to in china” said doug feagin the former goldman sachs group inc partner who now oversees ant financial’s international operations “then we look to expand that to a much broader customer base”ma through alibaba and ant financial is also stitching together an ecommerce and payments network in singapore through the acquisitions of lazada group sa onlinegrocer redmart and hellopay a mobile payments service now rebranded as alipay lazada involved in ecommerce payments transport and storage on wednesday said alibaba will invest another  billion in the company to boost its stake to dbs is moving to

year for investment in digitalbanking technology“if we don’t do anything we believe there could be an impact to our business and revenue” said michael foong maybank’s chief strategy officerthe banks that fail to adapt will face a doublewhammy of lost customers and higher costs according to denis bugrov a senior advisor at mckinsey  co as customers switch to mobile payments the lenders may find it harder to justify the expense of their branch networks“those that don’t do that will obviously get stuck with a highcost base that will become a disadvantage and smart and sophisticated people like alibaba will then come in and potentially do that customer adoption themselves” bugrov said bloombergfirst published fri jun     pm isttopics jack ma southeast asia alibaba ant financial ecommerce
