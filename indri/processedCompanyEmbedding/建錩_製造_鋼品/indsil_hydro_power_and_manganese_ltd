silico manganese low carbon and ultra low carbon silico manganese improve the productivity in the manufacture of stainless steel and special steel by eliminating decarburization in final step the use of low carbon silico manganese in stainless steels and alloy steels provides a more economical production route where a combination of manganese and silicon is required in a low carbon steel product low carbon silico manganese manganese alloys are mostly used in steelmaking and foundry activities some  of the manganese used today in steelmaking is used to promote the formation of sulphides as a deoxidant in this last case it combines with sulphur avoiding the formation of iron sulphides these sulphides are low melting point phases which become liquid at hot rolling temperatures and which consequently generate surface cracking the other  of the manganese is used purely as an alloying element steels usually contain from  to  manganese depending on grades as manganese is the cheapest alloying element among those which enhance some key mechanical properties like strength and toughness in the specific case of stainless steel it can substitute expensive nickel in some austenitic grades called  series there are two families of manganese alloys called ferromanganese femn and silicomanganese simn silicomanganese adds additional silicon which is a stronger deoxidant nitrogen boron titanium phosphorus are elements which can be controlled depending on requested specification a very specific application of refined manganese alloys is a  constituent in the coating of welding electrodes ferro chrome ferrochrome will be produced out of a joint venture company in oman and the chrome smelter would have access to captive chrome ore making it a highly cost effective chrome smelting complex exports to various regions of the globe comprise about  of the group’s market portfolio over  of the world’s ferrochrome is utilised in the production of stainless steel stainless steel depends on chromium for its appearance and its resistance to corrosion it is also used when it is desired to add chromium to carbon steel more commonly used in specialist applications such as engineering steels where a high cr to fe ratio and minimum levels of other elements such as sulfur phosphorus and titanium are important and production of finished metals   ferro silicon ferrosilicon is used as a source of silicon to reduce metals from their oxides and to deoxidize steel and other ferrous alloys this prevents the loss of carbon from the molten steel so called blocking the heat ferro manganese spiegeleisen silicides of calcium and many other materials are used for the same purpose it can be used to make other ferroalloys ferrosilicon is also used for manufacture of silicon corrosionresistant and hightemperature resistant ferrous silicon alloys and silicon steel for electromotors and transformer cores in the manufacture of cast iron ferrosilicon is used for inoculation of the iron to accelerate graphitization in arc welding ferrosilicon can be found in some electrode coatings     recommended browsers  google chrome mozilla firefox and ie  copyright  all rights
