methods of construction leading to larger gestation period in construction since early ’s especially after opening up of the economy the need for infrastructure in the country has grown exponentially and with expected high gdp growth the infrastructure growth is expected to remain strong the growth of infrastructure sector led to the requirement of faster deliveries and reduction in the construction time to create the infrastructure facilities required by the country especially in the building segment human resource we seek to retain our talent through better career growth and a

activities being taken up in that area it is always beneficial for the customer to procure from local producers to save on transportation costs and this is also helpful to the producer due to lower cycle time the products envisaged by us will generally cater to the three major construction sectors like infrastructure industrial construction and housing  commercial construction client servicing since this concept is relatively new we also provide after sales service to provide comfort to the clients in usage of this concept as well as to derive the optimal value from usage of readymade steel
