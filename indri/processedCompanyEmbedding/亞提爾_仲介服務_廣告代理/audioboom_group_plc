platform adoption by key content partners to ensure that the company remains the hosting and distribution platform of choice for some of the worlds leading content creators the companys business model is now based principally on entering into advertising revenue share agreements with content creators principally broadcasters and publishers using the audioboom platform to embed audio content across their own websites mobile apps and other distribution channels such as facebook and twitter  each piece of audio provides an opportunity to place traditional audio or video ads at the beginning middle and end of the content pre mid and post roll advertising working with content partners third parties andor programmatic advertising exchanges audioboom seeks to secure advertising to place on its inventory of audio content on the audioboom platform  it will share the proceeds of such advertising with the content creator on a preagreed revenue share basis  revenue will be driven by the number of listens to the particular content and the cpm rate at which the advertising is secured  the cpm is the cost per thousand listens of audio that the advertiser is willing to pay and dictates the revenue for audioboom  cpms may differ according to various factors including the type and length of content the target audience and whether the advert is pre mid or post roll inread advertising where the presenter promotes a product or brand during the broadcast also presents a significant mediumterm opportunity and which typically attracts higher cpms with the strategic shift in the groups business model from its early focus on the consumer app to a more scalable advertisingdistribution model so have the companys key performance indicators kpis evolved the companys focus now is on ·     content partners  third party brands broadcasters publishers and producers who post content to the audioboom platform and   ·     listens  the number of times users consume audioboom hosted content via embeddable content players on third party websites or apps on audiobooms own website or apps or via other distribution channels such as itunes   which will ultimately generate advertising revenue for the company during fy the company entered into an advertising revenue share agreement with cumulus media holdings inc cumulus the second largest radio group in the us for cumulus to use the audioboom platform to provide ondemand creative hosting broadcasting and advertising tools for its radio network encompassing over  stations over  nationally syndicated shows and over  million unique listeners cumulus monetises this digital ondemand content through the sale of preroll and postroll video audio and display advertising as well as inread native advertising for high profile

as announced today for h  the six month period to  may  the company has made tangible progress in growing revenue securing significant new content partners and further broadening its geographic distribution this progress includes ·   major new content distribution and monetisation partnerships with companies such as spotify nbc sports univision and saavn an american digital distributor of

world   ·      the company achieving its  billion lifetime listen and   ·      content partner channels to  up  h     during fy and h  it has become clear to the company that the key markets of the us and india present the greatest opportunity for monetisation as set out in the companys interim results audioboom is now building momentum in the us the worlds largest media market with us based users accounting for  per cent of listens in the period compared with approximately  per cent  months earlier the company expects the us to continue to be the strongest region for revenue growth throughout  and beyond and given its importance the company appointed thomas mancusi formerly of cbs radio as us commercial director in april  who has made a considerable impact on revenue bookings since his arrival the company also recognises the huge opportunity in india recruiting a new country manager and commercial director to capitalise on increasing demand for the companys services and also manage the key relationships with eros saavn and redfm  the company believes the time is right to capitalise on the growth opportunities offered in its key markets however is currently constrained from doing so by the cash position of the company accordingly the company wishes to complete the placing and subscription and in doing so provide the funding to accelerate the growth and future success of the company     use of proceeds the net proceeds of the placing and subscription will be approximately £ million and are expected to be applied as follows ·      working capital to accelerate growth approximately £   the company has recognised the need to focus its head count and business development activity to capitalise on the countries the board has identified as those that afford the greatest opportunity for monetisation being the us and india to reflect this the company intends to relocate staff from its uk operations and increase the commercial function overseas   ·     technical development approximately £ million   by  the companys adserving costs will increase substantially through both listen and inventory growth much of this total is related to using third party ad servers audioboom has identified using new funds to build its own market leading digital audio adserver utilising neurolinguistic programming artificial intelligence and audio to text transcription as a strategic way to reduce adserving costs and remove reliance on third parties thereby allowing the company to target advertising in a much more effective and valuable way   ·      content acquisition and creative initiatives approximately £   over the last  months audioboom has focused on acquiring established podcast talent and creating its own bespoke podcast content audioboom will accelerate this acquisition and creation strategy in its strategic markets to enable it to rapidly scale revenues from host read or inread advertising sale and in doing so intends to add a further two people to its headcount       potential strategic investment the company is currently in discussions with a chinese fund the investor for a strategic investment of up to us million including the loan described below to be made at not less than the issue price the funds received from the strategic investment are to be applied towards accelerating the growth of the company and not for working capital purposes the board currently expects that a formal agreement will be entered into with the investor and announced by the end of september  the investment will be conditional on the chief executive officer of the company rob proctor accepting a loan from the investor of approximately us to be utilised in the acquisition of ordinary shares at not less than the issue price at the same time as the subscription by the investor the loan is expected to be repayable on the earlier of the date which is three years from drawdown of the loan or the purchase of  of all of the outstanding share capital of the company whether by the investor or otherwise the loan will accrue interest at five per cent per annum and will be secured against rob proctors existing interest in the capital of the company  the aggregate holding of the investor and rob proctor post completion of the strategic investment is expected to be up to approximately  per cent the investor will have the right to appoint up to two directors to the board of the company shareholders should note that there is no certainty that the investment described above will proceed or if it does proceed that it will be on the terms described above in the event that the investment does proceed it will be conditional on shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting of the company and so the resolutions being proposed at the extraordinary general meeting being convened by the notice of extraordinary general meeting do not relate to the investment described in this paragraph  note that should the

intelligence algorithms the board believes that the acquisition of sonr has the potential to accelerate the companys speed to market of the adserving platform through acquiring the required engineeringcoding team and specialist algorithms accordingly the company has entered into informal discussions with the board of sonr with a view to a potential acquisition of sonr by the company it is currently envisaged that the consideration would be satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares in the company the company intends on requesting specific information from the sonr board to allow the company to evaluate sonrs technology assess its suitability for sonrs adserving requirements and model an indicative price for the sonr business nick candy and rob proctor chief executive officer
