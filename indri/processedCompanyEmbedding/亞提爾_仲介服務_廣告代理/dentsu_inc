kei nishikori and the japan national rugby team’s performance at rugby world cup  chosen as the top three— november    am eastern standard time tokyobusiness wiredentsu inc tokyoisinjppresident  ceo tadashi ishii head office tokyo capital  million yen announced today the release of its “ hit products in japan” report produced as part of a series that has been chronicling hit products since  the latest report examines major trends that represented the japanese people’s mindset in  it is based on an internet survey of the general public in japan carried out at the end of october and early november  by video research ltd the following top  products which include some popular content and social phenomena were selected from  popular items and services by  internet survey respondents aged between  and   hit products no    binge shopping  inbound tourism no  kei nishikori japanese professional tennis player no  japan national rugby team’s performance at rugby world cup  no  matsuko

mobile action roleplaying game    was a year in which signs of change were evident although there were some bright spots such as the emergence from deflation due to rising stock prices at the beginning of the year and other factors it was also a year where uncertainty caused by costofliving increases and concerns about future prospects created a less than favorable consumption environment the increase in inbound tourism consumption however an example of which is binge shopping by chinese and other foreign tourists had a considerable impact on japan’s consumption figures and this is also reflected in this year’s hit product rankings binge shopping  inbound tourism which took first place in this years rankings drew attention to the chinese new year also known as the spring festival holiday which was celebrated in february through the mass media’s frequent reports on the buying of japanese products by foreign tourists on their holiday trips attention was also drawn to other holidays celebrated by people of other nationalities such as the national day of the people’s republic of china and this media coverage had a significant impact on the japanese public as their eyes were drawn to the binge shopping by inbound tourists the japanese people rediscovered the charm of japan and once again focused on local products as can be seen in the no  ranking for the hokuriku shinkansen and the no  ranking for the hometown contribution tax system which enables people to make a donation to the local or prefectural government of their choice and receive gifts of regional products in return the second equal ranking shared by tennis player kei nishikori and the japan national rugby team’s performance at rugby world cup  shows the japanese public’s surprise at and admiration for their worldclass performances in areas where japan felt that it was facing a big wall it can be said that with each success on the world stage there were many people who gained courage as they saw how their athletes competed outside of japan the following “ expected hit products” list was compiled using the products selected for the “it has been popular this year  it is popular now” category as a base and then focusing on those selected for the “it will become popular” category  expected hit products no    hydrogenpowered automobiles no  d printers no  simfree mobile
