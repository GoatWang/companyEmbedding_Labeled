uses cookies in order to improve your online experience by continuing to use swissportcom you accept our cookie policy swissport and icts international unveil a new and more efficient airport security system secure check zurichvancouver november    swissport international and icts international nv have devised an innovative concept for a new ground services system which will both enhance aviation security and substantially reduce waiting times at checkin and for document checks pilot trials will commence at zurich airport in december  swissport a world leader in the provision of ground handling services has perceived an urgent need to accelerate specific passenger processing transactions while enhancing the level of security forming the basis of the new concept secure check meets the above needs by incorporating and integrating advanced technological tools such as ictss proprietary aps advanced passenger screening a sophisticated rule engine utilized by major carriers since  swissport and icts internationals subsidiary icts technologies have jointly developed this new concept which is based on ictss proven technological capabilities and on swissports broad expertise in efficient ground handling operations secure check utilizes an integrated security solution that extracts the passengers personal and travel details at the checkin using a smart document reader takes the passengers biometric reading in an improved short process and stores this information on a smart card for transfer between all security checkpoints while protecting confidentiality throughout the process the passenger will be required to present travel documents only once and will undergo biometric identity verification at the gate before boarding the new approach will eliminate the timeconsuming multiple checks of boarding cards and passports on the way to the gate will render the security check process more efficient and smoothen the passengers progress from checkin to gate secure check introduced at this years avsec international aviation security conference will now be tested on selected swiss international air lines flights departing from zurich airport from december  onwards in full cooperation with swissports subsidiary checkport following the pilot trial swissport intends to launch secure check globally checkport will also play a central role in the assimilation of secure check at swissports  stations around the world this innovative and forwardlooking system will also be offered to other interested airports and airlines swissport  personnel provides ground handling services to over  million passengers and three million tonnes of cargo a year on behalf of some  corporate clients swissport is active at  airports in  countries checkport currently performs airport security duties for over  airlines and employs some  specialist personnel the company was acquired by swissport international from protectas aviation security in february
