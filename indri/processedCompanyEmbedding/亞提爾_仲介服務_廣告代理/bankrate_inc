doesn’t have to be complicated and the beauty of mutual funds is that they simplify investingbelow are the pros and cons of targetdate funds index funds and lifestyle funds popular shortcut plans that let investors earn yields without constantly tweaking their portfolios  targetdate fundsthe targetdate fund is named by its retirement year or the year you plan to start withdrawing money from the fund as the date nears the fund’s asset allocation shifts to become more conservative and adjustments happen automatically these funds can charge high fees so try to find a fund with an expense ratio of  percent or less they also tend to be light on international stocks the typical targetdate fund has about  percent invested overseas but aim for  percent or even more there are an increasing amount of good foreign businesses and you don’t want to limit your portfolio’s growth by not having much exposure to foreign stocks  lifestyle fundalso known as asset allocation funds lifestyle funds offer a conservative moderate balanced or aggressive investing approach these funds let investors choose funds based on their own riskandreturn preference and they offer broad diversification in one fund investors must remember to adjust these funds but they don’t have to tweak them too often it may be a matter of scaling down aggressive investments every  or  years   index fundan index fund follows a
