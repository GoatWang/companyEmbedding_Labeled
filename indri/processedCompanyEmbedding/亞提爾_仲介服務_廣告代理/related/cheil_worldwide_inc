common the ambition to offer their customers particularly welldesigned products they have all understood what thomas j watson jr the onetime ceo of ibm meant when he said “good design is good business” these companies know that consumers are increasingly aware of quality and they understand that design is an important criterion in purchasing decisions many firms have also realised that the
