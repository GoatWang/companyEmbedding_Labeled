apr    et from burger king worldwide holdings inc miami and london april   prnewswire  burger king worldwide holdings inc burger king worldwide the worlds second largest fast food hamburger restaurant chain and justice holdings limited justice lse jush a publicly listed uk investment vehicle today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement  under the terms of the agreement g capital a global investment firm and burger king worldwides principal stockholder will receive approximately  billion in cash and continue as the majority shareholder the justice shareholders and its founders will own approximately  of the combined company upon closing the combined company will be incorporated in delaware and will be renamed burger king worldwide inc justices shares will be immediately suspended from trading on the london stock exchange and upon closing it is expected that the newly formed combined company will list and commence trading on the new york stock exchange on wednesday april   at  am eastern daylight time justice will host a teleconference web presentation and question and answer session to provide details on the transaction  the webcast can be accessed by dialing  tollfree or  international using conference id  by visiting wwwjusticeholdingsltdcom    was a pivotal year for the burger king® brand said bernardo hees chief executive officer burger king worldwide since g capitals acquisition of the company along with our franchisees we have rolled out our fourpillar strategy in north america and expanded our international footprint in key growth markets  burger king worldwides longterm strategy and its entire senior management team will remain unchanged  in partnership with our new public shareholders we will continue to focus on creating profitable growth for our franchise system while delivering bestinclass food and service for our guests  we believe it is the right time for burger king to be publicly traded in the us again said daniel schwartz chief financial officer burger king worldwide  with this transaction we are positioning the burger king® brand for longterm growth both domestically and internationally and are excited to take this next step in delivering on our strategic objectives justice has been extremely disciplined in considering potential operating businesses since its formation in february  commented lord myners the independent chairman of justices board of directors adding that  the burger king transaction offers a number of the key features the board was looking for in a combination  strong cash flows an experienced and successful management team significant strategic growth opportunities and a company that would benefit from justices public ownership  the board voted unanimously in favor of entering into the combination agreement with burger king worldwide  we look forward to closing the transaction later this year once the requirements of the us securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange are satisfied justice cofounder nicolas berggruen added  the transaction with burger king exemplifies our ability to bring justice shareholders access to investments that would not otherwise be available to them  we believe that burger kings aggressive plans for international growth will benefit from its visibility as a nyselisted public company  we looked at many different opportunities over the last  months but burger king stood out as a unique global player in the expanding international quick service restaurant industry with a strong heritage and an aggressive transformation underway in its north america business unit justice cofounder martin e franklin commented that  the management team that g capital has assembled to operate burger king is extremely impressive and their progress in implementing cost control and developing an international growth strategy in a relatively short period of time has been outstanding  we agree with management that the burger king® brand is still at an early stage of its true potential and believe that over the next three to five years the us turnaround and international growth franchise model can lead to significant margin expansion and free cash flow growth  i look forward to serving on the board with alan parker and supporting this global franchise   william a ackman a cofounder of justice commented i have long admired gs track record as bestinclass operators in the beverage anheuser busch retail lojas americanas logistics and rail road industries and i have personally invested in g capitals private equity funds  when i learned that burger king was interested in a possible transaction with justice i brought the opportunity to my justice founding partners to consider  they liked what i saw a yearold global brand and a simple predictable free cash flow growth franchise in the process of transformation into a pure brand royalty business  the results to date have been remarkable  mr ackman continued  since gs acquisition of burger king in october  ebitda minus capex has increased from  million in  to  million in  with  ebitda minus capex expected to be nearly double that of s results  as importantly burger kings management has made substantial progress in accelerating international growth through the formation of joint ventures with thirdparty capital sources and local operators  as a result of managements initiatives and the power of this global brand i am confident this will be an excellent investment for justice shareholders  in order to avoid the potential for any actual or perceived conflict of interest g will make an inkind distribution to me of shares in burger king reflecting my proportionate interest in the g private equity fund  as a result i will receive stock and no cash from this transaction  at the closing of the deal through the additional indirect economic interests i will own through the pershing square funds i will be substantially increasing my personal stake in the company   i have committed to retain my personal stake until after pershing square is no longer a shareholder as part of the agreement martin franklin and alan parker one of justices independent directors will join the board of directors at closing along with all of the existing burger king worldwide board members  martin e franklin is the founder and executive chairman of jarden a nyselisted diversified consumer products company with revenue of approximately  billion for which he previously served as its chief executive officer  alan parker was previously the chief executive of whitbread plc the uks largest hotel and restaurant company  in the transaction justices cofounders have agreed to reduce their founders interests to  of the combined companys outstanding shares and have waived the right to receive any other additional equity interests originally contemplated by the justice structure investment funds managed by pershing square capital management lp will own approximately  of the combined companys outstanding shares which it will receive as a result of its interests in justice the transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and requires no further shareholder approvals  the transaction is subject to other customary approvals including antitrust approval listing on the new york stock exchange and the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed shortly with the us securities and exchange commission  the transaction closing

common stock for the selling security holders the exhibition organizing industry is intensely competitive the barriers to enter the industry is low and an organizer lacking sufficient experience financing and or media sources is vulnerable since it does not have any bargaining power with the exhibitors exhibitors are able to extract many favors such as price discounts and prime corner locations also in cities where one exhibition center has total domination the owner of the center main supplier has significant bargaining power on negotiation with exhibition organizer on leasing exhibition spaces the industry is currently evolving in such a way that multinational organizers will be able to dominate this business area because their control over key sources such as long term cooperation with international exhibition centers and plentiful experience and sufficient financing such organizers have numerous competitive advantages such as the ability to acquire financing for their organizing activities and expand its market by merger andor acquisition of other organizers all of our competitors will likely be organizers of substantially larger size and capacity with far greater financial and personnel resources and longer operating histories and may be better able to acquire properties personnel and financing and enter into more favorable arrangement on exhibition
