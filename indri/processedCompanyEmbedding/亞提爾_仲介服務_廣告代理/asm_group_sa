amino acid  wikipedia amino acid from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the class of chemicals for the structures and properties of the standard proteinogenic amino acids see proteinogenic amino acid the structure of an alpha amino acid in its unionized form the  proteinogenic αamino acids found in eukaryotes grouped according to their side chains pka values and charges carried at physiological ph  amino acids are organic compounds containing amine nh and carboxyl cooh functional groups along with a side chain r group specific to each amino acid the key elements of an amino acid are carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids about  amino acids are known though only  appear in the genetic code and can be classified in many ways they can be classified according to the core structural functional groups locations as alpha α beta β gamma γ or delta δ amino acids other categories relate to polarity ph level and side chain group type aliphatic acyclic aromatic containing hydroxyl or sulfur etc in the form of proteins amino acid residues form the secondlargest component water is the largest of human muscles and other tissues beyond their role as residues in proteins amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis in biochemistry amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the first alpha carbon atom have particular importance they are known as  alpha or αamino acids generic formula hnchrcooh in most cases where r is an organic substituent known as a side chain often the term amino acid is used to refer specifically to these they include the  proteinogenic proteinbuilding amino acids which combine into peptide chains polypeptides to form the buildingblocks of a vast array of proteins these are all lstereoisomers lefthanded isomers although a few damino acids righthanded occur in bacterial envelopes as a neuromodulator dserine and in some antibiotics twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as standard amino acids the other two nonstandard or noncanonical are selenocysteine present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna and pyrrolysine found only in some archea and one bacterium pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element nformylmethionine which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid codon–trna combinations not found in nature can also be used to expand the genetic code and form novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating nonproteinogenic amino acids many important proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids have biological functions for example in the human brain glutamate standard glutamic acid and gammaaminobutyric acid gaba nonstandard gammaamino acid are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters hydroxyproline a major component of the connective tissue collagen is synthesised from proline glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells carnitine is used in lipid transport nine proteinogenic amino acids are called essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions essential amino acids may also differ between species because of their biological significance

pierre jean robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine the first amino acid to be discovered cystine was discovered in  although its monomer cysteine remained undiscovered until  glycine and leucine were discovered in  the last of the  common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in  by william cumming rose who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth usage of the term amino acid in the english language is from  proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis in  emil fischer and franz hofmeister proposed that proteins are the result of the formation of bonds between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another in a linear structure that fischer termed peptide general structureedit further information alpha carbon in the structure shown at the top of the page r represents a side chain specific to each amino acid the carbon atom next to the carboxyl group which is therefore numbered  in the carbon chain starting from that functional group is called the α–carbon amino acids containing an amino group bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as alpha amino acids these include amino acids such as proline which contain secondary amines which used to be often referred to as imino acids isomerismedit the two enantiomers of alanine dalanine and lalanine the alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature but only when occurring in the lisomer the alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon therefore all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers called l or d amino acids which are mirror images of each other see also chirality while lamino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome damino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum as in exotic seadwelling organisms such as cone snails they are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria and dserine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain damino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals which depending on the protein may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination the l and d convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can in theory be synthesized dglyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory lglyceraldehyde is levorotatory in alternative fashion the s and r designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry almost all of the amino acids in proteins are s at the α carbon with cysteine being r and glycine nonchiral cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids but the rs terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority side chainsedit lysine with carbon atoms labeled in amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the α–carbon such as lysine shown to the right the carbons are labeled in order as α β γ δ and so on in some amino acids the amine group is attached to the β or γcarbon and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids amino acids are usually classified by the properties of their side chain into four groups the side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar the chemical structures of the  standard amino acids along with their chemical properties are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids the phrase branchedchain amino acids or bcaa refers to the amino acids having aliphatic side chains that are nonlinear these are leucine isoleucine and valine proline is the only proteinogenic amino acid whose sidegroup links to the αamino group and thus is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position in chemical terms proline is therefore an imino acid since it lacks a primary amino group although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature and may also be called an nalkylated alphaamino acid zwitterionsedit an amino acid in its  unionized and  zwitterionic forms the αcarboxylic acid group of amino acids is a weak acid meaning that it releases a hydron such as a proton at moderate ph values in other words carboxylic acid groups −coh can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates −co−  the negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at ph values greater than the pka of the carboxylic acid group mean for the  common amino acids is about  see the table of amino acid structures above in a complementary fashion the αamine of amino acids is a weak base meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate ph values in other words αamino groups nh− can be protonated to become positive αammonium groups nh− the positively charged αammonium group predominates at ph values less than the pka of the αammonium group mean for the  common αamino acids is about  because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups they share amphiprotic properties below ph  the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive αammonium ion net charge  and above ph  a negative carboxylate and neutral αamino group net charge − but at ph between  and  an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive αammonium group as shown in structure  on the right so has net zero charge this molecular state is known as a zwitterion from the german zwitter meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid the fully neutral form structure  on the left is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the ph range less than  part in  amino acids exist as zwitterions also in the solid phase and crystallize with saltlike properties unlike typical organic acids or amines isoelectric pointedit the variation in titration curves when the amino acids are grouped by category can be seen here with the exception of tyrosine using titration to distinguish between hydrophobic amino acids is problematic composite of titration curves of twenty proteinogenic amino acids grouped by side chain category at ph values between the two pka values the zwitterion predominates but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions at the exact midpoint between the two pka values the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance so that average net charge of all forms present is zero this ph is known as the isoelectric point pi so pi  ½pka  pka the individual amino acids all have slightly different pka values so have different isoelectric points for amino acids with charged side chains the pka of the side chain is involved thus for asp glu with negative side chains pi  ½pka  pkar where pkar is the side chain pka cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pkar   so pi should be calculated as for asp and glu even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral ph for his lys and arg with positive side chains pi  ½pkar  pka amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids in particular with nonpolar side chains can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the ph to the required isoelectric point occurrence and functions in biochemistryedit a polypeptide is an unbranched chain of amino acids proteinogenic amino acidsedit main article proteinogenic amino acids see also protein primary structure and posttranslational modification the amino acid selenocysteine amino acids are the structural units monomers that make up proteins they join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins these polymers are linear and unbranched with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids the process of making proteins is called translation and involves the stepbystep addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome the order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mrna template which is a rna copy of one of the organisms genes twentytwo amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids of these  are encoded by the universal genetic code the remaining  selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms selenocysteine is incorporated when the mrna being translated includes a secis element which causes the uga codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane it is coded for with the codon uag which is normally a stop codon in other organisms this uag codon is followed by a pylis downstream sequence nonproteinogenic amino acidsedit βalanine and its αalanine isomer main article nonproteinogenic amino acids aside from the  proteinogenic amino acids many nonproteinogenic amino acids are known those either are not found in proteins for example carnitine gaba levothyroxine or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery for example hydroxyproline and selenomethionine nonproteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by posttranslational modification which is modification after translation during protein synthesis these modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein for example the carboxylation of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations and collagen contains hydroxyproline generated by hydroxylation of proline another example is the formation of hypusine in the translation initiation factor eifa through modification of a lysine residue such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein eg the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane some nonproteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins examples include aminoisobutyric acid and the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid nonproteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids – for example ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle part of amino acid catabolism see below a rare exception to the dominance of αamino acids in biology is the βamino acid beta alanine aminopropanoic acid which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid vitamin b a component of coenzyme a damino acid natural abundanceedit disomers are uncommon in live organisms for instance gramicidin is a polypeptide made up from mixture of d and lamino acids other compounds containing damino acid are tyrocidine and valinomycin these compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls particularly in grampositive bacteria only  damino acids were found in swissprot database  million amino acids analysed nonstandard amino acidsedit the  amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids a modified form of methionine nformylmethionine is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts other amino acids are called nonstandard or noncanonical most of the nonstandard amino acids are also nonproteinogenic ie they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation but two of them are proteinogenic as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code the two nonstandard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna and pyrrolysine found only in some archaea and one bacterium the incorporation of these nonstandard amino acids is rare for example  human proteins include selenocysteine sec in their primary structure and the structurally characterized enzymes selenoenzymes employ sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element in human nutritionedit main article essential amino acids further information protein nutrient and amino acid synthesis share of amino acid in different human diets and the resulting mix of amino acids in human blood serum glutamate and glutamine are the most frequent in food at over  while alanine glutamine and glycine are the most common in blood when taken up into the human body from the diet the  standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy the oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle the other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis of the  standard amino acids nine his ile leu lys met phe thr trp and val are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth so they must be obtained from food in addition cysteine taurine tyrosine and arginine are considered semiessential aminoacids in children though taurine is not technically an amino acid because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed the amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids dietary exposure to the nonstandard amino acid bmaa has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases including als diagram of the molecular signaling cascades that are involved in

phenylalanine and tyrosine in humans in humans nonprotein amino acids also have important roles as metabolic intermediates such as in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid gaba many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules for example tryptophan is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin tyrosine and its precursor phenylalanine are precursors of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine and various trace amines phenylalanine is a precursor of phenethylamine and tyrosine in humans in plants it is a precursor of various phenylpropanoids which are important in plant metabolism glycine is a precursor of porphyrins such as heme arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide ornithine and sadenosylmethionine are precursors of polyamines aspartate glycine and glutamine are precursors of nucleotides however not all of the functions of other abundant nonstandard amino acids are known some nonstandard amino acids are used as defenses against herbivores in plants for example canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes and in particularly large amounts in canavalia gladiata sword bean this amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing the nonprotein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume in particular leucaena leucocephala this compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants uses in industryedit amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry but their main use is as additives to animal feed this is necessary since many of the bulk components of these feeds such as soybeans either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids lysine methionine threonine and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds in this industry amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals the food industry is also a major consumer of amino acids in particular glutamic acid which is used as a flavor enhancer and aspartame aspartylphenylalaninemethyl ester as a lowcalorie artificial sweetener similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies such as anemia by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation the chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies such as iron chlorosis these fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants the remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics similarly some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry they include htp hydroxytryptophan used for experimental treatment of depression ldopa ldihydroxyphenylalanine for parkinsons treatment and eflornithine drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used in the treatment of sleeping sickness expanded genetic codeedit main article expanded genetic code since   nonnatural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon recoding and a corresponding transferrnaaminoacyl – trnasynthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins nullomersedit main article nullomers nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another for example bacteria prefer to use cga instead of aga to code for arginine this creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome this characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancerfighting drugs and to prevent crosscontamination of dna samples from crimescene investigations chemical building blocksedit further information asymmetric synthesis amino acids are important as lowcost feedstocks these compounds are used in chiral pool synthesis as enantiomerically pure buildingblocks amino acids have been investigated as precursors chiral catalysts eg for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions although no commercial applications exist biodegradable plasticsedit further information biodegradable plastic and biopolymer amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers these materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants these polymers include polypeptides polyamides polyesters polysulfides and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains these modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers an interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate a watersoluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable antiscaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor in addition the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol a in the manufacture of polycarbonates reactionsedit as amino acids have both a primary amine group and a primary carboxyl group these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups these include nucleophilic addition amide bond formation and imine formation for the amine group and esterification amide bond formation and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group the combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metalamino acid chelates the multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions the types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are therefore different between the various types of amino acid the strecker amino acid synthesis chemical synthesisedit see also categorychemical synthesis of amino acids several methods exist to synthesize amino acids one of the oldest methods begins with the bromination at the αcarbon of a carboxylic acid nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid in alternative fashion the strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia this produces an αamino nitrile as an intermediate hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a αamino acid using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids likewise using ketones instead of aldehydes gives ααdisubstituted amino acids the classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of αamino acids as products but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed at the current time the mostadopted method is an automated synthesis on a solid support eg polystyrene beads using protecting groups eg fmoc and tboc and activating groups eg dcc and dic peptide bond formationedit see also peptide synthesis and peptide bond the condensation of two amino acids to form a dipeptide through a peptide bond as both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage this polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins this condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water in cells this reaction does not occur directly instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer rna molecule through an ester bond this aminoacyltrna is produced in an atpdependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl trna synthetase this aminoacyltrna is then a substrate for the ribosome which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond as a result of this mechanism all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their nterminus and moving toward their cterminus however not all peptide bonds are formed in this way in a few cases peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes for example the tripeptide glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress this peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids in the first step gammaglutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate the gamma carbon of this side chain and the amino group of the cysteine this dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione in chemistry peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions one of the mostused in solidphase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units these are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain which is attached to a solid resin support the ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids using combinatorial chemistry has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through highthroughput screening biosynthesisedit main article amino acid synthesis in plants nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate formed from alphaketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion in order to form other amino acids the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alphaketo carboxylic acid for example aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alphaketoglutarate and aspartate other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis too nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids for example homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite sadenosyl methionine while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline microorganisms and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids for example some microbes make aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine which is a sulfidebridged derivative of alanine both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin however in plants aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone ethylene catabolismedit catabolism of proteinogenic amino acids amino acids can be classified according to the properties of their main products as either of the following  glucogenic with the products having the ability to form glucose by gluconeogenesis  ketogenic with the products not having the ability to form glucose these products may still be used for ketogenesis or lipid synthesis  amino acids catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via amino acid transporters since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized degradation of an amino acid occurring in the liver and kidneys often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alphaketoglutarate forming glutamate this process involves transaminases often the same as those used in amination during synthesis in many vertebrates the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea however amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead for example serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia after removal of one or more amino groups the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle as detailed in image at right physicochemical properties of amino acidsedit the  amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties important factors are charge hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity size and functional groups these properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions the watersoluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues leu ile val phe and trp buried in the middle of the protein whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent note that in biochemistry a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide protein or nucleic acid the integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer in the case partway between these two extremes some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane in similar fashion proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine there are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues some amino acids have special properties such as cysteine that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone and glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins or hydrophilic glycoproteins these type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane for example the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes table of standard

multicast data plane traffic       using get vpn to authenticate control plane traffic conclusions references future work acknowledgements background  introduction introduction and scope this document is intended to provide guidance on some of the best practices for securing an ip multicast network infrastructure we begin by explaining some basic concepts and terminology used and then discuss some specific ipmc threats from there we describe mechanisms for securing a specific platform and the network in general both any source multicast asm and source specific multicast ssm models are discussed in addition some comments on multicast virtual private network mvpn security are provided we also include a brief discussion on the get vpn architecture for providing confidentiality and integrity for multicast data plane or control plane traffic future papers will focus on ios xr and cisco’s recently released nexus os nxos operating system for the nexus  as well as provide a more detailed discussion of the issues connected with multicast security in a vpn context terminology in ip multicast there are two classic service models i any source multicast asm ii source specific multicast ssm in asm the receiver joins a group g via an igmp or mld membership report indicating only the group this report requests traffic sent by any source to the group g and hence the name “any source” by contrast in ssm the receiver joins a specific channel defined by a source s sending to a group g each of these service models is described in detail below any source multicast the asm model is characterised by two classes of protocol “dense mode floodandprune” and “sparse mode explicit join” i dense mode floodandprune protocols dvmrp  mospf  pimdm in dense mode protocols all routers in the network are aware of all trees their sources and receivers protocols such as dvmrp and pim dense mode flood “active source” information across the whole network and build trees by creating “prune state” in parts of the topology where traffic for a specific tree is unwanted they are also called floodandprune protocols in mospf information about receivers is flooded throughout the network to support the building of trees dense mode protocols are undesirable because every tree built in some part of the network will always cause resource utilization with convergence impact on all routers in the network or within the administrative scope if configured we will not be discussing these protocols in the rest of this paper ii sparse mode explicit join protocols pimsmpimbidir with sparse mode explicit join protocols we do not create a groupspecific forwarding state in the network unless a receiver has sent an explicit igmpmld membership report or “join” for a group this variant of asm is known to scale well and is the multicast paradigm we will mainly be discussing this is the basis for pimsparse mode which most multicast deployments have used to this point this is also the basis for pimbidir which will be increasingly deployed for many sources to many receivers applications these protocols are called sparse mode because they efficiently support ip multicast delivery trees with a “sparse” receiver population – creating control plane state only on routers in the path between sources and receivers and in pimsmbidir the rendezvous point rp they never create state in other parts of the network state in a router is only built explicitly when it receives a join from a downstream router or receiver hence the name “explicit join protocols” both pimsm and pimbidir employ “shared trees” which allow traffic from any source to be forwarded to a receiver the forwarding state on a shared tree is referred to as g forwarding state where the  is a wild card for any source additionally pimsm supports the creation of forwarding state that relates to traffic from a specific source these are known as source trees and the associated state is referred to as sg forwarding state sourcespecific multicast ssm is the model used when the receiver or some proxy sends sg “joins” to indicate that it wants to receive traffic sent by source s to group g this is possible with igmpvmldv “include” mode membership reports we therefore refer to this model as the sourcespecific multicast ssm model ssm mandates the use of an explicitjoin protocol between routers the standard protocol for this is pimssm which is simply the subset of pimsm used to create sg trees there are no shared trees g state in ssm  multicast receivers can thus “join” an asm group g or “join” or more accurately “subscribe” to an ssm sg channel to avoid having to repeat the term “asm group or ssm channel” we will use the term multicast flow in the text implying that the flow could be an asm group or an ssm channel relevant multicast protocols  packet types when securing a multicast network it is important to understand the packet types we might encounter and need to protect against there are three main protocols with which to be concerned  igmp  mld  pim  msdp the following sections address each of these protocols and the issues that might arise igmp  mld packets igmp  mld is the protocol used by ipmc receivers to signal to a router that they are interested in receiving content for a particular ipmc group internet group membership protocol igmp is the protocol used in ipv and multicast listener discovery mld is the protocol used in ipv there are two versions of igmp that are commonly deployed igmpv and igmpv  there are also two versions of mld that are commonly deployed mldv and mldv igmpv and mldv are functionally equivalent and igmpv and mldv are functionally equivalent these protocols are specified at the following links igmpv httpwwwietforgrfcrfctxt igmpv httpwwwietforgrfcrfctxt mldv httpwwwietforgrfcrfctxt mldv httpwwwietforgrfcrfctxt it should be noted that with the above listed versions igmp is not only a protocol but also an ipv ip protocol number  it is not only used as described in these rfcs to report multicast group membership but also by other ipv multicast protocols such as dvmrp pim version  mtrace and mrinfo this is important to remember when attempting to filter igmp via cisco ios acls for example in ipv mld is not an ipv protocol instead icmpv is used to carry mld packets pim version  is the same protocol type in ipv and ipv protocol number  pim control packets in this section we will discuss multicast and unicast pim control packets we will also look at autorp and bsr which are ways of electing rendezvous points and controlling grouptorp assignments in pimsm networks multicast pim control packets multicast pim control packets include pim hello  the pim hello packet is a linklocal scope ip multicast packet sent to a router attached to the same network to establish pim neighborship pim joinprune  pim joinprunes are linklocal scope ip multicast packets sent to create  remove multicast forwarding state and are only sent to pim neighbors they are multicast within the lan to facilitate assert report suppression and other pim protocol details but they are always directed to a specific neighbor pim dfelect  pim designated forwarder is the bidir pim router responsible for sending g joins to the rp on behalf of attached receivers or downstream pim neighbours for cases where a pim router detects another router sending g joins on the same segment for the same group g there is an election to determine the router with the best path to the rp pim assert  pim asserts are linklocal ip multicast packets sent when a pim router attached to a network segment that is actively forwarding packets for a particular sg out of a particular interface begins receiving packets for that same sg on the same interface on which they are forwarding this event indicates the presence of another router that thinks it is the single forwarder for this sg the assert mechanism elects a unique sf for that sg pim single forwarder router is elected to forward packets for a particular sg stream pim allows for different routers to perform the role of the single forwarder on behalf of different sgs but there should only be one sf per sg the sf should not be confused with the designated router pim designated router is the router responsible for sending join  prunes or source registers to the rp in a pimsm network pim bootstrap  pim bootstrap messages are sent in a pimv network to facilitate the dynamic election of a rendezvous point for a particular group g unicast pim control packets unicast pim control packets are directed to or from the rp and include source register packet  pim source register packets are sent to register a new multicast source with a rendezvous point as soon as a source starts to send ipmc packets the designated router that is attached to the source network will send a unicast register stream to the rp to indicate that there is an active source present for a multicast group for which the rp is responsible source register  packets are sent as a unicast encapsulation of the original multicast stream pim register messages are processlevel switched and are sent only until the rp sends a register stop message the performance impact of these packets is proportional to the rate of the source per sg flow register stop packet  pim register stop packets are sent from the rendezvous point to the pim dr sending the register message register stop messages are sent as soon as the rp starts to receive ipmc packets natively from the source bsr candidaterendezvous point advertisement packet  pim bsr crpadvertisement packets are sent to the bsr to advertise a candidate rp once the bsr is elected fig  pim unicast packets  attacks exploiting such packets can originate from anywhere as these packets are unicast for information on how to secure pim refer to section  autorp packets autorp is a ciscodeveloped protocol that serves the same purpose as pimv bsr autorp was developed before bsr and only supports ipv bsr supports ipv and ipv the mapping agent in autorp serves the same function as the bootstrap router in bsr in bsr messages from the crp are unicast to the bootstrap router in autorp messages are sent via multicast to the mapping agent allowing easier boundary filtering as described later autorp is described in detail at the following link httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsiossolutionsdocsipmulticastwhitepapersrpshtml in ios the forwarding of autorpbsr packets is always enabled and currently not configurable this can present a particular security exposure in the case of autorp fig  autorp packets note that autorp even though it is a mechanism for pimsm rp announcement and discovery does not use pim packets ip protocol  instead it uses udp port  packets with multicast addresses there are two packet types used by autorp crpannounce packets these packets are multicast to all mapping agents using an iana reserved “well known” address  they are sent by a crp to announce the rp address and group range for which that rp is willing to act as the rp crp discovery packets these packets are multicast to all pim routers using an iana reserved “well known” address  they are sent by the autorp mapping agent to announce the specific crp that is elected as the rp for a particular group range each of these packet types are intended to be flooded through the network in ios both  and  are forwarded in pim dense mode to avoid a problem of knowing the rp for a group when that group is used to distribute rp information this is the only recommended use of pim dense mode in ios xr autorp messages are “rpfflooded” hop by hop from neighbor to neighbor therefore there is no need to create a pim dm mroute state to support autorp in ios xr in fact ios xr does not support pimdm at all msdp packets msdp is the ipv protocol that allows a source in one domain to be announced to a receiver in another domain via their respective rendezvous points msdp is specified in rfc  httpwwwietforgrfcrfctxt msdp works by forwarding information about active sources between pim domains if a source becomes active in one domain then msdp ensures that all peer domains learn about this new source in a timely manner allowing receivers in other domains to rapidly make contact with this new source if it happens to be sending to a group in which they have an interest msdp is needed for asm  pimsm multicast communications and runs over a unicast tcp connection configured between rendezvous points in the respective domains threats in a multicast environment zones of trust and trust boundaries this section of the document is organized by functional entities in the network the threat model discussed is shaped around those entities for example we explain how a router in a multicast network should be secured from a multicast point of view independent of where the router is deployed similarly there are considerations on how to deploy networkwide security measures or measures on a designated router rendezvous point etc the threats described here also follow this logic and are organized by logical function in the network  threat overview on an abstract level any multicast deployment can be subject to a number of threats on various aspects of security the key aspects of security are confidentiality integrity and availability threats against confidentiality in most applications multicast traffic is not encrypted and is therefore open to eavesdropping on any line or network element in the path in the section on get vpn we describe a way to encrypt multicast traffic to prevent such attacks threats against traffic integrity without applicationlevel security or networkbased security such as get vpn multicast traffic is open to being modified in transit this is particularly important for control plane traffic using multicast such as ospf pim and many other protocols threats against network integrity without the security mechanisms described in this paper unauthorized senders receivers or compromised network elements can access the multicast network masquerading send and receive traffic without authorization theft of service or overload network resources threats against availability there are a number of denial of service attack possibilities that can make resources unavailable to legitimate users in the following sections we discuss threats for each logical function in the network basic threats against a router there are a number of fundamental threats against a router that are independent of whether the router supports multicast and whether the attack involves multicast traffic or protocols denial of service dos attacks are the most important generic attack vectors in a network in principle every network element can be targeted with a dos attack which may overload the element with potential subsequent loss or degradation of service for legitimate users it is of paramount importance to follow the basic network security recommendations that apply to unicast it is noteworthy that multicast attacks are not always intentional but often accidental for instance the witty worm first observed in march  is one example of a worm that spread by attacking random ip addresses as a consequence of complete randomization of the address space multicast ip destinations were also affected by the worm in many organizations a number of firsthop routers collapsed because the worm sent packets to many different ip multicast destination addresses the routers however were not scoped for such a multicast traffic load with the associated state creation and effectively experienced resource exhaustion this illustrates the need to secure multicast traffic even if multicast is not used in an enterprise generic threats against routers include packet floods of any type for example against hardware paths such as slow punt paths and software paths such as management or control plane ports including ssh telnet bgp ospf ntp etc intrusions into the router with subsequent exploitation of features on the router weak telnet or ssh passwords and weak snmp community strings are a common problem in today’s network operational issues such as misconfigurations or insider attacks can endanger the security of the entire network and its traffic when multicast is enabled on a router it must be secured in addition to unicast enabling ip multicast does not change the fundamental threat model above however it enables additional protocols pim igmp mld msdp that may be subject to attacks which need to be secured specifically when unicast traffic is used in these protocols the threat model is identical to other protocols run by the router it is important to note that ip multicast traffic cannot be used in the same way as unicast traffic to attack a router because multicast traffic is fundamentally “receiver driven” and cannot be targeted at a remote destination an attack target needs to be explicitly “joined” to the attacking multicast stream in most cases autorp being the main exception routers only listen to and receive “link local” ip multicast traffic link local traffic is never forwarded therefore attacks on a router with ip multicast packets can only originate from directly attached attackers threats from the sender side ip multicast senders whether pcs or video servers are sometimes not under the same administrative control as the network therefore the sender is mostly treated as untrusted from the network operator’s point of view given the powerful capabilities of pcs and servers and their complex security settings which are often incomplete the senders pose a substantial threat against any network including multicast these threats include layer  attacks there are a wide range of attack forms on layer  to carry out eavesdropping masquerading or dos attacks these apply to unicast as well as multicast since these attack forms are not specific to multicast they are not discussed in more detail in this document for more information see the cisco press book “lan switch security” isbn  attacks with multicast traffic as described previously it is difficult to conduct attacks with multicast traffic since the firsthop router will not forward ip multicast traffic unless there is a listener for the group however the first hop can be attacked in various ways with multicast packets network saturation attacks an attacker can flood a segment with multicast packets overutilizing the available bandwidth creating a dos condition multicast state attacks flooding the firsthop router with multicast packets creating too much state and a consequent dos attack condition a sender could attempt to become the pim dr sending pim hellos in such cases no traffic would forward to or from the lan pim df election packets for a bidirpim df could be spoofed in such cases no traffic would forward to or from the lan a sender could spoof autorp rpdiscovery or bsr bootstrap messages this would effectively announce a fake rp and bring down or disrupt a pimsmbidir service a sender could source unicast attacks such as pim source registerregisterstop messages or could send bsr announce packets and announce a fake bsr a sender can send to any valid multicast group unless this is filtered if source address spoofing is not prevented at the edge the sender can use the source ip address of a legitimate sender and override content in parts of the network multicast attacks against control plane protocols a number of protocols not associated with multicast such as ospf and dhcp use multicast packets which can be used to attack these protocols masquerading there are a number of attack forms where a sender can pretend to be another sender source ip spoofing is one such attack form theft of service unless senders are controlled it is possible to use the multicast service illegitimately from the sender side note hosts should never send or receive pim packets hosts that do this are likely attempting an attack threats from the receiver side the receiver is also typically a platform with significant cpu power and bandwidth and allows for a number of attack forms these are mostly identical to the threats on the sender side layer  attacks remain an important attack vector masquerading and theft of service are also possible on the receiver side except that the attack vector is typically igmp or layer attacks as mentioned threats against a rendezvous point and bsr pimsm rps and pimbsrs are critical points in a multicast network and are therefore valuable targets for an attacker when neither is the firsthop router only unicast attack forms including pim unicast can be targeted directly against those elements the threats against rps and bsrs include all generic attack forms as described above in the section “basic threats against any multicast router” pim unicast attacks potentially with source ip spoofing allow for dos attacks by sending pim register or registerstop messages for example multicast and unicast security compared state considerations  filtering consider the topology in figure  which shows a source three receivers a b c a switch s and two routers r and r the blue line represents a unicast stream and the red line represents a multicast stream all three receivers are members of the multicast flow fig  replication in routers and switches to inhibit traffic flowing from a specific source to a specific receiver for the unicast stream we can install a filter anywhere on the path from sender to receiver for the multicast stream however we need to be more specific about where we can install filters at the receiver side we should filter after the last replication point before the receiver at the source side we should filter before the first replication point after the source attacks from multicast sources the following applies to both the asm and ssm service models where traffic forwarding is based on the receipt of receiverside explicit joins for unicast streams there is no implicit receiver protection a unicast source can send traffic to a destination even if this destination has not asked for the traffic therefore defense mechanisms such as firewalls are typically used to protect end points multicast on the other hand has some implicit protection built into the protocols traffic should usually only reach a receiver that has joined the flow in question with asm sources can launch traffic insertion or dos attacks by sending to any of the groups supported by an active rp such traffic may not reach a receiver but it will reach at least the firsthop router in the path as well as the rp allowing for limited attacks if an attacking source however knows a group to which a target receiver is listening and if there are no appropriate filters in place it can send traffic to that group this traffic will be received as long as it is listening to the group with ssm attacks by unwanted sources are only possible on the firsthop router where the traffic will stop if no receiver has joined that sg channel this should not lead to any state attack on the firsthop router because it should discard all ssm traffic for which no explicit join state exists from receivers in this model it is not sufficient for an attacking source to know which group a target is listening to because “joins” are sourcespecific here in addition ip source address spoofing plus potential routing attacks would be required to succeed state attacks even without receivers present in a network pimsm will create sg and g state on the firsthop router closest to the source and also on the rendezvous point thus there exists the possibility of a state attack on the network at the source firsthop router and on the pimsm rp if a malicious source starts to send traffic to multiple groups then for each of the groups that are detected the routers in the network will create state at the source and the rp provided the groups in question are permitted by the rp configuration therefore pimsm is subject to state and traffic attacks by sources the attack can be aggravated if the source is spoofing its source ip address randomly within the correct prefix or in other words spoofing only the host bits of the address randomly fig  asm rp attacks as with pimssm pimbidir statecreation attacks from sources are impossible traffic in pimbidir is forwarded on state created by joins from receivers and in addition on state forwarding traffic to the rp such that it can reach receivers behind the rp since the joins only go to the rp statetoforward traffic to the rp is called gm state and is created by rp configuration static autorp bsr it does not change in the presence of sources therefore attackers can send multicast traffic to a pimbidir rp but unlike pimsm a pimbidir rp is not an “active” entity and will instead just forward or discard traffic for pimbidir groups note that on some ios platforms gm state may not be supported in such cases sources can attack the router by sending to multiple pimbidir groups causing g state creation the catalyst does support gm states receiverinitiated attacks attacks can originate from multicast receivers any receiver sending an igmpmld report will typically create state on the firsthop router there is no equivalent mechanism in unicast fig  receiverside explicit joinbased traffic forwarding receiver attacks can be of three types a multicast receiver can attempt to join a flow for which they are not authorized and attempt to receive content they are unauthorized to receive a multicast receiver can potentially overload available network bandwidth by joining too many groups or channels this sort of attack becomes a shared bandwidth attack against other potential receivers of content a multicast receiver can attempt to launch an attack against routers or switches a large number of igmp reports can be generated which can create a large amount of multicast tree state and potentially overload router capacity this in turn can result in an increase in multicast convergence times or in a dos on the router we will discuss ways of mitigating these sorts of attacks in the next section securing a multicast network securing a multicast network securing a network element security is not a point feature but an intrinsic part of every network design as such security must be considered at every point in the network it is of paramount importance that each and every network element is appropriately secured one possible attack scenario applicable to any technology is a router subverted by an intruder once an intruder has control of a router the attacker can run a number of different attack scenarios including eavesdropping spoofing and active protocol attacks each network element must therefore be appropriately secured against any form of basic attack as well as against specific multicast attacks basic security before taking specific measures to secure routers and other network elements such as switches against specific multicast attack forms basic security must be deployed this applies to routers switches and any other element on the path for routers the recommended steps for fundamental security are as follows secure router remote access disable unneeded servers configure basic access lists enable logging secure management access enable authentication authorization and accounting configure traffic filtering enable routing security perform router maintenance and testing receive access control lists racl only  and  receive access control lists filter traffic destined to the control plane of a router as such the destination does not necessarily need to be specified since transit traffic will never be filtered by racls the command syntax which is only applicable to the  and  is as follows ip receive accesslist extacl this is a global filter that is applied to all “received” packets or in other words packets sent to any address “owned” by the router this includes all configured unicast addresses of the router as well as the mcast groups to which the router is listening to see what constitutes “receive” addresses on a router use the command show ip cef  include receive this filter can be useful to restrict the following unicast packets addressed to one of the router interface addresses ip broadcast packets packets for joined ip multicast traffic packets for link local scope groups note that racl is mostly superseded by copp please refer to the following section on copp for some cautionary remarks regarding racl and copp configuration control plane policing copp control plane policing is the evolution of racls and available on most platforms the principle is the same only traffic destined to the router will be policed by copp the syntax of the command is controlplane servicepolicy input policyname the service policy uses the same syntax as any quality of service policy with policymaps and classmaps therefore it extends the functionality of racls permitdeny with ratelimiters for certain traffic towards the control plane  note care must be taken when configuring racls and copp in a live network since both features filter all traffic to the control plane all required control and management plane protocols must be explicitly permitted the list of required protocols is therefore large and it is easy to overlook less obvious protocols such as ntp or tacacs as such all racl and copp configurations should always be tested in a lab before deployment furthermore initial deployments should start with a “permit” policy only this allows checking with acl hit counters for any unexpected hits in a multicast environment the required multicast protocols pim msdp igmp etc must be permitted in raclcopp for multicast to function properly note also that the first packet in a multicast stream with pimsm being used is also a control plane packet even though strictly speaking it is data plane traffic this is due to the fact that with the first packet multicast state needs to be created which is a control plane function therefore it is important to permit relevant multicast groups in raclcopp in copp they can be rate limited also note that there are a number of platformspecific exceptions especially on the highend platforms it is therefore important to read the relevant documentation and test any planned configuration before deployment please refer to the links in the reference section for more information local packet transport service lpts on ios xr local packet transport service lpts serves as a policer of traffic to the control plane of the router similar to copp on ios additionally receive traffic including unicast and multicast traffic can be filtered and rate limited see more about generic router security at the online training in the references multicastspecific security in a multicastenabled network each network element needs to be secured with multicastspecific security features these are outlined in this section for generic router protection features that are not required on every router but only in specific locations in the network and features that require interaction between routers such as pim authentication are discussed in the next section mroute limits the mroute limit command limits the amount of multicast routes globally on a router and helps to prevent dos attacks by flooding the multicast routing table ip multicast routelimit mroutelimit warningthreshold fig  mroute limits mroute limits allow the setting of a threshold on the number of mroutes that are permitted into the multicast routing table if a multicast route limit is enabled then no multicast state is created beyond the configured limit there is also a warning threshold when the number of mroutes exceeds the warning threshold it will trigger syslog warning messages at the mroute limit any further state triggering packets are discarded the ip multicast routelimit command is also available per mvrf disabling sap listen no ip sap listen the sap listen command causes a router to receive sapsdp messages sapsdp is a legacy protocol that dates from the days of the mbone these messages indicate directory information about multicast content that might be available in the future or at present this can be a source of a dos against router cpu and memory resources and therefore disabling this feature is generally recommended controlling access to mrinfo information  the ip multicast mrinfofilter command the mrinfo command available on cisco ios and also on some versions of microsoft windows and linux use diagnostic and troubleshooting messages to query a multicast router for information the ip multicast mrinfofilter global configuration command can be used to limit access to this information to a subset of sources or disable it altogether the following example denies queries sourced from  while allowing queries from any other source ip multicast mrinfofilter  accesslist  deny  accesslist  permit any the following example denies mrinfo requests from any source ip multicast mrinfofilter  accesslist  deny any note that as expected for any acl a deny means the packet will be filtered while a permit means the packet will be allowed if the mrinfo command is being used for troubleshooting or diagnostic purposes it is highly recommended to configure the ip multicast mrinfofilter command with an appropriate acl to allow queries only from a subset of source addresses the information provided by the mrinfo command can also be retrieved through snmp completely filtering mrinfo requests block any source from querying the device is highly recommended securing the network in this section we will discuss securing pim multicast and unicast control packets from a network perspective we will also look at autorp and bsr packets disabling multicast groups the following commands can be used to disable all operations for groups denied by the acl ip multicast grouprange stdacl future ipv multicast grouprange stdacl t if packets appear for any of the groups denied by the acl they are dropped in all control protocols which includes pim igmp mld msdp and are also dropped on the data plane therefore no igmpmld cache entries pim mribmfib state are ever created for these group ranges and all data packets are immediately dropped these commands are entered globally note that at this time there is only support for the ipv version of the command the ipv version will be available in a future code release  the recommendation is to deploy this command on all routers in the network when and where available so that all multicast traffic originating outside the network is controlled note that these commands affect the data plane and control plane where available this command provides more extensive coverage than standard acls and should be preferred securing pim pim neighbor control a pim router must receive pim hellos to establish pim neighborship pim neighborship is also the basis for designated router dr election and dr failover and accepting  sending pim joinpruneassert messages fig  pim neighbor control to inhibit unwanted neighbors use the ip pim neighborfilter command illustrated in figure  above this command filters from all nonallowed neighbors pim packets including hellos joinprune packets and bsr packets note that hosts on the segment can spoof the source ip address to pretend to be the pim neighbor layer  security mechanisms namely ip source guard are required to prevent source address spoofing on a segment see references or use a vlan acl in the access switch to prevent hosts from sending protocol  packets the keyword “loginput” can be used in acls to log offending packets the pim joinprune packet is sent to a pim neighbor to add or remove that neighbor from a particular sg or g forwarding path pim multicast packets are link local multicast packets sent with ttl all of these packets are multicast to the well known allpimrouters address   this means that all such attacks must originate on the same subnet as the router being attacked attacks can include forged hello joinprune and assert packets note that forging the ttl value in pim multicast packets to a higher value than  does not create problems since the allpimrouters address is always received and treated locally on a router it is never directly forwarded by normal and legitimate routers to protect the rp against a potential flood of pimsm register messages the dr should rate limit those messages the following command does this ip pim registerratelimit count fig  pimsm register tunnel control pim unicast packets can be used to attack the rp therefore the rp should be protected by infrastructure acls against such attacks note again that senders and receivers never need to send pim packets so the pim protocol ip protocol  can usually be filtered at the subscriber edge the following additional security measures should be configured with autorp where possible autorp control  rp announce filter ip pim rpannouncefilter this should be configured on the mapping agent to control which routers are accepted as candidate rps for which group ranges  groupmode fig  autorp – rp announce filter autorp control  constrain autorp messages use the multicast boundary command to constrain autorp packets to a particular pim domain  rpannounce  rpdiscover fig  multicast boundary command bsr control  constrain bsr messages use the ip pim bsrborder command to filter bsr messages at the border of a pim domain note that no acl is necessary since bsr messages are hopbyhop forwarded with link local multicast fig  bsr border rp  pimsmrelated filtering in the final section of this chapter we will discuss filtering relating to pimsm and rp control plane messages we will consider autorp bsr and msdp messages autorp filtering the following shows an example of autorp working together with address scoping two different ways of bounding a region are shown the two acls are equivalent from an autorp perspective fig  autorp filtering  scoping the idea of the interface boundary filters for autorp is to ensure that the autorp announcements only reach the regions they are supporting regional company and internetwide scopes are defined and in each case there exist corresponding rps and autorp advertisements we only want the regional rps to be known to the regional routers the company rps to be known to the regional and company routers and we want any internet rps to be globally available further levels of scoping are possible as shown in the picture there are two fundamentally different ways to filter autorp packets the internet boundary explicitly calls out the autorp control groups   resulting in all autorp packets being filtered this method should be used at the edge of an administrative domain where no autorp packets should pass through the region boundary uses the filterautorp keyword to instead create “semantic filtering” of autorp messages instead of directly filtering autorp packets this command will cause an examination of the rptogrouprange announcements within autorp packets when an announcement is explicitly denied by the acl it will be removed from the autorp packet before the packet is forwarded in the example this will allow the enterprisewide rps to be known within the regions while the regionwide rps will be filtered at the boundary from the region to the rest of the enterprise interdomain filters and msdp in this example isp is acting as a pimsm transit provider they are only supporting msdp peering with neighbors and they are only accepting sg but no g traffic on the border routers in interdomain usually between autonomous systems there are two basic security measures to be taken securing the data plane using the multicast boundary command this ensures that multicast traffic is only accepted for defined groups and potentially sources securing the interdomain control plane traffic msdp this consists of a number of separate security measures msdp content control state limitation and neighbor authentication we show a typical configuration from one of isp’s border routers showing an example interface filter to secure the data plane at the domain boundary we are inhibiting g joins by filtering “host ” and administratively scoped addresses via the multicast boundary command fig  interdomain g filter to secure the control plane we harden msdp via three basic security measures    msdp sa filters it is a “best common practice” to filter the content of msdp messages via msdp sa filters the main idea of this filter is to avoid propagating multicast state for applications and groups that are not internetwide applications and do not need to be forwarded beyond the source domain ideally from a security point of view the filters should only allow known groups and potentially senders and deny any unknown senders andor groups it is usually not possible to explicitly list all allowed senders andor groups cisco therefore recommends using the following default configuration filter for pimsm domains with a single rp for every group no msdp meshgroup  filter msdp samessages  replicate the following two rules for every external msdp peer  ip msdp safilter in peeraddress list  ip msdp safilter out peeraddress list    the redistribution rule is independent of peers  ip msdp redistribute list    acl to control samessages originated forwarded   domainlocal applications

recommendations httpwwwciscocomenustechtktechnologiestechnoteafdashtml  msdp state limitation when msdp is enabled between ass it is recommended to limit the amount of state that will be built in the router due to “sourceactive” sa messages received from neighbors the relevant command needed is as follows ip msdp salimit peer limit fig  msdp control plane with this command we can limit the number of sa states created due to sa messages accepted from an msdp peer some simple ruleofthumb recommendations include small limit from stubneighbor customer large limit from transit customer eg maximum sas in internet transit isp  configure maximum sas your platform can support  msdp md neighbor authentication we support and recommend the use of md password authentication on msdp peers this uses the tcp md signature option equivalent to the use described in rfc  for securing bgp fig  msdp md neighbor authentication these three msdp security recommendations pursue different goals neighbor authentication with md ensures that only trusted msdp peers can send messages the sa filters ensure that even a trusted msdp peer can only send sa announcements that are in line with preagreed sourcegroup policy the sa limit further ensures that even with legitimate sg announcements from legitimate peers the available memory cannot be exhausted sender  source issues many multicast security issues originating at the sender can be mitigated with appropriate unicast security mechanisms a number of unicast security mechanisms are recommended best practices here source address spoofing protection urpf or acl and ip source guard for the access layer infrastructure acls deny ip any to core address space such measures can be used to block directed attacks on the core this would for example also solve issues like attacks using pim unicast packets to the rp which is inside the network and would therefore be protected by the infrastructure acl packet filterbased access control – controlling sources in the example shown in figure  the filter is configured on the lan interface e of the firsthop multicast router designated router the filter is defined by an extended access control list called “source” this acl is applied to the sourcefacing interface of the designated router connected to the source lan in fact because of the nature of ipmc traffic there may need to be a similar filter configured on all lanfacing interfaces on which sources may potentially become active since it is not possible in all cases to know exactly where source activity may occur it is recommended to apply such filters on all ingress points into the network fig  controlling sources the effect of applying this filter is to filter traffic from a specific source or range of source addresses to a specific group or range of group addresses this filter will act before pim creates any mroutes and so helps limit state this is a standard data plane acl this is implemented in asic on highend platforms and no performance penalty should be incurred data plane acls are recommended and preferred over control plane filtering for directly connected sources because they minimize any control plane impact of unwanted traffic it is also very effective to limit the destination ip multicast group addresses to which packets can be sent being a router command it cannot overcome spoofing of sourceip addresses see earlier part of this section therefore it is recommended to either provide additional l mechanisms or a consistent policy for all devices that can connect to a particular lanvlan note that the “log” keyword in an acl is very useful to trace policy violations however logging consumes cpu resources and should be handled with care also on hardwarebased platforms acl log messages are produced by a cpu and therefore the cpu impact should be considered pimsm source control one of the actual advantages of the asm  pimsm architecture from a security standpoint is the fact that the rendezvous point gives a single point of control for all sources in the network for any group range this can be leveraged with a device called the acceptregister filter the command for this filter is as follows ip pim acceptregister  ipv pim acceptregister fig  pimsm source control in a pimsm network an unwanted traffic source can be controlled with this command when the source traffic hits the firsthop router the firsthop router dr creates sg state and sends a pim source register message to the rp if the source is not listed in the acceptregister filter list configured on the rp then the rp rejects the register and sends back an immediate registerstop message to the dr in the example shown a simple acl has been applied to the rp which filters only on the source address it is also possible to filter the source and the group with the use of an extended acl on the rp there are drawbacks with this method of source filtering because with the pim acceptregister command on the rp pimsm sg state is still created on the source’s firsthop router this can result in traffic reaching receivers local to the source and located between the source and the rp furthermore the pim acceptregister command works on the control plane of the rp this could be used to overload the rp with fake register messages and possibly cause a dos condition it is therefore recommended to apply the pim acceptregister command on the rp in addition to other edge filtering methods such as applying simple data plane acls on all drs on all ingress points into the network as described in section  while ingress acls on the dr would be sufficient in a perfectly configured and operated network it is recommended to configure the pim acceptregister command on the rp as a secondary security mechanism in case of misconfigurations on the edge routers applying several security mechanisms with the same goal is called “defense in depth” and is a common design principle in security receiver issues – controlling igmpmld most receiver issues fall in the domain of controlling the igmpmld receiver protocol interactions fig  controlling igmp when filtering igmp or mld packets the following should be considered ipv igmp is an ipv protocol type ipv procotol  ipv mld is carried in icmpv protocol type packets the igmp process is enabled by default as soon as ipmc is enabled igmp packets also carry the following protocols and therefore all of the following protocols are enabled whenever ipmc is enabled pimv – pimv was the first version of pim and is always enabled in ios for migration purposes current deployments all use pimv mrinfo  mrinfo is a unix command that ios inherited to display multicast neighbors cisco recommends the use of snmp instead of the mrinfo command dvmrp  dvmrp is a legacy dense mode distance vector protocol with very limited scaling characteristics ios support for dvmrp is being retired mtrace  mtrace is the multicast equivalent of unicast “traceroute” and is a useful tool for more information see the following httpwwwianaorgassignmentsigmptypenumbers router mtrace    type escape sequence to abort mtrace from  to  via group  from source  to destination  querying full reverse path     pim thresh   ms   pim thresh   ms   pim thresh   ms   pim thresh   ms   pim thresh   ms   pim thresh   ms unicast igmp packets for igmpudlr should always be filtered as these are most likely attack packets and not valid igmp protocol packets unicast igmp packets are supported by cisco ios in support of unidirectional links and other exception conditions forged igmpmld query packets can result in a lower igmp version being assumed in particular hosts should never send igmp queries because a query sent with a lower igmp version can cause all hosts that receive this query to revert to the lower version in the presence of igmpv  ssm hosts this can “attack” the ssm streams in the case of igmpv this can result in longer leave latencies if a nonredundant lan with a single igmp querier is present the router needs to drop igmp queries received if a redundant  common passive lan exists then a switch capable of igmp snooping is required there are  specific features that can help in this case router guard igmp minimum version command router guard any switch port can become a multicast router port if the switch receives a multicast router control packet igmp general query pim hello or cgmp hello on that port when a switch port becomes a multicast router port all multicast traffic is sent to that port this can be prevented with “router guard” the router guard feature does not require igmp snooping to be enabled the router guard feature allows a specified port to be designated a multicast host port the port is prevented from becoming a router port even if multicast router control packets are received the following packet types are discarded if they are received on a port that has router guard enabled igmp query messages ipv pimv messages igmp pim messages pimv igmp dvmrp messages rgmp messages cgmp messages when these packets are discarded statistics are updated indicating that packets are being dropped due to router guard igmp minimum version it is possible to configure the minimum version of igmp hosts allowed for example you may want to disallow all igmpv hosts or all igmpv and igmpv hosts this filtering applies only to membership reports if the hosts are attached to a common passive lan for example a switch that does not support igmp snooping or is not configured for it there is also nothing a router can do about such false queries other than ignore the “old version” membership reports that are then triggered and not fall back itself since igmp queries must be visible to all hosts it is not possible to use a hmac mechanism using a preshared key such as static key ipsec to authenticate igmp queries from “valid routers” if two or more routers are attached to a common lan segment an igmp querier election is required in that case the only filter that could be used is an ip accessgroup filter based on the source ip address of the other igmp querying router “normal” multicast igmp packets must be permitted the following filter should be used on receiver ports to allow only “good” igmp packets and to filter known “bad” ones ip accesslist extended igmpcontrol … deny igmp any any pim  no pimv deny igmp any any dvmrp  no dvmrp packets deny igmp any any hostquery  do not use this command with redundant routers  in that case this packet type is required  permit igmp any host   igmpv membership reports permit igmp any any   mtrace responses permit igmp any any   mtrace queries permit igmp any   hostquery  igmpvvv queries permit igmp any   hostreport  igmpvv reports permit igmp any     igmpv leave messages deny igmp any any  implicitly deny unicast igmp here … permit ip any any  permit other packets interface ethernet  ip accessgroup igmpcontrol in note that this type of igmp filtering can and should be used in receive acls or control plane policing in both applications it needs to be combined with filters for other traffic handled such as routing and management plane protocols  fig  host receiverside access control to filter traffic to a receiver we do not filter data plane traffic but rather the control plane protocol igmp since igmp is a necessary prerequisite to receive multicast traffic no data plane filters are required in particular we might want to restrict which multicast flows receivers can join attached to the interface that the command is configured on in this case the following command should be used ip igmp accessgroup  ipv mld accessgroup for more information see the following httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosipmulticommandimccrbookhtml for asm groups this command will effectively only filter based on the destination address the source ip address in the acl is then ignored for ssm groups using igmpv  mldv it will filter on source and destination ip the following example filters a given group for all igmp speakers accesslist  deny   accesslist  permit any log  interface ethernet  ip igmp accessgroup  the following example filters specific igmp speakers hence specific multicast receivers for a given group ip accesslist extended test deny igmp host  host  permit igmp any any  interface ethernet ip igmp accessgroup test again note that for asm groups the source is ignored admission control we discussed access control in the previous section access control delivers a yesno answer for certain flows independently of the state of the network admission control by contrast limits the number of resources that a sender  receiver can use assuming they passed the access control mechanisms various devices are available to help with admission control in a multicast environment global and per interface igmp limits at the receiverside router there is the possibility to limit the number of igmp groups joined both globally and per interface the commands are as follows ip igmp limit n  except extacl  ipv mld limit n  except extacl  it is recommended that this limit always be configured per interface and also globally in each case the limit refers to counts of entries in the igmp cache the following two examples show how this command can be used to help limit the number of groups at the edge of a residential broadband network example   restrict received groups to only the sdr announcements plus one received channel sdr session directory acts as a channel guide to some ipmc receivers see the following for more details httptoolsietforghtmldraftietfmmusicsdp a common requirement is to restrict receivers to receive the sd group plus one channel the following configuration can be used ip accesslist extended channelguides permit ip any host   sdr announcements deny ip any any ip igmp limit  except channelguides interface ethernet  ip igmp limit  except channelguides the access list in this example specifies the channel guide only the global ip igmp limit command limits each igmp source to a single  channel excluding the channel guide which can always be received the interface command overrides the global command and allows two  channels to be received in addition to the channel guide on this interface example   admission control on aggregationdslam link this command can also be used to provide a form of bandwidth admission control for example if it were necessary to distribute  sdtv channels which are mbps each and there is a gbps link to the dslam we might take a policy decision to limit the tv bandwidth to mbps and leave the rest for internet and other uses in that case we would limit the igmp states to mbpsmbps   igmp states the following configuration can be used in this case fig  use of perinterface igmp limits admission control on aggdslam link perinterface mroute limits enabling perinterface mroute state limits is a more generic form of admission control it not only limits igmp and pim state on an outgoing interface but also provides a way of limiting state on incoming interfaces the command to use in such cases is as follows ip multicast limit  rpf  out  connected  extacl max state can be separately limited on input and output interfaces directly attached source state can also be limited with the use of the “connected” key word the following examples illustrate the use of this command example  – egress admission control on aggdslam link in this example we have  sd tv channels we assume that each sd channel needs mbps again we assume that we allow no more than mbps for video traffic we also assume that we need to support basic extended and premium bundles if we decide to allocate bandwidth as follows   mbps basic   mbps extended   mbps premium then using mbps per channel we will limit the dslam uplink to basic  states extended  states premium  states we configure the limit on the outbound interface facing the dslam from the peagg fig  use of perinterface mroute limits admission control on aggdslam link example  – ingress admission control on aggdslam link instead of using the “out” limit on the upstream device’s outbound interface it is possible to use “rpf” limits on the downstream device’s rpf interface this effectively has the same result as the previous example and could be useful if the downstream device is not an ios device fig  use of perinterface mroute limits input admission control example   bandwidthbased limits we can make a further subdivision of access bandwidth between multiple content providers and offer each content provider a fair share of the bandwidth on the uplink to the dslam in that case we can use the following ip multicast limit cost extacl multiplier with this command it is possible to attribute a “cost” using the value specified in “multiplier” to any states that match the extended acl in the ip multicast limit this command is a global command and multiple simultaneous costs can be configured in this example it is necessary to support three different content providers with fair access to each into the network additionally in this example it is a requirement to support streams of the following types mpeg sdtv mbps  mpeg hdtv mbps  mpeg sdtv mbps  mpeg hdtv mbps in such a case we could then allocate bandwidth costs to each stream type and share the remaining mbps between the three content providers with the following configuration ip multicast limit cost aclmpsdchannels   from any provider ip multicast limit cost aclmphdchannels   from any provider ip multicast limit cost aclmpsdchannels   from any provider ip multicast limit cost aclmphdchannels   from any provider  interface gig description  interface towards dslam    cac ip multicast limit out  aclcpchannels ip multicast limit out  aclcpchannels ip multicast limit out  aclcpchannels fig  cost factor for perinterface mroute state limits multicast and ipsec introduction to get vpn as with unicast multicast traffic also sometimes needs to be secured to provide confidentiality or integrity protection there are two major areas where such services may be required encrypting multicast streams for example in banking applications that stream confidential data to a large set of receivers using multicast  this is data plane security encrypting control plane protocols that use multicast ospf or pim for example  this is control plane security ipsec as a protocol rfcs     is specifically limited to unicast traffic by rfc there a “security association” sa is established between two unicast peers in order to apply ipsec to multicast traffic one option is to encapsulate multicast traffic within a gre tunnel and then to apply ipsec to the gre tunnel which is unicast a newer approach uses a single security association established between all members of the group the group domain of interpretation gdoi rfc  defines how this is achieved based on gdoi cisco developed a technology called group encryption transport get vpn this technology uses “tunnel mode with address preservation” as defined in the document “draftietfmsecipsecextensions” in get vpn first a group security association is established between all members of the group subsequently the traffic is protected either with esp encapsulating security payload or ah authentication header using tunnel mode with address preservation in summary get vpn encapsulates a multicast packet using the address information of the original header and then protects the inner packet according to the group policy using an esp for example the advantage of get vpn is that routing and forwarding are not affected at all by the security encapsulation mechanisms the routed ip header addresses remain the same as the original ip header this makes it easy to secure multicast traffic because routing and forwarding is the same as without get vpn the policy that is applied to the get vpn nodes is centrally defined on a group key server and distributed to all group nodes therefore all group nodes have the same policy and the same security settings applied to group traffic similar to standard ipsec the crypto policy defines what type of traffic needs to be protected in which way this allows get vpn to be used for various purposes using get vpn to encrypt multicast data plane traffic the networkwide crypto policy is set on the group key server and distributed to the get vpn endpoints the policy contains the ipsec policy ipsec mode  here tunnel mode with header preservation and security algorithms to be used eg aes it also contains a policy describing which traffic should be secured as defined by an acl get vpn can be used for multicast as well as unicast traffic a policy for securing unicast traffic could be defined by an acl in the following manner permit ip     this would encrypt all traffic with a source ip from  and a destination ip  all other traffic for example traffic from  to another address would be ignored by get vpn the application of get vpn for multicast traffic is technically the same for example the following can be used to secure traffic from any source to respective multicast groups permit ip any   this policy matches all sources “any” and all multicast groups starting with  traffic to other multicast groups will not be secured note that while this appears relatively simple great attention must be paid to the construction of the crypto acl management traffic or traffic that originates outside the get vpn domain but terminates inside ie traffic that passes only one crypto endpoint must be excluded from the gdoi policy common mistakes include permit ip any   this also encrypts ospf traffic and other control plane traffic which might be destined at a peer router for example not excluding management traffic from the crypto policy which terminates inside the network this includes gdoi traffic itself using get vpn to authenticate control plane traffic it is generally a best practice to authenticate control plane traffic such as routing to ensure that messages are coming from a trusted peer this is comparatively simple for control plane protocols that use unicast such as bgp however many control plane protocols use multicast traffic examples are ospf rip and pim for the full list see the following httpwwwianaorgassignmentsmulticastaddresses some of these protocols have builtin authentication eg rip ospfv eigrp others rely on ipsec to provide this authentication eg ospfv pim for the latter case get vpn provides a scalable way to secure these protocols in most cases the requirement is protocol message authentication or in other words verification that a message was sent by a trusted peer however get vpn also allows encryption of such messages to secure typically authenticate only such control plane traffic the traffic needs to be described with an acl and included in the get vpn policy the details depend on the protocol to be secured where attention needs to be paid to whether the acl includes traffic that passes only an ingress get vpn node ie is encapsulated or also an egress node there are two fundamental ways to secure pim protocols permit ip any   this is the “all pim routers” multicast group however this will not secure unicast pim messages permit pim any any this will secure the pim protocol independent of whether multicast or unicast is used note that the above commands explain a concept and are not be used literally for example it is necessary to exclude certain pim protocols used to bootstrap pim such as bsr or autorp also depending on the deployment both methods have certain advantages and inconveniences please refer to specific literature on how to secure pim with get vpn for details conclusions ip multicast is becoming an increasingly common service in internetworks the emergence of iptv services in residential  home broadband networks and the move towards electronic trading applications in many of the world’s financial markets are just two examples of requirements that are making ip multicast an absolute requirement multicast comes with a variety of different configuration operation and management challenges one of the key challenges is security in this paper we have examined a variety of ways in which ipmc can be secured we began by looking at the overall multicast control and data planes and explained how the differences from unicast present new security challenges we then examined the key protocols that are encountered in an ip multicast network in particular igmp pim and msdp were examined in some detail in each case a description of security threats and recommended best practices for mitigating these threats were provided we then described some specific examples of how multicast can be secured in some specific applications such as broadband edge networks where bandwidth may be relatively limited in comparison to the amount of bandwidth that specific video flows may require finally the get vpn architecture was described as a means of integrating ipmc with ipsec for delivering secure vpns in securing ipmc it should always be remembered how it is different to unicast multicast forwarding is based upon the creation of dynamic forwarding state multicast involves dynamic packet replication and multicast builds unidirectional trees in response to pim join  prune messages maintaining the security of this whole environment involves the understanding and deployment of a rich framework of ios commands these commands are largely centered around controlling protocol operations states multicast or policing packets mqc copp with correct use of these commands it is possible to provide a robust protected servicesla for ipmc in summary the following are the approaches that we have promoted and described in this paper widespread use of ssm – this is the most simple pim mode that also allows the use of sg forwarding where ssm can be used it should be if asm services are needed ensure a robust service can be provided – use of statically defined rps provides a more secure control plane than dynamic rp announcements autorp and bsr are more flexible if pimsm is enabled look at areas of particular vulnerability like the register tunnel to the rp and ensure that the dr is always well protected copp is very helpful in these areas if interdomain asm services are needed consider whether bidir pim can be deployed use global mrouteigmp state limits – understand the capabilities of your platforms together with the expected maximum amount of state you might need under normal circumstances and in the worst case scenario configure limits within your platform’s capabilities that allow your network to operate to its maximal limits fundamental filtering – raclcopp and infrastructure acls including blocking pim at the access layer ipmc is an exciting and scalable means of delivering a variety of application

which the compatibleasm attribute must be set to  or higherthis attribute can only be set when altering a disk groupfailgrouprepairtime cthe failgrouprepairtime attribute specifies a default repair time for the failure groups in the disk group the failure group repair time is used if asm determines that an entire failure group has failed the default value is  hours if there is a repair time specified for a disk such as with the drop after clause of the alter diskgroup offline disk statement that disk repair time overrides the failure group repair timethis attribute can only be set when altering a disk group and is only applicable to normal and high redundancy disk groupsidpboundary and idptype exadatathese attributes are used to configure exadata storage and are relevant for the intelligent data placement featurephysmetareplicated cthe physmetareplicated attribute tracks the replication status of a disk group when the asm compatibility of a disk group is advanced to  or higher the physical metadata of each disk is replicated this metadata includes the disk header free space table blocks and allocation table blocks the replication is performed online asynchronously this attribute value is set to true by asm if the physical metadata of every disk in the disk group has been replicatedthis attribute is only defined in a disk group with the compatibleasm set to  and higher the attribute is readonly and is intended for information only  a user cannot set or change its value the values are either true or falsesectorsizethe sectorsize attribute specifies the sector size for disks in a disk group and can only be set when creating a disk groupthe values for the sectorsize can be   or k provided the disks support those values the default value is platform dependent the compatibleasm and compatiblerdbms attributes must be set to  or higher to set the sector size to a value other than the default valuenote asm cluster file system acfs does not support  kb sector drivesstoragetypethe storagetype attribute specifies the type of the disks in the disk group the possible values are exadata pillar zfsas and other if the attribute is set to exadatapillarzfsas then all disks in the disk group must be of that type if the attribute is set to other any types of disks can be in the disk groupif the storagetype disk group attribute is set to pillar or zfsas the hybrid columnar compression hcc functionality can be enabled for the objects in the disk group exadata already supports hccnote the zfs storage must be provisioned through direct nfs dnfs and the pillar axiom storage must be provisioned via the scsi or the fiber channel interfaceto set the storagetype attribute the compatibleasm and compatiblerdbms disk group attributes must be set to  or higher for maximum support with zfs storage set compatibleasm and compatiblerdbms disk group attributes to  or higherthe storagetype attribute can be set when creating or altering a disk group the attribute cannot be set when clients are connected to the disk group for example the attribute cannot be set when an advm volume is enabled on the disk groupthe attribute is not visible in the vasmattribute view or with the asmcmd lsattr command until the attribute has been setthinprovisioned cthe thinprovisioned attribute enables or disables the functionality to discard unused storage space after a disk group rebalance is completed the attribute value can be true or false defaultstorage vendor products that support thin provisioning have the capability to reuse the discarded storage space for a more efficient overall physical storage utilizationappliancemode  exadatathe appliancemode attribute improves the disk rebalance completion time when dropping one or more asm disks this means that redundancy is restored faster after a disk failure the attribute is automatically enabled when creating a new disk group in exadata existing disk groups must explicitly set the attribute using the alter diskgroup command this feature is also known as fixed partneringthe attribute can only be enabled on disk groups that meet the following requirementsthe oracle asm disk group attribute compatibleasm is set to release  or laterthe cellsmartscancapable attribute is set to trueall disks in the disk group are the same type of disk such as all hard disks or all flash disksall

release  running oracle database g release   release note this feature is not available in oracle database version hidden disk group attributesnot all disk group attributes are documented here are some of the more interesting onesrebalancecompactthe rebalancecompact attribute is related to the compacting phase of the rebalance the attribute value can be true default or false setting the attribute to false disables the compacting phase of the disk group rebalanceextentcountsthe extentcounts attribute is related to the variable extents size feature that determines the points at which the extent size will be incrementedthe value of the attribute is “  ” which means that the first  extent sizes will be  au next  extents will have the size determined by the second value of the extentsizes attribute and the rest will have the size determined by the third value of the extentsizes attributeextentsizesthe extentsizes is the second attribute relevant to the variable extents size feature and it determines the extent size increments  in the number of ausin asm version  the attribute value is    in asm version  and later the value of the extentsizes is   vasmattribute view and
