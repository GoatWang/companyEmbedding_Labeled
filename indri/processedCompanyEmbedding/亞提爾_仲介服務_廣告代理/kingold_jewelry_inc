  kingold jewelry inc “kingold” or the “company” through a variable interest entity relationship with wuhan kingold jewelry company limited or wuhan kingold is one of the leading professional designers and manufacturers of high quality karat gold jewelry and chinese ornaments kingold offers a wide range of inhouse designed products including but not limited to gold necklaces rings earrings bracelets and pendants   kingold is also engaged in developing promoting and selling a broad range of products to the rapidly expanding jewelry market across the people’s republic of china kingold has built a partnership with the jewelry institute of china university of geosciences to help new products design   b products overview   in  kingold’s net sales were primarily composed of sales of branded products to wholesale and retail customers as well as fees generated from customized production in customized production a customer supplies the company with the raw materials and the company creates products per that customer’s instructions whereas in branded production the company generally purchases gold directly and manufactures and markets the products on its own   based upon kingold’s internal analysis of its products all products that kingold produces contain conflict minerals accordingly for the purpose of this form sd together with any exhibits hereto branded and customized products were considered   c supply chain overview   as kingold specializes in karat gold jewelry its products contain gold and do not contain other types of conflict minerals tin tantalum and tungsten kingold does not engage in the actual mining of gold nor makes purchase of raw ore or unrefined conflict minerals all gold used in kingold’s products is sourced from shanghai gold exchange the “exchange” or supplied directly from its customers   kingold has reviewed the procurement process of gold and analyzed the supply chain throughout its manufacturing and product delivery kingold trades gold from the exchange and obtains gold from the bank vaults and the warehouse of a finance security company the “warehouse” as designated by the exchange whilst gold supplied by customers is sourced from either the exchange or local refineries in which recycled gold may be used   according to the information kingold gathered gold traded on the exchange may be either imported by qualified entities that are assigned by the central bank or locally sourced before storing in designated bank vaults and the warehouse in  only chinese banks were allowed to import gold such gold regardless imported or locally sourced is marked with the identity of refineries in the form of name and logo therefore kingold defined the scope of conflict minerals due diligence by identifying and reaching out to the refineries as indicated on the gold bullion for the purpose of due diligence kingold has developed conflict minerals reporting template by reference to the standard reporting established by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi   d reasonable country of origin inquiry rcoi and roci conclusion   due to the fact that kingold obtained gold directly from bank vaults and the warehouse kingold conducted a series of inquiries with the bank vaults and the warehouse where it collected gold from in          kingold has noticed that i the bank vaults and the warehouse record the movement of gold in the format of quantity fineness time refinery and collector ii each batch of gold is marked with the identity of the refinery weight fineness and a unique identification number iii each batch of gold is affixed with a refinery certificate iv the record is archived every month v companies can obtain refinery certificates of the batch to be collected upon prior notice made to the bank vaults and the warehouse   kingold made no record of refineries associated with the gold collected from the bank vaults and the warehouse in  and it relied on the records from the bank vaults and the warehouse for refinery identities as past records from the bank vaults and the warehouse were archived kingold was unable to collect sufficient information to identify the refineries associated with the gold in the products that kingold produced in such context kingold was unable to identify the origin of the gold contained in its branded and customized products provided to its customers and it will take further actions to mitigate the risk   due to the complexity and the breadth of refineries involved it will take time for kingold to identify all the refineries associated with the gold used in its products kingold will leverage its due diligence processes participate industrywide initiatives and work with regulators to further develop transparency in its supply chain   item  exhibit   a copy of the company’s conflict minerals report is provided as exhibit  to this form sd a copy of the company’s conflict minerals report together with this form

commission the “sec” to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to conflict minerals as directed by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank act” the rule imposes certain reporting obligations on sec registrants whose manufactured products contain conflict minerals which are necessary to the functionality or production of their products “conflict minerals” refer to cassiterite ie tin columbitetantalite ie tantalum gold wolframite ie tungsten or any other minerals or their derivatives determined by the secretary of state to be financing conflict in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country “covered countries”   in accordance with the rule kingold undertook due diligence to determine the conflict minerals status of the necessary conflict minerals used in components for manufacturing kingold’s karat gold jewelry and chinese ornament products in conducting its due diligence kingold applied guidance from the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas and the related supplements on gold tin tantalum and tungsten collectively “oecd guidance” an internationally recognized due diligence framework   kingold has determined in good faith from its due diligence efforts that for the calendar year conflict minerals used in components for manufacturing kingold’s products are “drc conflict undeterminable”   the report presented herein is not audited as the rule provides for a temporary twoyear period for all companies and fouryear period for smaller reporting companies if a registrant’s products are “drc conflict undeterminable” the report is not subject to an independent private sector audit   kingold jewelry inc will follow and comply with any change on the rule on a continuous basis and adopt any appropriate measures    introduction   this conflict minerals report provides a description of the measures that the company has taken to exercise due diligence with respect to the conflict minerals contained in kingold’s branded and customized products under instructions of its customers that kingold manufactured either internally or through contractual arrangement with thirdparty manufacturers contract to manufacture during the calendar year   the objective of the company’s due diligence measures is to identify the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in its branded and customized products manufactured internally or contract to manufacture during    based upon the analysis of its products and supply chain kingold has determined that gold is the only type of conflict minerals contained in all the products that kingold internally manufactures and contracts to manufacture through agreement with thirdparty manufacturers kingold sources all gold from shanghai gold exchange the “exchange” for its branded products customers source the gold either from the exchange or local refinery and supply to kingold for customized product manufacturing gold sourced from the exchange is marked with the identity of the refineries         as stated in the form sd kingold is unable to determine the origin of the gold in its products and therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some gold may have originated in the covered countries for that reason kingold is required under the rule to submit this report to the sec as an exhibit to the form sd    design of the company’s due diligence measures   kingold designed its due diligence measures to conform in all material aspects with the oecd guidance    due diligence performed by the company   step  establish company management system   kingold established a working group the “working group” to manage the company’s conflict minerals management program the working group consists of representatives from departments across the company including investment finance and legal affairs members of the working group and the company’s chief financial officer held a kickoff meeting to understand the requirements of the rule the objectives of the conflict minerals management program and the expectations of the due diligence measures   kingold has developed a series of procedures as guidance for the working group to perform all necessary work in order to trace the origins of the conflict minerals in its products the procedures include identification of refineries reasonable country of origin inquiry due diligence governance and future enhancements   kingold has adopted a conflict minerals policy which sets forth the company’s value and commitment towards the tracing of conflict minerals origins the conflict minerals policy is as follows   kingold jewelry inc conflict minerals policy   kingold jewelry inc “kingold” is committed to become a socially responsible and ethical business that respects human rights and condemn any conduct that violates   the rules “the rule” of section  of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act require all uslisted registrants to disclose origins of the “conflict minerals” used in their products “conflict minerals” refer to cassiterite ie tin columbitetantalite ie tantalum gold wolframite ie tungsten or any other minerals or their derivatives determined by the secretary of state to be financing conflict in the covered countries     kingold is aware that “conflict minerals” may directly or indirectly finance the armed groups in the “covered countries” through trading and acknowledges and supports the goal of the rule to disclose origin of the “conflict minerals” in order to meet the requirements of the rule kingold has started to develop the procedures that are necessary to analyse its products and investigate the origins of the “conflict minerals” used in its products currently gold is the “conflict minerals” contained in kingold’s products   kingold sources gold from shanghai gold exchange the “exchange” or receives gold from its customers for customized products kingold endeavors to trace the origins of gold sourced from the exchange and actively communicate with its customers regarding the requirements of the rule and seek their cooperation to assist kingold in the identification of gold origins   kingold’s actions to trace the origins of “conflict minerals” demonstrate its commitment of responsible and ethical practice and will continue to do so by adhering to the underlying sec rules and other applicable regulations on “conflict minerals”      covered countries include democratic republic of the congo drc angola burundi central african republic the republic of the congo rwanda south sudan tanzania uganda and zambia         step  assessment of risk in the company’s supply chain   the working group evaluated the risk of channels where gold is processed at kingold for manufacturing currently there are two channels where kingold receives gold i collected from the exchange and ii supplied by kingold’s customers   during the reasonable country of origin inquiry as described in the form sd the working group has made inquiries with the bank vaults and the warehouse from which kingold has collected gold in  to identify the refineries associated with the gold in kingold’s products in the same period the bank vaults and the warehouse have disclosed the name of two major refineries namely rand refinery pty ltd and argorheraeus sa which provided most of the gold supply but could not confirm if all the gold used in kingold’s products was from those two refineries due to the limited information provided by the bank vaults and the warehouse kingold was unable to identify the name of all gold refineries which produced gold used in kingold’s products in the calendar year   regarding customized product old supplied by customers is sourced from either the exchange or local refineries because of limited information provided by the relevant customers kingold was unable to identify the name of local refineries pertained to customized products and whether there was a mixture of recycled gold and raw ore    as a result of the inquiry and the assessment for gold sourced from the exchange either by kingold or kingold’s customers the company noted that i information marked on gold leads to the identification of the refineries ii some gold used in its products may not originate from the covered countries iii the exchange as the only authorized platform for gold trading in china and under regulation of the central bank has the database recording movement of all gold traded   kingold compared the names of the two identified refineries against the cfsi list of certified smelters to confirm whether the refineries are in the list or not   step  design and implementation of strategies to respond to identified risks   based on the results of the inquiries and the assessment kingold clarified the movement of gold from the exchange and has developed several methods to investigate the list of refineries that have produced the gold used in kingold’s products   kingold is in process of creating a database of refineries whose gold is used in its products by requesting refinery certificate from the bank vaults and the warehouse on each batch it collects for the purpose of due diligence in the future kingold has developed conflict minerals reporting template by reference to the standard reporting established by the conflictfree sourcing initiative cfsi regarding customized products kingold will ask its customers to provide the following information as appropriate to conduct due diligence   · refinery certificates from bank vaults and the warehouse if gold is delivered from the exchange · the name of local refineries   step  independent thirdparty audits of company’s supply chain   kingold has no direct business relationships with refineries and does not perform or direct audits of these entities within its supply chain kingold relies on certain industry initiatives such as the conflictfree smelter programs for independent thirdparty audit information   step  reporting on supply chain due diligence   with the preparation and submission of this conflict minerals report the company has provided a public report of its due diligence measures with regard to the sourcing of conflict minerals a copy of this report is publicly available at wwwkingoldjewelrycom          results of due diligence   based on the inquiries made to the bank vaults and the warehouse and after exercising the due diligences measures described above kingold could not with respect to the information gathered form a basis for a reasonable belief that none of the gold used in its branded and customized products originated in the covered countries   the bank vaults and the warehouse have disclosed the name of two major refineries namely rand refinery pty ltd and argorheraeus sa which provided most of the gold supply kingold noted that these two identified refineries are on the list of cfsi’s certified conflict free smelters cfs since the bank vaults and the warehouse have already archived most of their past records they could not provide the details of refineries pertained to gold used in kingold’s products in  because of passage of time kingold was unable to identify the name of local refineries pertained to customized products   as such the company has concluded that the gold used in the branded and customized products is “drc conflict undeterminable”    steps to be taken to mitigate risks   in the coming years kingold will take the following steps along with the due diligence measures described above to improve its conflict minerals management program and to further mitigate risks that gold used in kingold’s branded and customized products may directly or indirectly finance armed groups in the covered countries   · to request for refinery certificate from the bank vaults and the warehouse on each collection of gold and update its database of refineries on a regular basis · to include a conflict minerals clause in business agreement with kingold’s customers for customized products request for the source and origins of gold from customers on each supply of gold     kingold jewelry inc issues open letter to shareholderspr newswire asia home page  news releases  industry news  kingold jewelry inc issues open letter to shareholders × consumer products  retail entertainment  media kingold jewelry inc issues open letter to shareholders   wuhan city china may   prnewswireasia  kingold jewelry inc kingold or the company nasdaq kgji one of chinas leading manufacturers and designers of karat gold jewelry and ornaments today released an open letter to shareholders from the companys chairman zhihong jia discussing kingolds platform for sustainable growth and dedication to strong corporate governance dear kingold shareholders i am writing to thank you for your ongoing commitment to kingold jewelry especially during the challenging current market environment for reverse mergers rtosreverse takeovers of china based operating companies that trade on united states exchanges  the problems that have surfaced among china rtos appear to emanate largely from failures in corporate governance practices and in a few cases reflect blatant fraud  in the hope of allaying any concerns you may have i would like to review ways in which kingold has built a solid platform for sustainable growth while maintaining rigorous corporate governance standards kingold operates a sustainable low risk business model we have established a market leading position in chinas gold jewelry industry which only opened to the private sector in   unlike many of our peers who are conglomerates or who operate in the broader nongold jewelry category kingold focuses exclusively on karat gold products  furthermore we have specialized in design and manufacturing rather than branching out into wholesale distribution and retailing businesses  we have placed a strong emphasis on product quality and serving our valued customers  importantly we have not made a single acquisition to date and we plan to continue on an organic growth strategy going forward   we are proud of our progress in developing our new line of investmentoriented gold products as well as our line of proprietary mgold brand jewelry  we believe our current capital base and cash flow are sufficient to meet our nearterm capital requirements a major benefit of our business model is a low level of accounts receivable  we set the price for our products at the time a customer places a purchase order we then buy the gold to produce the products ordered and are paid in full when we deliver the finished goods to the customer  kingold had less than  million of accounts receivable as of december   a negligible amount for a business that generated  million in  revenues kingold is dedicated to transparency and strong financial and operational controls our business model is inherently transparent as kingold produces only karat gold products and we purchase our gold exclusively from the shanghai gold exchange the exchange all these purchases can be independently verified in addition some of our gold is supplied by our customers for customized production in  we produced a total of  tons of gold products of which approximately  tons of gold was purchased from the exchange and  tons was supplied by customers   moreover our tax records in china are transparent and match the numbers reported in the united states  as a result of our focused business model the fair market value of our inventory which is comprised entirely of karat gold can be easily determined   finally stringent financial controls are a companywide priority from the ground up to our board of directors board and finally to me we recently hired a wellregarded consulting firm in china to bolster our internal controls and  compliance who conducted an indepth review of our internal control over financial reporting and continues to support us regarding financial controls when we had an issue with a noncash stock compensation expense resulting from the issuance of  shares of restricted common stock that was previously disclosed we hired a big  accounting firm to evaluate the effect of the expense on our financial statements which resulted in a de minimis charge our decisive action demonstrates our commitment to achieving a very high standard of corporate governance our goal is to have the best corporate governance of any chinese company listed on a us exchange       kingold has a dedicated management team and board of directors i started kingold shortly after liberalization of the jewelry industry in  i was attracted to the sector as a result of my previous experience managing gold mines on behalf of the prc army i have worked hard to surround myself with the best possible team to help me realize what i believe to be a unique opportunity that of becoming the undisputed leader in chinas karat gold jewelry manufacturing industry the day to day operations of kingold are managed by our general manager bin zhao an industry veteran with close to  years of experience together with a highly skilled team of professionals our cfo bin liu has more than  years of global capital markets experience and before joining us served as a vice president of citigroups financial institution cards business  i have no family members involved in any aspect of kingolds business nor do i have any other businesses kingold also is distinguished by a strong board with independent directors that include professor h david sherman a us certified public accountant who serves as chairman of our audit committee since  dr sherman has been a professor at northeastern university college of business in addition dr sherman who earned his mba and doctorate at the harvard graduate school of business administration was on the faculty of the mit sloan school of management an adjunct professor of insead france and an adjunct professor of tufts medical school department of public health he also served as an academic fellow at the securities and exchange
