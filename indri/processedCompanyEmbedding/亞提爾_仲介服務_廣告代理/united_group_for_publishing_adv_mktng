mestdaghon august  format paperbackas a teacher of apush i have purchased all the available review books that reflect the  updates seeing as the college board has been less than helpful to teachers in this regard here is how i rank them amsco john newman is the best this book offers eight stimulusbased multiple choice questions and six short answers per chapter not period and  long essays and a dbq for each period of history the drawback to this book however is that students cannot purchase an answer key teachers can obtain one through the publisher but it must be shipped to a school there is also only one fulllength practice exam kaplan is also good as it offers five practice tests and  stimulus based multiple choice questions at least two short answers and either a long essay or a dbqs for each period of history this is what i will recommend to my students this year as i will likely keep the amsco for myself to use for inclass assessments barrons is pretty substandard for while it does offer three practice tests it only offers  stimulus based multiple choice questions and zero short answers long answers dbqs per period of history  steps to a  is the worst of the bunch with three practice tests and no stimulus based multiple choice short answers long essays or dbqs associated with each period of historyif you are an apush teacher i highly recommend this book whether you spend the extra  to buy the answer key from the publisher is up to you if you are an apush student i would also highly recommend this book but would also tell you to consider the kaplan book as they have a few more fulllength tests and answers are included although you sacrifice questions that are associated with each periodread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to

books being hauled around by students this one is unusually good because its simple straightforward and uncomplicated the writing is clear it covers the main topics and the practice ap exam questions are generally good its also not big and bulky like the more famous review books most of which are overly complicated and no fun to use this one can be treated like a normal book saved and reused for
