invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search chinas bald tires yet another defective product from the orient piles on the misery of overseas investing rich duprey tmfcop jun   at am not that china needed another black eye these days but reports that tires manufactured in the country are missing a key safety component thats already caused two deaths certainly doesnt help china shed its growing image of shoddy products some  chinesemade tires  a number that could balloon to nearly a million depending on how many distributors have sold tires made at this factory  are going to be subject to a massive recall that threatens to bankrupt the small new jersey distributor that imports them foreign tire sales says it will begin a recall when it gets notification from the nhtsa we will wait to get their order and create a remedy plan and begin a recall said a company spokesman when the money runs out thats the end the problem is that a thin gum strip between the steel belts of a tire is allegedly missing foreign tire says the chinese manufacturer a company that its been doing business with for  years with no problems until now stopped inserting the apiece strip leading to tread separation it was tread separation that doomed firestone a few years back and caused a blowout in its relationship with ford nysef which had extended as far back as the model t the chinese manufacturer the hangzhou zhongce rubber company disputes the assertion though foreign tires says it had admitted as much to the company in a report it gave to federal regulators foreign tire was sued in may as a result of a crash caused by tread separation that led to two deaths the company had been suspicious of the tires since  when it began receiving an increasing number of customer complaints about them the company undertook its own tests and earlier this month it reported its concerns to the nhtsa asking for assistance in recalling the tires it estimates that this process will cost between  million and  million  money foreign tire says it doesnt have hangzhou zhongce thinks the problem has more to do with china becoming a bigger player in the tire market than anything to do with defective tires according to the rubber manufacturers association china accounts for  million units in tire imports to the us the largest of any other country both goodyear nysegt and cooper tire nysectb have moved production facilities to china in the face of rising us labor costs tires of course are merely the latest in a string of highprofile product problems emanating from china toymaker rc nasdaqrcrc is probably relieved that tires may now be the focus of substandard manufacturing processes since it was discovered that its hugely popular thomas the tank engine train toys were coated with lead paint  a process its chinese manufacturer also undertook on its own  it has been the subject of consumer and regulatory ire lead paint has been banned in the us for decades before the toy problem there was another cause for alarm the use of antifreeze in chinesemade toothpaste the ingredient was mislabeled as a benign similarsounding chemical and then there was tainted pet food that contained a flame retardant as an additive investing overseas can provide wonderful opportunities to profit from emerging markets and growing companies domiciled outside of united states for my money however china has yet to prove itself committed to ensuring the health safety and welfare of its products while the companies themselves walk a knifes edge of legitimacy in a communist society this requires us not only to carefully consider whether we want to invest in a company like game maker the nasdaqncty but also whether a company like goodyear
