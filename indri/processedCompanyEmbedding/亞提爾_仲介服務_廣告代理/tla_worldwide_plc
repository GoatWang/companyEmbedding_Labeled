five years has evolved and now encompasses a single global digital presence an integrated approach to investor and stakeholder reporting and the ongoing innovation of digital products that will help

digital corporate reporting establishing a logic to a global brand presence enabling regional reference with a view to global integration the cultivation and growth of a single brand alongside a period of business acquisition creating a core brand guidelines directive with a foundation of brand templates and assets asset  in producing a range of brand outputs including corporate reporting we have established an ownable style and creative direction that resonates with tla’s core values our reporting including both physical reports and digital companions have provided profiling opportunities for talent as well as highlighting other areas of focus from a stakeholder’s perspective our approach to corporate reporting as an integrated agency we believe strongly in providing accessibility to all stakeholders naturally this means an increasing digital presence coordinated to aim rule  compliance but it also means that tangible physical communications should not be ignored our work across the corporate reporting landscape within other sectors corroborates this in our opinion a physical report continues to maintain a role within the boardroom and within reach of investors our team ensure that from a messaging and brand consistency perspective digital and physical outputs compliment one another and take advantage of the unique benefits that each platform provides designing for purpose this could mean encouraging the use of interactive charting within the digital report – allowing investors to truly interrogate data yearonyear or it could mean the addition of a data narrative to reporting figures a core global site tla the legacy agency maintained a usled digital presence when our relationship began with business acquisition and growth however it became clear that a single revised site presence was required that would aptly showcase everything that tla represented on a global scale with their expanded brand reach we helped their team

contentfirst approach where we iterate through an idea and discovery phase of work identifying user and client needs alongside business objectives establish a core specification often formed in a shareable google doc that aids direction of the project map content and user requirements to core site functionality plotting site structure and needs quickly iterate through idea generation
