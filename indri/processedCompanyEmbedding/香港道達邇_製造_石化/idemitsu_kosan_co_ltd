for fishing boats in shimonoseki idemitsu supplied lubricant to the south manchuria railway after success in japan idemitsu  co expanded to manchuria china in  where the japaneseowned south manchuria railroad co ltd was a major customer of lubricant a branch was opened in dalian northeast china and idemitsu attempted to enter the chinese market that was dominated by western companies like standard oil and the asiatic petroleum company a shell subsidiary the company extended through northern china and into korea and taiwan after the japanese invasion of manchuria in  the oil trade became government controlled and idemitsu was forced to scale back instead he went into transport by oil tanker in  the headquarters were moved to tokyo and the name changed to the current idemitsu kosan kk kabushiki kaisha stock company with the japanese military expansion and united states joining the pacific war the government took control of all industries postwar eraedit after the war idemitsu kosan lost its overseas trade with the allied occupation of japan it was among the ten petroleum suppliers selected by the ministry of international trade and industry miti and cut its ties with nippon oil idemitsu began importing naphtha an intermediate oil product first from the united states and later from venezuela and iran the protectionist oil industry law helped idemitsu against foreign competition in japan but also made owning its own refineries important idemitsus first tokuyama refinery opened in  this was followed by the chiba oil refinery in  hyogo oil refinery in  the hokkaido oil refinery in  and the aichi oil refinery in  in  idemitsu sent its large tanker nisshomaru to iran to purchase oil iranian prime minister mohammed mosaddeq had recently nationalized the oil fields and was under britishled embargo abadan crisis idemitsu managed to buy the oil at  below market price and displeased the british this was popular with the japanese public but got idemitsu in conflict with the japanese government and miti later the same year was the  iranian coup détat in the s idemitsu imported crude oil from russia again it got a good price at  below market value but angered the united states who decided to boycott idemitsu when buying fuel for its military jets in japan idemitsu called the boycott an odd christmas gift but utterly negligible in  it broke off contracts with the soviet union the company also came in conflict with the petroleum association of japan which was set up by miti to restrict production and idemitsu even left the organization in  the seamens union went on strike the first of its kind in japan this led to petroleum shortages idemitsu then ignored the quotas and produced at full speed when the price control and production quotas were removed in

coal mining company in japan and developed the coal cartridge system for small users it worked on geothermal power experiments and uranium mining in canada with cameco and cogema the sharp  price drop on oil made idemitsus nonoil operations less profitable japanese import restrictions on oil once again came under debate as in  idemitsu favored opening up to foreign competition in opposition to most of the japanese oil industry the japanese government eventually settled on a compromise that would slowly open for free importation and remove production quotas on refineries as a means of diversifying its business in the wake of global oil shocks idemitsu began development of oled technology in the s culminating in the development of a practical fullcolor led display introduced by

opening service stations outside japan in portugal and puerto rico as well as a lubricant factory in the united states oil industry deregulation took big leaps with the abolishment of the special
