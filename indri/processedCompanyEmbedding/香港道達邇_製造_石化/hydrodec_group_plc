opera onal review − usa the main drivers in  have been to refocus on the core transformer oil re‐reﬁning technology by op mising the performance of the canton facility and to increase produc on levels through a combina on of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with speciﬁc targeted opera ng improvements building on lessons learned during the commissioning process these improvements have been validated by the signiﬁcantly lower number of produc on hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly produc on performance of the plant in may of  million litres of superfine transformer oil and base oil plant u lisa on increased over the period from an average of  in q to  in q with a peak of  in may and has averaged  through q to date these developments have supported total sales volumes in canton in the period of  million litres an addi onal primary objec ve relates to improving the sales mix between

going forward the focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the propor on of transformer oil sales post period‐end in august we announced the award of a  year contract to supply superfine transformer oil to essen al energy a major australian u lity the contract includes the collec on and re‐reﬁning of all their pcb and non‐pcb waste oils and is expected to generate over  million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract the contract was awarded under a compe ve tender process with the company successfully compe ng against a range of new oil suppliers market background in the us leading producers of naphthenic speciality products of which hydrodec is one have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the ﬁrst quarter crude price fall whilst the group has been successful in improving margins since the ﬁrst quarter the board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into  driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices in australia market demand and margin remain rela vely stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the essen al energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key u li es financial review revenues from con

disposal of uk recycling opera ons in late  and january  the company undertook a detailed strategic review of its uk waste oil collec ons business and proposed uk lubricant oil re‐reﬁning project following a signiﬁcant deteriora on in its uk opera ons this deteriora on was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and con nued challenging market condi ons which resulted in the uk business genera ng an increasing level of signiﬁcant losses despite implemen ng extensive restructuring and cost‐saving measures during  hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline given the signiﬁcant cash consump on and limited cash resources available to the company in the absence of a signiﬁcant further fundraising the directors reviewed all available op ons and concluded that it was in the best interests of the company to dispose of the uk opera ons following a strategic auc on process conducted by an independent third party ﬁnancial adviser the company sold its uk opera ons to andrew black a non‐execu ve director and substan al shareholder the buyer on  march  for a considera on of £ in cash including the transfer to the buyer of c £ million

project going forward with hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these proﬁt share arrangements the uk re‐reﬁning project also oﬀers a poten al opportunity to develop transformer

announcement this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain   chief executives report   after a particularly difficult  for the company i am pleased to be able to report significant progress in delivering the companys key objectives during the period under review achieved against a challenging yet improving market backdrop   strategy   at the time of my appointment as ceo and the divestment of the uk recycling operations in march  the board restated its strategy to concentrate on the groups market leading transformer oil rerefining technology and business and to grow that business to access an increasing proportion of the us billion plus global transformer oil market specifically the board stated its intention as the company moves forward through  to look to strengthen hydrodecs footprint in the us and in the international transformer oil market where the board believes hydrodec has a competitive advantage through its proven and market‐leading technology   in line with this strategy my focus has been to grow the transformer oil business in order to drive profitability with a rigorous focus on execution when deploying our market leading transformer oil rerefining technology making effective costs savings and delivering the rampup of production and sales in the us   continuing business  rerefining   summary      months  months  change   jun jun   volume  litres    revenue us    operating ebitda pre oneoff costs       includes traded oil  million litres pending recommissioning of canton plant   operational review         usa   the main drivers in  have been to refocus on the core transformer oil rerefining technology by optimising the performance of the canton facility and to increase production levels through a combination of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with specific targeted operating improvements building on lessons learned during the commissioning process these improvements have been validated by the significantly lower number of production hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly production performance of the plant in may of  million litres of superfine transformer oil and base oil  plant utilisation increased over the period from an average of  in q to  in q with a peak of  in may and has averaged  through q to date   these developments have supported total sales volumes in canton in the period of  million litres an additional primary objective relates to improving the sales mix between higher margin transformer oil and lower margin base oil produced at the canton plant at the beginning of the year january transformer oil sales represented  of us volumes sold since then significant improvements have been made in this area and in june transformer oil represented  of sales with further advances targeted growth in transformer oil sales have been supported by the superfine product achieving  hour oil status certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and a prerequisite to accessing the larger power transformer market   post periodend in september we announced that the american carbon registry acr had approved hydrodecs patented technology as a carbon offset project in the voluntary carbon offset market allowing the company to generate and monetise carbon credits  hydrodec of north america hona is now generating offsets through the rerefining of used transformer oil which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner the acr has recognised  credits for honas previous production between  and  and the company anticipates that it will generate  to  tons of carbon offset annually going forward whilst the historical credits may only generate nominal sums through trading the ongoing generation of such credits could realise up to us per ton source carbonomics         australia   in respect of the operations in australia since the commissioning of the plant at the southern oil refinery in may  we have had to work hard to reestablish our commercial position in the market total sales volumes in australia for the period were  million  in may the australian business enjoyed one of its highest feedstock acquisition months since  and since then has consistently sourced feedstock at an optimal level to maximise its profitability going forward  the focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the proportion of transformer oil sales    post periodend in august we announced the award of a  year contract to supply superfine transformer oil to essential energy a major australian utility  the contract includes the collection and rerefining of all their pcb and nonpcb waste oils and is expected to generate over  million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract the contract was awarded under a competitive tender process with the company successfully competing against a range of new oil suppliers          market background   in the us leading producers of naphthenic speciality products of which hydrodec is one have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the first quarter crude price fall whilst the group has been successful in improving margins since the first quarter the board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into  driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices    in australia market demand and margin remain relatively stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the essential energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key utilities     financial review   revenues from continuing operations increased  to us million h  us million reflecting the full commissioning of the canton plant at the end of last year  the group sold  million litres during the period an increase of  on the corresponding period in  which had included  million litres of traded oil whilst the us business was being recommissioned of the volumes sold in the period  represented transformer oil and  was base oil with margins steadily improving since the beginning of the year   there has been a key focus on the reduction of overheads and corporate costs significant reductions have already been realised with the expectation that the benefits from more recently implemented initiatives will filter through in h  these savings are reflected in the reduction in administrative expenses from continuing operations from us million to us million as highlighted below       six months ended six months ended        june   june        usd usd  change indirect operating costs      corporate costs      depreciation and amortisation  overheads      administrative expenses      group ebitda from continuing operations improved from us million loss h  to us million loss  the total loss for the period including discontinued operations was us million h  us million  operating cash outflow before working capital movements reduced to us million h  us million  the improved ebitda performance resulted in lower working capital outflows which reduced from  million to  million total net cash expended in the first six months of  was us million compared to a us million outflow in the prior year comparable period overall the group held us million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period and retained approximately us million headroom under its working capital facilities provided by andrew black a director and the companys largest shareholder    disposal of uk recycling operations   in late  and january  the company undertook a detailed strategic review of its uk waste oil collections business and proposed uk lubricant oil rerefining project following a significant deterioration in its uk operations this deterioration was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and continued challenging market conditions which resulted in the uk business generating an increasing level of significant losses despite implementing extensive restructuring and costsaving measures during  hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline given the significant cash consumption and limited cash resources available to the company in the absence of a significant further fundraising the directors reviewed all available options and concluded that it was in the best interests of the company to dispose of the uk operations   following a strategic auction process conducted by an independent third party financial adviser the company sold its uk operations to andrew black a nonexecutive director and substantial shareholder the buyer on  march  for a consideration of £ in cash including the transfer to the buyer of c £ million of existing third party indebtedness in the uk business and involving the injection by the buyer of further working capital into that operation in addition the buyer granted hydrodec a contractual right to receive a proportion of the buyers entitlement to any future profits of the uk rerefining project on the following waterfall basis a first the buyer as primary risk taker to recover the costs of its investment in the uk rerefining project b then the next tranche to be applied  between hydrodec and the buyer respectively until hydrodec has recovered its costs incurred to date in connection with the uk rerefining project and c finally the balance of any profits to be shared  between the buyer and hydrodec the buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the uk lubricant oil rerefining project going forward with hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these profit share arrangements the uk rerefining project also offers a potential opportunity to develop transformer oil rerefining capacity in the uk the impact on the company of all of the above is described in note  to the interim financial statements   risk management process   the group has policies processes and systems in place to help identify evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisation risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by business unit or functional management teams the executive team review the major risks across the group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus the board review these at least twice a year   the principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on the group in the future are set out on pages  and  of the  annual report the continued successful operation of canton is the key performance imperative for the group  the annual report can be downloaded at wwwhydrodeccom    outlook   todays results confirm significant progress in the turnaround of the company over the first half of the year  our key objective during the rest of the year is to strengthen margins as we grow market share and seek to leverage the recent carbon credit approval in the us whilst continuing the program of cost reduction volumes and margins in q to date remain consistent with q and with both operations now generating positive ebitda we continue to make strong progress towards positive group ebitda in the second half of the year     chris ellis ceo

hydrodec – good oil on electricity  csiropedia skip to main content home  hydrodec – good oil on electricity hydrodec – good oil on electricity mineral oil is used as an insulator in electricity transformers capacitors and switching equipment and independent estimates put the value of transformer oil used worldwide at more than  billion in australia and overseas a large proportion of the transformer oils in service are contaminated with various levels of toxic polychlorinated biphenyl pcb compounds these were used as insulating oils in the s and s because of their enhanced thermal fire safety and stability properties this old oil represents a major liability within the electricity industry the hydrodec process developed by csiro is the only one available that can simultaneously decontaminate transformer oil and also regenerate its electrical properties to a quality as good as if not superior to the original product hydrodec hydrodechlorination is not just a solution for transformer oils and pcbs it is capable of treating a broad range of persistent organic pollutants including dioxins pesticides herbicides and petrochemical waste and can be applied to advanced processes for the production of aluminium and magnesium metals which produce toxic waste the hydrodec development corporation pty ltd was specifically formed to commercialise the technology for application worldwide and listed on the london stock exchange as the hydrodec group plc in  beginning with a   litreday plant in regional new south wales hydrodec group entered the us market in late  with the commissioning of a   litreday plant in ohio they plan to enter the japanese and european markets by  background mineral oil is used as an insulator in electricity transformers capacitors and switching equipment the australian electricity generating and distribution system contains transformer oil valued at  million and independent estimates put the value of transformer oil used worldwide at more than  billion in the s and s toxic polychlorinated biphenyl pcb compounds were used as insulating oils in the electricity industry because of their enhanced thermal fire safety and stability properties pcbs were later found to be toxic and subsequently banned in the late s in australia and overseas a large proportion of the transformer oils in service are contaminated with various levels of pcbs much of it largely as a result of cross contamination across the network this can represent a significant hazard and precludes normal treatment andor disposal the old oil represents a major liability within the electricity industry recycling this oil provides significant economic savings avoids potential environmental problems and could eliminate the need for transformer oil imports and the costs associated with the disposal of the used product high voltage power lines photo csiro regenerating transformer oils in  csiro energy technology began its collaboration with transgrid the authority responsible for the nsw high voltage electricity network on the development of a process that regenerates the electrical properties of transformer oils and destroys toxic pcb compounds without producing any noxious emissions the process was later registered under the name ‘hydrodec’ the hydrodec research partnership addressed several main issues the need for generating authorities and operators of electricity distribution networks to more effectively maintain the value of the transformer oil inventories within their networks the high cost of handling and disposal of transformer oils contaminated with pcbs achieving the objective of treating both contaminated and noncontaminated oils in a single process to produce a clean product with electrical properties restored to an ‘as new’ condition avoiding the generation of noxious wastes in the treatment process which might just replace one environmental problem with another the project’s primary objectives were to develop a new highly effective and economic process that can in a single pass destroy pcbs in degraded transformer oils without having a deleterious impact on the composition of the product to simultaneously restore the electrical properties of degraded transformer oils to a condition equivalent to or better than the original so they can be returned to service to ensure the process could achieve oil yields in excess of  to develop a modular and compact process that could be skidmounted to facilitate relocation between sites to demonstrate the suitability of the process for destroying a wide range of toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons including dioxins hexachlorobenzene hcb dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and pentachlorophenol pcp what is the hydrodec process to eliminate contaminants the transformer oil is reacted with hydrogen over a catalyst removing the oxygenated and chlorinated species that degrade the electrical properties of the oil the hydrodec process restores the electrical properties of the oil to an ‘as new’ condition while destroying any chlorinated hydrocarbons present through this unique refining technology degraded transformer oils previously regarded as waste can be fully and safely recovered hydrodec restores contaminated transformer oil right to ‘as new’ condition centre photo csiro who was involved the early development of the hydrodec process was carried out by scientists from csiro energy technology in particular dr chris fookes in collaboration with personnel from transgrid chiefly dr frances mitchell and mr sen peric this work was supported through a generic technology grant from the department of industry technology and regional development more recently there have been ongoing collaborations with the technology licensee hydrodec development corporation pty ltd to scale up the process to a viable commercial technology environmental and economic benefits traditional methods for reconditioning transformer oils are unsuitable for pcb contaminated oils as they produce a contaminated waste that presents another disposal issue the hydrodec process is extremely effective in the destruction of pcbs reducing feed concentrations as high as   ppm to levels below the detection limit of about  parts per billion in addition traditional processes cannot produce oil that has electrical properties comparable with hydrodec superfine® transformer oil a product with superior oxidation stability and high performance characteristics and with specifications equivalent to that of new transformer oil not only is the hydrodec process very effective at restoring the dielectric properties of the oil it achieves oil yields in excess of  implementation of the hydrodec system translates to significant cost savings in transformer asset management as treated oil can be returned to service and disposal costs are avoided it also means less crude oil needs to be imported and refined therefore reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with oil production as well as disposal of the product where it is simply burnt as a fuel oil other applications hydrodec is not just a solution for transformer oils and pcbs it has been proven capable of treating a broad range of persistent organic pollutants including dioxins pesticides herbicides and petrochemical waste high temperature incineration has been a widely used method for disposing of such toxic wastes overseas however potential formation of dioxins during this process is the single most important factor raised in public opposition to incineration as a solution to toxic waste destruction in australia the chemical process developed by the csiro team solves this problem in a very ingenious way process conditions make the formation of dioxins totally impossible and our research has shown the hydrodec process can destroy such chlorinated toxic materials with single pass decontamination factors  the csiro technology can also be applied to advanced processes for the production of aluminium and magnesium metals which produce toxic waste and for which there has so far been no viable treatment option when combined with thermal desorption processes our work has shown that hydrodec could also be used for the treatment of contaminated soils hydrodec’s commercialisation the hydrodec process and equipment are fully patented and have been exclusively licensed to the hydrodec development corporation pty ltd now hydrodec group plc a company specifically formed to commercialise the technology for application worldwide and listed on the london stock exchange in  a   litreday commercial scale module scaled up from the   litres per day pilot plant operated at csiro’s lucas heights location is now fully operational in regional new south wales processing transformer oil from australian power utilities in late  hydrodec development corporation entered the us market with the commissioning of a   litreday plant in ohio with another plant of similar capacity in the planning stage the us market will be followed by the japanese and european markets over the coming two to four years beyond its implications for transformer oils the hydrodec development corporation is looking to apply the process to the disposal of a large range of hazardous chlorinated chemicals and wastes without creating toxic byproducts or hazardous emissions this is potentially a very lucrative market in june  csiro assisted hydrodec development corporation to streamline their operating cash outflows with the intention of making themselves more attractive to future investors as they move into global expansion by converting its future royalty stream to a lump sum payment of a million csiro   litreday pilot plant at lucas heights photo csiro source duffy gj
