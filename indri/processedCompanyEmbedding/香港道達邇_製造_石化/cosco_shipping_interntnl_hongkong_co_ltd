pleased to announce that its whollyowned subsidiary yuantong marine service co limited “yuantong” expanded its supply of marine equipment and spare parts business to overseas through acquiring a company in singapore and setting up a new company in japan yuantong entered into a share transfer agreement on st may  to acquire  of the issued share capital of a company namely xing yuan singapore pte ltd “xing yuan” to expand its supply of marine equipment and spare parts business in singapore the total consideration of the acquisition is s equivalent to approximately hk upon completion of the

its existing business based in hong kong and china mainland cosco international will successfully build up a complete platform of marine equipment and spare parts supply network in asia pacific region mr wang xiaodong managing director of cosco international gave his remark on the acquisition ‘as a growing company we are always seeking opportunities to expand our shipping services value chain after the global financial crisis we have noted that the world shipping industry and shipbuilding industry have accelerated moving to asia especially china however the development of china’s shipbuilding support industry still lags behind shipbuilding industry and many marine equipment and spare parts are mainly imported from south korea japan and europe we believe that expanding our geographical presence to overseas to form a global marine equipment supply network is one of the key development strategies to expand our supply of marine equipment and spare part business and further strengthen our core competitiveness in future” “singapore is one of the major shipping hubs in the world with tremendous annual trade volume of marine equipment while japan owned nearly  marine equipment manufacturers and ranked the third largest marine equipment manufacturing countries following europe and south korea the acquisition of xing yuan can enable us to leverage on its geographical advantage to develop material supplies business for all fleets in the world the incorporation of shin chung lin in japan will facilitate the group to establish good business relationship with those sophisticated marine equipment manufacturers in japan and south korea and help increase our product variety and business scale in addition these two companies will give us opportunities to closely provide more shipping related services and products for foreign ship owners and ship builders this will help create synergies with other business units of the shipping services segment and further enhance its profitability in the future so as to maximise our contribution to the shareholders” managing director wang xiaodong added in this acquisition yuantong a whollyowned subsidiary of cosco international entered into a share transfer agreement with cosco holdings singapore pte ltd“cosco singapore” and hai feng marine private limited “hai feng” to acquire each of  and  of the issued share capital of xing yuan respectively the consideration was determined with reference to the audited net assets value of xing yuan as at st december  of s which was adjusted and deducted by s being the amount of dividends which the vendors are entitled to be paid for the year ended st december  with reference to the audited accounts of xing yuan for the year ended st december  together with an addition of a premium of s the consideration will be satisfied by way of internal resources of the group xing yuan is mainly engaged in the business of sales and installation of marine equipment and spare parts for vessels and related services including marine transportation and sales exporting and importing of raw materials and products based in singapore during  xing yuan’s profit before taxation amounted to s equivalent to approximately hk xing yuan rented an office premise owned by hai feng to avoid paying an increasing rental fee in singapore and facilitate the future business operation of xing yuan the group therefore decided to purchase the property which comprises a terraced factory building of three storeys with a total salable area of approximately  square feet upon the completion of acquisition of xing yuan the purchase price amounted to s equivalent to approximately hk  which was determined with reference to independent property valuer’s report as at st march  as xing yuan’s substantial shareholder cosco singapore is a whollyowned company of cosco while cosco is also a controlling shareholder of the company the acquisition of  of the issued share capital in xing yuan therefore constitutes a connected transaction for the company under the listing rules and is subject to the approval of the independent shareholders meanwhile in consideration of upon the completion of the acquisition of xing yuan and the newly incorporated shin chung lin it is anticipated that the business volume of yuantong will substantially increase and its proposed annual cap amount of the turnover for the supply and installation services provided by yuantong and its subsidiaries to the cosco group for the year ending st december  shall be increased from hk to hk therefore according to the listing rules the proposed revised cap is subject to the approval of the independent shareholders  end  about xing yuan and shin chung lin xing yuan is principally engaged in the
