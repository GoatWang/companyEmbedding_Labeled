bp stock could be a gusher  nasdaqcom hot topics etfs  smart portfolio  currencies  online broker center search bp plc adr bp stock could be a gusher april    pm edt by tom taulli investorplace media shutterstock photo investorplace investorplace  stock market news stock advice  trading tips the oil patch is getting its mojo back as seen with the nice move in bp plc adr  bp  which is up about  the company posted a fairly solid earnings report and should also get a lift from the rebound in crude prices of course bp stock sports a juicy  dividend yield this compares to  for exxon mobil corporation  xom   for chevron corporation  cvx  and  for conocophillips  cop  yet there are certainly material risks after all the company has had to dramatically restructure its operations because of the enormous liabilities from the deepwater horizon spill in the gulf of mexico during  however might there still be upside here for bp stock bp by the numbers well lets take a deeper look at the first quarter bp reported a replacement cost loss at  million which was down from a gain of  billion in the same period a year ago keep in mind that replacement cost is a common way to measure profitability for oil operators this was higher than the consensus of about a  million loss the top  sp  dividend stocks to buy right now besides with oil prices averaging about  per barrel during the quarter the performance was impressive as should be no surprise there is still some uncertainty with the liabilities from deepwater horizon disaster in the latest quarter bp took a  million charge for this in fact the total costs have come to a staggering  billion  then again much of the exposure has been settled which should provide some comfort for investors something else over the past five years bp has had little choice but to engage in aggressive cost cutting involving sizable layoffs as well as over  billion in asset sales the result is that the companys core operating structure is much more streamlined which has allowed bp to weather the sudden drop in crude prices its rivals on the other hand have had to scramble it also helps that bp has a diversified platform for example the refining and marketing segments have continued to thrive in the first quarter there was a replacement cost profit of  billion  and yes bp stock should get a lift from the longterm opportunities as noted by investorplacecoms charles sizemore the company recently struck a strategic deal with china national petroleum corporation  the two companies will explore develop and produce shale gas resources in the sichuan basin of southern china given that the country wants to reduce its awful pollution and move away from coal this deal with bp should get a high priority  and could be a nice source of ongoing profits bottom line on bp stock dont expect the cost cutting to end anytime soon for the current year bp plans on spending about  billion on capital expenditures which compares to  billion during  there are also plans to reduce the workforce by about  the idea is to keep lowering the breakeven point thats based on the price of oil currently its about  but it could drop to   to  within a year or so  in other words if crude oil can continue its recent bull move then profits will certainly get juiced especially since the cost structure will likely continue to trend downwards  big dividend stocks to add to your watch list actually some noted oil analysts think that crude oil could even double by year end just look at mike rothman who is the president and founder of cornerstone analytics he has a price target of  on crude oil because he believes that demand will be continue to be robust and that output will trail off because of the massive cuts in capital expenditures no doubt predicting oil prices is very dicey especially lately but rothman has a solid track record and has some good reasons for why oil could continue its rise and if his scenario pans out bp stock could be poised for further gains tom taulli runs the  investorplace blog ipo playbook  he is also the author of  highprofit ipo strategies   all about commodities  and  all about short selling  follow him on twitter at ttaulli  as of this writing he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities more from investorplace your  retirement spring cleaning checklist

 kg of carbon monoxide the state’s investigation showed that bp’s failure to properly maintain its equipment caused the malfunction when the equipment malfunctioned and caught fire bp workers shut it down and routed escaping gases to flares rather than shut down associated units while compressor repairs were made bp chose to keep operating those other units which led to unlawful release of

strong economic impact on the gulf coasts economy sectors such as fishing and tourism according to noaa gulf fisheries were recovering in  but in late  local fishermen reported that crab shrimp and oyster fishing operations had not yet recovered from the oil spill in late  and may  press reports indicated a rebound in tourism aided by bp advertising dollars and concurrent with a nationwide rise in hotel occupancy rates however it was not clear if states most affected by the oil spill would still lag behind others as tourism improves nationally a  study in the journal of travel research found that the hotel industry weathered the spill better than the vacation rental industry and that the overall impact was complex and difficult to determine environmental impactedit oil spills are known to cause both immediate and longterm harm to human health and ecosystems research into the impacts of this spill is ongoing studies in  suggested that as much as onethird of the released oil remains in the gulf further research suggested that the oil on the bottom of the seafloor was not degrading oil in affected coastal areas increased erosion due to the death of mangrove trees and marsh grass researchers say the oil and dispersant mixture including pahs permeated the food chain through zooplankton in  it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate and half the dolphins examined in a december  study were seriously ill or dying bp said the report was “inconclusive as to any causation associated with the spill in october  al jazeera reported that the gulf ecosystem was in crisis citing a decline in seafood catches as well as deformities and lesions found in fish in louisiana  million pounds of oily material was removed from the beaches in  over double the amount collected in  oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on  miles of louisiana shoreline throughout  oil continued to be found as far from the macondo site as the florida panhandle where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand researchers looking at sediment seawater biota and seafood found toxic compounds in high concentrations that they said was due to the added oil and dispersants although gulf fisheries recovered in  a  study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna by researchers at stanford university and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration published in the journal science found that toxins released by the oil spill sent fish into cardiac arrest the study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats bp disputed the study which was conducted as part of the federal natural resource damage assessment process required by the oil pollution act the study also found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil another peerreviewed study released in march  and conducted by  scientists from the united states and australia and published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs bp responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the gulf but the new york times reported that the bp statement was contradicted by the study in february  a study from university of south florida researchers showed the possibility that subsurface oil particles from deepwater horizon had traveled underwater as far south as sanibel florida and reached the west florida shelf computer models showed the possibility of subsurface currents delivering oil to the surface in an upwelling off the florida shelf fish along the way were found to have diseased livers from filtering hydrocarbons chemically similar to oil from deepwater horizon causing them immune system problems the team concluded the transport of subsurface hydrocarbonsis both plausible and consistent with the observed distribution of fish lesions fish liver chemistry and other chemical and ecological evidence oil particles buried in gulf sediment could remain there for  years effects on human healthedit research discussed at a  conference included preliminary results of an ongoing study being done by the national institute for environmental health sciences indicating that oil spill cleanup workers carry biomarkers of chemicals contained in the spilled oil and the dispersants used a separate study is following the health issues of women and children affected by the spill several studies found that a significant percentage of gulf residents reported mental health problems such as anxiety depression and ptsd according to a columbia university study investigating the health effects among children living less than  miles from the coast more than a third of the parents report physical or mental health symptoms among their children australias  minutes reported that people living along the gulf coast were becoming sick from the mixture of corexit and oil susan shaw of the deepwater horizon oil spill strategic sciences working group says bp told the public that corexit was as harmless as dawn dishwashing liquidbut bp and the epa clearly knew about the toxicity of the corexit long before this spill according to shaw bps own safety sheet on corexit says that there are high and immediate human health hazards cleanup workers were not provided safety equipment by the company and the safety manuals were rarely if ever followed or distributed to workers according to a newsweek investigation the safety manuals read avoid breathing vapor and wear suitable protective clothing oil clean up workers reported that they were not allowed to use respirators and that their jobs were threatened if they did a peerreviewed study published in the american journal of medicine reported significantly altered blood profiles of individuals exposed to the spilled oil and dispersants that put them at increased risk of developing liver cancer leukemia and other disorders bp disputed its methodology and said other studies supported its position that dispersants did not create a danger to health in  a study was published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences which found heart deformities in fish exposed to oil from the spill the researchers said that their results probably apply to humans as well as fish criminal prosecutionsedit on  march  the us department of justice formed the deepwater horizon task force to consolidate several federal agencies investigations into possible criminal charges stemming the explosion and spill on  november  the doj announced that bp and the doj had reached a  billion settlement of all federal criminal charges related to the explosion and spill the largest of its kind in us history under the settlement bp agreed to plead guilty to  felony counts of manslaughter two misdemeanors and a felony count of lying to congress and agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics bp also paid  million to settle civil charges by the securities and exchange commission that it misled investors about the flow rate of oil from the well as part of the announcement of the settlement bp said it was increasing its reserve for a trust fund to pay costs and claims related to the spill to about  billion on the same day the us government filed criminal charges against three bp employees two site managers were charged with manslaughter and negligence and one former vice president with obstruction near the end of november  the us government temporarily banned bp from bidding any new federal contracts citing the company’s “lack of business integrity”  as of february  criminal and civil settlements and payments to the trust fund had cost the company  billion bp sued to have the  ban lifted and in march  bp and the us environmental protection agency reached an agreement to lift the ban bps ability to bid for leases is conditional on it meeting new ethical and corporate governance standards as well as complying with safety procedures a code of conduct for officers and showing zero tolerance for retaliation against whistleblowers among its employees and contractors environmental and consumer groups attacked the lifting of the ban as unwarranted public citizen said it “lets a corporate felon and repeat offender off the hook for its crimes against people and the environment” justice department suitedit on  december  the us department of justice filed a civil and criminal suit against bp and other defendants for violations under the clean water act in the us district court for the eastern district of louisiana the case was consolidated with about  others including those brought by state governments individuals and companies under multidistrict litigation docket mdl no  before us district judge carl barbier the justice department contends that bp committed gross negligence and willful misconduct which bp contests and is seeking the stiffest penalties possible the case was carefully watched because a ruling of gross negligence would result in a fourfold increase in clean water act penalties which would cause the penalties to reach approximately  billion and would increase damages in the other suits as well any fines from gross negligence would hit bps bottom line very hard because they would not be taxdeductible the company paid no federal income tax to the us government in  because of deductions related to the spill the consolidated trials first phase began on  february  to determine the liability of bp transocean halliburton and other companies and to determine whether the companies acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct the second phase began on  september  and focused on the how much oil spilled into the gulf and who was responsible for stopping it the third phase set to begin in january  will focus on all other liability that occurred in the process of oil spill cleanup and containment issues including the use of dispersants test jury trials will follow to determine actual damage amounts on  september  judge barbier ruled in the first phase of the case that bp had committed gross negligence he rejected bps assertion that other parties were equally responsible for the oil spill and ruled that its employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in us history barbier found that bp was reckless while the other two defendants transocean ltd and halliburton co were negligent and bore less responsibility for the spill he apportioned fault at  for bp  for transocean and  for halliburton barbier ruled that bp had acted with conscious disregard of known risks bp strongly disagreed with the ruling and filed an immediate appeal on july   bp and five states announced an  billion settlement to be used for clean water act penalties and various claims civil proceedings and claims settlementedit in june  after a meeting in the white house between president barack obama and bp executives the president announced that bp would pay  billion into a trust fund that will be used to compensate victims of the oil spill the fund would not supersede individual or states rights for future claims bp also set aside  million to compensate oil workers who lost their jobs because of the spill the fund known as the gulf coast claims facility gccf was administered by attorney kenneth feinberg until it was succeeded by a court supervised settlement program in june  in january  a panel of the us fifth circuit court of appeals rejected an effort by bp to curb payment of what bp claimed to be fictitious and absurd claims to the settlement fund for businesses and persons affected by the oil spill bp said administration of the settlement fund was marred by the fact that people without actual damages could file a claim the court ruled that bp hadnt explained how this court or the district court should identify or even discern the existence of claimants that have suffered no
