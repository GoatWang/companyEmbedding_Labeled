ltdroad bike january   by digitalbuyersguide leave a comment inq no c as cycling which is associated with not only a clean mode of transport that does not generate greenhouse gas emissions but also a good way of getting fit has grown popular in korea alton sports co ltd has lately further enjoyed a stronger upside one of its flagship products alton road master r uses dp frame the first time for a bicycle in the world its bicycle frames are strong and sleeklooking as well as safe and durable enough to meet higher expectation of riders the intensity of dp is about mpa which makes it possible to have a much slimmer layer of bicycle frame ultimately being as light as the highend chromoly frame the use of dp allows alton road master r to have sleeker wheels and decals providing comfortable ride with excellent elasticity and the nature of the dp enables alton to produce a new bike with thinner and sportier frame geometry that’s why the alton road master r is equipped with a ″ head tube not the standard ″ custommade handle stem seat tube and seat post instead of the standard products it has also improved straightness by keeping the wheelbase toe clearance and rear wheel base as short as possible with overall compact shape the maneuverability and safety has also been emphasized by installing shimano onetouch speed shift lever and shimano derailleur for better shifting as well as chain cover to keep the rider’s clothing from getting jammed in the chains the bike weighs kg so that it is easy to move when people cannot ride and the combination of matt finish of steel and a vivid color has been chosen to highlight the new bike the choice to commute on a bike is already an environmentallyfriendly lifestyle by reducing gas and emissions in the air on top of that alton has also adopted innovating dp frame which uses less natural resources but is as light as the highend chromemolybden alloyed steel and carbone frames contributing to the environment protection since its establishment in  alton sports co ltd rewrote the history of the domestic bicycle industry with its own plants in korea and abroad alton has cooperated with automobile brands and launched bikes with glamorous colors from bikes that were simply used to carry luggage customers now want a bike that is comfortable and safe on any kind of road and has a sensual design that stands out alton sports understand the
