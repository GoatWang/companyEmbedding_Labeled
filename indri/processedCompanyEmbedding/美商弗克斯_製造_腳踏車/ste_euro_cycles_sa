publications journals business and economics portal v t e the business cycle or economic cycle is the downward and upward movement of gross domestic product gdp around its longterm growth trend the length of a business cycle is the period of time containing a single boom and contraction in sequence these fluctuations typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth expansions or booms and periods of relative stagnation or decline contractions or recessions business cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of real gross domestic product despite the oftenapplied term cycles these fluctuations in economic activity do not exhibit uniform or predictable periodicity the common or popular usage boomandbust cycle refers to fluctuations in

of the business cycle long term growth of gdp the first systematic exposition of periodic economic crises in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium was the  nouveaux principes déconomie politique by jean charles léonard de sismondi  prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles blamed them on external factors notably war or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of  which was the first unarguably international economic crisis occurring in peacetime sismondi and his contemporary robert owen who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in  report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption caused in particular by wealth inequality they advocated government intervention and socialism respectively as the solution this work did not generate interest among classical economists though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the s sismondis theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer and similar theories showing signs of influence by sismondi were developed by johann karl rodbertus periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of karl marx who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and on the basis of which he predicted a communist revolution though only passing references in das kapital  refer to crises they were extensively discussed in marxs posthumously published books particularly in theories of surplus value in progress and poverty  henry george focused on lands role in crises – particularly land speculation – and proposed a single tax on land as a solution classification by periodsedit business cycle with it specific forces in four stages according to malcolm c rorty  in  french economist clement juglar first identified economic cycles  to  years long although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity laterwhen economist joseph schumpeter – argued that a juglar cycle has four stages expansion increase in production and prices low interestrates crisis stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur recession drops in prices and in output high interestrates recovery stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes schumpeters juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity consumer confidence aggregate demand and prices in the midth century schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers proposed economic waves cyclewave name period years kitchin cycle inventory eg pork cycle – juglar cycle fixed investment – kuznets swing infrastructural investment – kondratiev wave technological basis – this box view talk edit the kitchin inventory cycle of  to  years after joseph kitchin the juglar fixedinvestment cycle of  to  years often identifiedby whom as the business cycle the kuznets infrastructural investment cycle of  to  years after simon kuznets – also called building cycle the kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of  to  years after the soviet economist nikolai kondratiev interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles occurrenceedit a simplified kondratiev wave with the theory that productivity enhancing innovations drive waves of economic growth there were great increases in productivity industrial production and real per capita product throughout the period from  to  that included the long depression and two other recessions there were also significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the great depression both the long and great depressions were characterized by overcapacity and market saturation over the period since the industrial revolution technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt the primary exception being the great depression which caused a multiyear steep economic decline the effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hours work which has grown from  in  to  in  measured in  dollars there were similar increases in real wages during the th century see productivity improving technologies historical a table of innovations and long cycles can be seen at kondratiev wavemodern modifications of kondratiev theory there were frequent crises in europe and america in the th and first half of the th century specifically the period – this period started from the end of the napoleonic wars in  which was immediately followed by the postnapoleonic depression in the united kingdom – and culminated in the great depression of – which led into world war ii see financial crisis th century for listing and details the first of these crises not associated with a war was the panic of citation needed business cycles in oecd countries after world war ii were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles this was particularly true during the golden age of capitalism –s and the period – did not experience a global downturn until the lates recession economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles and automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the governments budget also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policymakerscitation needed in this period the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead the first declaration was in the late s when the phillips curve was seen as being able to steer the economy however this was followed by stagflation in the s which discredited the theory the second declaration was in the early s following the stability and growth in the s and s in what came to be known as the great moderation notably in  robert lucas in his presidential address to the american economic association declared that the central problem of depressionprevention has been solved for all practical purposes unfortunately this was followed by the – global recession various regions have experienced prolonged depressions most dramatically the economic crisis in former eastern bloc countries following the end of the soviet union in  for several of these countries the period – has been an ongoing depression with real income still lower than in citation needed this has been attributed not to a cyclical pattern but to a mismanaged transition from command economies to market economies identifyingedit economic activity in the us – deviations from the longterm us growth trend – in  economists arthur f burns and wesley c mitchell provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book measuring business cycles business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities followed by similarly general recessions contractions and revivals which merge into the expansin phase of the next cycle in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar characteristics with amplitudes approximating their own according to a f burns business cycles are not merely fluctuations in aggregate economic activity the critical feature that distinguishes them from the commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely diffused over the economy – its industry its commercial dealings and its tangles of finance the economy of the western world is a system of closely interrelated parts he who would understand business cycles must master the workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free enterprises searching for profit the problem of how business cycles come about is therefore inseparable from the problem of how a capitalist economy functions in the united states it is generally accepted that the national bureau of economic research nber is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle an expansion is the period from a trough to a peak and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough the nber identifies a recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production upper turning points of business cycle commodity prices and freight ratesedit there is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle commodity prices and freight rates which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of    and  spectral analysis of business cyclesedit recent research employing spectral analysis has confirmed the presence of kondratiev waves in the world gdp dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance korotayev  tsirel also detected shorter business cycles dating the kuznets to about  years and calling it the third subharmonic of the kondratiev meaning that there are three kuznets cycles per kondratievjargon cycles or fluctuationsedit in recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of economic fluctuation rather than a business cycle – though some economists use the phrase business cycle as a convenient shorthand for milton friedman calling the business cycle a cycle is a misnomer because of its noncyclical nature friedman believed that for the most part excluding very large supply shocks business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon proposed explanationsedit the explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics the main framework for explaining such fluctuations is keynesian economics in the keynesian view business cycles reflect the possibility that the economy may reach shortrun equilibrium at levels below or above full employment if the economy is operating with less than full employment ie with high unemployment keynesian theory states that monetary policy and fiscal policy can have a positive role to play in smoothing the fluctuations of the business cycle beside the keynesian explanation there are a number of alternative theories of business cycles largely associated with particular schools or theorists in heterodox economics a common alternative within mainstream economics is real business cycle theory nowadays other notable theories are creditbased explanations such as debt deflation and the financial instability hypothesis the latter two gained interest for being able to explain the subprime mortgage crisis and financial crises exogenous vs endogenousedit within mainstream economics the debate over external exogenous versus internal endogenous being the causes of the economic cycles with the classical school now neoclassical arguing for exogenous causes and the underconsumptionist now keynesian school arguing for endogenous causes these may also broadly be classed as supplyside and demandside explanations supplyside explanations may be styled following says law as arguing that supply creates its own demand while demandside explanations argue that effective demand may fall short of supply yielding a recession or depression this debate has important policy consequences proponents of exogenous causes of crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or regulation laissez faire as absent these external shocks the market functions while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as keynesians largely argue for larger government policy and regulation as absent regulation the market will move from crisis to crisis this division is not absolute – some classicals including say argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles despite believing in external causes while austrian school economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises despite believing in internal causes the view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to says law and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting says law this is also referred to as the general glut debate until the keynesian revolution in mainstream economics in the wake of the great depression classical and neoclassical explanations exogenous causes were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles following the keynesian revolution neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected there has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of real business cycle rbc theory the debate between keynesians and neoclassical advocates was reawakened following the recession of  mainstream economists working in the neoclassical tradition as opposed to the keynesian tradition have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences such as the state or its regulations labor unions business monopolies or shocks due to technology or natural causes contrarily in the heterodox tradition of jean charles léonard de sismondi clement juglar and marx the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it the thcentury school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle notably the paradox of thrift and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of keynesian economics via the keynesian revolution keynesianedit according to keynesian economics fluctuations in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output these fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles keynesian models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles however simple keynesian models involving the interaction of the keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks paul samuelsons oscillator model is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator the amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment for investment determines the level of aggregate output multiplier and is determined by aggregate demand accelerator in the keynesian tradition richard goodwin accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers wages the fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of employment wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle for when the economy is at high employment workers are able to demand rises in wages whereas in periods of high unemployment wages tend to fall according to goodwin when unemployment and business profits rise the output rises creditdebt cycleedit main articles credit cycle and debt deflation one alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the credit cycle the net expansion of credit increase in private credit equivalently debt as a percentage of gdp yields economic expansions while the net contraction causes recessions and if it persists depressions in particular the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate cause of depressions and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle a primary theory in this vein is the debt deflation theory of irving fisher which he proposed to explain the great depression a more recent complementary theory is the financial instability hypothesis of hyman minsky and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with postkeynesian economics such as steve keen postkeynesian economist hyman minsky has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit interest rates and financial frailty called the financial instability hypothesis in an expansion period interest rates are low and companies easily borrow money from banks to invest banks are not reluctant to grant them loans because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans this process leads to firms becoming excessively indebted so that they stop investing and the economy goes into recession while credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream they have gained occasional mention such as eckstein  sinai  cited approvingly by summers  carlota perez blames financial capital for excess speculation which she claims is likely to occur in the frenzy stage of a new technology such as the – computer internet dotcom mania and bust perez also says excess speculation is likely to occur in the mature phase of a technological age real business cycle theoryedit main article real business cycle theory within mainstream economics keynesian views have been challenged by real business cycle models in which fluctuations are due to technology shocks this theory is most associated with finn e kydland and edward c prescott and more generally the chicago school of economics freshwater economics they consider that economic crisis and fluctuations cannot stem from a monetary shock only from an external shock such as an innovationcitation needed rbc theory has been categorically rejected by a number of mainstream economists in the keynesian tradition such as summers  and paul krugman politically based business cycleedit another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions the partisan business cycle suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes regime a adopts expansionary policies resulting in growth and inflation but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high the replacement regime b adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth and the downwards swing of the cycle it is voted out of office when unemployment is too high being replaced by party a the political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence it then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on election day the political business cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of michał kalecki who discussed the reluctance of the captains of industry to accept government intervention in the matter of employment persistent full employment would mean increasing workers bargaining power to raise wages and to avoid doing unpaid labor potentially hurting profitability he did not see this theory as applying under fascism which would use direct force to destroy labors power in recent years proponents of the electoral business cycle theorywho have argued that incumbent politicians encourage prosperity before elections in order to ensure reelection – and make the citizens pay for it with recessions afterwards marxian economicsedit for marx the economy based on production of commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to crisis in the heterodox marxian view profit is the major engine of the market economy but business capital profitability has a tendency to fall that recurrently creates crises in which mass unemployment occurs businesses fail remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered in the long run these crises tend to be more severe and the system will eventually fail some marxist authors such as rosa luxemburg viewed the lack of purchasing power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand creating crisis in a model that has similarities with the keynesian one indeed a number of modern authors have tried to combine marxs and keyness views henryk grossman reviewed the debates and the counteracting tendencies and paul mattick subsequently emphasized the basic differences between the marxian and the keynesian perspective while keynes saw capitalism as a system worth maintaining and susceptible to efficient regulation marx viewed capitalism as a historically doomed system that cannot be put under societal control the american mathematician and economist richard m goodwin formalised a marxist model of business cycles known as the goodwin model in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers a result of high employment in boom periods pushing up the wage share of national income suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation later theorists applying variants of the goodwin model have identified both short and long period profitled growth and distribution cycles in the united states and elsewhere david gordon provided a marxist model of long period institutional growth cycles in an attempt to explain the kondratiev wave this cycle is due to the periodic breakdown of the social structure of accumulation – a set of institutions which secure and stabilise capital accumulation austrian schooledit main article austrian business cycle theory economists of the austrian school argue that business cycles are caused by excessive issuance of credit by banks in fractional reserve banking systems according to austrian economists excessive issuance of bank credit may be exacerbated if central bank monetary policy sets interest rates too low and the resulting expansion of the money supply causes a boom in which resources are misallocated or malinvested because of artificially low interest rates eventually the boom cannot be sustained and is followed by a bust in which the malinvestments are liquidated sold for less than their original cost and the money supply contracts one of the criticisms of the austrian business cycle theory is based on the observation that the united states suffered recurrent economic crises in the th century notably the panic of  which occurred prior to the establishment of a us central bank in  adherents of the austrian school such as the historian thomas woods argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard and are thus consistent with austrian business cycle theory the austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the mainstream understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists mainstream economists generally do not support austrian school explanations for business cycles on both theoretical as well as realworld empirical grounds yield curveedit the slope of the yield curve is one of the most powerful predictors of future economic growth inflation and recessions one measure of the yield curve slope ie the difference between year treasury bond rate and the month treasury bond rate is included in the financial stress index published by the st louis fed a different measure of the slope ie the difference between year treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate is incorporated into the index of leading economic indicators an inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of recession a positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of inflationary growth work by dr arturo estrella  dr tobias adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession their models show that when the difference between shortterm interest rates he uses month tbills and longterm interest rates year treasury bonds at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than  basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs the new york fed publishes a monthly recession probability prediction derived from the yield curve and based on dr estrellas work all the recessions in the us since  up through  have been preceded by an inverted yield curve year vs month over the same time frame every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession as declared by the nber business cycle dating committee event date of inversion start date of the recession start time from inversion to recession start duration of inversion time from

jan       − average since        − std dev since         dr estrella has postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks or banklike financial institutions  when the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on shortterm deposits than they are making on longterm loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a credit crunch when the yield curve is upward sloping banks can profitably takein short term deposits and make longterm loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers this eventually leads to a credit bubble georgismedit henry george claimed land price fluctuations were the primary cause of most business cycles the theory is generally discounted by modern mainstream economists mitigating an economic downturnedit many social indicators such as mental health crimes and suicides worsen during economic recessions though general mortality tends to fall and it is in expansions when it tends to increase as periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions since the s following the keynesian revolution most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government under the rubric of stabilization policycitation needed since in the keynesian view recessions are caused by inadequate aggregate demand when a recession occurs the government should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium this the government can do in two ways firstly by increasing the money supply expansionary monetary policy and secondly by increasing government spending or cutting taxes expansionary fiscal policy by contrast some economists notably new classical economist robert lucas argue that the welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible and that governments should focus on longterm growth instead of stabilization however even according to keynesian theory managing economic policy to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy some theorists notably those who believe in marxian economics believe that this difficulty is insurmountable karl marx claimed that recurrent business cycle crises were an inevitable result of the operations of the capitalistic system in this view all that the government can do is to change the timing of economic crises the crisis could also show up in a different form for example as severe inflation or a steadily increasing government deficit worse by delaying a crisis government policy is seen as making it more dramatic and thus more painful additionally since the s neoclassical economists have played down the ability of keynesian policies to manage an economy since the s economists like nobel laureates milton friedman and edmund phelps have made ground in their arguments that inflationary expectations negate the phillips curve in the long run the stagflation of the s provided striking support for their theories while proving a dilemma for keynesian policies which appeared to necessitate both expansionary policies to mitigate recession and contractionary policies to reduce inflation friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the central bank of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the wall street crash of  in which they made what would have been a recession into the great depressioncitation needed see alsoedit dynamic stochastic general equilibrium information revolution inventory investment over the business cycle list of commodity booms list

leveredunlevered beta of eurocycles sa  ecycl  tunbeta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of a stock against the volatility of the broader market which is typically measured by a reference market index since the market is the benchmark the markets beta is always  when a stock has a beta greater than  it means the stock is expected to increase by more than the market in up markets and decrease more than the market in down markets conversely a stock with a beta lower than  is expected to rise less than the market when the market is moving up  but fall less than the market when the market is moving down despite being rare a stock may have a negative beta which means the stock moves opposite the general market trendeurocycles sa shows a beta of this is

ungeared beta compares the risk of an unlevered company ie with no debt in the capital structure to the risk of the market unlevered beta is useful when comparing companies with different capital structures as it focuses on the equity risk unlevered beta is generally lower than the levered beta however unlevered beta could be higher than levered beta when the net debt is negative meaning that
