left william a davidson walter davidson sr arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons

automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring

canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police

commission president reagan imposed in  a  percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than  cc harleydavidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from japanese motorcycle makers however the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the japanese rather than trying to match the japanese the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of the machines building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era many

during the late s and early first decade of the st century harleydavidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing

classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to

recordings taken at the talladega superspeedway with the objective to lower the sound level for eu standards while analytically capturing the harley soundcitation needed this research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of harleydavidsons competitors filed comments opposing the application arguing that cruiserstyle motorcycles of various brands use a singlecrankpin vtwin engine which produce a similar sound these objections were followed by litigation in june  the company

company is operating in this particular country market environment customers  competitors customers in uk market are very diverse in the context of culture religion ethnicity social life style buying pattern age groups and behavioral aspects for harleydavidson people of all age groups are its potential customers because uk is a highly individualistic society as stated by hofstede  competitors of harleydavidson include honda suzuki and kawasaki etc but due to rapidly changing technological factors and advancements rivalry also fluctuates each year according to ash  in uk currently there are three competitors of harley ie triumph speedmaster ducati monster and victory vegas market environment suppliers  intermediaries harleydavidson uk has its own dealership and supplier network which they operate and manage via their website and hd university hdenetcom is a secure and stateof the art website developed by harleydavidson uk for dealers to access harleydavidson uk  the official network of dealers in uk also acts as intermediaries for harleydavidson and they dont use any separate retailers in the market for their products and services this factor makes it easy for the company to sustain an efficient system of marketing distribution channels czinkota  ronkainen  macro environment pestle analysis here we will discuss the macrofactors of the country in which organization is

legal new regulations about driving license ie implementation of rd license has put a new set of laws for motorcycle drivers creating more limitations for the people  years of age has been set minimum for driving a motorcycle as per the regulation of the uk government  competitors analysis harley davidson the uk scooter and motorcycle industry has been dominated for a long time by japanese brands yamaha  honda and currently around  out of  sales are from these two brands for new scooters and motorcycles making them strong competitors of harley davidson in the uk market mintel  the other competitors of hd are suzuki bmw and ducati the biggest market share is of honda in the market with total market share of  mintel  honda honda has been the market leader in the motorcycle industry of the uk for many years now by bringing in innovative models and technology through its products and has been able to sustain its position successfully mintel  yamaha motorbikes yamaha has been the second largest motorcycle brand in the uk in terms of market share and they have been giving tough competitor to honda as well throughout last  years mintel  we will see statistical comparisons of these brands in the uk market to authenticate our arguments and will include recent and past years data about the market share of these brands in the uk motorcycle  scooter market last  years brand shares of the uk motorcycle and scooter market by number of new registrations  and  source mintel         point change    no  no  honda     yamaha     triumph     pvg group     llexeter     bmw

      suzuki        piaggio        these comparisons show that honda and yamaha have captured the major market share in the uk and posing serious threats  competition for harley davidson as well harley davidson market share in  its combined market share was  only and intense competition was posed against harley by other competitors in the market harley davidson has the eighth largest market share in uk behind japanese giants suzuki and market leader honda etc it is interesting to know here that in  hondas market shared dropped and the following year market share of harley davidson increased by  mintel  swot analysis of harley davidson inc this is a planning tool which is used for understanding the threats opportunities weaknesses and strengths that are involved in a business or project cipd  strength customized bikes luxury brand reputation strong customer base and years of existing in the market the brand name  image of harleydavidson a strong research  development harleydavidson inc  weakness sale of company in the uk are encouraging geographic concentration is vulnerable to risks mcbee  nonfuel efficient bikes opportunity differentiation and innovation of hd rising interest of uk youth in motorbikes tim  male  and female  mintel  move into other markets using brand image of company such as apparel fashion clothing threats stringent emission standards in uk harleydavidson inc  overall usage of bikes in uk is very low compared to uk strong competition tows matrix of harleydavidson so strategies st strategies by introducing new models of motorcycles in uk considering the cultural  technological trends in uk will help in capturing the market share target female and younger generation because they are getting attracted to this segment which can help in expanding and sustaining the uk market harleydavidson is a legacy for us police officers that they can continue in uk as well harleydavidson  use manufacturing investment in uk and develop a strong dealership network for managing cost  gripping the market customer loyalty in european countries especially uk can be a potential threat because harleydavidson is yet to obtain loyalty here to gain that loyalty in uk via their quality services and innovation will get them their traditional strength and diminish potential threat especially quality customer services which is most considered by uk people  companies jenkinson sain  wo strategies wt strategies average buying age of harleydavidsons customers is still increasing which is becoming a weakness and luxury motorcycles of the company restrain majority of younger population to buy it the dominant segment of customers were baby boomers who are ageing out and the company needs to specifically focus on their rd for younger segment of uk eg light weight motorcycles or scooters is one strategy to attract younger customers harleydavidson has never been into traditional advertising  promotional activities and have relied more on word of mouth but few of their competitors have large marketing and financial resources delikase  use of tradition marketing  advertising methods in uk market is essential to cancel out the diversification factor motorcycle noise standards of european unions are stricter than those used in us which can be a potential threat  weakness which the company has to consider porters five forces model micheal porter has given this model which provides an in depth analysis for companies to help them in their strategic and marketing decision making hollensen svend  internal rivalry honda and yamaha have entered the segment of heavy weight bikes and are rivals of harleydavidson they have a competitive advantage over harleydavidson in the form of low prices rutter  threat of new entrants motor industry is very vast and huge in terms of its product range market  investment so new entrant threat is something which hd should not worry about bargaining power of suppliers  customers harleydavidson relies heavily on a single supplier for some of its raw material but raw material is for customized bikes and there are fewer producers in the market making it minimal factor harleydavidson has the brand name  image of worlds most valuable brand with iconic status bbc  but still the price range of hd can affect the buying power of customers threat of substitution this factor is high for hd with the introduction of innovative cost effective and stylish japanese brands in the market market identification we have identified  target markets based on the cultural social economic and other factors in depth discussion and analysis on the identified markets is as follows first target market segmentation according to keller  kotler  segmentation refers to a strategy using which we can create a subgroup having similar product requirements by dividing the whole relevant market of the product first target consumer market that we have chosen will be younger generation ranging from age  to  male and this is mainly due to the reason that for harley davidson baby boomers who are basic market segment have gone aged now and the company is in need of customers who can persist for a longer period of time and the company need to utilize its brand image to attract such customers demographic segmentation this particular type of segmentation refers to the division of market on the basis of variables that comes under demographic aspect ie education occupation income life cycle family size socio economic group sex and age etc according to armstrong  kotler  this type of segmentation is most wide used and popular for distinguishing customer groups mainly due to the simplicity with which users can collect this sort of data variables of demographic segmentations in the hds context are discussed below age  gender in the new customer segments young adults were identified as most prominent segments for scotty as per the reports stated by mintel  we are specifically targeting male customers in this market segment with age from  years because in this age group male customers are more vulnerable to be attracted for scotty the kids in this age range likes to ride and have the tendency towards sport activities which makes them potential customers majority of kids in this market segment are school going and now scooters are used as mode of transport and allowed in schools making it more attractive product and j fraser of ndp group stated that for those who cannot drive bikes this is a fun way of transport safer than bikes and stable doward  income income range of these customers will be around  pounds and being students parents can only afford to spend that much of money and mostly they belongs to middle class with educational level upto middle as well it means they can easily afford to spend on scotty of harley davidson which will not cost much due to its average prices as a product behavioral  social factor behaviorally these customers see benefits in brands because their friends are using it and children use toys on regular basis which later on turns into heavy usage and this segment belongs to middle social class they purchase mostly on different occasions such as christmas easter and other national events or festivals and they value reliability the most ie my friend is using thats why it is reliable whereas they are not brand conscious and not loyal as well because they are using brand for the first time socially this particular segment has high need of kid scooters because of the school going kids and sports activities of male kids in uk mintel  psychographic segmentation according to keller  kotler  values of the consumers personality and psychological traits are few segments on the basis of which consumers are divided in this market segment psychographic variables of this segment show that they are family oriented and socially conscious customers ie wants to buy for the child due to social pressure and competition and the interests of kids in sports activities they possess average brand opinion and have various alternative options because they dont use brands quite often and mostly they are first time buyers their lifestyle is family oriented and they prefer brands that are beneficial for the kids in a reliable way and popular in their social circle of friends  peers according to datamonitor  middle class population of uk is increasingly using brands when it comes to their kids and children product positioning here we will try to create a particular image of our brand  product in the minds of the customers by positioning the harley davidson product accordingly we will use perceptual mapping in this regard which will help us in identifying the exact position of our product in the perception or mind of the consumers ie by illustrating consumer favorites and competitor brands or products which is as follows expensive ben zinc razor razor yvol razor appealing designs reliability zinc zinc sporty there are various brands available in the uk that is providing kids scooters but few brands have been able to perform better we have taken  dimensions that are appropriate with scooters for kids brands ie designs quality reliability and sporty when consumer identification was viewed it was clear that consumers view razor zinc and yvolution as reliable and sporty brands whereas consumers view razor and zinc as sporty and cool in designs and they view razor zinc and ben as expensive and cool in designs harley davidson should develop their new product for this specific market by focusing on attractive and modern designs of scotty and use of bright color combinations that are elegant  sporty as well and avoid heavyweight scottys because this segment customers will prefer lighter weight scotty due to their age and usage factor these factors will play key role in attracting customers of this segment to communicate and make people aware about the uniqueness and arrival of the brand in a new way ie using a new tag line will be effective for example creating a tag line which will attract the younger generation male such as play smart look smart use smart harley davidson smart rides we have to hit hard on the hearts  mind of our target market segment with such tag line which will make hd alive and revive because once we are able to enter this market segment with few sales it will be easy to continue adopt traditional ways of advertising and promotion eg hires a brand ambassador while launching new models and designs sportsperson like andy murray is the best possible brand ambassador who can lift the brand name  image in uk market because currently he is the most popular sports player among our target market segment ie younger generation males on top of this wimbledon championship is coming up in few months time in the uk which will create putting icing on the cake impact of our brand marketing objectives of segment here we will state some marketing objectives for this segment that we want to achieve with these marketing strategies and we have to make sure that the objectives are realistic and measureable we have outlined a year marketing plan below for harley davidson to raise the market share by  in first years  in the second year and  in the third year ie in total  increase in the market share for the company and we will do so by developing brand equity and brand image in the country our main weapon will be to produce unique and innovative products especially designed for this target market segment so that we can achieve a respected and emerging position in this market we want our sales to increase  each following year ie for three years we all know that customer service is of supreme important in this country where we see please  thank you used frequently and it is a strong culture in the uk by considering this we will launch a strong customer relationship management system through which customers can interact with the company regarding any issue and query anytime and feel being valued to achieve status of market leader in this specific uk market of scotty in the next  years by basing on our marketing csr innovative and consistent strategies focusing on the lifestyles of the customers of target segments to achieve an increase in sale progressively ie doubling the sales ratio for each coming year by utilizing innovative marketing techniques and fulfilling customers precise needs through innovation and differentiation marketing mix for segment  product for this segment we have to market such product which meets the requirements demands trends lifestyle and tastes of the customers for this we will have to keep few things in mind eg scotty is in trend recently and its use is vast because it fulfills the need of this segment using combination of  colors for one model ie blue  black then using multicolors for one model ie yellow orange and brown will attract the kids and will show variety  uniqueness as well we have to keep mini micro scooters popularity in mind which according to bbc  has risen in last  years ie we have to keep separate designs models color combinations features and reliability for different age groups such as  years  years and then  years of consumers this will allow us to make a positive impact and satisfy needs of this segment adequately this year we will launch color combination of  in nd year multiple color combinations will be launched and in rd year new additions in previous model color combinations at the same time we have to make different sizes of the models as well to make sure that all the age group segment benefits and use our products price pricing factors have to consider very precisely because other brands in the market are not expensive and since scotty is a new product by harley davidson for specific market segment and people have made up their mind regarding price by looking at other brands a new pricing criteria is needed for this segment because we will be targeting this segment majorly in our marketing strategies and as schembri  stated that premium prices are offered by hd for its products in addition the current consumer market of scooters in uk is price sensitive and we have to forgo our pricing strategy that we use for our other products we have to adopt cost based pricing for this segment as we have to keep in mind the purchasing power of the customers and they will be new customers plus we have to look at  years strategy by competing with strong competitors so initially competitive prices should be offered that are not more than what competitors are offering and once the customers has admired the brand product and accepted then we can think about increasing slightly when the risk will be minimum place social media and companys own website will be effective sources of distribution apart from companys own dealership network in the country social media is important because it plays a fast and effective role in todays world for communicating and distributing products and services in a cost effective way facebook pages and twitter accounts will be used to let the dotcom generation know about the hd products and the companys own website will be modified with information about the new and upcoming products and their features according to ofcom  over  of the uk population today uses social media for different purposes which show the potential in this source the website of the company will also allow the customers to locate the official dealers countrywide and to interact with them about gathering information and queries in addition the company should add  more dealers in major cities of the country to cover maximum number of customers promotion creating a super hero logo to be used on all models of scooters will be a great way to promote the brand ie just like spiderman  batman we will design our own super hero logo which will attract young kids in addition hiring a brand ambassador for this product line will be positive such as andy murray will be the best possible person for this role because he is very popular among younger generation public appearances of andy in few events will provide great advertising benefits to the company or in few competitions of kids about riding scooters developing an android application or game about the new products of hd by using the super hero logo that drives scooters of hd and it will also produce high results because almost  of the uk population uses mobile phones and with the inclusion of smart phones advertising has become more effective efficient and long lasting market identification second target market segmentation this market that we have targeted by segmenting and creating subgroup of customers consists of females with age range   years we will be launching women bikes that are lighter and trendier than bikes for males and it will be brand extension of harley davidson according to mintel  survey women appears a more promising segment for motorbikes as about  of the women desire to keep a motorcycle demographic segmentation for identifying the potential customers segment this segmentation includes age gender income and similar other variables we have chosen this segment because females with such attributes like to use branded products for their routine life and are adventurous and sports frenzy income age  gender this segment includes females that are doing white collar job and earning more than £  annually or their families who support them are extremely well off the age range for these consumers is from  to  years and their purchase power is also healthy making them attractive segment for hd the disposable income available to this segment is very high and they are in a better position to make their own decision this age women are also looking to breakaway and our particular segment is going away from families to study and looking to enter new exciting phase in their lives which makes them positive potential customers of our product the size of this segment is also very high according to statistics by mintel  total number of females falling under this category is  of total female population in uk similarly of total population uk under    years total female is about  these women fall under the distinct lifecycle category and more attracted towards brand they want to be associated with fashion and want to wear and look for style of life that is based on branded and stylish products our target marget for this category is women that are falling under upper middle and upper income level and share the same lifestyle characteristics that are also followed by global harley davidson followers and brand persons according to report of mintel  women during the age  to  and single look to develop hobbies which make them distinctive using a harley davidson bike will be the ideal opportunity and best segment to utilize this window behavioral segmentation behaviorally females of this market segment are brand conscious fashionable and likes to be fit  healthy and takes interest in sporting activities and they are freewill with power to purchase and identify brands according to their needs and demands depend on niche market  buy brands as status symbol this segment is looking for comfort status and reputation from the brand the look for niche products and always are attracted with products which are not common they are extremely brand loyal and once there trust is established it is very difficult to detract them from their brand of choice they are very loyal followers of brand and will look to keep associated with brand in all areas meaning that not only they will be interested in the core product but they will be buying all the brand extensions this can allow harley to develop to develop trendy helmets jackets and other accessories psychographic segmentation this segment customers value uniqueness innovation and luxurious brands in the market they look to satisfy their mind by purchasing such products and they are returning customers as well who gets excited by the brand image  symbol distinctive lifestyle is what they seek and carry with a high social class which matches with the brand position of harley davidson brand positioning  perceptual mapping simple design kawasaki expensive suzuki affordability honda ducati harley davidson fashionable in this perceptual map we have used variables such as affordability fashionable designs affordability of brands and expensiveness from the perceptual map it can be seen that honda ranks high in terms of affordability and fashion the motorcycle is a perfect combination of medium range design and pricing ducate appears to be the most expensive however the fashionable is not high and honda sportster brand ranks high in fashion and is also less expensive than ducati if customers looking for luxury and fashionable motorcycle than harley davidson sportsterr brand appear to be the best choice while consumers going for cheaper alternatives will look for either suzuki or honda kawasaki is admired for its better mieage and efficiency these factors are not rated high among choices for females marketing objectives for segment  objectives for this segment are different because of both age and gender difference smart technique will be sued for this segment marketing objectives being specific this market is very lucrative due to which we have to achieve an overall market share of  within first  months of the launch has to be identified the introduction of sportster women version will be done on grand scale and break even is expected to be achieved by year three being measureable measuring the costs of production and whole marketing process and other transportation costs for reaching a set target that we need to match by making our sales we have  months of time to reach that target and show our performance being achievable right use of social media and website for selling  advertising purposes will easily get us through to that target and in addition brand ambassador campaign will also assist in achieving the target within the set time being realistic this objective and goal is very realistic given the situation in our hand ie huge potential in the segment the trend for using bikes has shown double digit growth in uk during the past five year mintel  being time specific this one year is a short term objective and step towards the medium term goals ie this objective is set for achieving breakeven so that further objectives can be achieved marketing mix for segment  product the product for the segment will be sportster line of motorbikes the line will be labeled as shesportster the bikes will be modified made lighter and more comfortable so that they can be use for the segment women in the age bracket of  to  years luxurious feel is important for females the motorcycle would also be comfortable and easy to ride and customers should also look for style and fashionable according to the behavioral requirements ie satisfaction and brand image we will use different color combinations for the motor cycles so that consumers of this segment gets attracted to it and mostly using vibrant colors that looks cool such as pink red purple royal blue black etc hdfortyeightbsjpg harley davidson  sportster  bs model hdseventytwobsjpg harley davidson  sportster  bs model to make it more appealing leather material for the seats will be used which will also increase the product usage and improve the fashion touch at least three different types of shesportster will be launched with different color combinations and contrasts one set of product will include all the necessary supporting equipments making sure that customer needs are met the option of customizing the color combinations will be available on official website of the product so that product positioning can be made more attractive yet simple price as we know that harley davidson is a luxury brand with iconic positing and image its prices has always been at premium and mostly hd has been a price leader in the market of luxury products which has attached certain expectations of customers with this brand according to moriarty et al  high pricing is normally linked with luxury products and brands so that a sense of expensiveness and appeal can be felt and most importantly consumers feel a sense of satisfaction while buying such expensive brand items for this segment pricing will not be an issue and we can set the prices according to our feasible calculations and we can set healthy margins in this because customers of this segment are not price conscious the sportster brand already has pricing established in uk due to the association of harley davidson the motorcycle will be priced at higher level the comparison of existing bikes which are suitable to b driven by the females is as follow make prices in £ lowest price highest price honda sportster   kawasaki ninja   honda rebel   ducati monster   suzuki sfv    data for motorcycle pirces collected from websites of companies respectively from the above figures it can be seen than every company is selling one of it top product at almost the similar price however at lower end the price of honda and kawasaki is the cheapest these brands will be the main competition of harley davidson shesportster prices will be competitive and high so that our brand image and position is maintained and customers perception can be met and fulfilled this product range is price elastic because this product is not basic necessity for customers and they can look for other brands if prices get too high or out of reach then demand will also shift to the lower side so premium prices will be set since the purchasing power and sense of brand identification is high in this particular segment of customers place channels of placing and distribution have always been important for any product for this product range we will have to rely on set of distributors the best option is to look for existing retailers of harley and use the same premises to sell the product other option is to place shesportster at various retail chain stores for special marketing and promotion packages new look and sports direct are some retail outlets where we will provide our products to be sold to customers especially new look and debenhams outlets are available easily countrywide and in access of majority of such customers apart from this company website and other selling websites such as ebay will be used for online selling where a large number of females visits and buy products on regular basis issuing purchase cards with bonus points and making them workable at both physical stores and online will provide a benefit to the company using which customers can do purchasing in the way which is feasible and easy for them this distribution strategy is chosen simply because above  of the uk population has access to social media through their cell phones bbc  and above  of customers of this segment uses internet and social media because of the nature of their work and interests which is a plus point for us to position our products in a better way and in quick time avoiding long channels of distribution will allow the company to sell the products efficiently and making sure that customer relationship management is of high quality at both physical stores and online stores so that customers will feel satisfied on the effectiveness of the distribution and management systems the facility of modifying color combinations and sizes at online stores will make it more impactful on the customers promotion several promotional methods can be used for advertising this product of harley davidson a separate facebook page for shesportster motorcycle range in highly desirable here because women shop online in huge numbers and especially working women doing white collar job likes to search for their favorite products and brands online so a separate facebook page and a separate section of this product on the official website of the company will be an effective tool of promotion fashion magazines and professional magazines are also an effective way for promoting the shesportster range because consumers of this segment frequently view or read these magazines for their information updates and new trends in the market attractive billboards featuring models or celebrities will be used to impact on masses organizing a sports event of females in major cities of the country eg a competition of motorbike racing or other healthy sports games which involves no risk will be a positive step in these games prizes will be given to the winners in the form of harley davidson accessories such as helmets and jackets which will increase the interest and desire in the consumers of this segment hiring a celebrity or model to endorse this product range will also make a huge impact on the promotion of harley davidson products such as victoria beckham or captain of world cup winning women cricket team who can influence largely on attracting this segment even a unique ramp walk by models with the motorcycles in a fashion week will do more than what is required by the promotional events of our products ie showcasing shesportster products in such event will be a unique idea and will definitely attract the attention of media and consumers control mechanism for hd for evaluating monitoring and assessing the success of our marketing plan different techniques are available the business plan for harley davidson is for three years and marketing control plan will be developed accordingly year   product launch shesportster will b official launched in the uk market promotion effectiveness as this would be the first year the promotion effectiveness will be measured using number o visits of customers to the distributors and other places where products are sold also visits to social media such as facebook twitter my space and google etc will be monitored to identify product awareness and effectiveness of promotion also surveys will be conducted among the targeted segments to identify their views and perceptions about the brand during the first year of launch the traffic of consumers on facebook page how many likes are made and traffic on company website ie how many clicks per day this will show the popularity and success of attracting the customers towards our products similarly for customer doings physical purchasing will be given a small questionnaire card to fill up and let their opinion be shared with us for our betterment ie how they came to know about our product or what image they have about our products so far etc distribution criteria shesportster will be distributed using existing hd distributers and retail stores also online sales via hd website product performance increase market share by  increase total awareness by  of the total target segment of harley year   promotion effectiveness statistics should be viewed from last year promotion activities and checked on quarterly basis so that progress can be assured up to  months a customer feedback form during marketing promotions and sales visits is a most widely used tool in this regard and it is effective as well so we will use this form and take feedback from our valued customers so that we know exactly what consumers think and feel about their purchase behavior and about competitor brands or the brands they already use and the after  weeks time asking the customers about their comments regarding our brand products and it will be entirely upto customers whether they want to share their opinion or not with this we will get positive and negative points that we need to improve and change regarding our products and services as this would be the second year the promotion effectiveness will be measured by using sales of unit sold also surveys will be conducted among the targeted segments to identify their views and perceptions about the brand extension during the second year of launch distribution criteria shesportster will continue to be distributed using existing hd distributers and retail stores also online sales via hd website product performance increase market share by  increase sales revenue by  year   promotion effectiveness this year effectiveness will be a direct function of sales the product is thre years old now survey will be conducted to identify customers brand association and where do they rank shesportster against competition brand position of shesportster will be derived and its strength will be analyzed product performance increase market share by  break even in sales introduce or plan to introduce product extension such as helmets and jackets for females conclusion harley davidson has chosen two market segments which are complete different segments in terms of their needs requirements and other attributes this can be seen as an advantage or disadvantage as well at the same time because if the company did well in one segment it will automatically reflect on the other segment sales and acceptability and if one segment fails it will dent the performance of the other segment as well rivals of both segments of market are different making it more difficult to compete and handle the marketing campaign three years plan are set for both segments which are not very aggressive due to the stiff competition in both segments and this will benefit in implementation and attainment of set objectives kids market is relatively complex because you never know with kids that what sort of product will appeal them but still we have put innovative and

manufacturer has no doubts about its identity heres how you can crystalize yours by laura montini laura montini is a reporter at inc she previously covered health care technology for health  news and has served as an associate editor at the health care blog she lives in san francisco lmmontini reporter inclmmontini  comments credit shutterstock to be able to tell the world about your new product you first need to be able to talk about it internally  this is what it means to position your product to find a great example of strong product positioning take a look at harleydavidson this is the companys internal positioning statement  the only motorcycle manufacturer that makes big loud motorcycles for macho guys and macho wannabes mostly in the united states who want to join a gang of cowboys in an era of decreasing personal freedom its rather poetic but you dont have to be a poet to draft a similarly effective statement developing this kind of mantra is formulaic startup advisor arielle jackson recently told first round review jackson is a former product marketing manager for google and square she recommended using the following structure to come up with your own positioning statement  for target customer who statement of need or opportunity product name is a product category that statement of key benefit unlike competing alternative product namestatement of primary differentiation note that the end result is different from a tagline jackson said taglines are consumerfacing catch phrases that summarize your positioning statement extremely concisely for example one of harleydavidsons tag lines is american by birth rebel by choice   internally positioning statements are crucial because they set the stage for all that will followincluding finding the right people as you expand further developing the product and of course marketing it to your audience it all starts with nailing down your positioning everything stems from that jackson said if youve done it right youll be able to tell everyone why what you’re doing matters in a way that will make them listen and respond published on aug   essays  repository of free essays ukessays trusted by students
