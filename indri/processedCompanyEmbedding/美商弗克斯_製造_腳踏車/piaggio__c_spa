the aeronautical and military sector piaggio engages in the production of mas antisubmarine motorboats and especially of aeroplanes and seaplanes initially built under ansaldo macchi caproni and dornier license and later on piaggio drawings in the  the level reached by piaggio production is demonstrated by the  world records acquired between  and  by the aircraft and engines built in the new factory in pontedera where since the early twenties piaggio concentrates its civil and military aviation manufacturing culminating in the highly advanced fourengine p  a strategic fourengine bomber in  rinaldo piaggio dies and the company – which has meanwhile become a company with many shareholders in the family in addition to the entrepreneur attilio odero – is managed by his sons enrico and armando in  piaggio manufactures trains nautical fittings aircraft engines and aeroplanes trucks trams buses funiculars and aluminium windows but piaggio emerged from the conflict with its pontedera plant completely demolished by allied bombing and production activities are relocated to the biella area italys crippled economy and the disastrous state of the roads did not assist in the redevelopment of the automobile markets enrico piaggio decided to leave the aeronautical field in order to address italys urgent need for a modern and affordable mode of transportation the idea was to design an inexpensive vehicle for the masses starting from biella based on a small motorcycle made for parachutists the prototype known as the mp was nicknamed paperino the italian name for donald duck because of its strange shape but enrico piaggio did not like it and he asked corradino d’ascanio to redesign it aeronautical engineer corradino dascanio – responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by agusta – was asked therefore by enrico piaggio to create a simple robust and affordable vehicle the aeronautical designer didnt like motorcycles he found them uncomfortable and bulky with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture corradino dascanios drawings had nothing to do with the paperino his design was absolutely original and revolutionary compared to all the other existing means of twowheeled transport with the help of mario deste his trusted designer it would only take corradino dascanio a few days to fine tune his idea and prepare the first vespa project manufactured in pontedera in april  the vehicle had to be easy to drive for both men and women be able to carry a passenger and not get its drivers clothes dirty

and changed it so that every piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line unlike the turnaround recipe applied at us auto makers mr colaninno did not fire a single worker – a move which helped
