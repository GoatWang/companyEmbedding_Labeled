determinant of different markets demographic studies comprises of human population according to size density location age sex race occupation etc in general the major demographic threat is of course the growing population due to this hazard needs and wants of human beings are increasing which create a threat of not fulfilling these needs and wants due to insufficient amount of resources to meet the desired production level the demand of petroleum products has been continuously increasing since the rapid development in industrialization especially in automobile industry applying these facts to pakistani market where with the growing population automobile usage rate has also been increased which mean growing market opportunities for petroleum product companies currently there are only three major petroleum product companies working effectively here vizshell pakistan limitedpakistan state oil psocaltex oils pakistan limitedthese companies are extensively fulfilling the current demand of petroleum products according to the demographic needs of the populationdemographic trends posses an opportunity for shell in a way that it is a multinational company and its strength lies in its ability to bring in changes and innovation from abroad into local environment according to the local trends in population lifestyle of the people and their perception about its products it poses threats in a sense that pakistan is a developing country searching for new technologies for rapid development the difference between the western technologies and ours is vast because of educational lag and ability to adapt changes so as technology skills and expertise are coming in from abroad it is somehow difficult to absorb them in the local environment managers at shell very well know about these facts and categorically working out different strategies to cope with this problem of under absorbing new technologies in local environment economicthe economic environment is defined as factors that effect consumer buying power and spending patterns in today’s world two types of economies in terms of level as well as distribution of incomes viz subsistence economies in which countries consume mostly their own agricultural and industrial output and industrial economies which stands at the other extreme countries having subsistence economies have little market opportunity for international marketers but they find it lucrative to invest in countries possessing industrial economies pakistan falls under subsistence economies but due to major industrialization it’s heading towards industrial economies and that’s why many multinational companies showing their keen interest in investing in pakistan changes in incomesin pakistan there is a considerable variance in income level between upper and the lower class the upper class has a lot to spend while lower class has been working hard to pull itself out of poverty circleas the population of pakistan consists of mostly middle and lower class shell is following the strategy of value marketing because shell’s main objective is revolved around “customers” as the company’s motto is “you can be sure of shell”  this strategy implies to provide right combination of products and good services at a fair pricethere is a distorted impact of income on the company in rural areas the impact is less positive as company cannot possess more outlets there in urban areas it is definitely positive impact because of more outlets and distribution channels government’s deregulation of prices of lubricants leads to different prices in the different citiesthis basically happens because of transportation cost that was initially borne by the government but now company is responsible for this as such there is no direct relationship between savings and company natural resourcesas far as the availability of the natural resources is concerned company is basically engaged in both upstream exploration and the downstream  refining blending distribution and marketing of petroleum business by downstream of petroleum business we mean that it couldn’t drill the soil for getting crude oil from it first and then further process and blend it into petroleum refines lubricants and specialty products so it required no direct access to the natural resources however the main costs comprise getting crude oil and base oil from national refinery and blend it to produce different products the cost that company incurs is according to the oil prices prevailing in the international market cost depends upon the materials required and terms and conditions with the governmentinternational standards for health the environment and safety are an integral part of shell’s business planning and operations this carries through all levels with a comprehensive system of management practices training and auditing shell facilities are among the industry leaders in preventing pollution and oil spills and in preserving natural resources and habits as a result the company’s environmental health and safety performance is well above the industry normsophisticated environmental technology helps employees manage and monitor activity to assure safety protect health minimize pollution process recyclable waste materials meet community expectations and government regulations shell has introduced a driver league system that will encourage drivers to operate in a safe manner by providing incentives targeted towards improving the quality of their lives shell pakistan has made it mandatory that drivers carrying shell’s product wear seat belts this has reduced the number of fatalities that occur due to adverse road conditions and poor driving standards shell has also regularly training drivers in a bid to improve driving standards shell has also establishing a number of rest stations that will provide rest and recreational facilities to drivers throughout the country along the major routes as well as depots and installations technologytoday’s world is moving with a tremendous pace in technological changes new technologies replace the older ones quickly also with the growth in automobile industry the demand in petroleum products has been increased drastically the new changing technology in automobile industry induces the manufacturer of petroleum products to constantly innovate new combination of high quality lubricants in order to provide customers satisfactory and reasonable value for their moneyshell has pioneered products services and technologies used in the petroleum industry today it is committed to a variety of total quality management initiatives and iso  standards from new fuels and lubricants to innovations in refining customers and joint venture partners count on shell to deliver leadingedge product and technologies with its own expertise added to research and development groups shell optimizes upon its existing resources boost refining efficiency and markets performancetested products with real value of customers in addition shell pakistan limited offers independently developed technologies that help to optimize the quality and environmental suitability of shell’s productsin the retail sector shell pioneered the service station technology for delivering compressed natural gas cng to automobiles shell has started extensive research on cng as viable and profitable business venture of the future it also was the first in its operating area to promote branded gasoline based on a performance deposit control additive package shell’s rimulax rimulac and rimulad increased performance reduced fuel consumption and controlled emissions politicalpolitical uproar may affect company’s activities but to a very little extent the main factor is again deregulation of prices and company has to change its strategy accordingly it has always worked according to the rules and regulations designed by the government as such there is no major effecttaking place because all the companies in the industry will face the same circumstances culturalculture can be defined as the basic values perceptions preferences and behaviors of a particular society so cultural environment includes institutions and other forces that affect all of the above factors in our society their is a vast deviation in the perception values and behavior because our society is composed of people belonging to different segments of the country besides this there is a class difference ie upper class middle class and lower class when these differences come into play a company feels difficult to cope with each and every need of different people because upper class usually prefers the higher quality products with higher prices reverse is the case with the lower class with the growing use of expensive cars manufactured under new technologies people are heading towards a luxurious and lavish lifestyle the vigorous economies in asian countries are creating a rapidly increasing demand for petroleum products as well a significant part of that demand is coming from a young expanding middle class whose purchasing power is an approach to its counter parts in the european community they are buying modern expensive automobiles and the products to run them the potential to capture a significant share of this market while also attracting large number of high mileage motorists such as taxi drivers and other professional drivers is the reason shell is concentrating its resources so intensely on retail marketing environment audittask environment marketmarket is defined as the set of allactual and potential buyers and sellers in case of shell the market which we are talking about is the market for petroleum products lubricants it means all the retail outlets at which customers get what they want regarding petroleum products comprises mainly of petrol lubricants like motor engine oil shell advance diesel engine oil rimula series hydraulic oils etc market size  growth market size is growing day by day as competition is developing between the three giants of the industry ie shell pso and caltex with the growing vehicle consumption the company’s growth in the market is significant in nation wide retail petroleum products distribution network pso leads the market by capturing a market share of  having an annual sales of rs billion and an assets of rs billion all the figures are approximate shell holds a market share of in the lubricant market this market has an annual sales volume of  million liters shell had a sales turnover of rs billion in the year shell primarily focuses on the three main cities of pakistan ie karachi lahore  islamabad because of two reasons ie these cities comprises concentrated population and have largest purchasing power in the country for example one rupee spent on advertising maximizes coverage similarly one rupee spent on promotion maximizes return on sales so its primary focus is on the three main cities with subsequent focuses on peshawar faisalabad and so onin retail business market share depends on how many number of retail outlets a company possess consider the case of karachi shell has a market share of  caltex has a market share of  and pso has  share in the market in terms of retail outlets in karachi shell possess  retail outlets caltex has around  retail outlets while pso leads the market by possessing around  retail outlets this figure is taken from a marketing research survey conducted early last year so the total number of retail outlets in the city comes out to be  retail outlet share of shell is around  caltex has share in retail outlet while pso captures a retail outlet share of  if we divide market share by the number of retail outlet share we will get market effectiveness after calculating we can say that shell has a market effectiveness of  times ie if it makes an investment of one rupee it will get  rupee back for shell this figure is  and for pso it is  so out of three shell is the most effective company as it gets more of the two on its investments geographic distributionfor geographic distribution company has divided the country into two parts northern region and southern region punjab and nwfp come under northern region while balochistan and sindh come under southern region among the three shell is the most profitable company in terms of return on asset and return on sales profitsas far as profits are concerned company is running with growing profits last year company made a profit of about rs  million after tax expectations for this year according to the management is even more than last year’s profit because as we have seen in the above section that shell is the most profitable in terms of return on investment major market segmentsthe major market segments are industrial segment and distribution segment industrial segment comprises almost all type of major industries working in the country while distribution segment consists of the normal requirement of the automobiles customersthere are two types of customers of shell products the upper class and the lower class of the people upper class comprises quality and service conscious people and have less consideration about prices reverse is the case in lower class peopleas shell is always puts customers’ values in the center while making price strategy its products reflects the ideology of customers buying power and the satisfaction that they can get from its products the factors that customers keep in their minds  are of course greater quality and satisfaction as long as they are getting a good quality and performance they would buy its products because by using these lubricants they could improve the efficiency of their cars customers attitude towards shellshell has constantly watching the trends and the patterns of people’s lifestyles and drawing conclusions on these changing scenarios it is successfully placing its products and providing services in the form of petrol pumps into the market according to the needs of the people people at shell design the strategies to produce high quality lubricants and refines to match the users’ requirements the people have a nice and appreciable attitude and perception about the company’s products they think that shell’s products can provide better value for their money they prefer shell products to some other brands because of high quality and competitive prices that is the reason why shell products’ demand is growing day by day competitorsthe main competitors are caltex and pso both of them specially caltex are more concerned about the market share rather than market effectiveness right now shell has approximately  market share whereas pso has approximately  while caltex has approximately  shell captures a good market share both in rural and urban areas of pakistan but shell is also putting a lot of concentration on developing markets in rural areas that is not economical for the time being this can be termed as a weakness of the company channelssince it belongs to retail business industry therefore the main channels for distributing products to the customers are retail outlets there are some other channels which are used to distribute shell’s products for example lube shops which contains only shell’s brands distributors which carry different petroleum brands along with shell’s lubricant brands spare parts shops different work shops dealers and petrol pumps these channels are performing very well in terms of market efficiency market effectiveness and profitabilitybesides these channels it distributes products through direct selling to the industrial sector it captures  to   shares in sales of industrial oils and lubricants it provides good quality industrial oil and lubricants to almost all the major industries in the country consisting textile machinery etc no intermediary would involve in selling to the industry because company makes direct selling to them suppliersthe main supplier of the company is government that provides raw oil and base oil for the manufacturing of different products the major trends which affect suppliers is fluctuations in the oil prices in international markets and the inconsistency in the economic condition of the country otherwise the process of getting crude and base oils from the government is quite smoothpublicsgovernment is the main publics which provides problem and opportunity for the company it can cope with this by obeying the government rules and regulations about the industry  marketing strategy auditbusiness missionsince it is a retail business therefore its business mission is sales and distribution oriented its market has flourished as more competitors enter into the market and the marketing environment gets more aggressive so its business mission according to its chairman mr david m weston is on becoming the  “top performer of first choice”                         although its business mission is sales and distribution oriented it reflects the market oriented theme because company gives top priority to customers’ satisfaction marketing objectivesthe main marketing objectives areto maximize market effectiveness by analyzing how company is performing in different areasto get a high roito provide customer satisfactionthese objectives are clearly defined to guide marketing and sales planning and performance because these objectives are upgraded quarterly half yearly and annually through different meetings like regional marketing conference operation conference and marketing conference by constantly working according to these objectives company avail benefits as much as it can from the opportunities and resources it gets marketing strategyits motto is“you can be sure of shell” ie the marketing strategy revolves around customers’ satisfaction and developing long term relationship with them by providing quick and satisfactory service without destroying and affecting their values its marketing strategy covers two basic aspects focus on quality products  focus on geographical distribution in those areas which are feasible for business also it focuses on economic profitability focus on quality productsshell is recognized with the highest quality products and is associated with reliability and performance at present the highestgrade lubricant on offer in pakistan is shell rimulax for high performance passenger diesel vehicles rimulad mainly for trucks  various transportation vehicles and rimulac for factory machines and fishing trawlers focus on geographical distributionshell is distinctively positioned as far as marketing in geographical distribution is concerned with an intense focus on the three main cities ie karachi lahore and islamabad and industrial centers in pakistan subsequently in other major cities in descending order in terms of geographical feasibility economic profitabilityas far as the economic profitability is concerned shell follows the approach of doing business in those areas that are economically suitable it focuses on the densely populated areas like karachi lahore  islamabad which provides better opportunities for economic profitability that’s why if we consider the nation wide market share it would be around  but in terms of economically feasible areas like karachi it would be around  budgetsit does not budget things with respect to products it budgets things to sales efforts as it is a sales oriented company it does not mean that it forgets about the customers but still the central core is ‘customers’ budgeting is zerobased in shell that is budget does not wholly depend on the previous year’s sales but as the needs arise changes are made right from the beginning that’s how it makes advertising and promotional budgets  marketing organization audit formal structure shell has a marketoriented structure which focuses around customerorientation for different segments of customers the sales and marketing activities are optimally structured along functional market and territory lines for example for each industry like pharmaceutical cement etc different sales person is assigned these sales persons are trained in a way that they can provide the individual industry with technical backup and specific and tailored approach of getting a particular oil product even in the retail business different sales persons are assigned for different retail outlet and distributors same strategy is applied for dealing with aviation and governmentshell has a flat structure and the chief marketing officer has an adequate authority over activities affecting customer satisfaction he can supervise various activities regarding customer satisfaction and building long term relationship with customers functional efficiencythe marketing staff is well trained supervised and may be motivated enough but still is evaluated frequently they are evaluated through their sales efforts ie how effectively they achieve their sales targets customer service people are evaluated by their efforts in handling activities regarding customer service and so onas far as communication between sales and marketing staff is concerned they do communicate effectively because they work as a team they believe in synergy ie by working as a team they could have achieved what they couldn’t if they worked individually interface efficiencymarketing staff not only has a sound working with sales staff but it also works well with manufacturing purchasing human resources and other non marketing areas in order to achieve organizational goalsin shell marketing and sales department line managers are fully responsible for the decisions they make they have almost full authority over other functional areas as the primary function of shell is that of an oilmarketing firm so we can conclude that marketing and sales have dominance over other functional areas marketing system audit marketing information systemthere is an internal division reserved for marketing research and intelligence in shell this division is responsible for providing the updated information about the research work and also to find out the competitors existing strategies as well as their future strategies about the market besides this every sales person has a responsibility of getting a little bit of the knowledge about the market conducts especially competitors’ strategies during his or her work this further supplements the internal division to analyze the market more effectively because sales person has a better idea about the current market demand behavior of the customers and what are the reactions of their competitors in response to their sales the company decisionmakers thoroughly analyze this relevant information on the basis of which they design to their day to day decisions and plan their future course of action in response to the competitor’s moves and strategies marketing planing systemthe company prepares annual longterm and strategic plans which are harmonized with shortterm and tactical plans they have designated the responsibilities for determining the company’s future courses of action but the major chunk of such work falls under two planning sections or departments one works under fiscal or finance department and the other one works under marketing department annual budgets business planning and other planning regarding finance are made by the fiscal planning section while marketing planning section makes the marketing plans concerning the future marketing strategies marketing investment strategies etc marketing control systemshell has more than often been able to outrun the objectives and target set by itself due to an ever increase in the consumption of petroleum products and also due to its aggressive marketing strategies as people are becoming more knowledgeable about the maintenance of their vehicles the demand for shell’s lubricants has also jumped rapidly higher through annual marketing conference and regional marketing conference it analyzes various aspects of marketing to make sure that the targets are met they have maintained a very healthy competition amongst their distributors by keeping the competition not only they have dispelled any notion of malpractice by the distributors but have also harmonized the goals of shell and its distributors new product developmentbefore introducing any new product first of all different ideas about the new product are developed according to the demand and different markets of customers competing products and their prices suppliers distribution and other factors then these ideas are processed through screening for picking up the feasible ones and dropping the poor ones then a feasibility plan is prepared ahead of time to find out whether it will be economically good to introduce this new product in a particular segment then they check out the strategies of competitors and so on                        marketing productivituy audit profitabilityat shell profitability is measured in terms of market share as it major rival is pso which has its services spread in almost throughout the country its business shows a sound profitability in terms market share as well as net income after taxes there are different markets like karachi lahore islamabad etc in which profitability is being measured by considering the contribution margin of particular city or market shell is also working on expanding as they are locked in competition with pso keeping this mind they have recently expanded the network of theirs to remote areas of nwfp and balochistan the consequences of such expansion would be thoroughly analyzed by the competitors and would be taken seriously because they don’t want to lose their market share cost effectivenessas shell is in the process of revival and expansion costs incurred due to these are quiet high during the year  the capital expenditure was rs  million still shell has been commendable in keeping its costs effectively lower than the competitors but the costs marketing activities are higher than the rest as it is looking forward to expanding to all parts of the country for example cost on promotion and advertising are very high which can be reduced by effective negotiations and developing better and longterm relationship with the concerned people and agencies shell has always made sure to maintaining consistently high quality products while incurring lower overall costs than pso and caltex so people at shell know the knack of tackling the problem of increasing costs without compromising on the product quality and its perceived value to insure and maintain high standards of customer services a dedicated department continuously trains dealers and their staff besides this shell choose the best suppliers and dealers in order to get best quality and negotiate with them in a way that both agree on terms and conditions which are feasible for them in terms of cost and profitability marketing functional audit  productthe company has developed sound product line objectives its objective is to provide customers a premium product it has a variety of productline some of the products cover the petrol engines some of them cover diesel engines some are specialty products while

very well in the market and there is no need to phase out any product right now but as the need arises it should be done as far as adding up a new product is concerned company is periodically analyze the market and if there is any need of certain kind of product it should add as it is planning to launch a new two stroke motorcycle engine oil company is benefited comprehensively through the production and sale of these products as they satisfies the customers’ perceived values in terms of quality and priceperformances of the abovementioned products in terms of customer satisfaction and profitability have been a lot more than satisfactory due to this there are no plans to induct any new product in their product line to keep a constant look out for the need of introducing new products the market analysis is done on a periodical basis pricethe pricing objective is to promote a strong company image and circulate to maximize profit in minimum possible time shell has usually used a skimming pricing strategy they introduce their products at relatively high prices still their products are demanded immensely by people for their quality in the beginning shell set its price according to the demand and the cost it incur but with the passage of time competitors followed the same course of action and that’s why the current situation is the same for every company as the pricing strategies are same distributioncontractual vms and shell uses intensive distributionreasons for contractual vms  mkt considerationthere is a huge target markethuge number of potential customerswidespread geographic concentrationhuge order sizethe distribution objectives and strategies consist of providing good quality products to the customers at the right time and at the right place through effective distribution channels to match their perceived values about the products to revive the company’s image shell actively sponsors major events such as cricket matches and autocross rallies it has now developed adequate market coverage and providing a huge market service through out the countryto be more competent and hold the major share of the market shell is

at car washes and lube bays and convenience stores products and services such as atms phones and faxes shell has cordial and helpful attendants the latest service of shell gene has really added a differential advantage which shows their adaptive attitude towards the upcoming technologies shell gene saves the hassle and time for an oil change  advertisementsales promotion  publicityfor advertisement sales promotion and publicity people at shell put there at most efforts to achieve the objective of creating a preferred place in customer’s mind today’s market is flourished with too much influx of different kinds of products so it is difficult for every company to hold the market without being followed by aggressive strategies and objectives shell follows the same track and sets its promotion objectives keeping in mind that customers are the main factor for adapting aggressive marketing besides the rapidly growing automobile industry could probably one of the reasons of following these strategiesbudget for advertisement and promotional activities is sufficient enough because this budget is being prepared as the need arises the company sets this budget according to the advertisement and sponsors of the promotional activityadvertising messages and media are well developed and received by the customers as we can see in the ad of shell helix it rightly justifies the fact about the product when it says “the energy in action” this message contains the theme of reliability quality and strength of the product when it shows that the same motor oil is used for formula racing cars all of these ads are contained with precise and well developed theme which can easily portrait the shell’s imagedifferent promotional programs are designed for the purpose the details of which are as follows  autocross car race championshipshell has a long history of sponsoring exciting auto races autocross racing is considered as one of the safest forms racing participated by drivers with diverse skills even drivers with everyday use cars passing am shell technical  safety inspection can qualify for the raceshell formula autocross race was held on october   at clifton  karachi shell along with agha motors successfully organized the event which one of its kind that was an exciting and thrilling event that helped in promoting the car racing sports in pakistan and shell is proudly sponsored the event which was a continuing tradition of seven yearsrecently another autocross championship called “am shell trithlon” was jointly organized by shell and agha motors which was held on april  and   this am shell triathlon features three different types of racing autocross solo ii  drag racingapril  and solo i hispeed autocross april  these races were held at the following places autocross solo ii near playland clifton drag racing at wateji in malir distt and solo i hispeed autocross at am speedway near gharo these events clearly shows shell’s keen interest in the promotion of sports activities in pakistan which in turn helpful in promoting its own name brand and image scrabble tournamentin the continuous spirit of promoting different types of sports and games in pakistan shell moved another step ahead the latest one was sponsoring of the th inter firm scrabble tournament held at local hotel on february     this was yet another step by shell to grab the attention of the people and to get an appreciable place in the eyes of its customers some other promotional activities at shell various kinds of sales promotion activities has been successfully done by the sales promotion group at shell the major ones are joint promotion activities with the other well reputed companies in the region the aim of doing joint promotion is to get high quality soughtafter products as promotional items for its customers some of the programs that have been organized are given below discounted car service promotionthis was conducted at star service center jail road  lahore from may  to june  it had the dual aim of increasing the sales and introducing the car service facility to new customers it was also meant to generate activity at that site which is facing a lot of competition the customers fillingup  liters or more were given a discount service card and they were asked to fillup  liters within a month to be entitled to car service for rs only these cards were issued during the promotion period of approximately  weeksthis was an innovative scheme and it was successful in generating sales the discount service card had the name address and telephone no section which the customers were asked to fillup on redemption the data from the cards received so far ahs been noted for setting up lahore customers data base  customer serviceunder this a help line is being set to provide even better service to the customers the basic purpose of this help line is not only to provide knowledge about the various lines of products but to assist customers in finding the day to day problems regarding their car engine during the previous year people at the customer service received approximately  to  calls and provided guidance to their customers the customers’ response regarding this service is marvelous and people are appreciating this effort made by shell because they are getting valuable tips and knowledge about the problems of their cars salesforcethe salesforce possesses the required skills needed for effective marketing and competitive advantage they are chosen on their abilities to capture the market in the best possible wayas mentioned in one of the previous sections country is divided into two geographic regions ie northern and southern region so as the sales force further within these regions it divided according to industrial sector distribution sector and retail sector sales force objectives comprises the same marketing objectives like to provide industry distributors and retailers the best possible quality products on the right time to avoid the gap between demand and supply of its productsas far as the size of the salesforce is concerned it consists of a large number they are too many people currently working in shell but besides such a large force they are properly organized welltrained executives who are responsible for inducing motivation in them supervise themsalesforce can be rated in a high rank as compared to competitors’ for example consider the case of pso where sales force is not as much efficient as it should be the main reason could be that it is a state own company and has a bad management for the same reason and some other government is now privatizing it as far as shell’s sales force is concerned they are also highly well trained and supervised enough to effectively compete with shell and other companies conclusionthis marketing audit report is proved to be a better approach of strategic control it is also helpful in finding analyzing and evaluating different opportunities threats faced by the companythe over all performance in the field of marketing shell oils pakistan limited is within the limits of industry norms but there are some places where improvements have to be made in order to outperform competitors and hold the marketas far as the macroenvironment is concerned demographic wise there are some threats of over populations because of diversification of tastes in the diversified population shell’s position in petroleum industry is strong in the sense that it categorically fulfilling the needs of the diversified customers in order to hold its markets superiority over its competitorsaccording to economical natural technological political and cultural environments shell managing these environments in a way to cope with the structured and unstructured problems so as minimize the risk of being followers the core of its marketing objectives is of course customer satisfaction while keeping in mind the consequences of not managing these environments accordinglytask environment plays a very important role in setting marketing objectives at shell there are only two main rivals in the petroleum industry for shell but with the increased industrialization in pakistan more and more foreign petroleum companies are interested in opening venture in pakistan some of them are mobil corporation british petroleum petromen oils these companies are just the new comers in pakistani industry but with the passage of time posing some great threats to the industry giantsshell strictly follows its marketing objective strategies because this is the only way to acquire competitive advantage over competitors if it couldn’t do this it would have cost more than what they would get now in terms of profitability efficiency market effectiveness and economyas people at shell are well and highly trained and educated they know how to communicate with customers as well as with their colleagues effectivelyas far as marketing system is concerned shell fetching the maximum advantage of the research materials available to them after thoroughly analyzing these information planning and control system would seems to be rather easyin terms of profitability and cost effectiveness we can say that shell leads the market if not individually but some how with one of the competitors shell couldn’t get this at the expense of its customers but mainly at the expense of competitors which is the right way this would help shell to build brand equity and loyaltymarketing function is doing very well at shell as we have seen in the previous section that it has a well reputed product line customer perceived competitive prices a well organized and equipped distribution system within the city and throughout the country well received advertising media and promotional activities and of course the very best of the salesforce who are devoted towards achieving what company wanted to achieve recommendationbased on the analysis of this marketing audit report i would prefer to put forward some of my recommendation for improving some of its weak points they are as follows shell’s city wise market share is pretty good as compared to its competitors but it must improve its nation wide market share as well it is satisfied with it for the time being but with growing market potential rapid industrialization and entrance of new aggressive entrants would damage the existing  market share nation wide although rural areas are not economical feasible for shell because of its size as compared to shell it must gradually pay attention to easy access to those areas keeping in mind the cost factorit must increase its retail outlets in the city keeping the current market effectiveness factor because competitors are also working out on the same strategiescurrently government is planning to privatize pso shell and some of the other petroleum companies are interested in giving bids for this deal but what i think that it must go for this bidding to get the major share in the company as it is alarming for it that new entrants are showing their keen interest in this bidding to stand aside would cost shell to lose its market share considerablyit must sponsor some of the music shows like vj on ntm vcd on ptv also they should sponsor road shows like on star tv this would considerably increase its name brand and
