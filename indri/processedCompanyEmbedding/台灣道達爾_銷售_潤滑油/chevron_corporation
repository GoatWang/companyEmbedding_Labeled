since that time the arbitration hearing was repeatedly suspended while the parties negotiate with an unknown prospective buyer no agreement has been reached with the potential buyer cobasyss patents relating to nimh batteries expired in  in plugin hybrids the cars that will recharge america published in february  sherry boschert argues that largeformat nimh batteries are commercially viable but that cobasys refuses to sell or license them to small companies or individuals boschert argues that cobasys accepts only very large orders for these batteries when boschert conducted her research major auto makers showed little interest in large orders for largeformat nimh batteries however toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format nimh batteries to service the existing  ravevs because no other companies were willing to make large orders cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format nimh battery technology for automotive purposes boschert concludes that its possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or its possible that cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plugin hybrids or electric vehicles in an interview with the economist ovshinsky subscribed to the former view i think we at ecd we made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company frankly speaking and i think it’s not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business rather than building the business in december  cobasys and general motors announced that they had signed a contract under which cobasys provides

its possible that cobasys chevron is squelching all access to large nimh batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline or its possible that cobasys

exploded on january   while drilling an exploration well for chevron in the funiwa field in nigeria the explosion resulted in the death of two of the  workers on board and a fire that burned for  days before the well was sealed on june  according to a reuters news report workers on the ks endeavor were ignored by chevron when they requested evacuation due to concerns of increasing smoke billowing

chevron told them to continue with drilling expecting an explosion the rig manager one of the two that later died kept the lifeboats at hand and ready for use a witness reported this is the reason so

chevron has experienced protests aimed at the company by local communities in southern poland when they started gas exploration in the region their complaint is that chevron didnt provide all of the documents required for gas exploration in poland and that the company has not promised to share a percentage of the revenues with the local landholders the landholders of the region view chevrons presence in the region negatively since they may be forced to sell their properties at a low cost if gas is discovered in the region as well potential environmental disasters are a concern for local farmers another of the residents primary concern is water pollution from the chemicals used in fracking in response to some of the protests chevron has sued some of the protesters from żurawlów for disrupting their operations according to gas and oil expert andrzej szczesniak one of the main reasons for the protest is the difference between polish and american law in the usa property owners typically receive  from the income of gas exploration in poland the discovery of gas on private property usually results in a forced sale of the property with the owner receiving only the prior value of the land and no percentage of the gas revenue this is the result of outdated communist era laws that are still on the books and which are often exploited by municipal governments if they can get a
