announces unaudited results for the six months ended  june    financial highlights   ·      has been and continues to be challenging but the company does not expect short term issues to impact  expectations   ·     the ramp up of key projects has been slower than expected  in the uk the company continues to face and react to oil price volatility and difficult market conditions   ·     total revenue and other income of us million h  us million includes business interruption income of us million from the canton insurance settlement but limited revenues from the plant as rampup is ongoing it is also impacted by lost production during relocation of operations in australia whilst revenues in the uk are adversely impacted as a result of the lower price of oil   ·     total sales volumes increased to  million litres h   million litres with the acquisition of the business and assets of eco oil limited ecooil in april     ·     gross profit of us million h   us million reflects limited revenues from the canton facility lost production in australia and the adverse impact of the lower price of oil in the uk   ·     operating ebitda loss of us million h  us million profit reflecting production delays in the us the costs associated with relocation of operations in australia and the effects of the decline in the price of oil and changing market conditions on margins in the uk recycling business   ·     overall loss for the period of us million h  us million included transaction costs and oneoff restructuring costs incurred in relation to the integration of the ecooil business the recommissioning of the rebuilt and expanded plant in canton and the relocation of australian operations    ebitda adjusted for growth expenditure of us million h  us million including acquisition costs of usm and restructuring costs of us million h  usnil   operational and strategic highlights   ·     the rebuilt and expanded facility in canton ohio was fully installed largely as expected but has experienced performance issues with plant and contractors slowing ramp up of production the pace and continuing execution of the canton rampup is the key performance imperative  at the time of this announcement four trains out of six are in production at a reduced rate producing approximately  litres of superfinetm base oil per day the previously announced issues with heat exchangers have been resolved repaired units are now fitted to four trains plans are in place to bring trains  and  into production and we expect to switch production to transformer oil shortly the business benefits from secure feedstock supply and ample stock we have now revised our production projections for canton for the year to  million litres assuming building to full production during october   ·     the acquisition of the business and assets of ecooil has consolidated feedstock collection for the proposed lubricant oil rerefinery in the uk a full restructure of the consolidated uk recycling business is nearing completion with an approximate  reduction in headcount as well as site consolidation benefits expected to generate annualised synergies of cus million    ·     the company has entered into an agreement for lease with the manchester ship canal company limited a member of the peel ports group for the proposed long term lease of a nine acre site near eastham locks port wirral merseyside in north west england for the first phase development of a used oil rerefinery in the uk  the company continues to ensure that it delivers on all aspects of the consultation and engagement process required by the nsip regime to work on the design and value engineering of the project and to develop the planning submission for the proposed rerefinery to be submitted later this year   ·     commenced tolling under the outsourcing arrangement with southern oil in australia product achieving hr oil status with encouraging market response   market outlook   ·      in the us despite slower than expected ramp up to full production we remain confident that the rebuilt and expanded plant has a unique market proposition and is well placed in  to leverage the production of the highest quality transformer oil produced in the us meeting all us and international standards   ·      in the uk lower oil prices have created a significant market dislocation in supply and demand for used oil and used oil products hydrodec uk has responded and continues to react to and operate in a tough trading environment with a second phase of restructuring underway the security of feedstock supply delivered by the combined business underpins the rationale and longer term strategy for a uk rerefinery where base oil margins are less volatile and continue to trade at a significant premium to fuel oil commenting on the results ian smale chief executive of hydrodec said we remain focused on managing the resources of the company and on delivering the comprehensive six point plan set out at this years annual general meeting against a backdrop of very difficult underlying market conditions and performance issues with plant and contractors in key projects  we remain confident that the key elements of our comprehensive strategy are in place and believe that the delivery of this strategy and plan will drive the company to profitability   the company also announces today that gillian

mcmahon     notes to editors hydrodecs technology is a proven highly efficient oil rerefining and chemical process initially targeted at the multibillion us market for transformer oil used by the worlds electricity industry spent oil is currently processed at two commercial plants with distinct competitive advantage delivered through very high recoveries near  producing as new high quality oils at competitive cost and without environmentally harmful emissions the process also completely eliminates pcbs a toxic additive banned under international regulations hydrodecs plants are located at canton ohio us and young new south wales australia  in  hydrodec acquired the business and assets of oss group the uks largest collector consolidator and processor of used lubricant oil and seller of processed fuel oil with a national network of oil storage and transfer stations used oil is converted into processed fuel oil at osss plant at stourport and principally sold on to the uk quarry and power industry in april  hydrodec further acquired the business and assets of eco oil a leading uk waste oil collector and supplier of recycled industrial fuel oil into the power and road stone industries it is also one of four significant providers of waste management services to the marine industry in the uk specifically oilywater slops or marine pollutant marpol  in line with our stated intention to develop a base oil rerefinery in the uk we have an exclusive licence agreement with californiabased chemical engineering partners cep to develop the cep wipedfilm evaporation and

exchange for further information please visit wwwhydrodeccom   chief executives report   operations   at the companys annual general meeting on  june  we set out a clear focused and comprehensive six point plan to drive the company to profitability the first half of  has been challenging but has delivered progress in terms of the companys strategic plan despite a backdrop of difficult underlying market conditions as well as performance issues with contractors and equipment in key projects   the interim results reflect the recommissioning of the rebuilt and expanded plant in canton and the relocation of australian operations as well as the impact of lower oil prices disproportionately affecting the uk collections business in addition they reflect the transaction costs and oneoff restructuring costs incurred in relation to the integration of the ecooil business without the benefit of cuts in growth and overhead costs which arise in the second half of the year   in the united states we have commissioned the rebuilt and expanded facility in canton ohio including the necessary remedial action on plant and equipment that slowed production rampup over the summer we have achieved design specification production from individual processing trains and remain confident that noted efficiency improvements will be attainable with full production from the plant in due course  at the time of this announcement four trains out of six are in production at a reduced rate producing approximately  litres of superfinetm base oil per day  previously announced issues with heat exchangers have been resolved with repaired units now fitted to four trains which will allow us to plan for trains  and  to be in production we expect to switch production to transformer oil shortly given the delay to the ramp up of trains  to  and based on revised internal forecasts we have now revised our production projections for canton for the year to  million litres assuming building to full production during october   in australia tolling has commenced under the outsourcing arrangements with southern oil with all transition and residual operating cost savings now delivered our product has achieved hr oil status certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and efforts to further develop market penetration of our superfinetm product are underway we expect the australian operation to be cash flow positive by the year end supported by better margin structures compensating for some lost production during transition   in the uk our objective remains to deploy world leading technology that delivers a european hub for rerefining producing high quality new oils from used oils for use in their original purpose we have consolidated feedstock collection for the proposed lubricant rerefinery through the acquisition of the business and assets of ecooil and are realising significant efficiencies through the transition of the oss and ecooil businesses under a combined hydrodec uk operating structure and brand revenue scale and efficiency savings are estimated to deliver approximately us million of benefit on an annualised basis significantly the reduced oil price has changed the character of the uk waste oil market from oil as an opportunity value proposition to a liability cost for workshops and operators  in the short term however this pricing lag both compresses margins and reduces oil available for collection  an additional market feature is a reduction in demand for pfo with the decline in uk coalfired power generation pushing markets increasingly into europe a number of steps to mitigate both pricing lag and market structure are underway as hydrodec uk continues to respond and operate in a tough trading environment   overall the companys priorities remain clear and the board remains confident that our focused and comprehensive six point plan will deliver value for shareholders delivering the rebuild and expansion of our us market position through our canton rerefinery embedding the outsourcing relationship with southern oil in australia delivering the leading oil and associated waste management business in the uk securing the technology platform of the company through patents and partnership with key technology providers under the guidance of the safety and technology board committee building out into the large lubricant oil rerefining market to be value accretive to hydrodec shareholders and growth through technology derisking expansion through partnership collaboration or integration along the value chain the key elements of this comprehensive strategy are in place the board and management all believe that delivery of this strategy and plan will drive the company to profitability   ian smale chief executive     chief financial officers review   the following provides a review of hydrodecs results for the  months ended  june   the half year results include additional costs related to the acquisition and consolidation of ecooils assets in the uk as well as recommissioning costs in both the us and australia  the impact of the restructuring charges incurred in h  will further reduce direct and overhead costs in h    overview   in the period the group sold  million litres of oil an increase of  on the previous year driven by the acquisition of the ecooil business at the start of q total income declined  as business interruption income ceased on st march and average selling price asp declined as a result of the fall in world oil prices   the focus for h is the continued ramp up to full production in the us of the expanded six train facility at canton and to complete the consolidation of the uk recycling business to build a sustainably profitable business despite lower oil prices   rerefining    months  months  change   jun jun   volume  litres    asp per litre uslitre    revenue us    ebitda pre oneoff costs      whilst the us plant remained under construction for the first half of the year oil sales were restricted in that region to traded oil  million litres which was lower compared to the prior year as the business focus moved to recommissioning the plant  in australia the business traded oil to maintain supply to key customers while the operations were transferred to the southern oil refinery however because of extended commissioning there was some sales disruption to the business during the transition resulting in a decline in volumes of    recycling    months  months  change   jun jun   volume    asp per litre    revenue    ebitda pre oneoff costs      overall volumes increased due to the acquisition of ecooil on  april   on a like for like basis volumes declined by  due to the focus on higher margin business and the impact of the decline in oil prices on the collection cycle at the end of  as suppliers retained their feedstock on the expectation of a price recovery through q the uk recycling business has suffered further margin compression

announcement this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain   chief executives report   after a particularly difficult  for the company i am pleased to be able to report significant progress in delivering the companys key objectives during the period under review achieved against a challenging yet improving market backdrop   strategy   at the time of my appointment as ceo and the divestment of the uk recycling operations in march  the board restated its strategy to concentrate on the groups market leading transformer oil rerefining technology and business and to grow that business to access an increasing proportion of the us billion plus global transformer oil market specifically the board stated its intention as the company moves forward through  to look to strengthen hydrodecs footprint in the us and in the international transformer oil market where the board believes hydrodec has a competitive advantage through its proven and market‐leading technology   in line with this strategy my focus has been to grow the transformer oil business in order to drive profitability with a rigorous focus on execution when deploying our market leading transformer oil rerefining technology making effective costs savings and delivering the rampup of production and sales in the us   continuing business  rerefining   summary      months  months  change   jun jun   volume  litres    revenue us    operating ebitda pre oneoff costs       includes traded oil  million litres pending recommissioning of canton plant   operational review         usa   the main drivers in  have been to refocus on the core transformer oil rerefining technology by optimising the performance of the canton facility and to increase production levels through a combination of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with specific targeted operating improvements building on lessons learned during the commissioning process these improvements have been validated by the significantly lower number of production hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly production performance of the plant in may of  million litres of superfine transformer oil and base oil  plant utilisation increased over the period from an average of  in q to  in q with a peak of  in may and has averaged  through q to date   these developments have supported total sales volumes in canton in the period of  million litres an additional primary objective relates to improving the sales mix between higher margin transformer oil and lower margin base oil produced at the canton plant at the beginning of the year january transformer oil sales represented  of us volumes sold since then significant improvements have been made in this area and in june transformer oil represented  of sales with further advances targeted growth in transformer oil sales have been supported by the superfine product achieving  hour oil status certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and a prerequisite to accessing the larger power transformer market   post periodend in september we announced that the american carbon registry acr had approved hydrodecs patented technology as a carbon offset project in the voluntary carbon offset market allowing the company to generate and monetise carbon credits  hydrodec of north america hona is now generating offsets through the rerefining of used transformer oil which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner the acr has recognised  credits for honas previous production between  and  and the company anticipates that it will generate  to  tons of carbon offset annually going forward whilst the historical credits may only generate nominal sums through trading the ongoing generation of such credits could realise up to us per ton source carbonomics         australia   in respect of the operations in australia since the commissioning of the plant at the southern oil refinery in may  we have had to work hard to reestablish our commercial position in the market total sales volumes in australia for the period were  million  in may the australian business enjoyed one of its highest feedstock acquisition months since  and since then has consistently sourced feedstock at an optimal level to maximise its profitability going forward  the focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the proportion of transformer oil sales    post periodend in august we announced the award of a  year contract to supply superfine transformer oil to essential energy a major australian utility  the contract includes the collection and rerefining of all their pcb and nonpcb waste oils and is expected to generate over  million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract the contract was awarded under a competitive tender process with the company successfully competing against a range of new oil suppliers          market background   in the us leading producers of naphthenic speciality products of which hydrodec is one have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the first quarter crude price fall whilst the group has been successful in improving margins since the first quarter the board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into  driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices    in australia market demand and margin remain relatively stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the essential energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key utilities     financial review   revenues from continuing operations increased  to us million h  us million reflecting the full commissioning of the canton plant at the end of last year  the group sold  million litres during the period an increase of  on the corresponding period in  which had included  million litres of traded oil whilst the us business was being recommissioned of the volumes sold in the period  represented transformer oil and  was base oil with margins steadily improving since the beginning of the year   there has been a key focus on the reduction of overheads and corporate costs significant reductions have already been realised with the expectation that the benefits from more recently implemented initiatives will filter through in h  these savings are reflected in the reduction in administrative expenses from continuing operations from us million to us million as highlighted below       six months ended six months ended        june   june        usd usd  change indirect operating costs      corporate costs      depreciation and amortisation  overheads      administrative expenses      group ebitda from continuing operations improved from us million loss h  to us million loss  the total loss for the period including discontinued operations was us million h  us million  operating cash outflow before working capital movements reduced to us million h  us million  the improved ebitda performance resulted in lower working capital outflows which reduced from  million to  million total net cash expended in the first six months of  was us million compared to a us million outflow in the prior year comparable period overall the group held us million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period and retained approximately us million headroom under its working capital facilities provided by andrew black a director and the companys largest shareholder    disposal of uk recycling operations   in late  and january  the company undertook a detailed strategic review of its uk waste oil collections business and proposed uk lubricant oil rerefining project following a significant deterioration in its uk operations this deterioration was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and continued challenging market conditions which resulted in the uk business generating an increasing level of significant losses despite implementing extensive restructuring and costsaving measures during  hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline given the significant cash consumption and limited cash resources available to the company in the absence of a significant further fundraising the directors reviewed all available options and concluded that it was in the best interests of the company to dispose of the uk operations   following a strategic auction process conducted by an independent third party financial adviser the company sold its uk operations to andrew black a nonexecutive director and substantial shareholder the buyer on  march  for a consideration of £ in cash including the transfer to the buyer of c £ million of existing third party indebtedness in the uk business and involving the injection by the buyer of further working capital into that operation in addition the buyer granted hydrodec a contractual right to receive a proportion of the buyers entitlement to any future profits of the uk rerefining project on the following waterfall basis a first the buyer as primary risk taker to recover the costs of its investment in the uk rerefining project b then the next tranche to be applied  between hydrodec and the buyer respectively until hydrodec has recovered its costs incurred to date in connection with the uk rerefining project and c finally the balance of any profits to be shared  between the buyer and hydrodec the buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the uk lubricant oil rerefining project going forward with hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these profit share arrangements the uk rerefining project also offers a potential opportunity to develop transformer oil rerefining capacity in the uk the impact on the company of all of the above is described in note  to the interim financial statements   risk management process   the group has policies processes and systems in place to help identify evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisation risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by business unit or functional management teams the executive team review the major risks across the group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus the board review these at least twice a year   the principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on the group in the future are set out on pages  and  of the  annual report the continued successful operation of canton is the key performance imperative for the group  the annual report can be downloaded at wwwhydrodeccom    outlook   todays results confirm significant progress in the turnaround of the company over the first half of the year  our key objective during the rest of the year is to strengthen margins as we grow market share and seek to leverage the recent carbon credit approval in the us whilst continuing the program of cost reduction volumes and margins in q to date remain consistent with q and with both operations now generating positive ebitda we continue to make strong progress towards positive group ebitda in the second half of the year     chris ellis ceo
