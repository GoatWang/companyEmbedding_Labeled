industrial sector in india is dependent on the large extent on mining mining constitutes  –  of the total industrial sector the government plans to increase gdp by  –  and therefore development and growth of basic industries such as iron and steel cement aluminum copper etc have to be nurtured mining activities supporting these basic industries will therefore be in the government focus if gdp target of  annual growth is to be achieved in fact during  –  the new union governments first year in office mining activities showed a marginal growth of  as against  negative in  –  detonators and accessories the demand for explosives and accessories registered a contraction in volumes in  –  with the growth of the economy in general  mining in particular demand pattern is expected to grow steadily in all coal and metal sectors it is expected to grow around  over the next   years the products of the division will therefore grow year on year however there is expected to be a change in product–mix as high volume trade items have changed to higher end initiating systems such as non electrics electronic detonators due to the change in storage and licensing requirements for ammonium nitrate the division has also recorded healthy growth in export where the demand has increased especially in africa middle east and east european countries in the meantime with intense follow up from the industry the government of india has permitted export of explosives material from chennai port in addition to mumbai this will help to improve the flexibility of availing vessels and reduce handling as well as freight cost this will increase the competitiveness of exports the improvement in production process and quality systems in the hyderabad plant has helped to improve the demand for the products besides making them competitive as a result in the recent tenders from coal india limited the major consumer of explosives and initiating devices in the country the company has won large orders compared to the previous years the company is poised to grow steadily over the next few years on the basis of favourable decisions from tender driven psus such as coal india singareni collieries nmdc etc and large non–psu organizations supported by growth in export business special products for defence and space agencies along with sophisticated products such as the electronic detonator range would add to the business volumes of this division  mining and infrastructure the division which has had rich exposure in providing support services to the mining industry with services such as mine planning execution of mine plans overburden removal extraction of ore crushing and grading of ore etc should be able to grow and recover its former activities levels the government has already fast tracked various mining related regulatory issues a few actions are already visible but will take time to yield visible results the government has recently allotted  re–allotted coal blocks which were earlier cancelled by the supreme court most of these mines are expected to commence operations shortly giving ample opportunities for the division we expect the mine scenario in the country to grow at a healthy pace after nearly four years of downtrend the division is already tendering  quoting for projects over the last few months and should be able to finalise some of the projects during the year in preparation for infrastructure work which is also in the government focus the division has started taking elevated road bitumen roads and other building projects in order to qualify for larger projects  realty in bangalore with the completion of the first building and multi–level car park of  lakhs sqft the nd building of another  lakhs sqft has been started the elevated approach road to the  buildings is also in place marketing of the space in the first building will be completed in the coming year major initiatives for the economic development of the state announced by the new telangana state government such as industry specific clusters for it foundry solar energy cinema city aiims etc is expected to increase the demand for realty space in hyderabad planning work relating to the project is being modified anticipating the emerging demand pattern and approvals are being sought on sector–wise basis based on an assessment and feedback on current market needs detailing for phase  of  lakh sft which will mainly be a residential development alongwith neighbourhood shopping is being readied for statutory approvals  risks  concerns and risk management pursuant to the companies act  and clause  of the listing agreement the board has authorized the audit committee to review the risk management plan of the company from time to time the executive management identifies evaluates business risks from time to time and furnishes the same to the audit committee along with risk mitigation plan the audit committee reviews and renders advice for minimizing adverse impact if any the key business risks identified by the company and its mitigation plans are as under  environmental risks regular safety audits are carried out by internal safety audit teams and at regular intervals by external teams general safety directions gsds are strictly enforced in all factories and plants within the factories to ensure minimisation of risk in addition strict compliance of the requirements of the explosives act and rules are ensured to protect the exposure of adjacent neighbourhoods to the explosives and accessories factories from undue risk operations are carried out to comply with emission waste water and waste disposal norms of the local authorities of the respective factories in addition the hyderabad factory has implemented the integrated management system incorporating iso  and ohsas   operational risk the energetics division operates in a highly regulated and licensed industry environment and amendment  revision in licenses are required based on expiry of the licenses and change in production capacity and process amended  revised licenses for increase in license capacity for any of the explosives products may get delayed temporarily or for long periods thereby limiting our ability to cater to any increase in demand for these products from our customers non–availability of licenses  approvals for expansion of new products could affect our future growth and expansion plans the division therefore ensures that approvals are applied for well in advance to avoid launch dates  export of products and active follow up is maintained to get approvals in time location risks manufacturing facilities of our major subsidiary are spread across six states the optimum locations for packed explosives unit is determined by the customer location and the source of raw material the advantage of the location of bulk explosives units is optimized to be close to the customer location with changes in sources of raw material our location may not continue to be optimal in comparison with the competition moreover if there is a consolidation in the industry and the size of each manufacturing units go up we may be disadvantaged by being sub–optimal raw materials many of the inputs of the company and its major subsidiary are imported availability of which is affected by global market situations also prices of such items are volatile timely availability of raw materials is critical for continuous plant operations the company seeks to mitigate the risk by entering into long–term relationship with global raw material suppliers with suitable escalation clauses to ensure regular supplies with crude oil prices showing an uptrend after an unexpected fall during the last six months or so the raw material prices and input costs are expected to increase the company seeks to mitigate the risk by entering into long–term relationship with global raw material suppliers with suitable escalation clauses to ensure regular supplies  market risks markets the company and its major subsidiary operate in highly competitive markets where competition from all india players as well as regional players is high the energetics division which manufactures explosive accessories and the mining and infrastructure division operate in tender–driven markets sometimes with onerous and unreasonable performance clauses therefore there is a risk of cost increases not possible to be passed on to ultimate consumers any reversal in growth trend in the economy in general and weak monsoons in particular could affect demand and consequent deceleration in manufacturing industry concentration of customers the mining and infrastructure division which currently undertakes mining services in coal iron ore and limestone sectors is exposed to business risks on account of non–availability of environmental clearances in time and lack of adequate infrastructure for dispatch of ores from the mine especially during the rainy seasons in view of this detailed review of approvals and quality of infrastructure is carried out before undertaking mining service contracts both the energetics and mining  infrastructure divisions are operating in the mining and infrastructure sectors dominated by the psus where the tendering system is in vogue with the attendant risks missing l to l status in these tenders might result in loss of business opportunities for extended periods for the relevant tenders  financial risks currency value and interest rate fluctuations financial risk management is done by the finance department at the various business divisions and at corporate office under policies approved by the board of directors policies for overall foreign exchange loss risks and liquidity are regularly reviewed based on emerging trends interests risks arising out of financial debt are normally done at fixed rates or linked to libor and appropriate bank lending rates adverse movement of rupee from current levels may further impact base oil and ammonium nitrate rates credit risk the company and its major subsidiary sometimes sell its products by extending credit to customers with the attendant risk of payment delays and defaults to mitigate the risk a credit risk policy is also in place to ensure that sale of products are made to customers after evaluation of their ability to meet financial commitments through allotment of specific credit limits to respective customers credit availability and exposure is another area of riskliquidity risk the company and its major subsidiary operate in working capital intensive industries the company realizes that its ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and others is linked to timely and regular collection of receivables and maintaining a healthy credit rating review of working capital constituents like inventory of raw materials finished goods and receivables are done regularly by the respective divisions and closely monitored by corporate finance  legal and statutory risks contractual liability all major contracts are reviewed  vetted by the in–house legal department before the same are executed in addition the company engages the services of reputed independent legal counsels on need basis in matters of tax law and other statutory obligations the outcome of litigation cannot always be predicted hence appropriate financial provisions insurance policies and credit lines are taken to limit the risk for the company litigation risks the company is exposed to the risk of litigation of prolonged nature apart from the tax matters referred to in the financial statements litigations having a major impact on the company include those with udasin mutt pertaining to leased lands of hyderabad works competition commission of india which are being pursued by the company with the appropriate court tribunal  it risks the company is dependent on intra–office and inter–office networks as well as several business software operated from the corporate office and the business divisions failure of system networks and consequential loss of business is attempted to be minimised by critical systems being operated on secured servers with regular maintenance regular back up and off–site storage of data selection of suitable firewall and virus protection systems  software  other risks various assets of the company including plant and machinery stocks buildings furniture office equipment and computer systems could suffer damages  loss owing to occurrences like fire accidental mishaps etc the company has taken insurance covers to protect these assets from possible damage  loss while the company undertakes regular review of remuneration structures threat of poaching by competitors especially new entrants in the industry of key persons is possible such actions could lead to temporary drop in efficiency and performance in the specific areas  directors during the year mrsanjay g hinduja ceased to be
