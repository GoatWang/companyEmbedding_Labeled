graphsolve from scomi oiltools for field deployment in myanmar graphsolve a nanoenhanced bioremediation solution for the treatment of drill cuttings offers a unique solution of enabling onsite treatment of drill cuttings waste replacing the costly need to transport and treat the same at offsite treatment facilities drill cuttings are heavily oil contaminated wastes generated during a well drilling process which need to be treated prior to disposal to comply with the environmental regulations for treatment of drilling wastes an oil drilling process generates between mt to mt cuttings per well and the conventional method of treatment has been to collect and transport the cuttings to offsite incineration facilities incurring expensive haulage and treatment costs the dual chemistry function of graphsolve effectively reduces the oil content in the cuttings to less than  to meet the environmental regulations for onsite disposal and enhances the biodegradation process to within    weeks providing significant cost savings to operators and an improved carbon footprint as compared to transportation and treatment of cuttings at offsite facilities depending on the concentration of oil in the drill cuttings graphsolve is expected to reduce treatment costs by us to us per mt of cuttings the first order of graphsolve was made following successful testing and full lab trial by scomi global research and technology centre in accordance with the rigorous standard and testing protocols set by the end customer a leading national oil company in the region end customer in its
