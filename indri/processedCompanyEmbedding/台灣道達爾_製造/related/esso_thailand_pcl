thailands management will be with us today dr adisak jangkamolkulchai director and refinery manager khun chai jangsirikul director and controller khun ratrimani pasiphol director and treasurer and lets start the presentationstart with the industry and business environment third quarter oil price was impacted by global economy concerns towards brexit as well as growing product surplus across the regionwith that everincreasing base september dubai crude price went down to  per barrel which was  lower than the average price in june given the current product the price continued in the third quarter industry gross refining margin remain weak at  per barrel which was increased slightly compared to the previous reviewparaxylene is still in the downcycle and its price decreased slightly from the previous quarter industrial demand for fuel product remained strong with the yeartodate diesel and gasoline growth at  and  respectivelygovernment expenditure and tourism continue to play important roles in driving moderate stronger growth in thailand the thailand economy economic planning agency projected gdp growth for  to be a  to so lets move to our third quarter headline result on page  the first key highlight in the third quarter starts with we complete the plant shut down for maintenance in the period of  days from august  the result came out very success with all targets met as planned and budget we achieved yeartodate earning of thb billion this result included the third quarter  loss of thb billion reflecting refinery maintenance activities and stock loss impactwe still demonstrate our solid performance in which yeartodate cash generated from operations of thb billion on the marketing program esso smiles loyalty card has continued to be well accepted by the customers there were more than  members who signed up for our card as of september lets move into more detail on page the chart on the top left corner shows the third quarter industry gross refining margin was at  per barrel which is slightly higher than the second quarter  but  lower than the same period last year the decrease from last year was driven mainly by the weaker fuel priceon the product spread at the top right chart ugp spread was down to  per barrel in the third quarter lower than the second quarter at  per barrel and the third quarter last year at  per barrel remaining under pressure from the surplus volume ado spread was  per barrel slightly lower than the second quarter from that monsoon season impact and still in a downward trend when compared to the same period last yearread more third quarter crude intake in the chart at the bottom right show the results impact form planned refinery maintenance which could run at kbd which was kbd lower than the second quarter and less lowered at kbd when compared to the third quarter last year because normally the third quarter demand is lower due to the rainy seasonthe bottom left chart show our gross refining margin the third quarter gross refining margin fell to  per barrel versus  per barrel in the second quarter the decrease from the second quarter this year resulted by the impact from the refinery plant shutdown stock loss and lower industry seasonal demandhowever when compared to the negative  last year in the same period gross refining margin improved moving on to page  the left chart show crude intake by source comparing the nine months of  with the nine months of  we processed higher level of middle east and west african crude reflecting streamlined operation and an increase of asphalt production we continued our efforts to diversify crude intake portfolio in order to optimize yield and cost competitiveness which led us to refine  new challenged crudes this yearlook at the sales chart now we achieved greater proportion of domestic retail and commercial sales with reduction in exporton page  as a percentage of total refinery production for the yeartodate  the production by type showed an increase of heavy crude yield which was driven by increase of asphalt salesmiddle distillate and feedstock product yield decreased driven by lower product price spreadson page  industrial paraxylene conditions has remained weak from the excess capacity but gradually improving as we showed  third quarter of paraxylene spread was improved slightly from the lower oil price compared to the second quarter and the same period last yearon the production side  quarter paraxylene production was  kton which was  kton lower compared to the third quarter last year as a result of the scheduled maintenancelets move to market business update on page we continue to strengthen our retail network and alliance partnerships by increasing our network as shown in the chartthe service station offering premium ado increased to  sic  see slide   sites which is equivalent to  of our network and service station offering e to  sites or  of our service stations we also opened  new service stations as of the third quarter this yearas a result of all market activities we can remain our market position by the domestic at the second round are  in the marketin addition to business results highlights i already mentioned we have strengthened our rented assets by increasing operating efficiency and enhanced cost cutting business to several projects and investments the following activity on page  and the example of the project that successfully completes in the third quarterin parallel of refinery shutdown that we successfully execute we also maximized the advantage and value from this event by implementing the energy improvement project and margin enhancement project during the shutdown periodat the third quarter end we have complete the image upgrade and include the inaudible replacement of  service stations we finished terminal facility upgrade project which enhanced our capacity to support the rollout of new esso fuel formula programas a result of the incremental asphalt sales volumes we also implemented asphalt heating tank capacity project to support the increase of asphalt sales with this project we can accommodate the increase of sale at least kbdanother example of investment project that completed in september was the enhancement of terminal automation system this project will improve our efficiency and product distribution and also terminal branding now lets move on to the financial performance on page  yeartodate sales revenue decreased thb billion from yeartodate september last year due to the lower product price our cash flow from operations yeartodate september we generate thb billion reflecting stronger operating performance in current year compared to thb billion as yeartodate september last yearour net profit and loss we operate loss of thb billion in the third quarter  compared to profit of thb billion in the second quarter the third quarter result is mainly driven by the refinery management and stock loss impactcomparing yeartodate earnings this year with last year yeartodate september earnings was thb billion which was thb billion higher than the earnings in the same period last year as a result of the current year third quarter negative earnings the third quarter this year ebitda decreased to negative thb billion from thb billion in the second quarter however with the overall stronger performance this year yeartodate september  ebitda was thb billion versus thb billion in the same period last yearon page  from financial position from the balance sheet indicators total assets increased slightly by thb million from year end  which is driven by higher inventory value upset by utilization of the tax loss carried forward this decline by thb billion at the end of september  with the replacement of both shortterm and longterm loan repayment with the repayment of both shortterm and longterm loanyeartodate  debt to equity ratio improved from  at  year end to  with lower debt level and current year profit  quarter end cash flow from operations reached thb billion with proceeds mainly due to reduced debt cash flow used to investment was th billion reflecting the capital investment from management and efficiency improvement project offset by dividend from an associatecash flow used in financial was thb billion reflecting repayment of debt with all of the highlight we saw in the third quarteri would like to conclude with the company performance and forecast in the summary on page  that we continue to focus on safety reliability and operational excellence our investment forecast is to invest the energy efficiency and margin enhancement project we continue to seek further opportunity to optimize the retail network premium product offering with focus of the fuel quality reliability supply and competitive pricingand last but not the least we continue to leverage strong financial rating with maintaining capital and cost discipline and this is the end of my presentationif there is any question on the line please i would like to take them nowquestions and answersoperator operator instructions we have one question madam its from chak of thanachart your line is now open you may proceedchak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst hi thank you just wanted to ask three questions firstly how much of the turnaround cost impacted your earnings in the third quarter and mainly how much did you spend on the turnaround programsecondly we saw that the sga came down by about thb million from the third quarter last year which is quite chunky i was just wondering if thats sustainable or if it can go lower or is it going to rebound i just want to get some color on thatand lastly on the challenged crude how much of that is contributing to your margin i mean how much of a crude premium are you saving by refining more challenged crude thank yousairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager okay let me address the first question on the turnaround cost first first of all thank you for your question and i have to say that we cannot give a specific amount of the budget spend on the management shutdown however as i mentioned in my presentation that our shutdown went very smooth and we are able to show the retail sales during the shutdown as well as we complete the action plan on the targetsand on the  would you  on the second question yes on the second question would you repeat your second questionchak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst on the selling and admin expense it went down about thb million from the third quarter last year i was just wondering if that is sustainable meaning is it going to be around thb billion going forward or is it going to rebound or can it go lower i just want to get some color because it was quite a big change thankssairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager okay thank you on the part of the selling admin one of the major impacts to the change of the cost of selling admin would be on the converting  service station conversion that we  convert the service station from company operated to be dealer operated and that impact our cost of selling admin but i would say that the cost would be  went downchak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst okaysairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager this could be constantly in terms of the selling admin cost inaudiblechak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst so is it going to remain at roughly this level or do you think it can go down lower i mean how much of the gas stations remains to be converted how many remain to be convertedsairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager in terms of the size conversion we have complete  conversion alreadychak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst okaysairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager and in terms of the cost reducing cost  even though that the conversion is already complete we will continue to focus on cost competitiveness and try to manage the cost to be down as much as possiblechak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst and can you say how much generally are you spending on advertisingsairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager sorry the advertising cost is a part of selling admin so we dont disclose in the detailchak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst okay and the last question was on the crude premium you mentioned that you are refining more of the challenged crude so just want to get some idea of how much that is contributing to your  for example refining margin or your  help with the yield i just want to get some ideathankssairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager dr adisak is on the line dr adisak perhaps would you help to provide the answer on the crude premiumadisak jangkamolkulchai esso thailand pcl  director refinery manager well adisak here from the refinery i think its kind of ongoing and continuous effort we are looking for the alternatives crude which are so called challenged crude and then obviously those crudes will provide you with a better cost versus the same level of yield we continue to see that our crude cost is coming down but i dont think we are going to be in a position to say how much of that contributed to our marginbut i think the only thing that i can say is that we continue to monitor our crude cost and given that the expansion of our envelope to bring in all these challenged crudes our crude cost continued to come downand that will remain the case going forward presumably like i said i think thats the effort that we are trying to do even with the margin improvement projects that got mentioned early on as part of the shutdown that project in itself is going to help improve additional flexibility for us to continue to explore all these challenge in crude and continue to drive the cost downchak reungsinpinya thanachart securities  analyst okay thank youoperator operator instructions madam we have one more question on queue its from punachoi of capital nomura your line is now open you may proceedunidentified participant hello this is from capital nomura securities we have like two questions the first one would be could you break down a bit on the stocking loss during the first half of the year and obviously the qand the second question is whats the prospect of the retails business would you expand the service stationand the last question was i heard that there was a change in the management would it affect esso direction in the future and obviously the earnings thank yousairuedee suchato esso thailand pcl  ir and planning manager okay thank you for your question let me address your first question about our operating profits and stocking loss we consider our stocking loss as a part of our business operation and we do not disclose specific inventory gainloss information however we  on average we hold inventory of both crude and products around  million barrel and we normally use the dubai crude price as a good indicator for our operationsso the stocking loss can be approximately temporarily inaudible in the inaudible dubai crude price at the quarter end assuming with the  million barrel inventory levelon the second question okay on the retail business  on the prospect of retail business as the retail business right now has grown approximately about two digits so then our retail prospect would be brought with the market we continue to strengthen our retail network and alliance partnership in order to capture the market growth by expanding our retail networkas you can see that our service station has continuously increased throughout the past several year and we also introduced the new product offering to customers such as the premium ado e and lets say as you can see that we just introduced a new fuel formula in last month and also in order to strengthen our customer base and loyalty we
