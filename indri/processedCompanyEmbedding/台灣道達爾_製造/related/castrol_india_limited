to the world’ powertrains about the companycastrol was founded by charles “cheers” wakefield under the name of ‘cc wakefield  company’ in 8 when he was  charles left a job at vacuum oil to start a new business at cheapside in london selling lubricants for trains and heavy machinery he was a persuasive man who could articulate a vision clearly and eight former colleagues followed him into the new company early in the new century wakefield took a personal interest in two sporty new motorised contraptions – the automobile and the aeroplane the company started developing lubricants especially for these new engines which needed oils that were runny enough to work from cold at startup and thick enough to keep working at very high temperatures wakefield researchers found that adding a measure of castor oil a vegetable oil made from castor beans did the trick nicely they called the new product “castrol”having helped pioneer a new kind of motor oil now cc wakefield pioneered a new method of getting customers to notice the product sponsorship the castrol name appeared on banners and flags at competitive aviation events auto races and at competitive drivers’ attempts to break the land speed record wakefield extended the company’s increasingly profitable product line to include oils developed especially for car manufacturer’s individual engines by 6 the name of the motor oil had all but eclipsed that of the company’s largerthanlife founder and so ‘cc wakefield company’ became simply castrol ltd meanwhile the company’s researchers delved ever deeper into the complexities of engine lubrication and a stateoftheart research facility opened in bracknell england then in 66 the burmah oil company bought castrol proving that castrol hadn’t become focused solely on cars and aircrafts the queen elizabeth ii the world’s largest oceangoing passenger liner launched in 6 powered by castrol lubricants through the  and s the company continued to introduce innovative new products burmahcastrol was purchased by bp in  and the castrol brand became part of the bps group of companiesmore recently when nasas curiosity rover began its exciting mission on mars in  a castrol industrial grease played a central role in the smooth operation of everything from curiositys wheels to its cameras the grease is formulated for the space program to perform in temperatures ranging from minus  degrees celsius to  degrees celsius the success of the company owes much to the original philosophy of charles wakefield he drew on the help and encouragement of his customers in developing his new castrol oils because he had the foresight to see that working in partnership was the best way to achieve success for both parties this rationale is as relevant to castrol today as

general manager of sales at castrol india limited was concerned sales of castrol motorcycle oil for fourstroke engines was far less than it should be especially when considering the five million motorcycles being added to indian roads each year most motorcycle oil changes took place in franchised workshops during the warranty period and in nonfranchised workshops after the warranty period the general manager wanted to increase the sales of castrol oil in the spare parts shops and nonfranchised workshops that serviced indias growing aftermarket castrol indias existing distributors were reluctant to sell to those segments which they viewed as lowvolume highcost and risky distribution channels the general manager needed a distribution strategy that would appeal to the existing distributors and boost castrol oil indias sales without increasing costs to the company settings india retail trade large  no reviews   write a review no usage share view our pricing guide or login to
