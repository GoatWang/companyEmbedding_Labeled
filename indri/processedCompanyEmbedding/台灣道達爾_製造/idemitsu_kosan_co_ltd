scale back instead he went into transport by oil tanker in  the headquarters were moved to tokyo and the name changed to the current idemitsu kosan kk kabushiki kaisha stock company with the japanese military expansion and united states joining the pacific war the government took control of all industries postwar eraedit after the war idemitsu kosan lost its overseas trade with the allied occupation of japan it was among the ten petroleum suppliers selected by the ministry of international trade and industry miti and cut its ties with nippon oil idemitsu began importing naphtha an intermediate oil product first from the united states and later from venezuela and iran the protectionist oil industry law helped idemitsu against foreign competition in japan but also made owning its

when buying fuel for its military jets in japan idemitsu called the boycott an odd christmas gift but utterly negligible in  it broke off contracts with the soviet union the company also came in conflict with the petroleum association of japan which was set up by miti to restrict production and idemitsu even left the organization in  the seamens union went on strike the first of its kind in

developed the coal cartridge system for small users it worked on geothermal power experiments and uranium mining in canada with cameco and cogema the sharp  price drop on oil made idemitsus nonoil operations less profitable japanese import restrictions on oil once again came under debate as in  idemitsu favored opening up to foreign competition in opposition to most of the japanese oil industry
