ceo and president · the russian economy remains weak the reduction in the market for new construction equipment seems to have slowed down but the market during the first six months was anyway  lower than during the same period last year we do not expect any material changes in the market situation before the end of the year · despite of the weak market we have delivered a relatively strong result for the quarter including a satisfying cash flow even if the revenue was lower than during the second quarter last year we managed to compensate this primarily by lower costs resulting in an increased operating profit like the last quarter we noted a positive result per ordinary share which is calculated after dividends on preference shares given the difficult market situation i am very pleased with this result · after the end of the quarter we have also been appointed official distributor for dressta bulldozers and pipelayers all over russia the addition of dressta bulldozers fits perfectly into our product offering and improves our ability to offer fullpackage solutions to our customers this is fully in line with our strategy to use our network to distribute complementary products we also take over responsibility for the aftermarket of the existing machine fleet · since the last report we have also refinanced our credit facilities in total we now have up to rub m of committed financing available from two different banks thanks to our net cash position we are not in need of this financing at the moment but it provides security for the company going forward in these troublesome times presentation of second quarter report a presentation of the second quarter report will be held by phone on  august  at  am cet the presentation can be accessed on the company’s
