autonomous ev for us in  by alysha webb shanghai – lynk  co and nio both launched their first production models at the shanghai auto show in april both tout their unique ownership experience which includes lots of cool technology cool technology is becoming standard in new cars however  the automakers arguably have a bigger task before them on the road to success “they must go through the painstaking process of building a brand” bill russo managing director at gao feng advisory a shanghaibased consultancy tells wardsauto most new brands can rely on predecessor brands from the same company for example lexus and toyota he says lynk may have a leg up in the brandbuilding battle it is the offspring of two automakers zhejiang geely and volvo which geely acquired in  “but i’m not sure that helps lynk  co very much” says russo meanwhile the lynk  co website proclaims “forget what you know about car brands and buying” its first model a compact luxury cuv called the  is scheduled to go on sale in china in fourthquarter  in europe in  and the us “some months” later lynk will offer the option of shared ownership of its vehicles which will include electric and traditional internalcombustionengine models the brand which calls itself “the world’s most connected car” offers a lifetime warranty and more important to its desired image lifetime free connectivity the carsharing feature may be a bonus in trying to attract younger buyers in china says namrita chow principal automotive analyst with ihs markit but she notes “the tough part will be brand awareness and gaining traction in a market already saturated by existing brands as well as a throng of newcomers” the aim says alain visser senior vice presidentmarketing and sales at lynk is to create a “hasslefree ownership experience” that clearly will differentiate his company from its competitors the startup is leaning heavily on the volvo brand heritage for legitimacy the  and future models will be “built in china in a volvo plant according to volvo standards” visser says nio formerly known as nextev also displayed its first production model at the shanghai show the es a fullsize suv is an allelectric vehicle with a swappable battery the startup is leaning on its ownership experience to differentiate it from the crowd although details aren’t out yet “we believe that a better electric automotive product and a better ownership experience will make more and more users willing to own an electric car” nio founder and chairman william li says at the shanghai show nio says the es will be on the market in china in  and it will offer an autonomous ev for sale in the us by  not having the burden of a parent brand actually may help nio says robin zhu senior analyst at investment researcher sanford c bernstein in hong kong “nio is free to build a brand story consisting of nurburgring lap times formula e and other achievements” he tells wardsauto the nextev team has competed in the fia formulae championship race series since its inception in  winning the series in  with driver nelson piquet jr in may its ep electric supercar set an electricvehicle lap record of  minutes  seconds at the famous nurburgring track in germany in february an autonomous version of the ep set a new record for an autonomous vehicle with a lap time of  minutes  seconds at the circuit of the americas in austin tx it won’t be easy for the startups to use customer experience to brand themselves says tom doctoroff senior partner at global brand and marketing firm prophet most chinese companies still are much more focused on sales than service he says “when you want to talk about customer experience you have to look at corporate structure and whether it can provide an integrated holistic experience” says doctoroff who lived in china for decades and is the former asia pacific ceo of communications firm j walter thompson “the ecosystem that is required is a very refined

future mobility corporation gao feng mobility nextev nio volkswagen beijing china june   how china is shaping the future of mobility click here to watch the recording of the panel discussion the china auto market is transitioning from a period of rapid growth and expansion of individual car ownership to a future where mobility needs are served via a more diverse stream of personal mobility solutions   personal mobility solutions now include new cars an expanding supply of good quality used cars as well as ondemand mobility odm services including bike sharing and ride hailing for people who prefer a payperuse model over ownership  china’s market is also quite unique with its short history of car ownership ultradense urban population and high penetration of the mobile internet  with an urbanization rate of  china’s urban population now exceeds  million people and the transportation needs of this increasingly urbanized population has driven the explosive demand for personal mobility  with a car population of over  million vehicles at the end of  individuals who own cars are still far outnumbered by those who do not and mobility needs are increasingly served through mobility services “usership” beyond just individual car “ownership” in this context automakers are expanding their focus from the product the “automobile” to the utility that is derived from the product “automobility” and are challenged to create a business model and digital ecosystem optimized to provide digitallyenabled solutions for both car owners and users we will discuss how are these factors shaping the auto market in china  what solutions are being developed to ease mobility “pain points” in china  how do you see these solutions impacting and shaping our everyday lives today and in the future  how will this impact the structure of the industry going forward innovations such as these originating from both traditional oems and new mobility solutions platforms many of whom are chinese is paving the way to an entirely new business model for china’s auto industry topics for discussion defining the disruption in the china context – what are the disruptive trends in the world of mobility big picture view of the competitive landscape – what does the new competitive landscape look like and how will it evolve how should incumbents respond disrupting or being disrupted – what new internal capabilities are required how to work with local startups  compete or collaborate china for the world – will china lead to world’s development and innovation in connected mobility prof dr

future mobility has hired about  engineers from car makers including bmw for its smartelectricvehicle project photo reuters chinese auto startup future mobility seeks eventually to sell several hundred thousand luxury vehicles a year beijing—an auto startup backed by internet giant tencent holdings ltd plans to start selling premium electric cars globally by  joining other chinese car makers in taking aim at an increasingly crowded luxury market four monthold future mobility corp seeks eventually to sell several hundred thousand fully electric highly automated chinabuilt vehicles a year the company is also backed by chinese luxurycar dealer harmony new energy auto and foxconn technology group which assembles iphones for apple inc apple has been working on its own autonomous electric car deeppocketed tech companies have backed a wave of new auto companies in china where a drive to cut fuel consumption and pioneer the auto industry of the future has encouraged startups analysts citing increasing competition and uncertainty over a subsidyfueled boom in electric vehicles question how such ambitions can be turned into reality “our target is to create the first chinese brand which is premium and internationally successful” carsten breitfeld chief executive of future mobility told the wall street journal in an interview on tuesday he said the company aims to sell cars in china europe and the us and to compete with audi ag bmw ag and daimler ag’s mercedesbenz which combine for three quarters of china’s luxurycar market the company will soon complete its first round of fundraising mr breitfeld said last year china’s industrial regulator amended rules to allow nonautomotive companies to invest in the electriccar industry which beijing has subsidized to the tune of tens of billions of dollars internet giants jumped right in china’s annual motor show in april showcased smart vehicles powered by software from onlineshopping company alibaba group holding ltd and search provider baidu inc last month a baidu executive said that the company plans to mass produce a driverless car within five years tencent china’s biggest socialnetwork company has a research team working on technology that can be used in automated cars according to a person familiar with the matter for now its involvement in future mobility—beyond its minority stake as a financial investor—is limited the person said tencent is an investor in another electriccar maker nextev inc whose other backers include sequoia capital the companies are poaching talented engineers from global auto and technology giants and setting up research centers in the west future mobility has hired  engineers from bmw mercedesbenz tesla and googlecom within  months it will have about  engineers globally said mr breitfeld formerly the project manager for bmw’s i plugin sports car he said the company will either build its own plant or partner with an existing auto maker to assemble cars it has research and development units in munich and silicon valley and is building its headquarters in shenzhen where tencent is based some analysts question how quickly such a new company can achieve its aims “several hundred thousand premium cars from an unknown brand sounds like a stretch” said bill russo managing director at gao feng advisory co and former head of chrysler’s north east asia business “building a brand and competing with the likes of the premium car makers is very difficult and the competition will not stand still” robin zhu a senior analyst at us research company sanford c bernstein noted that demand for electric vehicles in china is minimal except in big cities where they’re exempt from certain restrictions that apply to their gasolinefueled counterparts the number of electric and hybrid cars and buses sold in  was four times that of a year earlier—but at  vehicles was a small subsidydriven tally in a market where total sales exceeded  million —rose yu juro osawa contributed to

st century china has been the growth engine of the global automotive industry despite a recent slowdown china will surpass  million units in annual car sales in  and has become the battleground for dominance of the global auto industry several driving forces which are particularly evident china are disrupting the status quo of the automotive industry the unique context of china’s urban transportation challenge the high rate of adoption of mobile device connectivity combined with the rapid and aggressive introduction of alternative mobility solutions disruptive new entrants into the mobility solutions competitive landscape who draw insights about customers based on their online behaviors and mobility habits in order to offer a diverse pool of new revenuegenerating solutions the confluence of these forces are changing the landscape of how mobility needs can be served in a rather fundamental way touching off a wave of experimentation among both traditional automotive and new mobility solutions providers the origins of disruption disruptive business models typically originate from outside the core set of industry players  traditional original equipment manufacturer oem business models rely on selling products through an established businesstoconsumer bc channel often through an intermediary sales partner that is either owned or franchised to represent the oem brands in the marketplace  consumers pay to own the asset outright the entry point for disruption is through the “payperuse” servicebased business model  while this channel has existed for some time in the form of services managed through centralized professionally managed fleets rental car companies taxi and chauffeur services digitally disruptive companies such as uber and china’s yidao yongche and didichuxing created from a merger between rival mobility services from alibaba and tencent have gained rapid and widespread market acceptance once an entry point is established these servicescentric information and communications technology ict disruptors are able to leverage their big data and analytics capabilities to gain insight on consumers and their mobility patterns and behaviors essentially these disruptors view connected mobility services as a natural extension of their ecosystem platform and are viewing the traditional services and perhaps even the oem hardware business as a way of expanding their ecosystem  serving the “mobility on demand” market is merely the point of entry for an entire suite of internetbased mobile connectivity services which may include navigation route planning ecommerce vehicle repair and maintenance usage based insurance and other very lucrative “owner services” which are very important to today’s oem business ict disruptors are leveraging connected mobility services as a means to disintermediate the value chain of the automotive industry and capture a profitable services ecosystem  oems are at risk of their business model being relegated to a highrisk assetintensive commoditized businesstobusiness bb channel for delivering hardware to the profitable ecosystem of the mobility services providers reimagining personalized mobility the motivation for many ict disruptors to invest and compete in this market is to unlock the services revenue that encircles each user  it is not the mobility service itself that justifies the investment but rather all the things that we and our cars do when mobile  making such experiences feel more and more “personalized” to our individual needs and lifestyles which become apparent based on our mobility habits will ensure the loyalty of the user to the service provider’s ecosystem ict disruptors are leveraging their core value propositions to deliver a more personalized mobility solution  these disruptors may not see the car industry as their destination but are rather “travelling through mobility”  they view mobility services as a channel for enrollment of users into their broader ecosystembased platform offering a range of other services  chinese ict disruptors aiming at this “personalized mobility” solutions space include leeco future mobility and nextev the table below offers a glimpse of how major chinese players aim to leverage their core while expanding to and beyond mobility as a service  beyond manufacturing smart connected electric vehicles or building technologyenabled infotainment systems and mobility services these visionary companies are reinventing the mobility experience as a whole  moreover they are reimagining mobility as a transaction between a user and an ecosystem services provider which stands in stark contrast with the traditional model of a transaction between an owner and a manufacturer it is important to keep in mind that as cars become mobility service platforms the technology on board will become more sophisticated and tailored to the individual enduser’s needs  ict disruptors may in fact decide to contract out the actual production of vehicles to an ecosystem partner with an endgame of earning recurring revenue by providing car owners with data products and internet services  while some tech companies may profit from selling hardware the main focus is on the services that flow through the hardware disruptions typically originate from outside the traditional industry players which is clearly illustrated in this case  we are approaching an inflection point where the deployment of personalized mobility solutions will expand exponentially and thereby alter the competitive landscape and business models of several adjacent industries conclusion over the past few years we have witnessed how ict disruptors have pioneered new business models and are in the process reimagining mobility as a service  the emergence of chinese disruptive mobility solutions players such as didi chuxing and leeco with their innovative ecosystembased strategic approach offers clear evidence that something new is happening  this coupled with the chinese government’s determination to push newenergy vehicles and build a sustainable transportation infrastructure demonstrates the potential for china to become the major breeding ground for automotive innovation tech disruptors including apple aapl  google googl  leeco nextev and others may be garnering the most attention but as we have observed they are typically “travelling through mobility” as a means to enroll users into their broader service ecosystems  on the opposite flank traditional oems who will not easily cede their over year dominance in the auto industry are pivoting into mobility services new players will inevitably join this emerging landscape of competition  alliances are also being formed among new and traditional players seeking to access complementary strengths and seize a competitive advantage the battle will likely be won by those who understand the true potential of connected mobility services and thereby deliver value to

contributor the opinions expressed are those of the writer china electric vehicles electronics new mobility telematics  the race to produce china’s tesla april  april   bill russo alibaba bill russo china gao feng advisory company infotainment innovation internet of things leeco nextev tencent tesla bloomberg news april     william li isn’t your typical boundlessly optimistic chinese tech entrepreneur yes the founder of startup nextev inc has big plans to disrupt china’s electric car market the financial backing of venture capital powerhouses sequoia capital and hillhouse capital and considers tesla motors founder elon musk an inspiration that said he rates his chance of succeeding in china’s fastmoving car market at a whopping  percent he also thinks most of the new business models for electric cars being bandied about by tech companies will end up in the junk yard “there’s an exponential gulf between creating a concept car and mass production and then to actually sell them” li said “tesla has broken a lot of new ground and inspired a raft of internet companies to follow but most have no idea what they’re facing” such hardnosed realism is probably wise as global auto executives gather for the  beijing auto show a torrent of money is pouring into the nation’s alternative energy vehicle market which includes electric vehicles plugin hybrids and fuelcell cars in a country with some of the worst urban air pollution on the planet and a rapidly urbanizing populace the market’s upside potential seems big to conventional car companies and tech startups jumping in the chinese government is promoting what it considers a strategic industry with big subsidies for companies and consumers it wants new energy vehicle sales to top  million units a year by  versus  in  premier li keqiang in february urged local government and industry players to speed up construction of charging facilities to accommodate  million electric vehicles by  right now the electric car business is dominated by byd co a shenzhenbased automaker percent owned by warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway inc that has a  percent share of china’s new energy vehicle market at the beijing show byd will be touting its new entrylevel sportsutility vehicle called the yuan as in the thcentury chinese dynasty that starts from  yuan  for the hybrid version tesla is a player too in china where it sells its model s and model x though the palo alto californiabased electric carmaker would like to be a far bigger one for the first three quarters of  the company sold  vehicles in china which compares to  units of delivery by byd the chinese company also sells its electrics in us germany and japan and surpassed tesla in may to become the world’s biggest maker of new energy vehicles last year the success of tesla in the us and the development of driverless car technologies by apple and google are also attracting all manner of technology companies into the chinese auto market the world’s biggest some envision cars developing into “mobility service platforms” in which passengers receive data and services in addition to being moved from point a to b that could play to the strengths of technology companies and the huge and growing chinese auto market could be the perfect laboratory in which to experiment with new services and business models according to bill russo managing director at shanghaibased auto consultant gao feng advisory russo compares today’s autos to the mobile phones of a decade ago when apps started to gain in popularity “as cars become mobility service platforms the technology on board will become more sophisticated” he says technology companies could contract out auto production to make vehicles but then earn recurring revenue by providing car owners with data products and internet services “apple makes money not just on the device but on all the services that flow through it” he said it’s definitely a vision in search of details but plenty of technology companies are jumping into the fray electronics contract manufacturer foxconn technology internet service portal tencent and china harmony new energy auto have set up a joint venture to build alternative energy cars the partnership is designed to leverage different strengths foxconn’s component supply chain tencent’s infotainment and telematics systems that could improve vehicle’s connectivity and harmony auto’s aftersales network for electric vehicles in january daniel kirchert head of infiniti in china joined the alliance chinese tech billionaire jia yueting also has automotive ambitions the chairman and founder of le holdings co which makes webenabled televisions and smartphones and offers cloud and ecommerce services is a major investor in los angelesbased faraday future which is building a acre factory near las vegas nevada leeco which has developed its own electric vehicles is preparing to apply for a production license in china and also plans to manufacture its cars overseas given all the new entrants it is easy to understand why nextev founder li is wary of the competition even with financial backers like sequoia li has hired former cisco systems inc chief technology officer padmasree warrior to lead development and us operations and has inked a deal to outsource production to anhui jianghuai automobile co “they’re realistic they’re seasoned smart people with a lot of money and they’re unafraid of the challenge” michael dunne head of strategy and investment advisory firm dunne automotive ltd said of nextev “in fact they seem to be embracing it” li’s early life didn’t fit the profile of a tech entrepreneur he spent his early years herding cattle in a mountain village in anhui province where he grew up with his grandparents a talented student he left the rural china to attend the prestigious peking university where he earned a degree in social sciences while supporting himself with parttime work like selling office supplies to apple inc before starting nextev li cofounded and built bitauto holdings ltd into the country’s biggest provider of online car pricing data for dealers the company went public in new york in  li and bitauto have invested in more than  companies in china including usedcar business financing services and carsharing platform such as didapinche li says nextev is an opportunity to rethink the electric car as not just a transportation vehicle but as a digital platform “traditional auto manufacturers treat the car as  percent transportation tool” li said “tesla’s cars have perhaps  percent to  percent content that are not related to transportation” he said referring to such things as mobile connectivity and touchscreens that access car maintenance services  “my aim is to boost that to more than  percent” nextev has produced an electric formula e series racer but hasn’t yet disclosed its plans for launching an electric car aimed at the consumer market meantime the race is
