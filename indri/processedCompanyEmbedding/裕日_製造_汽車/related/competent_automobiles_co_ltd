they investigate my car and found that my all five tyres are defected since manufacturing so they called and informed me about the defects and need to change immediately and for that u have to gone to karol bagh for the exchange when i had a word with the concerned person on dd motors mrkamal deep he said that we are going to discuss your problem withmr mittal gm of dd motors and jk tyres and for this i have to left my vehicle for one day next day mr mandeep concerned person of jk tyres visited at dd motor mayapuri and after checking they confirmed me that sir there is manufacturing defects and they gave me letter of changing tyre and said that i have to go to chadha trader jk tyres dealer mayapuri they would change your all five jk tyres as per their instruction i visited over there and i found that all tyres which they r giving to me for exchange are also having the same manufacturing defect when i again have a word with him they told me that they have the same problem in all
