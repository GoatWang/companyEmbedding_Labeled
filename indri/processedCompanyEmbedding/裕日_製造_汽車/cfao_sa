need to significan⋯⋯tly improve their customer service and workshop practice i left my tucson at hrs for some small repairs and when i called round at hrs  hrs later my car was still not ready i was also asked if the replacement parts were actually needed i told them definitely yes thats why it was booked in that meant they had not started on my vehicle they told me to call at hrs which i did i did not get my car back until hrs also one of the repairs was not done due to some problem i then found that my back glass door lifter had been broken by the garage which they said they would replace next morning i also found that one of my roof rails had been damaged when i went back on  to report this i was told that they would have to check with the cctv as they did not admit to this damage my verdict very poor service the service advisors therer seem overworked and not able to cope with the amount of vehicles for repairs in addition i now have to take time off work to take the car back for more repairs through no fault of my own a time  motion study needs to be done at this establishments service desk to vastly improve customer service in the future brian davidson benit pouspous ·
