cents your feed never missed a beat  comment from roger interactive brokers tick data was inconsistent so i have switched to using dtn exclusively it is great to no longer have to worry about my

easiest and cleanest i have seen for some time  comment from jim i am enjoying the feed very much  so superior to the broker provided feed i was previously using  comment from george i bracket trade all major news releases and i have not found one lag or glitch with dtniq feed i am very comfortable with their feed under all typical news conditions fed releases employment numbers etc  comment from

funny i have a bloomberg terminal and a bridge feed but i still like having my dtn feed  comment from feras version  has been working well for me and i appreciate that it is now a much tighter client to work with i feel i can go to press with my own application and rely on a stable platform  comment from david in ia i will tell others who want to go into trading that dtn prophetx is an invaluable tool i dont think anyone can trade without it  comment from luther boy probably spent a thousand hours trying to get  api to work right and now two hours to have something running with iqfeed hmmm

with the dtniq system for quotes and news  comment from larry it’s so nice to be working with real professionals  comment from len everything is working great  very impressive client the news

perfectly with no lag even during fast market conditions  comment from andy via email i ran your iqfeed dde vs my broker vs a level ii window for some slowmoving options i would see the level ii quote
