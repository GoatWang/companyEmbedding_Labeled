versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs to generate additional sales bk occasionally introduces limitedtime offers of special versions of its products or brings out completely new products intended for either long or shortterm sales not all of these products and services have been successful in  burger king introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued the company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu along with the companys specialty sandwich product line in a  menu expansion the products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market members of which would be willing to spend more on a higherquality product the expanded burger king menu was part of a plan by thencompany president donald n smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with mcdonalds and to fend off then newcomer wendys who had a growing market share the plan was successful the companys sales increased by  percent despite another menu expansion in  the companys market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of thenparent pillsbury and its successors grand metropolitan and diageo when the company was sold to a group led by tpg capital in  the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its thenceo brad blum during blums tenure the company added several products that featured higherquality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic as in the past not all of these products met corporate sales expectations or in the case of several of its larger offerings resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns with the purchase of the company in  by g capital the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship whopper sandwich like its menu the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company grew the burgers have always been broiled mechanically the original unit called an instabroiler was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of instaburger king purchased before opening their new restaurant the instabroiler worked by cooking  burger patties in a wire basket allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously with the acquisition of the chain by its miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a flame broiler designed by the new owners it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the cooking format remained for the next  years until burger king developed a new variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new unit began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment and a computerbased product monitoring

the whopper as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time the whopper is a  oz  g hamburger with lettuce tomato mayonnaise pickle and ketchup that was priced at ¢ the sandwich was designed to give the customer a larger product with better value than competitors who were selling burgers with an average price of ¢ as burger kings flagship product the whopper has been expanded beyond the original sandwich into a line of sandwiches all made with the same ingredients the whopper sandwich has undergone several modifications in its recipe over the years with a change from a plain bun to a sesame seed roll in the early s and a change in patty size in the mids being two of the most notable since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and become the focus of much of its advertising the company has even named its kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars in  donald n smith was hired from mcdonalds to help restructure the corporate operations of burger king to better compete against his former company as well as the then upandcoming chain wendys as part of an operational overhaul he dubbed operation phoenixnotes  one of his first changes to the companys menu was to add the burger king specialty sandwich line in  this line—with many nonhamburger sandwiches including chicken and fish—significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu it was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic in this case adults aged between  and  years members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher

the chicken sandwich served on a fresh cooked baguette roll and came in several varieties all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat they were sold in the united states at one time but are now sold only in the european market the failed baguette line was replaced in north america with the current grilled chicken iteration the tendergrill sandwich although wendys was

offerings until a menu revamp in notes  this expansion introduced bks am express product line which included french toast sticks and minimuffins the new breakfast line was designed to be portable

minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment g capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of quaker oats company oatmeal to its menu in late  oatmeal has been shown to be a popular addition to breakfast menus industrywide due to its low cost ease in preparation and perception as a healthy wholegrain option analysts from industry analytic

duke manufacturing one of two models the company deployed in the united states the predecessor to burger king instaburger king began deploying the original broiling device in  when its owners matthew burns and kieth kramer acquired the rights to george reads instshake and instabroiler machines the instabroiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously the machine was capable of cooking over  patties per hour which allowed the company to grow rapidly when mclamore and edgarton opened their first instaburger king location in miami they revamped the unit into what they called a flame broiler – the forerunner of the modern unit used by burger king today after the acquisition of instaburger king in  the pair contracted the construction of the newly designed flame broilers to the saniserv company of indianapolis indiana for the initial run of broilersnotes  eventually the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to nieco automatic broilers of windsor california who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the s when the time came for the company to develop a new broiler it turned to its equipment manufacturer nieco and st louis missouribased duke manufacturing burger kings goal was to maintain the companys trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform the solutions that nieco and duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking the cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods nieco employed two chains one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control dukes solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature one heterogeneous product batch at a timenotes  the first batchstyle broiler was introduced in april  and was tested instore in central wisconsin during the summer of  a nieco mbp flexible broiler another model the company deployed in the united states beyond the flexibility of the new broilers the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs a more efficient design of the burners in the nieco units produces a  percent reduction in energy consumption the duke units produce a   annual savings on energy compared to the original units which ran approximately at full capacity all day the units are so fuelefficient that in many us states the company and its franchises qualify for energyefficiency rebatesnotes  however and issue arose in september  when the state of washington department of health warned burger king of issues with the duke units in multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state the duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products additionally there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues upon notification burger king released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporateowned stores operating the duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately additional training for operators was also ordered kitchen equipmentedit a burger king kitchen in italy featuring the companys product holding cabinets before any products are sold the company precooks the ingredients and holds them in a heated holding cabinet to ensure that product consistency is maintained and to reduce the amount of products discarded as waste burger king utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by integrated control corp or icc the system called kitchen minder monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products initially developed from  to  the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by duke the initial test designs were timeconsuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually this meant several minutes were required for each product which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each when bk finally deployed the system in  the updated units utilized a palm pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via infrared or serial port a kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in  combined with the new equipment it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage along with the holding system burger king

beverage and a toy the toy is usually a product tiein with a movie or popular television show the entrée and side offerings differ from market to market as does portion size in the north american market bk further divides its childrens menu into three segments toddler kids and tween the only difference between the first two groups is the prize offering the toddler will receive an ageappropriate toy the toys were originally designed by kentwood michiganbased sassy inc and were introduced in  as a supplement to the companys existing childrens line burger king changed its toddler

serving of chicken tenders plus a small order of fries and a  us fl oz  ml drink and a toy further additions to the line included a sixpiece serving of the companys chicken fries product the

company added other higherend product such as barbecued ribs grilled fish an improved grilled chicken sandwich kebabs and an extrathick burger called the steakhouse xtnotes  several industry publications claimed that these new offerings disrupt the differentiation between the fastfood and casualdining markets with a combination of taste competitive pricing speed of service and conveniencenotes  the adultoriented products of burger king and it competitors have been criticized by restaurant industry commentators as a temporary blip the indulgent products are seen as blurring the lines between the fastfood and casualdining market segments and while they draw in newer customers looking for value the effect may only be temporary once the economic instabilities of the lates recession fade customers may return to such casual chains as chilis and leave the fast food chains back where they started in terms of customer numbers and profits bk targets specific subgroups within

companys morningstar farms division another submarket in this group is onthego parents and commuters the companys bk chicken fries—frenchfry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment first introduced in  the product was successful enough that burger king expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the childrens demographic with a kids meal version of the product in  the meal was launched with a crosspromotion in conjunction with nickelodeons spongebob squarepants the series of commercials raised the ire of the american family association due to perceived nudity concerns the superfanedit see also the burger king one particular market target that was of importance to the company was identified as the superfan the superfan was a demographic group that included individuals that are  to  years old primarily male who would visit a fastfood restaurant five times a month and eat fast food  times a month burger king and their competitors hope to attract this group because of the large sums of money that they represent an increase in sales to this group could drive an increase in global sales while superfans accounted for less than  percent of burger kings customer base they accounted for nearly  percent of the companys business by focusing on this demographic group the company could increase sales more readily it was easier to generate more repeat visits by this demographic than it was to coax new customers to switch from other chains the company has used advertising featuring its mascot the burger king in tandem with new product rollouts such as its bk wrapper product to help generate an increased number of visits by this client segment with the slowing of the global economy due to the financial crisis of  the company experienced a downside of focusing so much on this demographic group the high unemployment of the recession coupled with healthier eating habits drove many customers away from fast food towards the fastcasual segment or forced them to stop eating out analysts have stated that by focusing its marketing and advertising programs on men bk alienated women and children morgan stanley analyst john glass stated maybe catering to the super fan was the correct strategy to kickstart the business but maybe they relied on that for too long to help counter the perceived male bias of its superfan target group the company expanded the definition in early  to cover individuals of both sexes all ages and households who frequent fast food within the stated time frame throughout  the company added newer calorieconscious positive steps combo meals that were advertised in femaleoriented media as well as a continuing crosspromotional tiein with the femaleoriented twilight film seriesnotes  g capitals

success but the companys franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment part of the product a pita salad was quickly dropped from the salad bar as were plans to use the bar unit to boost breakfast sales in  the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of prepackaged salads including chef and garden salads the salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads in  bk introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with paul newmans newmans own inc whose salad dressings accompanied the products burger king revamped its salad line again in  with the introduction of its fire grilled salad products burger king sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness at one point in the united states the salads are premade offsite they are sold with two toppings and kens foods kens steakhouse brand salad dressing internationally the salads vary in composition and style from market to market in all markets salads are one of the items targeted at

such as salads the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data one of its reactions to the concerns over transfats was to initiate a program in january  to phase out added transfat in its products and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats the program ended in early  with a complete changeover to the new oils most but not all of the products contain no added transfats some products such as the beef used in the hamburgers still contain naturally occurring transfatsnotes  to address concerns over the increase in childhood obesity in western nations and accusations of unhealthy offerings for children by groups such as the center for science in the public interest the company created a nutritional program called bk positive steps that is aimed at children and their families the program began with the introduction of products such as broiled chicken tenders kraft macaroni and cheese and apple fries which are french cut apples served in a fry box that are featured in a new lowfat kids club meal according to a statement by burger king the new kids club meals contain no more than  calories per meal

several vegetarian options including salads the bk veggie sandwich and its deepfried spicy bean burger that is sold in burger kings international locationsnotes  the majority of these products do not qualify as vegan due to the presence of egg or dairy productsnotes  an example is the bk veggie which is approved by the british vegetarian society society guidelines do not require their approved

in the united states that changed with the sale of the company in  the new owners relaxed the mandated hours for stores to be open from  am to midnight monday through saturday and  am to midnight on sundays franchises were encouraged to stay open later or for  hours in markets that could support the business packagingedit burger kings product packaging has undergone many changes over the years unlike mcdonalds the company never used the clamshell style box made of styrofoam so when the environmental concerns over styrofoam came to a head in the late s the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches when mcdonalds moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging burger king ran several sarcasticallyworded ads in national newspapers stating that it had always wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper they welcomed mcdonalds to the clubnotes  to cut back on the amount of paper that the company used the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in  it was replaced with waxed papernotes  paperboard boxes are still used for its finger food products like chicken tenders and fries french toast sticks and desserts in  the company committed itself to a redesign of its entire packaging line that tied the packaging into its irreverent advertising campaign created by crispin porter  bogusky each products packaging included a tongueincheek commentary about the product itself alex bogusky partner and executive creative director of cpb stated that bk decided to create a dialogue with the consumer by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time all of its sandwich wrappers cartons tray liners bags breakfast platters chili cups condiments and regional product packaging received what was described as quirky ad copy specifically targeting the –yearold male demographic segment besides the humorous commentary the company also created sniglettype names for things that would appear in its products such as a ringer – a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries the frypod and bk chicken fries products two examples of burger kings packaging designed to fit in a cup holder starting with the introduction of its bk chicken fries product in  bk began adapting some of its product packaging so that it could be placed in an automotive cup holder the bk chicken fry box while square in shape will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top when opened forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce burger king credits the design of this box with helping to make its chicken fries the most popular adultoriented chicken product in the united states it has since added a trademarked and patented round french fry container which it calls the frypod which is a paper cup made from

company has supplied much of the packaging for burger kings north american operations since winning its first contract in  the original  million contract was for paperboard clamshell containers and covered  bk locations in the united statesnotes  union was instrumental in the development of the frypod carton and its efforts earned the company a supplier of the year award from burger king in  reformulationsedit over time the company reformulates various products in an attempt to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste appearance or physical consistency of the product one such example of this is the bk big fish the companys fish sandwich offering in north america burger kings original fish sandwich introduced as early as the late s in some markets was called the whaler it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll bk used for their hamburgers when burger king introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in  the bk broiler it changed the fish sandwichs breading to a panko style began serving it on an oatmealdusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich and renamed the product the ocean catch sandwich when bk reformulated the bk broiler the company also reformulated the ocean catch as the bk big fish in its current configuration the sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phaseout of the baguette sandwiches and was reintroduced as the big fish in  one of the companys larger product reformulations came in march  the company updated the recipe of its  yearold chicken tender product line by reformulating the breading and spice mixture while updating the shape the new formulation was described by the company as being more broadly appealing to the palate of its customers according to statement released by the company nations restaurant news analyst john barone stated that the change may also be due to an industry wide move to chickenbased product as a result of raising commodity prices forcing restaurants to turn towards chickenbased offerings due to the elevated pork and beef prices occurring during the previous year he added that chicken breast costs have been down or flat during the same period making it a more appealing choice to companies the new product push was accompanied with a product tiein with the movie hop aimed at the youth market an adultoriented advertising campaign pushing convenience and product customization and a nationwide coupon mailing in the united states online advertising was emphasized with the release a facebook gaming application it called the tender  limited time offersedit the windows  whopper a whopper sandwich with seven patties that was an lto product tiein with microsoft in japan for the introduction of windows  to generate additional sales bk will occasionally introduce limited time offers lto that are versions of its core products or new products intended for either long or shortterm sales many of these lto products focus on core menu products such as the whopper which has featured variations such as the texas double whopper with added jalapeños bacon and pepperjack cheese other ltos include allnew sandwiches like the chickn crisp sandwich now a permanent item in many regions and test products such as the companys great american burger which was an attempt at a premium sandwich in  it was made with a whopper patty and several new ingredients including a bakerystyle bun peppered bacon wholeleaf as opposed to shredded lettuce seasoned mustard and a special sauce the burger was served with american cheese mayonnaise tomato and onions a similar burger was tested in wisconsin in  that great american burger featured a single  oz  g burger patty and different toppings it was designed to be cooked on a forerunner of the current batch broilernotes  other lto products sought to expand existing product lines with new base ingredients the companys  offering a meatloaf specialty sandwich was introduced as part of a push into limited table service other lto variants in its specialty sandwich line included an italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways with onions and peppers parmigianastyle with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce or with all four ingredients steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later restructured beef other offerings were a ham and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise lettuce and tomato and a veal parmigiana sandwich trendsedit the company is not above following trends within the fast food and fast casual industry two of examples of this can be seen in some of its former products the companys first wrap product called a bk wrapper was introduced in north america as a breakfast option in april  with a lunchdinner version offered in september  these products were in response to industry trends towards products that are easier to consume on the go and to trends that began in  regarding smaller foods originally a limited time offernotes  the lunchdinner version of this product was sold as a regional item through late  when they were eliminated due to weakening sales the  introduction of bk burger shots burger kings version of sliders was part of a wider trend in the restaurant industry for this type of sandwich european locations sell them as the bk six pack the variation sold in the uk and ireland is called the angus  pack it is six small burgers that are attached together in the united states they are based on the burger bundlesburger buddies products of the s which were originally inspired by the similar products

fries with ketchup inventure added a third flavor onion rings in  a second licensed product the companys childoriented bk fresh apple fries was licensed for sale in supermarkets in  to the cruch pak company the company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity they will not be concentrating their resources on them and will be investing the licensing fees into the companys marketing fund industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme with rob frankel author of the book the revenge of brand x stating just because you can do something does not mean you shouldnotes  the licensing deals have proven successful broad street has expanded the product line to seventeen countries across the globe while increasing selection to more than a half dozen products designed to mimic the flavors of some of burger kings core menu products the success of the product line and licensing deals garnered the companies an award for brand extension of the year from license global magazine and earned them a nomination for best corporate license of the year from the licensing industry merchandisers association conagra foods entered into a licensing agreement with burger king in  for a new line of microwavable french fry products the new products are king krinkz which are seasoned crinklecut fries king kolossalz an extralarge package of fries and king

sandwich sold by burger king in sweden burger king has introduced several new products that performed well in testing but did not catch on with the public the failure of the bk baguette line of sandwiches is an example a product that did not meet corporate expectations another earlier failure was the bullseye barbecue burger the sandwich consisted of two sidebyside hamburger patties american cheese and bacon with bullseye barbecue brand barbecue sauce the sandwich was served on the same  in  cm roll as the specialty sandwiches later it was sold as a traditionalstyle double cheeseburger in  during its time under the ownership of britainbased grand metropolitan burger king experimented with table service after  pm customers would place their order at the counter and their order would be brought to them at their table customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal to coincide with the offering a series of meals called the dinner baskets were introduced the dinner baskets included the whopper dinner basket steak sandwich dinner basket fried chicken dinner basket and shrimp dinner basket in the new england region of the united states bk sold a fried clam basket the dinner came with two sides including a choice of a side salad cole slaw french fries or baked potato lasting approximately a year the sitdown restaurant concept was abandoned in  in favor of the original quickservice formula another failed product this time under grand metropolitans successor diageo was the bk back porch grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty served on a bakerystyle roll there were two varieties the regular served with mayonnaise whole leaf iceberg lettuce tomato and grilled onions and the bacon cheddar with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese there was one lto variety the black stack griller made with black strap barbecue sauce a strong molassesflavored sauce bacon lettuce and tomato to promote men in black ii the griller patty was flavored so that it had a taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoalfired grill one of its international failures was the bk crown jewels line of sandwiches originally sold in new zealand these larger adultoriented sandwiches were made with fried and grilled chicken or a whopper patty and a variety of toppings and served on a kaiser roll toppings included a mango lime sauce avocado aioli a cajun spiced sauce and relish originally successful the sandwiches piqued the interest of burger kings corporate offices and were being considered for a potential global rollout however interest in the product faded and they were discontinued introduced as a direct challenge of corporate rival mcdonalds the big king was burger kings response to the big mac and had a similar style and tastenotes  the sandwich was originally introduced in  under the name double supreme during its testing stage the name was switched to big king when it was introduced nationally in  and again to the king supreme when reintroduced in  the sandwich was discontinued in the north american market in the mids in november  burger king brought the big king back to the

sara lees douwe egberts brand bk joe was burger kings coffee line that was first introduced in  in north america and later in parts of europenotes  advertised as being made from arabica coffee the product was made using douwes cafitesse system a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans in favor of a beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added sara lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor the product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as starbucks but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee despite the investment in the douwe egbert product burger king announced it would be phasing out the cafitesse system in the

anheuserbusch including budweiser bud lite and miller lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature the move designed to target the important andunder demographic has been called risky by

founded shortly after establishment of burger king primarily served the companyowned stores and – percent of franchised stores franchise groups were free to purchase supplies from one of seventeen
