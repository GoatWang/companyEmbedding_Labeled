citrus growers association tsb sugar small cane growers association scga events contact us welcome to ada     chairperson   dr martha tshitshi mbatha   promoting agribusiness through partnerships  knowledge  the agribusiness development agency ada has been in existence for just over five years to deal with supporting emerging black commercial farmers especially in the land reform programme as the raison d’etre a number of land reform farms were on the brink of collapse due a number of reasons including lack of farming skills by the new owners and overindebtedness the period during which the ada was established was also marked by unprecedented food price hikes and a world economy in recession the ada recorded some remarkable success during its first five years of existence notwithstanding numerous challenges that were faced by the entity  recently the ada and the department of agriculture and rural development dard completed a clarification of roles exercise which has culminated in a revised new mandate for the ada the ada has shifted its focus to on the whole value chain in the agriculture commonly referred to as agribusiness although the emphasis is on valueaddition to primary agriculture product the realignment process between dard and the ada came at an opportune time when the ada had started drafting the new five year strategy which would place the entity squarely at the centre of agribusiness development in kwazulunatal  the ada has crafted a new strategy as a response to the needs of sector having done an environmental scan and identified the niche that is intents satisfying it should be noted that this strategy has been crafted by and large by the ada itself albeit that some external assistance was sought to clarify and sharpen the strategy it is in this regard that i would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the ada management and the staff at large lastly i would like to thank members of the ada board of trustees for their commitment in ensuring that this strategy is crafted accordingly and completed timely as this one of the most important responsibility of the board  i believe that the new strategic direction will position the ada as an expert organisation in the agribusiness par excellence in the province of kwazulunatal and beyond   ada mandate  the agribusiness development agency ada is a catalytic vehicle that facilitates the growth of a strong transformed diversified dynamic competitive and sustainable agroprocessing industry in kwazulunatal in collaboration with the department of agriculture and rural development dard it serves as a catalyst for agribusiness development in the province through focussing on projects that are catalytic in nature and have the following attributes•    benefits beyond direct beneficiaries •    economic spinoffs •    embrace the whole value chain •    speed up the development in the whole geographical area what we do knowledge and
