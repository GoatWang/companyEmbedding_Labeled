administration of financial leasing companies” existing management system of financial leasing company in china recent activities of leasing industry in china why does chinese government keen on promoting leasing industry study  aeroleasing in china industry study – shipleasing in china industry study – healthcare equipment   what is financial leasing financial leasing is a new type of leasing originated from us nearly  years ago it allows the lease provider to provide lessee with equipments they need and allow the lessee to “use” the above equipments by simply paying fixed installments while the lease provider still retain the rights and ownerships of the equipments before end of the leasing contract from practical point of view financial leasing is somehow very much similar to the bank loan and hire purchase however it makes really big difference in legal and accounting point of senses since the property right is retained by the lease provider eg leasing company and lessee have the right to use only at the end of terms the lessee can return the assets buy –back for the preset amount or finance the option under the leasing arrangement the corporations need not to provide any warranty and other entanglements that are usually associated with bank loan and hire purchase moreover with less upfront cash outlay the corporations can have better cash flow management and don’t have to make any big cash payments for the lease providers they can shift their risks since the lease contracts are consented based on the request and choice of lease meanwhile the manufacturers and suppliers benefit greatly by greater sales volumes and less credit risks exposed to creditors financial leasing has become the nextbest and effective financing tool in the world as financial leasing can effectively boost the sales of productive assets eg equipments there is also a strong connection between development of financial leasing and the rate of economic growth in us over  of the capitals investments are financed by financial leasing and it even overtake bank loans in the areas of automobiles aircrafts and office equipments most of the leasing companies usually share common background of commercial banks and manufacturers and their presence usually positively influence the economic growth of the country     development of financial leasing industry in china history  laws as early as july  the chinese government already tried to defined the standards for ordinary leasing terms in article  of “economic contract law of people’s republic of china”  afterwards the government had further given some practical regulatory guidelines  regulations in the “laws of people’s republic of china on chineseforeign contractual joint ventures” and “contract laws of people’s republic of china” during the period a couple of local banks like industrial  commercial bank of china icbc agricultural bank of chinaabc bank of china boc china construction bank ccb and other banks like china citic bank bank of communications bocom china investment bank successively participated in the leasing market directly or indirectly the improper business environment and inappropriate management forced the chinese government to ban the commercial banks from taking part in the leasing business since the asian financial crisis in  in gaining membership in the wto the chinese government undertook various commitments including opening up china’s financial services industry to foreign companies the government also wanted to diversify its financing channels available to small and medium sized enterprises all these factors had driven china to reinitiate its efforts to promote financial leasing industry and the national people congress had took up the responsibility of drafting process of a new comprehensive leasing laws the procedure to produce the leasing law began in  with the formation of a legislation steering committee “steering committee” by the national people’s congress subsequently a working group was established to draft an outline of the leasing law and solicited comments from the local legislatures government agencies business leaders and experts from all over the country in  the official draft of the leasing law had been proposed to the steering committee and the committee resubmitted it to the finance and economic commission for second review since then the international businessmen started exploring the potentials of the market and the market was opened up to single foreign investor since  however the low market acceptance level and the limited choices for leasing product still greatly hindered the development of the industry thus the leasing market was unavoidably almost dominated by the foreign companies nevertheless with china’s low penetration rate and high gdp growth rate it is believed that china is still having huge potential in leasing market     what is the “measures for administration of financial leasing companies” the amended “measures for administration of financial leasing companies” which came effective in st march  allowed both local and overseasincorporated commercial banks to set up financial leasing companies the new regulations gave financial leasing a fresh opportunity to take root in the world’s fourth largest economy it requested that only the banks big leasing companies established manufacturers and other authorized business entities can be eligible for being the “major shareholder” eg more than  of the share holdings in the leasing companies the banks should have been regarded as newblood to energize the industry meanwhile the reinforcement of the proper supervision of industry created a better environment for the development of the industry all of the above the rejuvenation on financial leasing definitely has brought banking industry into a new era regulatory requirements for leasing companies summary from amended “measures for administration of financial leasing companies”   local banks local leasing companies leasing companies with background of manufacturers capital adequacy ratio not less than      total assets latest  year not less than rmb

company in china in the regulatory area china has a dualsystem under which the leasing companies are under supervision of two different legal entities  china banking regulatory commission cbrc and ministry of commerce mofcom now jointly conduct examination and approval rights for the leasing companies in china the issues of “measures for administration of financial leasing companies” and promulgated cbrc issued in  but revised in march  and “measures for administration of foreign investment in the leasing industry” issued by the mofcom in february  had initially provided an overview of the general regulatory regime for the financial leasing industry the key changes introduced by cbrc measures and major differences between financial leasing companies regulated by cbrc and mofcom leasing companies supervised by cbrc there are a total of  financial leasing companies and some enterprise group financial companies and trust leasing companies regulated by cbrc by end of  to rough estimation the values of their leased assets would be around rmb  billion these companies are regarded as financial leasing companies supervised by mofcom up to  more than  sinoforeign joint ventures and a few solely foreignfunded financial leasing companies are regulated by mofcom the values of their leased assets would be rmb  billion     recent activities of leasing industry in china date

setup for  years and held  of the stake afterwards the leasing company renamed as zhejiang financial leasing company this was regarded as the first merge and acquisition case in the local leasing industry     why does chinese government keen on promoting leasing advantages of financial leasing china is a country of few per capita resources through leasing it may save energy and resources and enable one variety of equipment to be used by several enterprises additionally the equipments can be recycled as manufacturers can repair and renovate old equipment for after leasing contracts which is also in line with the environmental protection policy of the government recently the china government is heavily promoting a contractive monetary policy and financial leasing itself is totally in line with the prevailing macroclimate under the tightened monetary climate the banks would inevitably tighten its credit lines and financial leasing would become the most effective use of financing in addition the chinese government would like to use this financial product to stimulate healthy economic growth since the national capital would be channeled to the creation of productivity and future incomes gdp under financial leasing particularly it really serves the purpose of helping the small and medium corporations especially for those with greatest difficulties in financing and hardest to provide any warranty for bank loans these companies make up  of the total number of business enterprises  of the total industrial productivity  of the total tax incomes and  of the total employment finally china is encouraging the hightech industry which is characterized by frequent replacement of equipment leasing would be a good choice for these companies since they need no warranty and little upfront cash for these purchases rising civil aviation market what is more the china’s civil aviation sector is expanding fast despite an aviation slump in the world the prospects of china’s jet market are enormous   copyright  currentdategetdate echo currentdateyear china financial leasing group all rights reserved disclaimer about powerchip englishchinese about powerchipcompany

—david roberts vox“this is the ideal environmental sciences textbook—only it is too interesting and inspiring to be called a textbook” —peter kareiva director of the institute of the environment and sustainability ucla“drawdown is not just a project—it is an adventure it is a promising story that has the potential to engage every person on the planet with at least one solution to climate change whether it is educating girls improved rice cultivation creating walkable cities eating a plantrich diet household recycling or any of the other solutions”—karen obrien cchange“drawdown is an exceptional example of cooperation between some of the sharpest thinkers on climate and energy matters an atlas that has the potential to save the planet”—andreas kuhlmann ceo german energy agency“it will give you the best kind of hope the kind that balances realism with radical vision    stabilizing the climate system will require a heroic global effort but the point here is only to show that    such an effort can do more than merely succeed that it can succeed well and open into futures that we can actually bear to contemplate”—tom athanasiou the nation“the paul hawken presentation i just experienced at telluride mountainfilm was simply the best speech i have ever heard and not so incidentally also the most important to come at the world’s most important issue in an entirely novel fashion is a monumental feat”— tom peters american writer on business management practices best known for in search of excellence“in the course of some years of investigating and writing about global warming i’ve become all too familiar with that dynamic of gloomdoomshamefearapathy and i think hawken has put his finger on exactly why we haven’t made more policy progress the biggest anchor dragging behind this boat isn’t climate denial or even indifference but i suspect the almost unspeakably deep defeatist conviction that no response really matters because we are already so thoroughly screwed i’m vulnerable to that despair at times and maybe you are too if so read this book — not just as an antidote to fear and despair but as foundation for understanding and supporting the kinds of change that really could be coming and at every scale from your household to your company your community your county and state and national government”—ron meador minnpost“i am blown away by drawdown like hearing an advance copy of sergeant pepper back in the day”—john elkington ceo volans author and world authority on sustainable development “be kindly unto the scientists for they may just save our skin—and make us happier and wealthier in the bargain    an optimistic program for getting out of our current mess well deserving of the broadest possible readership”—kirkus review “a rigorous and profoundly important resource”—donna seaman booklist “with a climatedenying party controlling the government it can seem that there’s no hope    but a new book might change that—and serve as a blueprint for what comes next if the us government and the global community begins to aggressively focus on altering the climate future drawdown is likely the most comprehensive model of climate solutions ever made”—fast company “drawdown is a magnificent achievement”—greg watson schumacher center for new economics “this is one of the most powerful hopeful worldchanging documents a deeply peer reviewed fully winwin nearly noregrets pathway    with a surprising ranking of the most important and impactful solutions paul hawken’s simple elegant genius in leading this approach can inspire rapid catalytic action ”—andy lipkis treepeople“a bold plan to beat back climate change based on solutions already within our grasp”—outside magazine“at a time when the trump administration is working to dismantle much of the nation’s efforts to minimize climate change paul hawken’s new book swoops onto the scene like a knight in shining armor    the book’s release couldn’t possibly come at a better time refreshingly absent of political analysis it’s grounded in scientific reality and will likely go a long way toward inciting people to action”—the portland tribune “drawdown is likely the most hopeful thing you’ll ever read about our ability to take on global warming” —joel makower greenbiz   “this book is a beautiful inspiring and deeply satisfying read most importantly it is no more doom and gloom it is optimistic and empowering paul hawken is a true visionary and a brilliant voice for real solutions” —jessica rolph founding partner happy family “it’s so brilliant    a

interested in whats this history  out of  stars  out of  stars is this feature helpful yes no thank you for your feedback top customer reviews out of  starswonderful albeit incompletebyherbon may  format paperbackverified purchasedrawdown is long overdue as with all of hawkens writings its well conceived carefully researched and beautifully written thank goodness for this effort yeti looked in vain for the evidence that the remedies discussed will materially change the trajectory of projected temperature increases how much below  c will we stabilize at with full implementation of these  remedies according to the book even the most aggressive scenario they model only reduces co by less than one gigaton out of about  gigatons we spew each year and that isnt until  that means that were still doomedim also puzzled that the book is called the most comprehensive plan every proposed to reverse global warming its not a plan it is a painstakingly researched compendium of currently used and and projected remedies as such its an essential contribution to our collective knowledge about climate change action a plan however would have a set of goals objectives strategies indicators and more perhaps paul or others are now working to transform this solid beginning into a real plan as a long time planner id be happy to helpthere is also little discussion about the single most important variable affecting whether we retain a livable planet  and that is time  or lack of it most all comprehensive analyses conclude that were essentially out of time to avoid the most existentially dangerous consequences of climate chaos its wildly optimistic and unsupported by the evidence to suggest as drawdown does that we can reverse climate change even if most of these remedies are not fully implemented until unless we almost fully decarbonize and drawdown in a decade or two were doomed to   degrees f of warming by the end of the century that level of warming will destabilize our politics our economy our food production our social cohesion and our infrastructure to such an extreme degree that the organized productive work necessary to implement these remedies will be next to impossible to sustainand even were we by some near miracle to stabilize at the  c target well have a barely habitable planet despite the conventional climate wisdom theres little that is scientific about the  c target its a convenient political decision that puts the need for urgent action far into the future we can see the severe consequences on our ice caps our coral reefs and our weather with only  c warming todaytheres also the moral hazard risk of the optimistic drawdown message we already have too much climate complacency yet reading drawdown suggests that the market and human creativity is enough  or almost enough  to reverse climate change without mass mobilization and radical changes in how we invest regulate consume and organize our daily livesi write this critique with hesitancy given the enormous trust i have in pauls good intentions and the admirable efforts of his  person working group but we need to do so much more and much faster than what drawdown describes so i hope paul will integrate that perspective into his continuing efforts at showing us the best path forwardread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starscoffee table quality paperback price  makes an amazing giftbyjen bouldenon april  format paperbackverified purchaseafter spending the last  years being actively involved in the green movement i have to confess that ive been guilty of thinking game over when it comes to the fate of our very own human race especially considering the current administration but also because of population growth increased meat production to meet the demand of a new middle class in china and many many other things however thank god i got to learn more about what my amazing friend paul hawken has been up to the past few years you see he didnt give up quite the opposite he doubled down he started a nonprofit with his own money called drawdown  and the result is this beautifully illustrated book with the top  things we can do to reverse global warming turns out its totally possible ex theres a type of seaweed that when fed to cows reduces their methane emissions by  and growing the seaweed helps reverse the acidification in the dead zones of our oceans methane is a huge contributor to global warming if you want to change your feelings from game over to game on i totally recommend getting this book its truly brilliant and so inexpensive for how big and beautiful it is this is a coffee table quality book in a paperback form so so beautifully done on all levels

editionverified purchasethis book is inspiring and superbly organized the solutions appear to be impeccably researched analyzed and clearly presented there are now many books about climate change most are largely reiterations of the same concepts and are typically short on solutions this one is different it is laser focused on solutions and puts them into clear and compelling context we needed a comprehensive assessment and presentation of what can be done to avoid global catastrophe now we have it highly recommendedread more comment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to

recovery being utilized and exploredthe writing was easy to understand without watering down the science the later section about ideas being tried but not yet to be the point of being replicated by others was very interesting it convinces me this issue is solvable and that many are working worldwide to ensure the survival of our planet i posted a number of quotes on facebook encouraging others to read the book and labeled it must read so hopefully others will also read and share ive read several very good nonfiction books but this would be valuable for all to readread morecomment one person

avert climate change catastrophe it is well written and actually interesting to read well laid out with good graphics considering that there is no single solution to this looming crisis having such a fair balanced description of possible efforts is a huge contribution though it is a lot to absorb because it is organized by category eg energy agriculture transportation with a specific topic or

topic particularly with our current administration it is well balanced and very thorough in its treatment of each selected program while none of this books plan is a final solution each taken separately can contribute to solving this crisis even though many of us in our group are scientists or engineers we all were introduced to new ideas too bad the book is not more widely read particularly by those who could introduce many of the books ideas to our government all of us learned about many new topics and now realize that several can be introduced to us in our every day lives

purchasefirst let me say that the reorganization of text and code embodied in the sixth edition of the opengl superbible was a good move oh i have a few gripes and grumbles relating to the reorganization eg it seems like chapter  will never end it could be split deferring pieces to later and appropriate contexts the reorganization of the sample code is a good step forward there is less dependence on mysterious libraries and the essential support code has been reorganized into a more attractive “framework”be prepared for a lot of emphasis on shader programming face up to it it’s the nature of the modern beast if you’re not ready for that one suggestion is to start with an earlier edition – one that focuses on earlier versions of opengl and then grow to love ithaving gone through many aborigines are said to have a ternary number system   many editions of the superbible i find it necessary to keep a copy of a corresponding redbook opengl programming guide edition handy in that sense i find the superbible to be an essential learning aid but …it was indeed unfortunate to find that the current authors and publisher continued to follow the habits of previous authors and publishers of walking away from what i view as their responsibility to their readership others have complained about the quality of the black and white illustrations they were correct the printing of screenshots is terrible the majority of the current authors are experienced authors a they should have avoided the problem b the editor should have caught the problem before going to press c the printer should have called attention to the problem before committing to a run there is no consistent way of tying a screenshot or a code listing to a project name in the source code provided as a download on the book’s web site i made it a point to deduce by one means or another the project name from the text or code if the project name was not explicitly mentioned which was the usual case the authors could have provided an index in the download’s readme file in the preface an author states “we made a bunch of mistakes – we’re certain of it … if you think you see something that doesn’t quite gel check the book’s web site for errata” i’m writing this review in june  almost a year after publication of the book there are no errata on the web site moreover there is no mechanism for submitting errata the code i downloaded dated november  built on visual studio  successfully all but a few projects executed without error i found the distribution for vs  available on github to be useless apparently the last person to build it built it with vs  i considered submitting an issue but got discouraged when i saw that the last commits were made seven or eight months ago the book’s appendix c describes two tools ktxtool and ddsktx which it says is available in the source code not so i searched for but could not find an opengl superbible forum the best i could find was the general opengl forum the last blog entry on the book’s web site is dated february  apparently the authors have better things to doin scoring a rating for this edition of the opengl superbible i started with five stars after all i consider it and the redbook to be essential components to learning opengl then because of the lousy illustrations and the authors’ neglect i backed off two stars a onestar deduction would not have been enoughit occurs to me that all of the problems enumerated above could be resolved on the book’s web site i would be glad to improve my rating if the authors or even someone else would step up to addressing themread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starswell organized thorough and readablebynajati imamon october  format paperbackverified purchasethis book has been a critical part of me getting started with opengl i had a general understanding of d graphics and limited experience with directd but it had been a while and i found opengl to be fairly intimidating especially since immediate mode was deprecated opengl superbible has gotten me past the intimidation and initial hurdles in pretty short order theres a lot to opengl but the book presents it plainly and clearly the tone is clear above all else its light and personal but not super familiar or cheeky  it strikes a good balancethe clear introduction to the pipeline and the lucid and wellexplained code examples have gotten me going far faster than i would have expected after reading part i of the book im familiar enough with the basics that im already working on my project in earnest and reading the rest of the book either as reference and as i have time the writing continues to be clear and the figures are really clear on the kindle both on phone and tablet the code samples can be a little difficult on a narrow screen but thats just the nature of reading code on a phonei think anyone entering the opengl world should be warned that it opengl is a bit of a mess especially if youre trying to target multiple platforms and be reasonably backwards compatible this book is about a particular version of opengl and as its not intended as a history lesson doesnt do a tremendous amount to be clear about the differences between versions itll take some independent work on the readers part to come to understand which version of gl suites their purposes best and then a bit more work to understand what parts of the book dont apply to that version having said that i am targeting opengl glsl  and have had no trouble applying my new understanding and only a couple hiccups using the bits of the code ive copiedon that note i tend to write my samples from scratch when learning a technology so i end up copypasting pieces of the samples and not just using them whole hog given this style the code download works well i havent tried to build the samplesoverall complaints about difficultly with the code samples on certain platforms and difficulties with color figures in a black and white book which is acknowledged by the author seem pretty insignificant when compared with the clarity of the writing the organization of the content and the availability of a code download highly recommendedread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsbest opengl bible yetbyrobin t wernickon march  format paperbackverified purchaseany comprehensive graphics rendering system is understandably complex introducing it requires detailed modeling of the properties of light transmission reflection and combination defining the interface to such a system requires detailed organization and a proper introduction to the reader these are difficult to accomplish without an outstanding degree of knowledge of the subject and an admirable presentation this book raises the standard for opengl tutorials while keeping up with the ever increasing capability of the apithere has been a lot of unbridled dissatisfaction with former versions of this book some of it has undeniable validity and i think that none of it applies to this version the  pages of this book cover the opengl api very well and provide enough examples of the more complex operations to satisfy all but the most hardened curmudgeon look the subject fills a full year of study so dont expect any author to provide the full  pages it deserves a lot of thinking and experimenting is required to master this subject for any api its not a one stop or single volume operation i cover both directx and opencl api
