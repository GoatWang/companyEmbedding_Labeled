firms business model and brand for a prescribed period of time the word franchise is of anglofrench derivation—from franc meaning free—and is used both as a noun and as a transitive verb for the franchisor the franchise is an alternative to building chain stores to distribute goods that avoids the investments and liability of a chain the franchisors success depends on the success of the franchisees the franchisee is said to have a greater incentive than a direct employee because they have a direct stake in the business thirtythree countries—including the united states and australia—have laws that explicitly regulate franchising with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising franchising is also used as a

franchising  homebased franchises  see also  references  external links historyedit the boom in franchising did not take place until after world war ii nevertheless the rudiments of modem franchising date back to the middle ages when landowners made franchiselike agreements with tax collectors who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over the practice ended around  but spread to other endeavors for example in th century england franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries there was little growth in franchising though until the midth century when it appeared in the united states for the first time one of the first successful american franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named john s pemberton in  he concocted a beverage comprising sugar molasses spices and cocaine which is no longer an ingredient pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink which is now known as cocacola his was one of the earliest—and most successful—franchising operations in the united states the singer company implemented a franchising plan in the s to distribute its sewing machines the operation failed though because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well the dealers who had exclusive rights to their territories absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts some failed to push singer products so competitors were able to outsell the company under the existing contract singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives so the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold the experiment proved to be a failure that may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed but it was by no means the last even colonel sanders did not initially succeed in his kentucky fried chicken franchising efforts still the singer venture did not put an end to franchising other companies tried franchising in one form or another after the singer experience for example several decades later general motors corporation established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital perhaps the father of modern franchising though is louis kroh liggett in  liggett invited a group of druggists to join a drug cooperative as he explained to them they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases especially if they set up their own manufacturing company his idea was to market private label products about  druggists pooled  of their own money and adopted the name rexall sales soared and rexall became a franchisor the chains success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow although many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another there was little growth in franchising until the early th century and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today as the united states shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles trucks gasoline beverages and a variety of other products the franchisees did little more than sell the products though the sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent consequently franchising was not a growth industry in the united states it was not until the s and s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising the concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit however there were serious pitfalls for investors which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular largest franchised chainsedit a pizza hut franchise the following us listing tabulates the early  ranking of major franchises along with

stations and trucking stations involve substantial investment and require all the attention of a businessperson there are also large franchises like hotels spas and hospitals which are discussed further under technological alliances fees and contract arrangementedit three important payments are made to a franchisor a a royalty for the trademark b reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee and c a percentage of the individual business units sales these three fees may be combined in a single management fee a fee for disclosure is separate and is always a frontend fee a franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period broken down into shorter periods which each require renewal and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location one franchisee may manage several such locations agreements typically last from five to thirty years with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees a franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership it is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license franchise fees are on average  with an additional average marketing fee of   however not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee a franchise can be exclusive nonexclusive or sole and exclusive although franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a franchise disclosure document fdd no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability which depends on how intensively the franchisee works the franchise therefore franchisor fees are typically based on gross revenue from sales and not on profits realized see remuneration various tangibles and intangibles such as national or international advertising training and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor franchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees there are also main master franchisors who obtain the rights to subfranchise in a territory according to the international franchise association approximately  of all businesses in the united states are franchiseeworked rationale and risk shiftedit franchising is one of the only means available to access venture capital without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it after the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk there is also risk for the people buying the franchises however failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups franchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement obligations of the partiesedit each party to a franchise has several interests to protect the franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark controlling the business concept and securing knowhow the franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous there is a great deal of standardization required the place of service has to bear the franchisors signs logos and trademark in a prominent place the uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color the service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations thus franchisees are not in full control of the business as they would be in retailing a service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor a coffee brew for example can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier if the franchisor requires purchase from his stores it may come under antitrust legislation or equivalent laws of other countries so too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs as well as the franchise sites if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor the franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor the fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees the startup costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted there must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the territory if the franchise is worked according to plan the franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant it must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties a franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations often the training period  the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee  is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals the training period must be adequate but in lowcost franchises it may be considered expensive many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online this is in addition to providing literature sales documents and email access also franchise agreements carry no guarantees or warranties and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the nonnegotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge in effect that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated regulationsedit australiaedit in australia franchising is regulated by the franchising code of conduct a mandatory code of conduct concluded under the trade practices act  the accc regulates the franchising code of conduct which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement this code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least  days before the franchise agreement is entered into the code also regulates the content of franchise agreements for example in relation to marketing funds a coolingoff period termination and the resolution of disputes by mediation franchising code of conductedit on  january  the old franchising code was repealed and replaced with a new franchising code of conduct the new code applies to conduct on or after  january  the new code introduces an obligation under the code for parties to act in good faith in their dealings with one another introduces financial penalties and infringement notices for serious breaches of the code requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with a short information sheet outlining the risks and rewards of franchising requires franchisors to provide greater transparency in the use of and accounting for money used for marketing and advertising and to set up a separate marketing fund for marketing and advertising fees requires additional disclosure about the ability of the franchisor and a franchisee to sell online prohibits franchisors from imposing significant capital expenditure except in limited circumstances these are significant changes and it is important that franchisors franchisees and potential franchises understand their rights and responsibilities under the code for further information about the changes to the code please see the updated franchisor compliance manual and the franchisee manual the code explanatory materials are available from the comlaw website link is external new zealandedit new zealand is served by around  franchise systems operating  brands giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world despite or because of the recessionwhich the total number of franchised units increased by  from  to  there is no separate law covering franchises so they are covered by normal commercial law this functions very well in new zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts restrictive trade practices intellectual property and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct the franchise association of new zealand introduced a selfregulatory code of practice for its members in  this contains many provisions similar to those of the australian franchising code of practice legislation although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code a case of fraud in  perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the countrys largest franchise system led to a review of the need for franchise law by the ministry of economic development the new zealand government decided there was no case for franchisespecific legislation at that time this decision was criticised by the opposition which had initiated the review when in power and the review process was questioned by a leading academic the franchise association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo – selfregulation braziledit by the end of  there were about  franchise brands operating in brazil with approximately  locations making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units around  percent of this total were foreignbased franchisors the brazilian franchise law law no  of december   defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee for a payment the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semiexclusive basis the provision of a franchise offer circular or disclosure document is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the brazilian territory failure to disclose voids the agreement which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages the franchise law does not distinguish between brazilian and foreign franchisors the national institute of industrial property inpi is the registering authority indispensable documents are a statement of delivery of disclosure documentation and a certification of recording inpi the latter is necessary for payments all sums may not be convertible into foreign currency certification may also mean compliance with brazils antitrust legislation parties to international franchising may decide to adopt the english language for the document as long as the brazilian party knows english fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact to avoid translation the registration accomplishes three things  it make the agreement effective against third parties  it permits the remittance of payments  it qualifies the franchisee for tax deductions chinaedit china has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small each system in china has an average of  outlets compared to more than  in the united states together there are  brands in some  retail markets kfc was the most significant foreign entry in  and is widespread  many franchises are in fact jointventures as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit for example mcdonalds is a joint venture pizza hut tgif walmart starbucks followed a

goods and services foreign to india is in its infancy the first international exhibition was only held in  india is however one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middleclass of  million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character in a highly diversified society see demographics of india mcdonalds is a success story despite its fares differing from that of the rest of the world so far franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws the contract act  and the specific relief act  which provide for both

present in kazakhstan through the franchise system include pepsi hilton marriott intercontinental and pizza hut europeedit franchising has grown rapidly in europe in recent years but the industry is largely unregulated unlike the united states the european union has not adopted a uniform franchise law only six of the  member states have a precontractual disclosure law they are france  spain  romania  italy  sweden   and belgium  estonia and lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements in spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry although they have no franchise specific laws germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of germany such as austria greece and portugal probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make profranchisee decisions in the uk the recentwhen papa john case shows that there is also a need for precontractual disclosure and the yam seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships the european franchising federations code of ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations however this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous commentators like dr mark abell in his book the law and regulation of franchising in the eu  published in  by edward elgar isbn     consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the eu when adopting a european strategy it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice most often one of the principal tasks in europe is to find retail space which is not so significant a factor in the usa this is where the franchise broker or the master franchisor plays an important role cultural factors are also relevant as local populations tend to be heterogeneous franceedit france is one of europes largest markets similar to the united states it has a long history of franchising dating back to the s growth came in the s the market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics yet mcdonalds and century  are found everywhere there are some  us firms involved in franchising in france there are no government agencies regulating franchises the loi doubin law of  was the first european franchise disclosure law combined with decree no  it regulates disclosure although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name trademark or trade name or other business arrangements the law applies to exclusive or quasiexclusive territory the disclosure document must be delivered at least  days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made the specific and important disclosures to be made are the date of the founding of the franchisors enterprise and a summary of its business history and all information necessary to assess the business experience of the franchisor including bankers a description of the local market for the goods or services the franchisors financial statements for the previous two years a list of all other franchisees currently in the network all franchisees who have left the network during the preceding year whether by termination or nonrenewal and the conditions for renewal assignment termination and the scope of exclusivity initially there was some uncertainty whether any breach of the provisions of the doubin law would enable the franchisee to walk away from the contract however the french supreme court cour de cassation eventually ruled that agreements should only be annulled where missing or incorrect information affected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the agreement the burden of proof is on the franchisee  dispute settlement features are only incorporated in some european countries by not being rigorous franchising is encouraged italyedit under italian law franchise  is defined as an arrangement between two

subject to the same laws that govern other businesses there is some selfregulation through the british franchise association bfa there are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the bfa and many which do not meet the bfa membership criteria part of the bfas role in selfregulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting bfa standards a number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the bfa code of ethics are therefore excluded from membership on  may  hearings were held in the uk parliament concerning citizeninitiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the uk due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises the minister of industry margaret hodge conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security mr mark prisk mp suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the bfa the minister of industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks the current laws governing business contracts in the uk offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks the debate also made reference to the selfregulatory function performed by the bfa recognizing that the association

motels the s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the us interstate highway system and the growing popularity of fast food in the united states the federal trade commission has oversight of franchising rather than the us securities and exchange commission the ftc administrates oversight via the ftc franchise rule the ftc requires that the franchisee be
