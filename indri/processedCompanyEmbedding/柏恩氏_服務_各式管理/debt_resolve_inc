or creditor the borrower may be a sovereign state or country local government company or an individual the lender may be a bank credit card company payday loan provider or an individual debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest a simple way to understand interest is to see it as the rent a person owes on money that they have borrowed to the bank from which they borrowed the money loans bonds notes and mortgages are all types of debt the term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value for example in western cultures a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a debt of gratitude to the second person contents

term debt was first used in the late th century the term debt comes from dette from old french dete from latin debitum thing owed neuter past participle of debere to owe originally keep something away from someone from de away see de  habere to have see habit n restored spelling was used after c  the related term debtor was first used in english also in the early th century the terms dettur dettour came from old french detour from latin debitor a debter from past participle stem of deberethe b was restored in later french and in english c c  in the king james bible various spellings are used the spellings detter are used three times debter three times debtor twice and debtour once  termsedit interestedit interest is the fee paid by the borrower to the lender interest is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding principal which percentage is known as an interest rate and is generally paid periodically at intervals such as monthly or semiannually interest rates may be fixed or floating in floatingrate structures the rate of interest that the borrower pays during each time period is tied to a benchmark such as libor or in the case of inflationindexed bonds inflation there are many different conventions for calculating interest depending on the terms of the debt compound interest may accumulate at a specific interval in addition different day count conventions exist for example sometimes each month is considered to have exactly thirty days such that the interest payment due is the same in each calendar month the annual percentage rate apr is a standardized way to calculate and compare interest rates on an annual basis quoting interest rates using apr is required by regulation for most loans to individuals in the united states and united kingdom for some loans the amount actually loaned to the debtor is less than the principal sum to be repaid this may be because upfront fees or points are charged or because the loan has been structured to be shariacompliant the additional principal due at the end of the term has the same economic effect as a higher interest rate this is sometimes referred to as a bankers dozen a play on bakers dozen – owe twelve a dozen receive a loan of eleven a bankers dozen note that the effective interest rate is not equal to the discount if one borrows  and must repay  then this is –   percent interest however if one borrows  and must repay  then this is –   percent interest repaymentedit there are three main ways repayment may be structured the entire principal balance may be due at the maturity of the loan the entire principal balance may be amortized over the term of the loan or the loan may partially amortized during its term with the remaining principal due as a balloon payment at maturity amortization structures are common in mortgages and credit cards default provisionsedit debtors of every type default on their debt from time to time with various consequences depending on the terms of the debt and the law governing default in the relevant jurisdiction if the debt was secured by specific collateral such as a car or home the creditor may seek to repossess the collateral in more serious circumstances individuals and companies may go into bankruptcy riskier borrowers must generally pay higher rates of interest to compensate lenders for taking on the additional risk of default debt investors assess the risk of default prior to making a loan for example through credit scores and corporate and sovereign ratings types of borrowersedit individualsedit common types of debt owed by individuals and households include mortgage loans car loans and credit card debt for individuals debt is a means of using anticipated income and future purchasing power in the present before it has actually been earned commonly people in industrialized nations use consumer debt to purchase houses cars and other things too expensive to buy with cash on hand people are more likely to spend more and get into debt when they use credit cards vs cash for buying products and services this is primarily because of the transparency effect and consumer’s pain of paying the transparency effect refers to the fact that the further you are from cash as in a credit card or another form of payment the less transparent it is and the less you remember how much you spent the less transparent or further away from cash the form of payment employed is the less an individual feels the “pain of paying” and thus is likely to spend more furthermore the differing physical appearanceform that credit cards have from cash may cause them to be viewed as “monopoly” money vs real money luring individuals to spend more money than they would if they only had cash available besides these more formal debts private individuals also lend informally to other people mostly relatives or friends one reason for such informal debts is that many people in particular those who are poor have no access to affordable credit such debts can cause problems when they are not paid back according to expectations of the lending household in   percent of people in the european union reported their households has been in arrears that is unable to pay as scheduled payments related to informal loans from friends or relatives not living in your household businessesedit a company may use various kinds of debt to finance its operations as a part of its overall corporate finance strategy a term loan is the simplest form of corporate debt it consists of an agreement to lend a fixed amount of money called the principal sum or principal for a fixed period of time with this amount to be repaid by a certain date in commercial loans interest calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year will also have to be paid by that date or may be paid periodically in the interval such as annually or monthly such loans are also colloquially called bullet loans particularly if there is only a single payment at the end – the bullet – without a stream of interest payments during the life of the loan a syndicated loan is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan a syndicated loan is provided by a group of lenders and is structured arranged and administered by one or several commercial banks or investment banks known as arrangers loan syndication is a risk management tool that allows the lead banks underwriting the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity a company may also issue bonds which are debt securities bonds have a fixed lifetime usually a number of years with longterm bonds lasting over  years being less common at the end of the bonds life the money should be repaid in full interest may be added to the end payment or can be paid in regular installments known as coupons during the life of the bond a letter of credit or lc can also be the source of payment for a transaction meaning that redeeming the letter of credit will pay an exporter letters of credit are used primarily in international trade transactions of significant value for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another they are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities streets sidewalks stormwater ponds etc will be built the parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client almost all letters of credit are irrevocable ie cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary the issuing bank and the confirming bank if any in executing a transaction letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and travelers cheque typically the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice bill of lading and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit however the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped or their place of origin companies also use debt in many ways to leverage the investment made in their assets leveraging the return on their equity this leverage the proportion of debt to equity is considered important in determining the riskiness of an investment the more debt per equity the riskier governmentsedit governments issue debt to pay for ongoing expenses as well as major capital projects government debt may be issued by sovereign states as well as by local governments sometimes known as municipalities the overall level of indebtedness by a government is typically shown as a ratio of debttogdp this ratio helps to assess the speed of changes in government indebtedness and the size of the debt due assessments of creditworthinessedit income metricsedit the debt service coverage ratio is the ratio of income available to the amount of debt service due including both interest and principal amortization if any the higher the debt service coverage ratio the more income is available to pay debt service and the easier and lowercost it will be for a borrower to obtain financing value metricsedit the loantovalue ratio is the ratio of the total amount of the loan to the total value of the collateral securing the loan collateral and recourseedit a debt obligation is considered secured if creditors have recourse to specific collateral collateral may include claims on tax receipts in the case of a government specific assets in the case of a company or a home in the case of a consumer unsecured debt comprises financial obligations for which creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy their claims role of rating agenciesedit specific bond debts owed by both governments and private corporations are rated by rating agencies such as moodys standard  poors fitch ratings and a m best the government or company itself will also be given its own separate rating these agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his obligations and accordingly give him or her a credit rating moodys uses the letters aaa aa a baa ba b caa ca c where ratings aacaa are qualified by numbers  sp and other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters and  qualifiers thus a government or corporation with a high rating would have aaa rating a change in ratings can strongly affect a company since its cost of refinancing depends on its creditworthiness bonds below baabbb moodyssp are considered junk or highrisk bonds their high risk of default approximately  percent for ba is compensated by higher interest payments bad debt is a loan that can not partially or fully be repaid by the debtor the debtor is said to default on his debt these types of debt are frequently repackaged and sold below face value buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but potentially profitable investment debt marketsedit market interest ratesedit main article bond valuation loans versus bondsedit bonds are debt securities tradeable on a bond market a countrys regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security for example in north america each security is uniquely identified by a cusip for trading and settlement purposes in contrast loans are not securities and do not have cusips or the equivalent loans may be sold or acquired in certain circumstances as when a bank syndicates a loan loans can be turned into securities through the securitization process in a securitization a company sells a pool of assets to a securitization trust and the securitization trust finances its purchase of the assets by selling securities to the market for example a trust may own a pool of home mortgages and be financed by residential mortgagebacked securities in this case the assetbacked trust is a debt issuer of residential mortgagebacked securities role of central banksedit central banks such as the us federal reserve system play a key role in the debt markets debt is normally denominated in a particular currency and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the effective size of the debt this can happen due to inflation or deflation so it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same currency criticismsedit main article criticism of debt some argue against debt as an instrument and institution on a personal family social corporate and governmental level islam forbids lending with interest even today in hard times the cost of servicing debt can grow beyond the debtors ability to pay due to either external events income loss or internal difficulties poor management of resources debt will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows through interest this effect may be termed usury while the term usury in other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest in excess of a reasonable profit for the risk accepted in international legal thought odious debt is debt that is incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state such debts are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state international third world debt has reached the scale that many economists are convinced that debt relief or debt cancellation is the only way to restore global equity in relations with the developing nationscitation needed excessive debt accumulation has been blamed for exacerbating economic problems for example before the great depression the debttogdp ratio was very high economic agents were heavily indebted this excess of debt equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets when expectations corrected deflation and a credit crunch followed deflation effectively made debt more expensive and as fisher explained this reinforced deflation again because in order to reduce their debt level economic agents reduced their consumption and investment the reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused further unemployment in a more direct sense more bankruptcies also occurred due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand at the household level debts can also have detrimental effects in particular when households make spending decisions assuming income to increase or remain stable for the years to come when households take on credit based on this assumption life events can easily change indebtedness into overindebtedness such life events include unexpected unemployment relationship breakup leaving the parental home business failure illness or home repairs overindebtedness has severe social consequences such as financial hardship poor physical and mental health family stress stigma difficulty obtaining employment exclusion from basic financial services european commission  work accidents and industrial disease a strain on social relations carpentier and van den bosch  absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment kim et al  feeling of insecurity and relational tensions levels and flowsedit main article debt levels and flows global debt underwriting grew  percent yearoveryear to us trillion during  it is expected to rise in the coming years if the spending habits of millions of people worldwide continue the way they do

specific years budget sequestration in  debtceiling crisis of   financial crisis of – government shutdowns of –  terminology cumulative deficit  interest ≈ debt balance of payments inflation v t e the united states debtceiling crisis of  was a stage in the ongoing political debate in the united states congress about the appropriate level of government spending and its effect on the national debt and deficit the debate centered around the raising of the debt ceiling which is normally raised without debate the crisis led to the passage of the budget control act of  the republican party which had retaken the house of representatives the prior year demanded that the president negotiate over deficit reduction in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling the statutory maximum of money the treasury is allowed to borrow the debt ceiling had routinely been raised in the past without partisan debate and without any additional terms or conditions this reflects the fact that the debt ceiling does not prescribe the amount of spending but only ensures that the government can pay for the spending to which it has already committed itself some use the analogy of an individual paying their bills if the united states breached its debt ceiling and were unable to resort to other extraordinary measures the treasury would have to either default on payments to bondholders or immediately curtail payment of funds owed to various companies and individuals that had been mandated but not fully funded by congress both situations would likely have led to a significant international financial crisis on july  two days prior to when the treasury estimated the borrowing authority of the united states would be exhausted republicans agreed to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for a complex deal of significant future spending cuts the crisis did not permanently resolve the potential of future use of the debt ceiling in budgetary disputes as shown by the subsequent debtceiling crisis of  the crisis sparked the most volatile week for financial markets since the  crisis with the stock market trending significantly downward prices of government bonds treasuries rose as investors anxious over the dismal prospects of the us economic future and the ongoing european sovereigndebt crisis fled into the stillperceived relative safety of us government bonds later that week the creditrating agency standard  poors downgraded the credit rating of the united states government for the first time in the countrys history though the other two major creditrating agencies moodys

spend only if it has sufficient funds to pay for it these funds can come either from tax receipts or from borrowing by the united states department of the treasury congress has set a debt ceiling beyond which the treasury cannot borrow this is similar to a credit limit on a credit card the debt limit does not restrict congress’s ability to enact spending and revenue legislation that affects the level of debt or otherwise constrains fiscal policy it restricts treasury’s authority to borrow to finance the decisions already enacted by congress and the president congress also usually votes on increasing the debt limit after fiscal policy decisions affecting federal borrowing have begun to take effect in the absence of sufficient revenue a failure to raise the debt ceiling would result in the administration being unable to fund all the spending which it is required to do by prior acts of congress at that point the government must cancel or delay some spending a situation sometimes referred to as a partial government shut down in addition the obama administration stated that without this increase the us would enter sovereign default failure to pay the interest andor principal of us treasury securities on time thereby creating an international crisis in the financial markets alternatively default could be averted if the government were to promptly reduce its other spending by about half an increase in the debt ceiling requires the approval of both houses of congress republicans and some democrats insisted that an increase in the debt ceiling be coupled with a plan to reduce the growth in debt there were differences as to how to reduce the expected increase in the debt initially nearly all republican legislators who held a majority in the house of representatives opposed any increase in taxes and proposed large spending cuts a large majority of democratic legislators who held a majority in the senate favored tax increases along with smaller spending cuts supporters of the tea party movement pushed their fellow republicans to reject any agreement that failed to incorporate large and immediate spending cuts or a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget backgroundedit us debt ceiling at the end of each year from  to  the graph indicates which president and which political party controlled congress each year us debt from  to  red lines indicate the debt held by the public net public debt and black lines indicate the total public debt outstanding gross public debt the difference between the two is the debt that is held by the federal government itself the second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of us gdp dollar value of us economic production for that year the top panel is deflated so every year is in  dollars debt ceilingedit see also united states public debt § debt ceiling in the united states the federal government can pay for expenditures only if congress has approved the expenditure in an appropriation bill if the proposed expenditure exceeds the revenues that have been collected there is a deficit or shortfall which can only be financed by the government through the department of the treasury borrowing the shortfall amount by the issue of debt instruments under federal law the amount that the government can borrow is limited by the debt ceiling which can only be increased with a separate vote by congress prior to  congress directly authorized the amount of each borrowing in  in order to provide more flexibility to finance the us involvement in world war i congress instituted the concept of a debt ceiling since then the treasury may borrow any amount needed as long as it keeps the total at or below the authorized ceiling some small special classes of debt are not included in this totalcitation needed to change the debt ceiling congress must enact specific legislation and the president must sign it into law the process of setting the debt ceiling is separate and distinct from the regular process of financing government operations and raising the debt ceiling does not have any direct impact on the budget deficit the us government passes a federal budget every year this budget details projected tax collections and outlays and therefore the amount of borrowing the government would have to do in that fiscal year a vote to increase the debt ceiling is therefore usually seen as a formality needed to continue spending that has already been approved previously by the congress and the president the government accountability office explains the debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations rather it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred the apparent redundancy of the debt ceiling has led to suggestions that it should be abolished altogether the us has had public debt since its inception debts incurred during the american revolutionary war and under the articles of confederation led to the first yearly report on the amount of the debt  on january   every president since harry truman has added to the national debt the debt ceiling has been raised  times since march  including  times under ronald reagan eight times under bill clinton seven times under george w bush and three times as of august update under barack obama as of may update approximately  percent of us government spending relied on borrowed money that is without borrowing the federal government would have had to cut spending immediately by  percent affecting many daily operations of the government besides the impact on the domestic and international economies it is unclear if the treasury has the technological capability to disperse funds to some individuals it owes money the government accountability office reported in february  that managing debt when delays in raising the debt limit occur diverts treasury’s resources away from other cash and debt management responsibilities and that treasury’s borrowing costs modestly increased during debt limit debates in    and  if the interest payments on the national debt are not made the us would be in default potentially causing catastrophic economic consequences for the us and the wider world as well effects outside the us would be likely because the united states is a major trading partner with many countries other major world powers who hold its debt could demand repayment according to the treasury failing to increase the debt limit would    cause the government to default on its legal obligations – an unprecedented event in american history these legal obligations include paying social security and medicare benefits military salaries interest on the debt and many other items making the promised payments of the principal and interest of us treasury securities on time ensures that the nation does not default on its sovereign debt critics have argued that the debt ceiling crisis is selfinflicted as treasury bond interest rates were at historical lows and the us had no market restrictions on its ability to obtain additional creditcitation needed the debt ceiling has been raised  times since  sometimes the increase was treated as routine many times it was used to score political points for the minority party by criticizing the outofcontrol spending of the majority the only other country with a debt limit is denmark which has set its debt ceiling so high that it is unlikely to be reached if raising the limit ceases to be routine this may create uncertainty for global markets each time a debt ceiling increase is debated the debtceiling crisis of  has shown how a party in control of only one chamber of congress in this case republicans in control of the house of representatives but not the senate or the presidency can have significant influence if it chooses to block the routine raising of the debt limit recent concern about budget deficits and longterm debtedit this article or section possibly contains previously unpublished synthesis of published material that conveys ideas not attributable to the original sources relevant discussion may be found on the talk page january  learn how and when to remove this template message see also united states public debt § causes of change in debt underlying the contentious debate over raising the debt ceiling has been an anxiety growing since  about the large united states federal budget deficits and the increasing federal debt according to the congressional budget office cbo at the end of  that debt equaled  percent of the nations annual economic output a little above the year average of  percent since then the figure has shot upward by the end of fiscal year  the congressional budget office cbo projects federal debt will reach roughly  percent of gross domestic product gdp — the highest percentage since shortly after world war ii the sharp rise in debt after  stems largely from lower tax revenues and higher federal spending related to the severe recession and persistently high unemployment in – though a balanced budget is ideal allowing down payment on debt and more flexibility within government budgeting limiting deficits to within  to  of gdp is sufficient to stabilize the debtwhy deficits in  and  were  percent and  percent respectively and the largest as a share of gross domestic product since  in  the tea party movement emerged with a focus on reducing government spending and regulation the tea party movement helped usher in a wave of new republican officeholders in the  midterm elections whose major planks during the campaign included cutting federal spending and stopping any tax increases these new republicans and the new republican house majority greatly affected the  debt ceiling political debate in early  president obama established the bowlessimpson commission to propose recommendations to balance the budget by  the commission issued a report in december  but the recommendations failed to receive enough votes to allow the report to be passed on to congress throughout  standard  poors and moodys credit rating services issued warnings that us debt could be downgraded because of the continued large deficits and increasing debt according to the cbos  longterm budget outlook without major policy changes the large budget deficits and growing debt would continue which would reduce national saving leading to higher interest rates more borrowing from abroad and less domestic investment – which in turn would lower income growth in the united states the european sovereign debt crisis was occurring throughout – and there were concerns that the us was on the same trajectory negative real interest ratesedit since  the us treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt such low rates outpaced by the inflation rate occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies pensions or bond money market and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in treasury securities to hedge against risk lawrence summers matthew yglesias and other economists state that at such low rates government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money and improves creditworthiness in the late s and then again in the early s the us and uk both reduced their debt burden by about  to  of gdp per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low in january  the us treasury borrowing advisory committee of the securities industry and financial markets association unanimously recommended that government debt be allowed to auction even lower at negative absolute interest rates this method of negative real interest rates has been claimed to be a form of financial repression by governments as it is a transfer from creditors savers to borrowers in the historical episode under study herethe government and given that deficit reduction usually involves highly unpopular expenditure reductions and or tax increases of one form or another the relatively stealthier financial repression tax may be a more politically palatable alternative to authorities faced with the need to reduce outstanding debts   resort to extraordinary measuresedit prior to the debt ceiling crisis of  the debt ceiling was last raised on february   to  trillion on april   congress passed the last part of the  united states federal budget in the beginning  authorizing federal government spending for the remainder of the  fiscal year which ended on september  citation needed for the  fiscal year expenditure was estimated at  trillion with expected revenues of  trillion leaving a deficit of  trillion this includes public and federal debt as well as the gdp leaving a budget deficit of  the worlds highest however soon after the  budget was passed the debt ceiling set in february  was reached in a letter to congress of april   treasury secretary timothy geithner explained that when the debt ceiling is reached the us treasury can declare a debt issuance suspension period and utilize extraordinary measures to acquire funds to meet federal obligations but which do not require the issue of new debt such as the sale of assets from the civil service retirement and disability fund and the g fund of the thrift savings plan these measures were implemented on may   when geithner declared a debt issuance suspension period according to his letter to congress this period could last until august   when the department of the treasury projects that the borrowing authority of the united states will be exhausted these methods have been used on several previous occasions in which federal debt neared its statutory limit the august   deadlineedit the us treasury stated on multiple occasions that the us government would exhaust its borrowing authority around august   that date appeared to serve as an effective deadline for congress to vote to increase the debt ceiling while the us treasurys borrowing authority may have been exhausted on august   it retained cash balances that would have enabled it to meet federal obligations for a short time according to barclays capital treasury would run out of cash around august  when  billion in social security payments were due according to wall street analysts treasury would not be able borrow from the capital markets after august  but still would have enough incoming cash to meet its obligations until august  analysts also predicted that treasury would be able to roll over the  billion in us debt that matured on august  and gain additional time to avert the crisis projections required for debt and cash management can be volatile outside experts that track treasury finances had said that announced treasury estimates were within the range of uncertainty for their analyses delaying an increase in the debt limit past august  could have risked a delay in social security and other benefit checks and could have led to disruptions in scheduled treasury auctions implications of not raising the debt ceilingedit experts were divided on how bad the effects of not raising the debt ceiling for a short period would be on the economy while some leading economists including republican adviser douglas holtzeakin suggested even a brief failure to meet us obligations could have devastating longterm consequences others argued that the market would write it off as a congressional dispute and return to normal once the immediate crisis was resolved some argued that the worst outcome would be if the us failed to pay interest andor principal on the national debt to bondholders thereby defaulting on its sovereign debt former treasury secretary lawrence summers warned in july  that the consequences of such a default would be higher borrowing costs for the us government as much as one percent or  billionyear in additional interest costs and the equivalent of bank runs on the money markets and other financial markets potentially as severe as those of september  in january  treasury secretary timothy geithner warned that failure to raise the limit would precipitate a default by the united states default would effectively impose a significant and longlasting tax on all americans and all american businesses and could lead to the loss of millions of american jobs even a very shortterm or limited default would have catastrophic economic consequences that would last for decades senators pat toomey and jim demint expressed deep concern that administration officials were stating or implying that failure to raise the nations debt limit would constitute a default on us debt and precipitate a financial crisis we believe it is irresponsible and harmful for you to sow the seeds of doubt in the market regarding the full faith and credit of the united states and ask that you set the record straight – that you will use all available treasury funds necessary to prevent default while congress addresses the looming debt crisis geithner responded that prioritizing debt would require cutting roughly  percent of all government payments which could only be achieved by selectively defaulting on obligations previously approved by congress he argued that this would harm the reputation of the united states so severely that there is no guarantee that investors would continue to reinvest in new treasury securities forcing the government to repay the principal on existing debt as it matured which it would be unable to do under any conceivable circumstance he concluded there is no alternative to enactment of a timely increase in the debt limit on january   senator toomey introduced the full faith and credit act bill s that would require the treasury to prioritize payments to service the national debt over other obligations the bill was cleared by its committee for consideration the next day and added to the senate calendar of business but no further action had occurred by midaugust  even if the treasury were to prioritize payments on the debt above other spending and avoid formal default on its bonds failure to raise the debt ceiling would force the government to reduce its spending by as much as ten percent of gdp overnight leading to a corresponding fall in aggregate demand economists believe that such a significant shock if sustained would reverse the economic recovery and send the country into a recession proposed resolutionsedit president barack obama met with speaker of the house john boehner on the patio near the oval office on sunday july   during the debt ceiling increase negotiations congress considered whether and by how much to extend the debt ceiling or eliminate it and what longterm policy changes if any should be made concurrently the republican positions on raising the debt ceiling included a dollarfordollar deal that is raise the debt ceiling to match corresponding spending cuts more of the budget cuts in the first two years spending caps a balanced budget amendment – to pass congress and be sent to states for ratification no tax increases but tax reform could be considered one representative ron paul proposed transferring  trillion of federal reserve assets to the government and destroying those bonds thereby reducing the united states gross federal debt by the same amount this would violate the property rights of national banks who own the federal reserve banks the democratic positions on raising the debt ceiling included initially a clean increase or unconditional raise to the debt ceiling with no spending cuts attached spending cuts combined with tax increases on some categories of taxpayers to reduce deficits for example a  spending cut  tax increase ratio initially desired in the congress versus  offered by president obama a large debtceiling increase to support borrowing into  after the next election opposed to any major cuts to social security medicare or medicaid some democratic lawmakers suggested that the president could declare that the debt ceiling violates the us constitution and issue an executive order to direct the treasury to issue more debt the us house of representatives originally refused to raise the debt ceiling without deficit reduction voting down a clean bill to increase the debt ceiling without conditions the may  vote was  to  with all  republicans and  democrats voting to defeat the bill the republicans largely believed a deficit reduction deal should be based solely on spending cuts including cuts to entitlements without any tax increases to reduce or solve the longterm issue of debt obama and the democrats in the us congress wanted an increase in the debt ceiling to solve the shortterm borrowing problem and in exchange supported a decrease in the budget deficit to be funded by a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases some prominent liberal economists such as paul krugman larry summers and brad delong and prominent investors such as bill gross went even further and argued that not only should the debt ceiling be raised but federal spending and therefore the deficit should be increased in the short term as long as the economy remains in the liquidity trap which they believed would stimulate the economy reduce unemployment and ultimately reduce the deficit in the medium to long term some tea party caucus and other republicans however including but not limited to senators jim demint rand paul and mike lee and representatives michele bachmann ron paul and allen west expressed skepticism about raising the debt ceiling with some suggesting the consequences of default are exaggerated arguing that the debt ceiling should not be raised and instead the federal debt should be capped at the current limit although that would oblige the government to cut spending by almost half overnight jack balkin the knight professor of constitutional law and the first amendment at yale law school suggested two other ways to solve the debt ceiling crisis he pointed out that the us treasury has the power to issue platinum coins in any denomination so it could solve the debt ceiling crisis by simply issuing two platinum coins in denominations of  trillion each depositing them into its account in the federal reserve and writing checks on the proceeds another way to solve the debt ceiling crisis balkin suggested would be for the federal government to sell the federal reserve an option to purchase government property for  trillion the federal reserve would then credit the proceeds to the governments checking account once congress lifted the debt ceiling the president could buy back the option for a dollar or the option could simply expire in  days in a report issued by the credit rating agency moodys analyst steven hess suggested that the government should consider getting rid of the limit altogether because the difficulty inherent in reaching an agreement to raise the debt ceiling creates a high level of uncertainty and an increased risk of default as reported by the washington post without a limit dependent on congressional approval the report said the agency would worry less about the governments ability to meet its debt obligations other public figures including democratic expresident bill clinton and republican excbo director douglas holtzeakin have suggested eliminating the debt ceiling possible methods of bypassing the debt ceilingedit fourteenth amendmentedit during the debate some scholars democratic lawmakers and treasury secretary tim geithner suggested that the president could declare that the debt ceiling violates the constitution and issue an executive order to direct the treasury to issue more debt they point to section  of the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution passed in the context of the civil war reconstruction that states that the validity of the public debt shall not be questioned others rebutted this argument by pointing to section  of article  and section  of the fourteenth amendment which state that congress has the power of the purse and the authority to enforce the fourteenth amendment article i section  the congress shall have power   to borrow money on the credit of the united states amendment xiv section  the validity of the public debt of the united states authorized by law including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion shall not be questioned but neither the united states nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the united states or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave but all such debts obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void amendment xiv section  the congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article arguments jack balkin looking into the legislative history of the fourteenth amendment argued that section  was adopted to guard against politicallydetermined default referencing the sponsor of the provision senator benjamin wade balkin argued that the central rationale for section four  was to remove threats of default on federal debts from partisan struggle balkin quotes wade every man who has property in the public funds will feel safer when he sees that the national debt is withdrawn from the power of a congress to repudiate it and placed under the guardianship of the constitution than he would feel if it were left at loose ends and subject to the varying majorities which may arise in congress according to balkin this reveals an important structural principle the threat of defaulting on government obligations is a powerful weapon especially in a complex interconnected world economy devoted partisans can use it to disrupt government to roil ordinary politics to undermine policies they do not like even to seek political revenge section four was placed in the constitution to remove this weapon from ordinary politics bruce bartlett a former adviser to president ronald reagan and columnist for the fiscal times argued that section  renders the debt ceiling unconstitutional and that the president should disregard the debt limit the nation editor katrina vanden heuvel argued that the president could use the public debt section of the fourteenth amendment to force the treasury to continue paying its debts if an agreement to raise the debt ceiling was not reached laurence tribe professor of constitutional law at harvard law school called the argument that the public debt clause can nullify the debt ceiling false hope and noted that nothing in the constitution enabled the president to usurp legislative power with regards to the debt tribe said that since congress has means other than borrowing to pay the federal debt including raising taxes coining money and selling federal assets the argument that the president could seize the power to borrow could be extended to give the president the ability to seize those powers as well garrett epps counterargued that the president would not be usurping congressional power by invoking section  to declare the debt ceiling unconstitutional because the debt ceiling exceeds congressional authority he called it legislative doublecounting as paraphrased in the new republic because congress already appropriated the funds in question it is the executive branchs duty to enact those appropriations in other words given congress has appropriated money via federal programs the executive is obligated to enact and therefore fund them but the debt ceilings limit on debt prevents the executive from carrying out the instructions given by congress on the constitutional authority to set appropriations essentially to obey the statutory debt ceiling would require usurping congress constitutional powers and hence the statute must be unconstitutional former president bill clinton endorsed this counterargument saying he would eliminate the debt ceiling using the th amendment he called it crazy that congress first appropriates funds and then gets a second vote on whether to pay matthew zeitlin added to the counterargument that were section  invoked members of congress would not have standing to sue the president for allegedly usurping congressional authority even if they were willing to do so and those likely to have standing would be people designed to elicit zero public sympathy those who purchased credit default swaps which would pay off in the event of government default matthew steinglass argued that because it would come down to the supreme court the court would not vote in favor of anyone who could and would sue it would rule the debt ceiling unconstitutional this is because for the court to rule to uphold the debt ceiling it would in effect be voting for the united states to default with the consequences that would entail and steinglass argues the court would not do that michael stern senior counsel to the us house of representatives from  to  stated that garrett epps had adopted an overly broad interpretation of the public debt clause and that this interpretation even if accepted could not justify invalidating the debt limit because the presidents duty to safeguard the national debt no more enables him to assume congresss power of the purse than it would enable him to assume the judicial power when in his opinion the supreme court acts in an unconstitutional manner rob natelson former constitutional law professor at university of montana argued that this is not some issue in the disputed boundaries between legislative and executive power he continued thats why the constitution itself article i section  clause  gives only congress not the president the power to borrow money on the credit of the united states in another argument natelson stated that bruce bartlett deftly omits a crucial part of the quote from the fourteenth amendment it actually says the validity of the public debt of the united states authorized by law  shall not be questioned in other words congress has to approve the debt for it not to be questioned and note that this language refers to existing debt not to creating new debt he also neglects to mention that section  of the fourteenth amendment specifically grants to congress not to the president authority to enforce the amendment treasury secretary tim geithner implied that the debt ceiling may violate the constitution however george madison general counsel to the us treasury wrote that secretary geithner has never argued that the th amendment to the us constitution allows the president to disregard the statutory debt limit but nor did madison say that geithner had argued against the proposition either and that the constitution explicitly places the borrowing authority with congress he stated that secretary geithner has always viewed the debt limit as a binding legal constraint that can only be raised by congress minting coins in extremely high denominationsedit see also trillion dollar coin us law does not place a limit on the denomination of minted coins and specifically mentions that the mint can create platinum coins of arbitrary value under the discretion of the secretary of the treasury yale law professor jack balkin mentioned seigniorage as a solution although there had been speculation about the option of a trillion dollar coin online since at least january  hence it has been suggested that a coin with a face value of a trillion or more could be minted and deposited with the federal reserve and used to buy back debt thus making funds available monetizing goldedit a similar crisis was faced during the eisenhower administration in  the debt ceiling was not raised until the spring of  to accommodate the gap the eisenhower administration increased its gold certificate deposits at the federal reserve which it could do because the market price of gold had increased according to experts the secretary of the treasury is still authorized to monetize  tons of gold valued under the old law at approximately  per ounce but with a market value worth over  per ounce agreementedit main article budget control act of  president barack obama makes a statement in the brady press briefing room at the white house announcing a deal that resolved the us debt ceiling crisis july   on july   president obama announced that the leaders of both parties in both chambers had reached an agreement that would reduce the deficit and avoid default the same day speaker boehners office outlined the agreement for house republicans according to the statement the agreement cut spending more than it increased the debt limit in the first installment tranche  billion would be cut over  years in exchange for increasing the debt limit by  billion the agreement established a congressional joint select committee that would produce debt reduction legislation by november   that would be immune from amendments or filibuster the goal of the legislation is to cut at least  trillion over the coming  years and should be passed by december   the committee would have  members  from each party projected revenue from the joint select committees legislation must not exceed the revenue baseline produced by current law which assumes the bush tax cuts will expire entirely at the end of citation needed the agreement specified an incentive for congress to act if congress fails to produce a deficit reduction bill with at least  trillion in cuts then congress can grant a  trillion increase in the debt ceiling this would trigger acrosstheboard cuts sequestration of spending equally split between defense and nondefense programs the cuts would apply to mandatory and discretionary spending in the years  to  and be in an amount equal to the difference between  trillion and the amount of deficit reduction enacted from the joint committee the sequestration mechanism is the same as the balanced budget act of  there are exemptions—across the board cuts would apply to medicare but not to social security medicaid civil and military employee pay or veterans congress must vote on a balanced budget amendment between october   and the end of the year the debt ceiling may be increased an additional  trillion if either one of the following two conditions are met a balanced budget amendment is sent to the states the joint committee cuts spending by a greater amount than the requested debt ceiling increase most of the  billion in cuts occur in future years and so will not remove significant capital from the economy in the current and following yearcitation needed the acrosstheboard cuts could not take place until  if they are triggered a new congress could vote to reduce eliminate or deepen all or part of them under the us constitution the president could veto such a future bill passed by congress in such a scenario congress would have pass a bill to override this veto by a twothirds majority of each house of congress the agreement entitled the budget control act of  passed the house on august   by a vote of –  republicans and  democrats voted for it while

cuts and only modest growth in government debt as a percentage of gdp over the coming decade a week later sp senior director joydeep mukherji said that one factor was that numerous american

grossly undervaluedjul   about tailored brands tlrd casita capital deep value longshort equitysummarycompany has the biggest market share in tuxedo rentals a sector that has proven difficult for online only competitors and has an inelastic customer demand profilemanagement is focused on reducing leveragecompany is free from headline distractions such as american airlinestwin hill and the failed macys partnershipthe good stuff here is where i think tailored brands nyse tlrd stock can go in the next  months base case  probability  share bear case  probability  share bull case  probability  share company overview tailored brands is a mens specialty apparel retailer offering formal clothing business casual sportswear outerwear shoes and accessories and tuxedo rentals the company currently operates through  primary segments mens wearhouse targets male customers aged  and offers a selection of exclusive and nonexclusive merchandise jos a banks targets male customers aged  and offers tailored and business casual clothing and accessories substantially all under the jos a bank label moores is a canadian retail store chain offering a similar product as mens wearhouse stores as well as tuxedo rentals kg offers valueoriented superstore approach to appeal to price sensitive male and female customers in the apparel market corporate apparel twin hill and dimensions uk provides corporate clothing uniforms for workforces eg british airways ups nyseups mcdonalds nysemcd the company makes money through these brands by renting tuxedos selling apparel and accessories and providing corporate apparel the bulk of my piece is focused on tuxedos because that is where i see the core value why is this business valuable the underlying value for tailored brands lies in its rental offering the company maintains a substantial share of the market with close to rd of the bn industry in the us this business is largely wedding and prom related making the demand for such services more inelasticrecession proof in the midst of a recession high school students still go to proms and a grooms wedding party will require formalwear a relatively minor expense compared to other aspects of the wedding from a financial standpoint the company is able to make compelling returns on its investments in tuxedo product from multiple rentals for example the company has recently been investing mm in new working capital for cash gross margins of mm from tuxedo rentals this does not include rent for the stores out of which they operate but highlights the direct return on investment for the specific product why is tuxedo rental important to valuation its recession proof or at least more so than most retail offerings department stores are risky because they sell apparel that a consumer can easily cut spending on when times get tough they also get a material  of revenue from credit card income which is linked to store credit cards and are susceptible to higher consumer default rates in a downturn the opposite is true for tuxedo rentals given the more inelastic demand profile of prom and wedding party attendees amazon nasdaqamzn every business in retail needs to prove how it can compete vs amazon long term mens wearhouse is able to compete today because of its national footprint that allows wedding parties to go into any store and get measured by a tailor for tuxedos in the same style for an event current online competitors have not been able to get critical capacity because they lack the footprint of mens wearhousejos a bank in the us i estimate the combined revenue of online competitors eg black tux menguin and generation tux to be mm a far cry from tlrds mm business in fact black tux just announced a recent partnership with nordstrom nysejwn to have a shopinshop experience this is interesting because it highlights the need for an instore experience and because tlrd recently had trouble making a partnership with macys nysem profitable tlrd was attracted to macys bridal registry business as a way to drive traffic but it did not pan out as anticipated it will be exciting to see how black tux fares in nordstrom but the most recent example shows that the concept doesnt work well in a department store why is the stock near alltime lows idiosyncratic and macro headlines have plagued the stock over the past  months the apparel sector showed weakness starting in december as holiday sales were weaker than anticipated across the board that weakness persisted into  as tax refund delays materially impacted january and february sales for most retailers additionally the fear of amazon has only grown and the launch of prime wardrobe and corresponding selloff across apparel retailers is just another sign of investor anxiety however i believe that the tuxedo rental business and tailored suiting will protect tlrd vs amazon for the foreseeable future the macys partnership was a huge drag on fiscal  guidance when tlrd reported q results in march at the time the company estimated a mm negative to operating income as a result of the partnership or roughly  eps taking eps to the range of  vs  in may they announced they were able to exit the partnership and would realize onetime charges to do so the revised guidance still includes a mm loss from the partnerships operating loss ytd if that loss is excluded given its nonrecurring nature the eps range is comparable to the share range that i back into in q excluding similar charges as a note it was rare this earnings season to find a retailer that beat q eps consensus estimates and at least maintained full year guidance both of which tlrd achieved american airlines nasdaqaaltwin hill there has been a large amount of press on the health issues aa flight staff have raised over the corporate apparel rollout that twin hill provided at the end of the day twin hill maintained proper standards and further tests did not reveal any illegal actions or poor standards from aas perspective that doesnt resolve an unhappy workforce and they caved to their demands to explore other providers of uniforms in the future as these complaints did not seem to die down the financial impact to tlrd is minimal the ebitda from aa given its replenishment nature tlrd already sold them the product and are just maintaining it now is minimal around  of total company ebitda by my estimates in fact the entire corporate apparel segment was only mm ebitda of the mm ebitda in fiscal  or  the company did not shift fiscal guidance when the nonrenewal of the contract was announced likely showing the impact is negligible tlrd was also able to win a contract as  of  suppliers for mcdonalds usa uniforms in the midst of the negative aa publicity that highlights tlrds ability to compete and the sustainability of its reputation my view is that tlrd views corporate apparel as noncore and may be looking to sell that business to a larger player and use the funds to delever the balance sheet lastly the companys cfo and general counsel both bought shares in the open market the day before the twin hillamerican air contract nonrenewal was announced again highlighting its negligible impact why would they buy before instead of after if its materially negative eminence exit eminence capital is a hedge that had a  stake in tlrd the firms cio was nominated by tlrds bod this year to join them instead he withdrew his candidacy and his firm sold their stake close to share after paying nearly share for the last mm shares a few months prior the market may have taken that as a negative signal that a large hedge fund thats backing the company and its story was effectively pulling its support by selling its position i disagree as it was eminences push that click on link and start at mins was a primary reason why mens wearhouse eventually overpaid for jos a banks i dont believe these distractions suggest a deterioration in the core tuxedo rental or tailored offering of tlrd one could argue that top brass especially the ceo given his tenure may be at fault for letting these distractions happen in the first place i believe not even current management could ruin the value of the business balance sheet tlrd is overlevered today for a retailer however the companys excess cash flow has been earmarked for debt reduction and management has proven they are committed to reducing debt in the past  months tlrd has repurchased mm bonds in the open market at a discount to par reducing the note outstanding to mm from mm they have also made excess cash flow sweep payments as mandated by the credit agreement on the floating rate term loan currently they maintain a dividend of around mm per year they could allocate that cash to debt repayment but management likely does not want to send an erroneous message that they are worried about liquidity given the most recent forecast for improved cash flow yoy in  the company should be able to generate mm of cash after the dividend and mandatory term loan amortization payments that is ample cash for nearterm debt reduction further reducing leverage and interest expense an interesting item to keep track of is how resistant bond prices have been compared to the stock its unusual to see a dramatic divergence in bondequity prices in a leveraged retailer with no hard assets eg real estate but i think it demonstrates that bond investors have a better understanding of the value and cash flow nature of the business than equity investors at the moment other items to keep track of are  maturities arent a risk as the nearest term facility is the term loan in   the abl facility remains undrawn and  the company has sizable credit facility baskets that would allow it to tap the secured debt markets if the business got worse and it needed the cash that last point is important when considering the downside as it allows the company to maintain a lifeline in a bearish scenario valuation in the current market environment retailers pe and ebitda multiples have come under pressure investors group think has left them to believe that most of the businesses wont survive an amazon world or more likely in my view the next economic downturn that means that despite the fact a retailer has an attractive valuation either on a historical basis or relative to other competitors investors have shied away given my view that tlrds core business is defensible i think it has the merits of a value investment and not a value trap the company will be able to generate mm of cash flow to equity this year  free cash flow to equity assuming mid mm of ebitda mm capex mm cash interest and mm of mandatory term loan paydowns it trades at x the low end of my eps for  share comparable to gnc which is a business in a much worse place as far as fundamentals and balance sheet tlrd also continues to pay an above market dividend  in my view a qoq uptick in comps into q in addition to investor awareness of the true value of tlrd will lead to a massive appreciation in the stock over the next  months my base case price is share based on an x pe ratio of my  eps forecast as investors realize how defensible the business model is my bullish case sees shares trading closer to share lastly and important to any investor in a retail stock i see downside at share given the value in tux and liquiditybalance sheet strength the next important catalyst is q earnings in september followed by a likely management roadshow with institutional investors on the east coast the first one in some time many retailers have free cash flow yields in the  context likely a result of investor fear of declining cash flows in the neartomedium term due to a variety of reasons amazon economic concerns high fixed expense due to leased stores if we were to value tlrd in that range here is a sensitivity for share price to different free cash flow and free cash flow yields keep in mind my estimate of mm free cash flow in  other items short interest is upwards of  due in part because of its classification as an apparel retailer and market group think to short all brick and mortar retailers as the business moves past the american air and macys distractions comps begin to stabilize cash flow improves and management meets investors i think a short squeeze could significantly amplify a rally in this name as it did in q and q in  finally the sell side research on this stock is limited at best only three firms equity research departments publish on tlrd db
