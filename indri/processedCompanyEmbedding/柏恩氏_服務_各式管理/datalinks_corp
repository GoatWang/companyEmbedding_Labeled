following information is provided to help answer the most common questions about percon datalinks q which product will work best for me datalinks or the professional series cdroms a while both products are designed for use in commercial business or engineering environments there are several differences between datalinks and the professional series cdroms these differences can be used to determine which product is best suited for a customers needs datalinks is best suited for customers who need data as current as possible customers who need data requiring multiple cdroms also benifit from the variety of databases found on the datalinks system and the fact that each database contains national coverage not regional however because each search consumes search credits customers who are performing a large number of searches in a localized area may benifit more by using a cdrom q what is the source of the data and how accurate is it does percon collect and maintain their own databases a the databases are created using data directly from the fcc faa and industry canada percon does not edit or change the data in any way and the data is provided exactly as it appears in the repestive databases because the data is an exact copy of what the fcc faa and industry canada have in their systems the data should be  accurate provided that the original data is correct percon processes the data into a format which is compatible with the datalinks searches q do any of the datalinks databases contain data for places outside the us a yes data for canada is also available a without a credit expiration date it would make it difficult for percon to make any policy or pricing changes to the datalinks system we have found that one year is sufficient for most customers q can i distribute data found using the datalinks system a no data contained within the datalinks system is copyright   by percon and cannot be redistributed without permission from percon please contact
