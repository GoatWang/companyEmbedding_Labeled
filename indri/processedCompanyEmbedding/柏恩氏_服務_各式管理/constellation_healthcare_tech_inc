integrated scaled healthcare services business in the us and that this continues to be reflected in our financial results the company continues to optimize its operations and this is reflected in improved ebitda margins cht continues to perform in line with managements expectations in relation to overall revenue growth and in particular organic rcm revenue growth   our number one priority is to deliver shareholder value we hope to achieve this by successfully integrating new acquisitions into the platform and growing revenue organically we have built an exciting pipeline of acquisition opportunities that we will seek to close in the coming months the ma stage of the business will continue in  and through    enquiries constellation healthcare technologies paul parmar chief executive

blunt  scott mathieson       stifel nicholas europe limited  joint broker       jonathan senior  giles balleny       chief executives review   the company is focused on delivering one of the largest scaled healthcare solutions businesses in the us we made significant progress in delivering this aim during the first half of the year and we have delivered solid financial results for the period the company closed its first earningsenhancing acquisition of the year in february and the integration of ppp into the cht platform is going well the ppp platform provides cht with a complementary technology product and a wholly owned bpo in india which further allows us to generate significant financial and operational savings   cht has successfully built a significant business in a market that has not historically lent itself to building scale because of the inherent barriers to entry and the large number of small providers cht has created a scale business that has allowed it to accelerate organic growth and has helped us exceed expectations by winning seven new clients to our platform we intend to build on this momentum during the remainder of this year and    in april of this year we returned to the equity market and raised £m for acquisitions yesterday we announced the successful acquisition of northstar first health which further extends chts practice management and rcm business over the last few months we have also built a very exciting pipeline of further acquisition opportunities that we expect will complement and help grow our business    cht increased the depth of its board with the appointment of sir rodney aldridge as a nonexecutive director sir rodney is a shareholder and will now act as an advisor to the board and formally joined cht in july we believe his experience of acquiring and operating businesses will be invaluable to cht in addition sam zaharis joined as our president and chief financial officer in july sam brings a wealth of operational experience to our business and a proven track record in both ma and importantly the successful integration of those businesses   cht paid its maiden dividend from earnings in april however the board of directors has now recommended that the company cease paying a dividend until the acquisition stage of its business strategy is completed cht believes that it can better employ this money to create substantial value for shareholders through further acquisitions in the near term as a result cht will continue to grow its business through acquisitions over the course of this year and next and will look to reintroduce dividends at an appropriate point in the future   financial performance   the financial results for the first half of  demonstrate that our business model of buying healthcare service companies making them more efficient and increasing revenue and profitability is working our first half revenues increased by over  to m compared with the same period last year and our ebita increased by  from m in the first half of  to m in the first of half of  the core orion business is going from strength to strength and the other acquired businesses nems and ppp are performing well   we continue to optimize our capital structure we have paid down a significant portion of our senior debt facility from internal cash generation and will continue to do so during the remainder of  we are also evaluating a number of options that will allow us to cut our interest expense further   strategy   cht is focused on acquiring healthcare service businesses across the us and improving revenue generation and profitability by utilizing chts proprietary technology this is coupled with our efficient processing operation to give cht a competitive edge organic growth will be a key performance indicator going forward as the platform continues to scale up   cht continues to increase the number of doctors using its platform and currently has in excess of  doctors utilizing its services products and technologies we expect that number will continue to grow this year and next   outlook   the us healthcare system remains complex while the number of people who continue to receive healthcare insurance and utilize the system continuously increases this provides an excellent back drop for cht to operate in and consolidate the sector in major way   paul parmar chief

financial results the company continues to optimize its operations and this is reflected in improved ebitda margins cht continues to perform in line with managements expectations in relation to overall revenue growth and in particular organic rcm revenue growth our number one priority is to deliver shareholder value we hope to achieve this by successfully integrating new acquisitions into

balleny  chief executives review the company is focused on delivering one of the largest scaled healthcare solutions businesses in the us we made significant progress in delivering this aim during the first half of the year and we have delivered solid financial results for the period the company closed its first earningsenhancing acquisition of the year in february and the integration of ppp into the cht platform is going well the ppp platform provides cht with a complementary technology product and a wholly owned bpo in india which further allows us to generate significant financial and operational savings cht has successfully built a significant business in a market that has not historically lent itself to building scale because of the inherent barriers to entry and the large number of small providers cht has created a scale business that has allowed it to accelerate organic growth and has helped us exceed expectations by winning seven new clients to our platform we intend to build on this momentum during the remainder of this year and  in april of this year we returned to the equity market and raised gbpm for acquisitions yesterday we announced the successful acquisition of northstar first health which further extends chts practice management and rcm business over the last few months we have also built a very exciting pipeline of further acquisition opportunities that we expect will complement and help grow our business cht increased the depth of its board with the appointment of sir rodney aldridge as a nonexecutive director sir rodney is a shareholder and will now act as an advisor to the board and formally joined cht in july we believe his experience of acquiring and operating businesses will be invaluable to cht in addition sam zaharis joined as our president and chief financial officer in july sam brings a wealth of operational experience to our business and a proven track record in both ma and importantly the successful integration of those businesses cht paid its maiden dividend from earnings in april however the board of directors has now recommended that the company cease paying a dividend until the acquisition stage of its business strategy is completed cht believes that it can better employ this money to create substantial value for shareholders through further acquisitions in the near term as a result cht will continue to grow its business through acquisitions over the course of this year and next and will look to reintroduce dividends at an appropriate point in the future financial performance the financial results for the first half of  demonstrate that our business model of buying healthcare service companies making them more efficient and increasing revenue and profitability is working our first half revenues increased by over  to m compared with the same period last year and our ebita increased by  from m in the first half of  to m in the first of half of  the core orion business is going from strength to strength and the other acquired businesses nems and ppp are performing well we continue to optimize our capital structure we have paid down a significant portion of our senior debt facility from internal cash generation and will continue to do so during the remainder of  we are also evaluating a number of options that will allow us to cut our interest expense further strategy cht is focused on acquiring healthcare service businesses across the us and improving revenue generation and profitability by utilizing chts proprietary technology this is coupled with our efficient processing operation to give cht a competitive edge organic growth will be a key performance indicator going forward as the platform continues to scale up cht continues to increase the number of doctors using its platform and currently has in excess of  doctors utilizing its services products and technologies we expect that number will continue to grow this year and next outlook the us healthcare system remains complex while the number of people who continue to receive healthcare insurance and utilize the system continuously increases this provides an excellent back drop for cht to operate in and
