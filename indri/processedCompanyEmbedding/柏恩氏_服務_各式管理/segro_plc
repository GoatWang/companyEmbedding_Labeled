industrial and warehouse properties in europe and a leading incomefocused reit to that end our strategy is to create a portfolio which generates attractive low risk incomeled returns with above average rental and capital growth when market conditions are positive and which is also resilient in a downturn we seek to enhance returns through development while ensuring that the shortterm income drag associated with holding land does not outweigh the longterm potential benefits fundamental to our strategy are three key pillars of activity which we believe combine to deliver an attractive incomeled total property return ·     disciplined capital allocation picking the right markets and assets to create the right portfolio shape by actively managing the portfolio composition and by adapting our capital deployment according to our assessment of the property cycle ·     operational excellence optimising performance from the portfolio through dedicated customer service expert asset management development and operational efficiency ·     efficient capital and corporate structure we aim to underpin the property level returns from our portfolio with a lean overhead structure and appropriate financial leverage through the cycle together these three elements should translate into sustainable attractive returns for our shareholders in the form of progressive dividends and net asset value growth over time our portfolio comprises modern big box and urban warehouses which are well specified and located with good sustainability credentials and which should benefit from a low structural void rate and relatively lowintensity asset management requirements our assets are concentrated in the strongest european submarkets which have attractive property market characteristics including good growth prospects limited supply availability and where we already have or can achieve critical mass disciplined capital allocation  acquisition activity during the first half we took full control of the £ billion app property portfolio through the acquisition of the  per cent interest from our joint venture partner aviva there were no other significant asset acquisitions during the period although we have purchased approximately £ million of land mainly to facilitate imminent development starts in northern italy and east london we now fully own the assets within app which will allow us to plan with greater certainty and flexibility the heathrow cargo area offers particular potential for growth in the short term regearing leases on peppercorn rents which expire in  offers reversionary potential of £ million of which we have already captured  per cent and are in discussion over a further  per cent these are the main reasons for the low initial yield on the portfolio of  per cent which rises to  per cent if the cargo area is excluded in the medium term we expect to redevelop the cargo area which is both one of the oldest and best located properties in our portfolio excluding app we reviewed a number of acquisition opportunities and continue to do so but pricing levels mean that for the time being it remains more accretive to focus our investment activity on development rather than acquisition     acquisitions completed in h  asset location  type purchase price £m segro share net initial yield  toppedup net initial yield  urban warehousing

consideration for its  per cent interest in the app property portfolio we sold a portfolio of older industrial estates in germany for £ million this sale continues the process of focusing our urban

assets under management the portfolio valuation including completed assets land and buildings under construction increased by  per cent on a likeforlike basis adjusted for capital expenditure and asset recycling during the year this combines a  per cent increase in the value of completed properties including acquisitions and complete developments and a  per cent valuation gain on properties currently under construction valuation gains were driven primarily by around  basis points of yield compression reflecting the quality of our portfolio improved by our active asset management and development activity the uk portfolio of completed properties delivered a  per cent valuation uplift slightly underperforming the msciipd uk industrial monthly index which increased by  per cent in the first half the performance reflects a combination of yield shift across the portfolio and the capture of reversionary potential in lease reviews and renewals particularly in london the average yield applied to our uk portfolio was  per cent true equivalent yield a  basis point improvement from  december  while rental values improved by  per cent during  erv growth for our portfolio has been lower than the very strong figures seen in the last two years particularly in london however we remain confident that the fundamental drivers of good occupational demand and limited supply of space continue to offer the potential of attractive rental growth over the coming years in continental europe the completed portfolio value increased by  per cent during the period on a constant currency basis reflecting  basis points of yield compression to  per cent our properties in germany and france were particularly strong delivering a  per cent and  per cent uplift respectively rental values increased by  per cent for the portfolio as a whole with the increases concentrated in the whollyowned portfolio of urban warehouses ervs grew  per cent in selp and  per cent for segros whollyowned

 vacancy rate excluding short term lettings for the group at  june  is  per cent     operational excellence at  june  our portfolio comprised two main asset types urban warehouses and big box warehouses the demandsupply dynamics differ varying by both type and by geography ·     urban warehouses account for  per cent of our portfolio value they are located mainly on the edges of london paris düsseldorf berlin and warsaw where land supply is restricted and there is strong demand for warehouse space particularly catering for the needs of last mile delivery and in slough from data centre users ·     big box warehouses classed as those over  sq m in size account for  per cent of our portfolio value these are focused on the major logistics hubs and corridors in the uk southeast and midlands regions france the logistics spine linking paris lyon and marseille germany düsseldorf berlin leipzig and hamburg and poland the central core of poznań łódź and warsaw plus the industrial region of silesia growing rental income from letting existing space and new developments we have continued to see strong occupier demand for warehouses across our markets reflected in the  per cent increase in contracted rent compared to the first half of  our low vacancy rate means that lettings of existing space are lower than last year while our success at retaining customers is reflected in less space returned rental growth on existing space has instead been driven mainly by capturing significant reversionary potential from our uk portfolio and from indexation provisions attached to leases equating to approximately  per cent of our rent data on the logistics markets in the uk from jll and france from cbre implies that available space continues to equate to less than one year of takeup this supplydemand tension has manifested itself in our own experience through rent from prelet agreements signed during the period more than doubling from the first half of  as occupiers seek to secure new space in supplyconstrained markets colliers international expects speculative completions in the uk to fall by  per cent in  to just  million sq m suggesting that the supplydemand imbalance is unlikely to be alleviated in the near term during h  we contracted new leases and prelet agreements totalling £ million of annualised rental income h  £ million  per cent higher than in the previous year we generated £ million from our standing assets h  £ million offset by £ million of rent lost from space returned to us h  £ million resulting in net takeup of £ million of existing space h  £ million ·     retailers and companies involved with retail distribution accounted for around half of our takeup during the first half including amazon which occupied  sq m of the companys space in the uk occupying the larger of the two units we developed speculatively at rugby gateway germany in a prelet unit just outside munich and spain occupying both of our speculatively developed warehouses on the edge of barcelona ·     manufacturing companies accounted for a further  per cent of takeup including auto exterior manufacturer plastic omnium in poland and glazing manufacturer maxlight in london developments completed during the period added £ million to the rent roll of which £ million was contracted in warehouses built speculatively around  per cent of the speculative lettings were agreed prior to practical completion and the average period between practical completion and letting was approximately four months     summary of key leasing data for h  summary of key

from break or expiry during the period   our customers represent a wide range of industries and we therefore avoid overreliance on any single sector or individual customer our top  customers account for  per cent of our rent roll and our largest customer represents just under  per cent the rent roll from our standing assets is influenced by three main factors lettings of available space discussed above space returned to us and rent agreed at rent reviews and lease renewals overall operating performance is also dependent on the level of vacancy prelet agreements and lease terms agreed as well as operating cost efficiencies which are examined in the financial review ·     rent reviews and lease renewals uplift of  per cent during the period new rents agreed at review and renewal were  per cent higher in the uk reflecting the capture of reversion accumulated over recent years and adding £ million of passing rent to the rent roll in continental europe rents agreed were  per cent lower than previous headline rents equating to a reduction of less than £ million of rent ·     vacancy remains low at  per cent the vacancy rate at  june  fell slightly to  per cent compared to  per cent at  december  approximately a quarter of the vacancy  percentage points relates to recently completed speculative developments this compares to our target vacancy rate of between  and  per cent treating shortterm lettings as vacant space would increase the vacancy rate to  per cent  december   per cent the average vacancy rate during the period was  per cent slightly higher than in h   per cent due primarily to the recently completed big box warehouses in rugby and the big box warehouse in magna park which was taken back in november  ·     high retention rate of  per cent h   per cent during the period space equating to just £ million h  £ million of rent was returned to us including £ million of rent lost due to insolvency h  £ million we took back space equating to an additional £ million for redevelopment and this is almost exclusively related to a welllocated but now redundant site near heathrow airport following dhls relocation to its new facility at our poyle development in  approximately £ million of headline rent was at risk from a break or lease expiry during the period and we retained  per cent in existing space with a further  per cent retained but in new premises   ·     lease terms continue to offer attractive income security the level of incentives agreed for new leases excluding those on developments completed in the period represented  per cent of the headline rent h   per cent the portfolios weighted average lease length remained stable compared to  december  at  years to first break  years to expiry lease terms are longer in the uk  years to break than in continental europe  years to break ·     £ million of rent contracted from developments h  £ million during the period we contracted £ million of rent from prelet agreements and lettings of speculative developments prior to completion h  £ million of which £ million was from supermarkets including carrefour in france and £ million from retailers including italian fashion retailer yoox netaporter and amazon in the second phase of our big box warehouse development outside barcelona we also secured £ million from takeup of developments completed in the preceding  months h  £ million of which £ million h  £ million had been contracted in prior periods disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence  delivering growth through development we invested £ million in new developments and £ million in infrastructure during h  h  £ million and £ million in our land bank to expand our development capacity the increased prelet activity means that our expected development capital expenditure for  as a whole should now exceed £ million and over £ million including land and infrastructure expenditure development projects completed we completed  sq m of new space during the period these projects were  per cent prelet prior to the start of construction and were  per cent let as at  june  generating £ million of annualised gross rent with a potential further £ million to come when the remainder of the space is let this translates into a yield on total development cost including land construction and finance costs of  per cent when fully let amongst the development projects completed in the first half were the warehouses let to amazon described above we also completed further speculative phases of urban warehouses in our city park and rheinpark estates in düsseldorf which are both almost fully let the additional capital provided through the two equity raises in the past  months has enabled us to accelerate the investment in our development pipeline ·     at the time of the equity placing in september  we identified projects under development or awaiting approval associated with £ million of capital expenditure projects associated with over  per cent of this capital expenditure have either completed or are in the current development pipeline ·     at the time of the rights issue in march  we identified projects under development or awaiting approval requiring £ million of capital expenditure projects associated with approximately half of this capital expenditure have either completed or are current development pipeline ·     the remaining £ million of proceeds of the rights issue were allocated to future development on our land bank since the time of the rights issue we have committed or expect to commit approximately £ million to new projects of which £ million are in the current development pipeline and £ million are associated with new prelet requirements    current development pipeline at  june  we had

around  per cent of our total portfolio we invested £ million in acquiring new land during the first half of the year including land sourced from the roxhill and east plus agreements and land associated with developments expected to start in the short term we estimate that our land bank including the nearterm projects above can support  million sq m of development over the next five years the prospective capital expenditure associated with the future pipeline is £ billion it could generate £ million of gross rental income representing a yield on total development cost including land

contracts and on our outlook for occupier conditions in local markets land with a total value of £ million has been identified as suited to alternative use or surplus to our short term requirements halving from £ million at  december following the sale of the former northfields industrial estate in park royal to a residential developer the largest single component is a brownfield site in hayes west london which was formerly a nestlé factory along with our residential partner barratt london we have submitted a planning application for a mixed use scheme comprising over  homes and  sq m of urban warehousing on receipt of planning consent we will sell the land zoned for residential use to barratt and will develop the warehouse element ourselves land held under option agreements land sites held under option agreements are not included in the figures above but together represent significant further development opportunities primarily in the uk including sites for urban warehousing in east london and for big box warehouses in the midlands and south east regions the options held on the balance sheet at a value of £ million including joint ventures at share are exercisable in both

the average duration and cost of our debt the raising of euro denominated debt increases the natural currency hedge our euro denominated assets are approximately  per cent hedged of which half is now natural reducing the need for synthetic hedging through currency swaps the combination of the financing activity during the first half including the impact of the us private placement once drawn will reduce our lookthrough cost of debt by  basis points to  per cent the actions we have taken over the past five years to improve the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet

on our debt of  per cent equating to a pro forma lookthrough ltv ratio of around  per cent at  june  the number of prelet agreements signed during the first half means that we will increase the pace

million of cash retained on the balance sheet and  million new shares being issued outlook the outlook for our occupational markets remains broadly positive given the continued shift towards online retailing supply chain restructuring and limited speculative supply of new warehousing in core logistics and urban locations the growth of ecommerce is gathering pace in continental europe and when combined with an improving economic outlook for our major markets the prospects for strengthening occupier demand here are good in the uk brexit negotiations and the less stable political situation appear to be weighing somewhat on consumer confidence which could impact the pace of economic growth however online sales continue to grow strongly and increase as a proportion of total retail sales this dynamic plays to our strength in well located modern warehouse assets investor demand for good quality welllocated warehouse assets also remains positive attracted by the occupational market fundamentals and yield profile of the sector we enter the second half of the year with  sq m of buildings in the current development pipeline  sq m of further prelet projects in advanced discussions and numerous other opportunities on our substantial land bank our vacancy rate is low and our balance sheet has been significantly strengthened by the refinancing activity undertaken in the first half of the year accordingly we are wellplaced to continue adding to our low risk development programme and expect the overall level of development expenditure for the year to exceed £ million well above the level of £ million indicated at the time of the rights issue should occupier market conditions remain supportive overall our business is well placed to continue outperforming the wider real estate

facilities providing funding headroom and more flexible borrowings that are cheaper and easier to repay at  june  pro forma for the uspp debt issuance and the app debt repayment  per cent of the debt facilities of the group were bonds or private placement notes and  per cent were bank borrowings the market value of the gross borrowings of the group including debt funding arrangements within joint ventures at  june  was £ million higher than the balance sheet carrying value this difference mainly relates to the sterling bond portfolio which have fixed interest coupons above current market rates the majority £ million of the sterling bonds have been swapped into floating sterling debt or floating euro debt via a combination of interest rate and currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts the market value including accrued interest of the groups derivative financial instruments mainly interest rate and currency swaps used to hedge interest rate and currency exposures at  june  was an asset of £ million  december  an asset of £ million the decrease in the asset during the period was mainly due to the reduction in maturity of the various swap portfolios bringing the app swap portfolio within derivatives on the balance sheet and a slight strengthening in the euro exchange rate partly offset by the impact of a reduction in medium term sterling interest rates these instruments are held at fair value on the groups balance sheet within debtors and creditors gearing and financial covenants the loan to value ltv ratio of the group at  june  on a lookthrough basis including the borrowings and property assets of the groups share of joint ventures was  per cent  december   per cent the gearing ratio of the group at  june  as defined within the principal debt funding arrangements of the group excluding debt funding arrangements within joint ventures was  per cent  december   per cent this is significantly lower than the groups tightest financial gearing covenant within these debt facilities of  per cent property valuations would need to fall by around  per cent from their  june  values to reach the gearing covenant threshold of  per cent a  per cent fall in property values would equate to a lookthrough ltv ratio of around  per cent the groups other key financial covenant within its principal debt funding arrangements is interest cover requiring that net interest before capitalisation be covered at least  times by net property rental income at  june  the groups multiple is comfortably above this threshold at  times on a lookthrough basis including joint ventures the multiple was  times interest rate exposure the groups interest rate risk policy is that between  and  per cent of net borrowings including the groups share of borrowings

impact at share of gross borrowings in joint ventures the weighted average interest rate of the group at  june  before commitment fees and amortised costs was  per cent  december   per cent as a result of fixed rate cover in place if shortterm interest rates had been  per cent higher throughout the year to  june  the adjusted net finance cost of the group would have increased by approximately £ million representing around  per cent of adjusted profit after tax the group elects not to hedge account its interest rate derivatives portfolio therefore movements in its fair value are taken to the income statement but in accordance with epra best practices recommendations these gains and losses are eliminated from adjusted profit after tax foreign currency translation exposure the group has negligible transactional foreign currency exposure but does have a potentially significant currency translation exposure arising on the conversion of its substantial foreign currency denominated assets mainly euro and euro denominated earnings into sterling in the group consolidated accounts at  june  the group had gross foreign currency assets which were  per cent hedged by gross foreign currency denominated liabilities including the impact of derivative financial instruments including the impact of forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts used to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets a  per cent strengthening against sterling in the value of the other currencies in which the group operates at  june  would have increased net assets by approximately £ million and there would have been an increase in gearing of approximately  per cent and in the lookthrough ltv of  per cent the average exchange rate used to translate euro denominated earnings generated during the period into sterling within the consolidated income statement of the group was €£ based on the hedging position at  june  if the euro had been  per cent stronger than it was against sterling throughout the first half of the year € £ adjusted profit after tax for the period would have been approximately £ million  per cent higher than reported in the event of the euro weakening  per cent the impact on income net assets gearing and ltv is approximately equal and opposite to the figures above going concern as noted in the financial position and funding section the group has a strong liquidity position a favourable debt maturity profile enhanced by the recently contracted uspp which will be drawn down in august and substantial headroom against financial covenants accordingly it can reasonably expect to continue to have good access to capital markets and other sources of funding having made enquiries and having considered the principal risks facing the group see statement of principal risks for further information including liquidity and solvency risks and material uncertainties the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future a period of at least  months from the date of approval of the condensed financial information accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed financial statements statement of principal risks the group recognises that its ability to manage risk effectively throughout the organisation continues to be central to its success our approach to risk management aims to bring controllable risks within our appetite and to enable our decision making to balance uncertainty against the objective of creating value for our shareholders the groups risk appetite its integrated approach to managing risk and the governance arrangements in place are described in the principal risks section of the  annual report on pages  to  the group notes the outcome of the uk general election held on  june  and the subsequent formation of a minority government whilst this development does not significantly change our assessment of risk to the group we observe that it has increased the level of uncertainty in the uk political environment generally nevertheless there are no significant changes to the risks presented in the  annual report on pages  to  a summary of the groups principal risks for the second half of  is provided below  property risks these are risks to achieving above average rental and capital growth from our portfolio including external market and competitive conditions portfolio strategy and execution of acquisitions and disposals we recognise that in seeking outperformance from our portfolio the group must accept a balanced level of property risk  with diversity in geographic locations and asset types and an appropriate mixture of stabilised income producing and opportunity assets  in order to provide opportunities for superior returns market cycle the property market is cyclical and there is a continuous risk that the group could either misinterpret the market or fail to react appropriately to changing market conditions which could result in capital being invested or disposals taking place at the wrong price or time in the cycle portfolio strategy the groups total property andor shareholder returns could underperform in absolute or relative terms as a result of an inappropriate portfolio strategy execution of investment plans decisions to buy hold sell or develop assets could be flawed due to uncertainty in analysis quality of assumptions poor due diligence or unexpected changes in the economic or operating environment  financial risks these are risks to the revenues costs cash flows equity capital and solvency of the group resulting from the capital structure of the group and changes in external factors such as interest rates foreign exchange rates and the creditworthiness of the groups major financial counterparties the group maintains a low to moderate appetite for financial risk in general with a very low appetite for risks to solvency and gearing covenant breaches solvency and covenant breach a substantial fall in the groups property asset values or rental income levels could lead to a breach of financial covenants within its debt funding arrangements this could lead to a cancellation of debt funding which could in turn leave the group without sufficient longterm resources solvency to meet its commitments uk exit from the eu the uncertainty associated with the uks decision to exit the eu may impact investment capital financial including foreign exchange and occupier markets in the uk during the transition period as the terms of exit and future relationships are negotiated and in the long term in the long term exit from the eu could reduce levels of investor and occupier demand as a result of reduced trade andor the relocation of corporations and financial institutions away from the uk and london in particular     european economic environment the risk of a significant adverse impact to the groups earnings net asset value financial covenants or investor confidence arising from a major disruption to the economic and business environment in europe sustained poor economic performance in the eurozone or the exit of a significant economy from the eurozone financial leverage the group could maintain an inappropriate capital structure financial leverage usually expressed as the ltv ratio but in financial covenants defined as gearing needs to be managed depending on the direction of the economic and property market cycle if gearing is too high when property valuations are falling net asset value movements can be exacerbated and financial covenants put at risk equally if gearing is too conservative there is a risk that attractive growth opportunities could be missed and the benefits of leverage not maximised interest rates a significant adverse movement in interest rates could have an unacceptable impact on the groups earnings on investment market conditions or on tenant covenant strength counterparty default a bank or other counterparty could default while holding segro deposits or derivative assets resulting in a significant financial loss to the group this could also include the loss of solvency headroom from lost undrawn committed bank facilities  corporate risks these are risks to business performance legal and regulatory compliance health and safety environmental impact reputation and business continuity arising from external factors or inadequate internal processes people or systems we have a very low
