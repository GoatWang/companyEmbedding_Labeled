unions major lenders or members of the community in which the organization is located an inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director not to be confused with the title executive director sometimes used for the ceo position in some organizations executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization such as finance marketing human resources or production outside directoredit main article independent director an outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization and does not represent any of its stakeholders a typical example is a director who is president of a firm in a different industry outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board for example for a company that only serves a domestic market the presence of ceos from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options one of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run outside directors are unlikely to tolerate insider dealing between insider directors as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors or between shareholders and the board they are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest on the other hand they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organizations governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating terminology edit director – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization such as an institution or business inside director – a director who in addition to serving on the board has a meaningful connection to the organization outside director – a director who other than serving on the board has no meaningful connections to the organization executive director – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization the term is also used in a completely different sense to refer to a ceo nonexecutive director – a director who is not an executive with the organization shadow or de facto director – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization nominee director – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder creditor or interest group whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointors or other interest in the appointing company individual directors often serve on more than one board this practice results in an interlocking directorate where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities this situation can have important corporate social economic and legal consequences and has been the subject of significant researchcitation needed process and structureedit the process for running a board sometimes called the board process includes the selection of board members the setting of clear board objectives the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members the collaborative creation of an agenda for the meeting the creation and followup of assigned action items and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members owners and ceos the science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards however some standardization is beginning to develop some who are pushing for this standardization in the usa are the national association of corporate directors mckinsey consulting and the board group board meetingsedit a board of directors conducts its meetings according to the rules and procedures contained in its governing documents these procedures may allow the board to conduct its business by conference call or other electronic means they may also specify how a quorum is to be determined most organizations have adopted roberts rules of order as its guide to supplement its own ruleswhere in this book the rules for conducting board meetings may be less formal if there is no more than about a dozen board members present an example of the informality is that motions are not required if its clear what is being discussed sizeedit historically nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twentyfour members but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people studies suggest that after seven people each additional person reduces the effectiveness of groupdecisionmaking noncorporate boardsedit the role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity see types of business entity for example the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market public company not traded on a public market a private limited or closely held company owned by family members a family business or exempt from income taxes a nonprofit not for profit or taxexempt entity there are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation limited liability company cooperative business trust partnership private limited company and public limited company much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets more recently however material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses a boardonly organization is one whose board is selfappointed rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limitedcitation needed membership organizationsedit in membership organizations such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership especially if the membership meets infrequently such as only at an annual general meeting the amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization some organizations place matters exclusively in the boards control while in others the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations the setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations in which the shareholders are the members of the organization a difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization such as the president and the secretary and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board the directors may also be classified as officers in this situation there may also be exofficio members of the board or persons who are members due to another position that they hold these exofficio members have all the same rights as the other board members members of the board may be removed before their term is complete details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws if the bylaws do not contain such details the section on disciplinary procedures in roberts rules of order may be used corporationsedit in a publicly held company directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the shareholdersstockholders in this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is dividend and how much it is stock options distributed to employees and the hiringfiring and compensation of upper management governanceedit theoretically the control of a company is divided between two bodies the board of directors and the shareholders in general meeting in practice the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company in small private companies the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people and thus there is no real division of power in large public companies the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives such as a finance director or a marketing director who deal with particular areas of the companys affairs another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more de facto power many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management since each shareholders power as well as interest and information is so small larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies the large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize however there have been moves recently to try to increase shareholder activism among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings a contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees adopting their recommendations almost without fail as a practical matter executives even choose the directors with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them in most cases serving on a board is not a career unto itself for major corporations the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field in the case of outside directors they are often senior leaders of other organizations nevertheless board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description outside directors are usually paid for their services these remunerations vary between corporations but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary additional compensation for each meeting attended stock options and various other benefits such as travel hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings tiffany  co for example pays directors an annual retainer of  an additional annual retainer of  if the director is also a chairperson of a committee a permeetingattended fee of  for meetings attended in person a  fee for each meeting attended via telephone in addition to stock options and retirement benefits twotier systemedit in some european and asian countries there are two separate boards an executive board for daytoday business and a supervisory board elected by the shareholders and employees for supervising the executive board in these countries the ceo chief executive or managing director presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people this ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority the aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person there is a strong parallel here with the structure of government which tends to separate the political cabinet from the management civil service in the united states the board of directors elected by the shareholders is often equivalent to the supervisory board while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee operating committee or executive council composed of the ceo and their direct reports other clevel officers divisionsubsidiary heads historyedit the examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the united kingdom and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate april  learn how and when to remove this template message the development of a separate board of directors to managegovernoversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history until the end of the th century it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting of all shareholders was the supreme organ of a company and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting however by  the english court of appeal had made it clear in the decision of automatic selfcleansing filter syndicate co ltd v cuninghame   ch  that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the articles of association and that where the powers of management were vested in the board the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise the articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that the directors and the directors alone shall manage the new approach did not secure immediate approval but it was endorsed by the house of lords in quin  axtens v salmon  ac  and has since received general acceptance under english law successive versions of table a have reinforced the norm that unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the articles the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them the modern doctrine was expressed in john shaw  sons salford ltd v shaw   kb  by greer lj as follows a company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors some of its powers may according to its articles be exercised by directors certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting if powers of management are vested in the directors they and they alone can exercise these powers the only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles or if opportunity arises under the articles by refusing to reelect the directors of whose actions they disapprove they cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders it has been remarkedby whom that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time as the relevant provisions in table a as it was then seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it election and removaledit in most legal systems the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting or through a proxy statement for publicly traded companies in the us the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a nominating committee although in  the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the ceo does not have a position on the board shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately in may  the sec proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement in practice for publicly traded companies the managers inside directors who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders in which case more gray outsider directors independent directors with conflicts of interest are nominated and elected directors may also leave office by resignation or death in some legal systems directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors in some countries they may only do so with cause in others the power is unrestricted some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death or as an addition to the existing directorsneeds citation in practice it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting in many legal systems the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting the director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make furthermore the directors contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed and may often include a generous golden parachute which also acts as a deterrent to removalcitation needed a recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the united states it found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly had excess ceo compensation or had poor shareholder protection also directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm the study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing poison pills or classified boards and by reducing excessive ceo pay after their directors receive low shareholder support board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue in  the new york times noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the financial crisis of – had found new positions as directors the sec sometimes imposes a ban a do bar on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases and one of these was upheld in  exercise of powersedit the exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings and that a quorum must be present before any business may be conducted usually a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise in most common law countries the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole and not in the individual directors however in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his ostensible authority see also the rule in turquands case dutiesedit main articles directors duties and fiduciary duties because directors exercise control and management over the organization but organizations are in theory run for the benefit of the shareholders the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties the duties imposed on directors are fiduciary duties similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust agents and trustees the duties apply to each director separately while the powers apply to the board jointly also the duties are owed to the company itself and not to any other entity this does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances proper purposeedit directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose while in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative such breaches usually involve a breach of the directors duty to act in good faith greater difficulties arise where the director while acting in good faith is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper the seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the supreme court decision in eclairs group ltd v jkx oil  gas plc  uksc   december  the case concerned the powers of directors under the articles of association of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders prior to that case the leading authority was howard smith ltd v ampol ltd  ac  the case concerned the power of the directors to issue new shares it was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority an argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the directors powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company if so the mere fact that an incidental result even if it was a desired consequence was that a shareholder lost his majority or a takeover bid was defeated this would not itself make the share issue improper but if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority or block a takeover bid that would be an improper purpose not all jurisdictions recognised the proper purpose duty as separate from the good faith duty however unfettered discretionedit directors cannot without the consent of the company fetter their discretion in relation to the exercise of their powers and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings this is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose and no personal advantage to the director this does not mean however that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval the company remains bound but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions although that may involve a breach by the company of the contract that the board previously approved conflict of duty and interestedit as fiduciaries the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company the law takes the view that good faith must not only be done but must be manifestly seen to be done and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded traditionally the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three subcategories transactions with the companyedit by definition where a director enters into a transaction with a company there is a conflict between the directors interest to do well for himself out of the transaction and his duty to the company to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction this rule is so strictly enforced that even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it in aberdeen ry v blaikie   macq hl  lord cranworth stated in his judgment that a corporate body can only act by agents and it is of course the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal and it is a rule of universal application that no one having such duties to discharge shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting or which possibly may conflict with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect so strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into emphasis added however in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle it is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the companys constitution in many countries there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure use of corporate property opportunity or informationedit directors must not without the informed consent of the company use for their own profit the companys assets opportunities or information this prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success in regal hastings ltd v gulliver  all er  the house of lords in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders held that i that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors and ii that what they did resulted in profit to themselves and accordingly the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made and the shareholders received their windfall the decision has been followed in several subsequent cases and is now regarded as settled law competing with the companyedit directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising similarly they should not act as directors of competing companies as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other common law duties of care and skilledit traditionally the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the nonexecutive director in re city equitable fire insurance co  ch  it was expressed in purely subjective terms where the court held that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his knowledge and experience emphasis added however this decision was based firmly in the older notions see above that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making and effective control residing in the shareholders if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker they should not have recourse to complain however a more modern approach has since developed and in dorchester finance co ltd v stebbing  bclc  the court held that the rule in equitable fire related only to skill and not to diligence with respect to diligence what was required was such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf this was a dual subjective and objective test and one deliberately pitched at a higher level more recently it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively in the united kingdom the statutory provisions relating to directors duties in the new companies act  have been codified on this basis remedies for breach of dutyedit in most jurisdictions the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties injunction or declaration damages or compensation restoration of the companys property rescission of the relevant contract account of profits summary dismissal current trendsedit historically directors duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the financial benefit of the company however more recently there have been attempts to soften the position and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens for example in the united kingdom the companies act  requires directors of companies to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole and sets out the following six factors regarding a directors duty to promote success the likely consequences of any decision in the long term the interests of the companys employees the need to foster the companys business relationships with suppliers customers and others the impact of the companys operations on the community and the environment the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct and the need to act fairly as between members of a company this represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors duties are owed only to the company previously in the united kingdom under the companies act  protections for nonmember stakeholders were considerably more limited see for example s which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves the changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism united statesedit sarbanes–oxley actedit the sarbanes–oxley act of  has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of us companies or companies listed on us stock exchanges under the act directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes internal control is now the direct responsibility of directors the vast majority of companies covered by the act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control the internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors one of whom is a financial expert the law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges nyse nasdaq to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it sizeedit according to the corporate librarys study the average size of publicly traded companys board is  members and most boards range from  to  members according to investopedia some analysts think the ideal size is seven state law may specify a minimum number of directors maximum number of directors and qualifications for directors eg whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities committeesedit while a board may have several committees two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three independent directors and no inside directors other common committees in boards are nominating and governance compensationedit directors of fortune  companies received median pay of  in  directorship is a parttime job a recent national association of corporate directors study found directors averaging just  hours a week on board work surveys indicate that about  of nonprofit foundations pay their board members and  of american nonprofit organizations do  of nonprofit organizations require board members to personally contribute to the organization as boardsource recommends this percentage has increased in recent years criticismedit according to john gillespie a former investment banker and coauthor of a book critical of boards far too much of their time has been for checkthebox and coveryourbehind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders at the same time scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions and crossborder investments the issue of gender representation on corporate boards of directors has been the subject of much criticism in recent years governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and comply or explain systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards a study of the french corporate elite has found that certain social classes

stipulations one of which was that company b had to have a paid up share capital of not less than £ a substantial sum at the time company a was unable to subscribe for more than £ in shares so the directors arranged for the remaining  shares to be taken by themselves and their friends later instead of selling the undertaking they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit the shareholders of company a sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their  shares in company b – the very same shares which
