investorsedit in  and  sothebys was the target of a takeover attempt by activist investor daniel s loeb of third point llc a registered investment adviser founded in  and headquartered in new york with over  billion in assets under management third point began acquiring shares in sothebys in february  by july  loebs stake in sothebys increased to  and in august he raised his stake to  and requested to talk with the management and board in july activists at marcato capital management revealed a  stake saying that the shares were undervalued at that point marcato and third point were sothebys second and thirdlargest shareholders following blackrock fund advisors third point’s august purchase brought its stake in sothebys to  million shares on  october third point increased its share of sothebys to  percent and in a letter to sothebys president ceo and chairman william f ruprecht called for a change in management due to the companys chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to christies as evidenced by each of the contemporary and modern art evening sales over the last several years third point noted we acknowledge that sothebys is a luxury brand but there appears to be some confusion  this does not entitle senior management to live a life of luxury at the expense of shareholders criticising sothebys for what he called an incoherent internet strategy and for not being aggressive enough in the contemporary art market loeb said that he wanted the firm to expand globally and exploit the sothebys brand through adjacent businesses and offered to join the board immediately and to help recruit several new directors who have experience increasing shareholder value share a passion for art understand technology

rights plan known generally as a poison pill whereby it forcibly diluted investor holdings in an attempt to ward off a hostile takeover third point described the action as a disproportionate response and a relic from the s” saying rather than address our welldocumented citations of mismanagement and initiate a constructive dialogue with its largest shareholder the board and the ceo have attempted to further entrench themselves putting their job security ahead of shareholders third point wrote that no action could have revealed more clearly the need for new blood and fresh views in the boardroom at this critical inflection point for sothebys between october  and february  representatives of sothebys and third point held a number of inperson and telephonic meetings in which they discussed third point’s ideas about how to increase stockholder value at these meetings third point insisted on multiple seats on sothebys board the firm offered only a single seat for loeb himself in third point’s view this offer did not represent a serious attempt to forge a settlement that would avoid a proxy contest in february  third point which by now was sothebys largest stockholder stated in a filing that it would nominate three people – loeb harry wilson and olivier reza – to sothebys board saying that current board members lack the fresh perspective necessary to overhaul the companys challenged operational structure and cure its cultural malaise informing sothebys formally on  february  of its nomination of loeb wilson and reza as board candidates third point commended sothebys for having taken certain actions that third point considered productive but stated that there remains much to be done to enhance the firm’s competitive position refocus its strategy and boost stockholder value it was reported in early march that marcato would support third point’s nominees to the board on  march a day after third point increased its stake in sothebys slightly to  the firm rejected third point’s board nominees saying that they add no relevant skills experience or expertise that is not already effectively represented on the board instead the firm nominated executive

must undertake  april  iss recommendationedit on  april  the investor shareholder advisory firm institutional shareholder services recommended that sothebys investors should vote for two of the three board members recommended by daniel loeb including himself the second board member recommended by the iss was olivier reza a former investment banker whose jeweler family has done business with sothebys prior to the iss recommendation on  april  mr loeb wrote a letter to the sothebys board noting the following we are convinced that having an owners perspective in the boardroom yields better results that this board is in dire need of fresh insights and that our candidates are more qualified than the companys emissaries we are seeking to replace in the report the iss noted that the particulars of their criticisms of things like commission margin there is credible reason to believe their larger criticism about strategic myopia has some credibility iss recommended shareholders vote for loeb and olivier reza and that introducing change into the boardroom was warranted writing for the new york times on  april of  alexandria stevenson notes mr loeb has accused sothebys of rebating the fees its takes for selling multimilliondollar works while also taking less of the buyers fees to attract more business he has taken issue with the auction houses strategy of focusing on top clients and headline sales he has even criticized board members relatively low holdings of their own company’s stock later that day sothebys issued a statement in regards to the report by the iss we believe that sothebys shareholders should vote for all of sothebys director nominees we note that iss rejected one of third points nominees and recommends that shareholders vote for our say on pay proposal on  may dan loeb and sothebys reached an agreement which stipulated that dan loeb olivier reza and harry j wilson joined the board in exchange for third point having an ownership cap at  william ruprecht would stay as ceo and the proxy context to be held at sothebys agm would cease on the newest board members bill ruprecht chairman president and ceo of sothebys noted we welcome our newest directors to the board and look forward to working with them confident that we share the common goal of delivering the greatest value to sothebys clients and shareholders this agreement ensures
