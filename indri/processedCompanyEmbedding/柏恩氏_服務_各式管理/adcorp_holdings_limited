divisions have been reorganised in order to better facilitate the offering of complete business solutions to clients with a focus on clients rather than products recruitment advertising and permanent

and flexible temporarycontract staffing our experience is that many outsourced staffing solutions require not only the staffing component but also human resource management and training capabilities the third division comprises corporate communications and design as well as research it is our intention to extend this service range to cover other business requirements the new structure is working well with pleasing results both from a profit and opportunity perspective as evidenced by the positive trading results for the first two months of the new year prospects we are uniquely positioned as a leader in the professional services value chain where growth has less to do with absolute market growth but rather with the rate at which inhouse delivery is outsourced we have the ability to offer integrated support services justifying higher margins dividend the directors have declared a dividend of  cents per share which is a  increase on the  dividend and represents a  times cover dividends
