recipes and purchasing tips for nearly  fruits vegetables and herbs this year the website features  new foods and dozens of new recipes said roy ballard purdue extensionhancock county educator and one of the program administratorsas we like to say we do what google cant and that is to bring all of this information into one place said ballard our goal is to make it easier for people to say yes to good fresh produce and that also benefits the vendors who will need to grow more and sell more to meet demandin addition to new recipes the website has expanded its collection of expertreviewed publications on food safety food preparation and successful shoppingone of the publications talks about how to shop at farmers markets ballard said if youve never been to a farmers market how do you shop there this resource can help people have a more fun and successful trip and make it something they want to do more than onceparticipating vendors display cards containing the qr codes for the websites fruits and vegetables at the point of purchase in advertisements and marketing materials and on packaging consumers can use the qr reader on their mobile devices to scan the codes for immediate access to the foodlink website consumers can also access the website directly no registration is necessary to use the website and the service is freefoodlink will continue to add new offerings over the summer ballard saidwe are very excited about the changes coming up in the next few months we plan to kick off a facebook page where people can exchange questions tips and recipes and find participating farmers markets and vendors in their area he said this summer customizable recipe cards will be available for each of the crops and there will be  seasonal recipe videos available for a variety of teaching and learning environments we also plan to add more recipes to the website and to create new resources for consumers teachers and community educatorsballard and his team also hope to increase the number of local grocery stores that enroll in foodlink helping consumers make healthy choices in the store as well as at the farmers marketwhen people go to the store every product has a label or a sign to help them choose the best option for them except for produce ballard said the fruits and vegetables might be fresh and attractively displayed but someone who doesnt know how to prepare them might not have the motivation to try them we hope that by helping stores find ways to integrate our materials into their current marketing plans we will help them boost their produce sales and help consumers make new healthy choices for their familiesfor more information about foodlink or to enroll as a vendor and receive a fast start kit visit

cfi is partnering with west virginia universitysfood justice lab in a project to develop an online resource network for people with food access issues in southeast ohio the project will also allow cfi and the regions communities to assess the food accessibility in the region mary nally the executive director of cfi said the area is known for its high poverty and food insecurity rates and although there are programs and nonprofit organization in communities across the region designed to address food accessibility there hasnt been much done to address the underlying issues of food access and poverty according to feedingamericaorg  percent of the us experiences food insecurity in  with the state of ohio experiencing a  percent food insecurity rate athens county had the highest rate of food insecurity in the state at about  percent the resource network will be a replicant of the west virginia foodlink website foodlinkwvuedu which includes a map that shows where people who depend on government food assistance programs such as snap and wic can go to purchase food using their assistance funds where fresh produce is sold and where food pantries are located the website also features profiles on each county in the foodlink network that will display comprehensive data on the median household income unemployment rate age and other household demographics in each county nally explained that it isnt just about figuring out where the next food pantry is needed but also figuring out the existing barriers and gaps in government and charity services and how they are impacting the community in each county the website will help to make data from those government entities more understandable which will make it easier to have more productive conversations about finding solutions to the existing barriers related to food insecurity in southeast ohio nally said for the next several months cfi will be collecting the data for the seo foodlink website according to nally this will include pulling data from the us census bureau us bureau of labor statistics and food assistance data from government entities it will also include contacting retailers and food pantries were really opening up the conversation nally said the seo foodlink website will include data from athens gallia hocking jackson lawrence meigs morgan perry vinton and washington counties following the data collection cfi will organize food access planning meetings for the  counties during which community members can begin to draft food security strategies according to a press release from the organization knowing the factors that contribute to poor nutrition and food disparities in each county will allow the communities to tackle their food insecurity issues the seo foodlink is also expected to inform policy recommendations for local and state legislatures as the wv foodlink has done for its state according to joshua lohnes the associate director of wv foodlink data from the wv foodlink has been used in the last two west virginia legislative sessions to make arguments against cuts to the snap program we were able to demonstrate how laws that would make eligibility for snap more restrictive would have both adverse impacts on the states food economy and reduce household food insecurity especially for households with children lohnes stated in an email sent to nally wv foodlink according to lohnes has also helped to extend community eligibility provision in counties that werent taking advantage of expanded free breakfast and lunch programs in public schools social service workers have been able to use the wv foodlink as a tool to find food resources for their clients the foodlink project also helped to facilitate legislation that provides opportunities for farmers to donate excess product to food banks and receive state tax writeoffs among several other impacts the seo foodlink website is expected to launch in december copyright   athens messenger apg
