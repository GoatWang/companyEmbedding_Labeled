problem into manageable pieces the company is now faced with a new innovation that crosses these boundaries and offers the opportunity to significantly improve the yield and performance of the manufacturing process while the technical solution is straightforward it is not clear that the companys customers are prepared to accept such a change because it would cross organizational lines that

product quality  quality  tokyo electron limited quality product quality initiatives for improving quality tel is continually improving the quality of its products to win customer satisfaction and trust an important statement from the quality policy is that “we build quality into every tel product during the design phase by focusing on leadingedge technology by bringing quality into our processes early and focusing on quality throughout all processes we succeed in providing high quality products and services” this is the foundation of our quality assurance activitiesspecifically we have adopted the frontloading approach this involves identifying and solving problems early in the product development and design processes to enhance design quality in addition we have expanded our training programs and established a system to verify skill levels in order to improve individual skills and design quality ultimately ensuring proper identification of problems and appropriate analysisin addition we implement inprocess quality control during each processfrom development and design to shipment semiconductor production equipment consists of various components and modules and assembly involves multiple processes making each of the manufacturing processes responsible for component quality is very effective significantly reducing production costs and defects each of our process teams constantly seeks improvement helping to produce superior products by taking ownership of quality assurance within a given processbecause the quality of each component can affect the overall quality of the end product we also focus on the quality of components early in the design phase tel’s development and quality assurance divisions exchange information among themselves and with suppliers in order to improve the quality of drawings and purchase specifications this also enables early sharing of component information as a result the quality of components has improved leading to fewer component defects inprocess quality control the idea that at each process employees take responsibility to ensure product quality with no defects   dff inc    education to promote highquality manufacturing in alignment with customer needs tel continually carries out crossfunctional quality improvement activities with involvement of not only its development and design departments but also other departments such as planning sales administration and field service as part of these efforts we encourage tel employees to obtain external quality certification administered by the japanese standards association and the union of japanese scientists and engineers the qmqc exam quality management and quality control examination is a major quality certification with more than  certification holders in japan as of september  the certification enables employees to improve their knowledge and skills in the area of quality control improve the quality of their work and provide customers with highquality products starting in fiscal year  this initiative has increased the number of certified employees each year to a total of  as of march in addition we are also educating our employees in the plan do check act pdca cycle although pdca is most frequently used to improve management of production and quality we have chosen to employ this method in every aspect of our business not just in production activities pdca is already being used in many areas driving process efficiency and greater value for our customers   dff inc    response to quality problems despite our efforts to produce highquality products with the frontloading approach inprocess quality control and employee education unforeseen quality problems occur from time to time when any such problem is reported by customers the information is fed into our proprietary qvics knowledge management system this information is distributed to the departments concerned enabling information sharing and quick problem resolution if disclosure of defect information is deemed necessary based on our internal criteria we issue necessary technical documents and inform our customersfor particularly serious problems we employ the tel step problemsolving model a customized version of the eight discipline d problem solving method widely used in quality management the tel step model enables systematic and highly reliable analysis of a problem to determine the root cause leading to quick implementation of countermeasures and preventing recurrence of similar problems we are currently training our personnel to actively use this methodwhen a quality issue occurring in one business unit has the potential to affect other business units we use a proprietary system called qabox to prevent the problem from spreading the system allows relevant information to be centrally managed on our secure network the information is shared with quality assurance managers at tel manufacturing companies and with the corporate quality division to discuss appropriate resolution following the discussion critical information is reported to the corporate executive officer in charge of quality to quickly determine the future actions on the issue d problem solving method  a quality improvement method for solving problems through eight disciplines or processes tokyo electron   dff inc    quality product quality education to promote

raw material procurement and product manufacture transport use and disposal was calculated according to the greenhouse gas ghg protocol emissions arising from product use currently account for  of our total emissions for this reason tel has made it a key corporate objective to promote environmentally friendly product design and has been striving to lower the energy consumption of its products in fiscal year  tel established a goal to reduce energy and pure water consumption by  by fiscal year  using fiscal year  consumption as the baseline in fiscal year  tel expanded the scope of this program to include products produced by its overseas subsidiaries tel also monitored tel’s global energy use while seeking to improve overall throughput in addition the percentage of sales of energysaving models increased to  of the total product salesto reduce the overall environmental impact of our products at our customers’ sites we must examine our primary equipment peripherals associated facilities and management of our own factories increasing the operational efficiency of the entire production system is increasingly important along with encouraging energyefficient operations of our customers’ sites we will continue to focus on monitoring and controlling our energy use we also plan to demonstrate the importance of energy saving measures through compliance with semi s a semiconductor industry standard for assessing energy conservationto meet our goals we are promoting environmentally friendly manufacturing through development of new technologies further reduction in the use of energy water and chemicals and proactive measures to contain greenhouse gases based on inhouse standardsenergy conservation features of tin metallization systemthin film deposition is a key process in semiconductor manufacturing conventionally chemical vapor deposition cvd was the technology of choice for this process however the need for continued semiconductor miniaturization from our customers called for development of new equipment based on the advanced sequential flow deposition asfd process technology this new technology not only enables deposition of nanoscale film with highly engineered properties but can also be implemented at temperatures lower than those for cvd making it a superior deposition technology in terms of energy conservationtel’s tin metallization system was developed in response to this shift in process technologies due largely to its low temperature processing and idletime energy conservation feature the system achieved a  reduction in per wafer energy consumption in fiscal year  as compared with its performance in fiscal year the latest triasetm exⅱtm tin plus model features a newly developed reactor chamber and unique gas injection mechanism to attain significant improvement in throughput while reducing the energy consumption level to  of the previous model as a result the new model achieved the corporate target of reducing energy consumption per wafer by  from the fiscal year  level this is three years ahead of the fiscal year  deadline cvd a method for depositing thin films on substrates by decomposing source materials using thermal andor chemical processes asfd advanced sequential flow deposition a lowtemperature processing method for forming nanoscale metal films with highlyengineered properties   dff inc    management of chemical substances contained in products to achieve our goal of manufacturing environmentally friendly products tel has set up a system for managing hazardous chemicals in our products in addition we proactively collect information on relevant laws and regulations in japan and abroad to properly ensure compliance for example when any substance of very high concern svhc is present in our products at a level of  or higher we disclose the information appropriately based on eu reach regulations we also provide safety data sheets sds on the chemicals we use in accordance with ghs requirementsto comply more effectively with regulations such as reach and china rohs in april  we conducted a survey of our japanese suppliers regarding the chemicals contained in their products based on the jamp aisin fiscal year  we expanded the previous year’s seminar on design for environmental compliance and offered the course not only to managers but also to staff members from relevant departments the seminar consisted of an overview of frequently revised environmental laws and regulations lectures on target chemicals and comprehension tests about  employees took the course

demand to reduce the environmental burden of logistics activities transportation regulations are becoming more stringent tel continues to adjust its logistics operations to meet these demandsco reduction initiativestel’s co emissions from domestic logistics operations are monitored and calculated within the scope of regulation defined by the act on the rational use of energy in our overseas logistics operations co emissions are monitored and calculated based on the data from our intracompany logistics and product shipments to customers tel has been implementing modal shifts to transportation methods that are less environmentally harmful where applicable for example we have adopted ocean shipment for some semiconductor and fpd production equipment and are making efforts to reduce production lead time to compensate for the extra time it takes to ship by ocean rather than by air we have extended the use of shelved trolleys from the shipment of fpd production equipment to semiconductor production equipment as well thereby improving the load factor of trucks and reducing both co emissions and cost our co emissions in fiscal year  were  kilotons down about  yearoveryear this is primarily due to the increase in the ratio of outbound international ocean shipments modal shift a change in the mode of transport specifically switching from conventional freight transport by truck or aircraft to a means that has a lower impact on the environment such as rail or ocean resourcesaving initiativesbecause tel ’s products are precision equipment they must be shipped with care and in clean conditions requiring the use wooden crates and cardboard boxes to conserve some of these resources tel uses recyclable cardboard boxes for packaging after the equipment has been shipped and installed casters and other specialized transport fixtures are collected and brought back to tel factories for reuse these are only a few examples of tel’s resourcesaving efforts   dff inc    product reuse and recycling with the advent of the internet of things iot semiconductors are in greater demand and are becoming more diverse than ever this has driven a corresponding rise in the need for more varied semiconductor production equipment as a leading manufacturer of semiconductor equipment tel is strongly encouraging reuse and recycling of equipment and components by marketing refurbished tel equipment and offering modification services to customers who already have tel equipment installed our refurbished equipment operations start with procuring used equipment from the market which takes place either directly or through leasing companies this equipment is then properly tested and refurbished before being offered to customers as tel certified used equipment our equipment modification services boost the productivity of installed equipment by maintaining and improving its quality and availability through these approaches we address our customers’ cost speed and performance needs while also contributing to waste reduction and resource conservation and utilization these efforts help reduce the use of resources and co emissions associated with procuring and manufacturing equipment and components they are also effective in reducing the costs of production logistics and waste disposal    dff inc    environment product initiatives environmentally friendly
