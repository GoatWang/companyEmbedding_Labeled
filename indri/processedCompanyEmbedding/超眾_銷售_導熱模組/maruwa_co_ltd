story sales  casio domestic sales division customer  maruwa unyu kikan co ltd location  saitama japan product  itg application  transportation and logistics user’s profile maruwa opened a new shizuoka food delivery center in july  as the logistics base for supermarkets in shizuoka area this delivery center is situated in very good location approximate km away from shimadakanaya interchange of new tomei highway maruwa targets transport and logistics for food distribution mainly for supermarkets as most important business criteria focusing on very high growth rate in supermarkets maruwa targets local supermarkets which mainly supply fresh foods for local customers mr ominato general manager of pl operation hq told “ there are still active local supermarkets and those local supermarkets are and will be supported by local people then we would like to support such active supermarkets by closely providing local foods day by day ” as well as pl operations maruwa provides management support services called “ azcom pl which includes reduction of sales administration cost they also support opening food service delivery center with a supermarket mr ominato streeses that maruwa can contribute not only for total logistics cost reduction but also for new business development for our customers ” in the logistics center handheld terminal plays an important role mr ominato explains that using auto id tools is inevitable to have much skilled labors and increase our productivity mr ominato adds that investing for auto id and handheld terminals is more costeffective for maruwa than large capital investment considering that business size of local supermarkets is around usd to  billi the reason behind the adoption of new it system casio itg handheld terminal is now used in the delivery center itg is used for cargo receipt and goods in for product registration to wms by checking itf barcodes of outer cases most important function is auto capturing of food expiration date with ocr reading in itg’s cmos camera all expiration dates of all products are checked in the delivery center after checking expiration date goodsin operation is completed with printing goodsin label including location date product name janitf code number of the carton box and expiration date maruwa has used casio dtx handheld before and decided to replace by new itg handheld  inch large size display and touch screen panel are preferred by maruwa but most important point was using ocr function for food expiration date control as food quality control is one of most concerned subjects among japanese consumers and maruwa set top priority on this subject at the same time itg is also used for picking delivered items operator picks ordered items up according to order pickling list and location instruction per product expiration date is also automatically checked for each ordered item remark  itg japanese domestic model has some original functions different from overseas models

furoshiki is used for wrapping things and japanese extend their hearts gratitude into wrapping furoshiki this is a japanese unique culture in the world we use furoshiki because of human relationship i recommend you to use furoshiki not only for carrying on the tradition but also showing your heart to the others about furoshiki it shows japanese minimalism and functionalism in the piece of fabric that allows to wrap anything from round sake bottles to square boxes and when not in use to be folded and stored compactly away its uses are only limited by your imagination now furoshiki is used for fashion interior decoration grocery bag gift wrapping etc recently in japan it is getting popular to use furoshiki as an ecofriendly product especailly we recommend to use it for gift wrapping instead of wrapping paper grocery bag instead of plastic bag the character “” is used in wrapping something with furoshiki but the letter originally symbolizes a pregnant woman in the same way a pregnant mother cares for her baby so furoshiki implies a care given to the object wrapped inside history of furoshiki at nara periodad  some temples had steam saunas and people had sat on furoshiki at muromachi period ad  the nobles used furoshiki with their family crests to distinguish from others when they go to public spa at edo periodad  public sauna was getting popular among people with furoshiki and they started to use furoshiki in some special occasion like picnic hiking etc after edo period the most popular furoshiki was made of cotton and hand printed after meiji periodad  it was necessary to use for any ceremonial occasion like wedding and people have used it as a bag for business school in their daily lives after world war two many types of furoshiki has been produced by the developed printing technique and artificial fiber with massproduction because of it many organization started to make their novelty furoshiki with their logo today furoshiki is used as a ecofriendly
