quality made by manzmore infotesting and measuring wafers and cells during manufacturing is an important means of controlling the quality of manufactured cells even the tiniest mechanical defects in the cells – such as microcracks for example – can have a negative impact on the efficiency of the entire module or render it completely unusable for the purposes of quality control manz manufactures complete wafer testing systems which are used by wafer manufacturers for their endofline inspection and by cell manufacturers for their receiving inspections the testers and sorters are characterized by their modular design and can be equipped with a variety of testing and measuring systems  testing the wafer’s geometry  testing for microcracks  measuring the wafer’s level of contamination  measuring the electrical resistance and carrier lifetime  measuring the thickness of the wafers and the total thickness variation  measuring the saw marks  measuring bow and warp after further production steps the celltesting and sorting modules in the backend area of the plant measure the various levels of quality and sort each cell into the designated module class the cell testers are

substrates wet chemical etching equipment to clean or preetch the tco layer rounds out manz’s range of products the manz group is the global market leader for laserscribing equipment with an estimated market share of approx  and sets international standards when it comes to equipment for manufacturing thinfilm solar modules pdf catalogautomation  thinfilm automation made by manzmore infomanz can look back on a long successful history of providing automation solutions for the fpd industry our automation solutions have now been on the market for  years and manz has been successfully applying exactly this expertise to the field of photovoltaics for many years our customers are the ones who can truly profit from the benefits of this longterm experience manz has wellengineered advanced and innovative solutions at its disposal for handling glass substrates which are primarily characterized by the low level of maintenance they require and their high level of process stability the equipment’s low operating costs and high productivity – as a result of low tact times and minimal breakage rates – both play significant roles in contributing to a successful manufacturing process our automation solutions which were developed together with the fraunhofer institute especially for use in cleanrooms have become a wellknown and established part of the photovoltaic industry over the past few years  handling of all major substrates for thinfilm solar modules with axis robots  buffer systems  conveyor systems  loading and unloading of trolleys our newly developed concept of a central automation corridor for fab automation provides many advantages  saving of storage space due to „chaotic storage“  higher flexibility the central robot unit reaches every substrate cassette very quickly this leads to shorter cycle times  cost advantage the enclosed cassette stations can be purged with inert gas or dry air this reduces the clean room class requirements for the entire fab  the central automation corridor is modular and can be extended as required it can also be applied to different glass sizesscribing equipment  laser  mechanical scribing by manzmore infomanz’s scribing systems are optimized for the highest level of precision – for every scribing process needed during the manufacture of thinfilm solar modules and manz’s equipment can be used for both highprecision mechanical p p for cigs substrates as well as laserassisted p p and p scribing during the manufacturing process active tracking manz’s inline precision control system allows dead areas to be reduced by  µm– µm a new milestone compared to other systems on the market doing so significantly increases the efficiency of the solar modules low operating costs are just one of the many benefits of manz’s scribing equipment high throughput and maximum efficiency are valued by longterm manz clients this is primarily the result of the parallel processing which allows tact times to be reduced while still maintaining the high level of quality another notable characteristic in addition to the highprecision processes and the high quality of the products is the equipment’s sophisticated and flexible design it allows the equipment to be easily integrated in completely automated production lines mechanical scribing substrate sizes  ×  mm to  ×  mm  highprecision machine base built from polymer concrete  highprecision dynamic linear motor drive  image processing for substrate calibration and compensation  different types of scribe heads to adjust for system throughput  efficient exhaust

more than  pieces of equipment delivered and installed manz asia is one the largest suppliers of cleaning and etching equipment for the fpd and pcb industry which gives the manz group access to extensive expertise in the field of wet chemistry using this expertise manz has developed innovative wet chemical equipment for manufacturing thinfilm solar modules this includes systems for cleaning glass substrates and systems for preetching the tco layer both systems are characterized by a number of benefits in comparison to conventional equipment their compact size and modular design allow the machines to be integrated into existing production lines efficiently and in a way that saves space both glasscleaning and tco etching systems are available for all common substrate sizes it goes without saying that the systems were designed for maximum throughput and productivity and that they fulfill the highest demands of the pv industry the systems’ wellengineered design reduces the need for consumable parts and cuts operating costslaser edge isolation and laser cutting  laser edge ablation made by manzmore infoan extremely reliable laser edge ablation process is required to manufacture highquality thinfilm solar modules this process which is carried out prior to laminating the glass cover ensures that the coated glass is well isolated conventional methods of edge ablation such as sandblasting or grinding the edge require a lower initial investment however due to their high operating costs they are less economical over the long term in addition the edge ablation process using these methods has drawbacks – such as reduced product quality and productivity in comparison laser edge ablation equipment from manz has been a fixture on the market for many years and is well known for its extremely high level of performance and reliability cutting rates of up to  cm²s can be achieved with these systems during the laser edge isolation process the glass is neither damaged nor negatively affected high process accuracy cost effectiveness and low tact times are the decisive advantages of manz’s laser edge ablation systems which can be used for all currently available thinfilm substrate sizesmanz cigsfabmanz is the only supplier of an integrated and fullyproductive turnkey production line for cigs modules that generates profit the cigs
