from the tool owners in response to our direct support line at aldsupport at ultratech dot com june 9  “we have been working with the savannah and fiji ald systems for over eight years and have found them to be excellent research tools our decision to move forward with our most recent purchase and to establish a collaborative relationship with ultratechcnt was based on our confidence in the performance of these products and in the consistency of support we have always received from the ultratechcnt staff over the years” prof miinjang chen nanoelectronic and nanophotonic materials laboratory nnml national taiwan university june   ultratechcnts ald system has provided a significant boost to our research productivity enabling us to make rapid advances in the field of surface and interfacial modification of energy conversion devices including batteries solar cells and catalysts the versatility of the ald system to address the varied needs of our research program coupled with

requirements in a costeffective and timely manner while continually improving our processes and procedures involved in the sheet metal fabrication process each job that enters our shop is treated with the same standard of inspection and care to ensure that it is made per print and then delivered to the customer on time and in good condition at the beginning of the inspection process each part is checked for compliance by our amada fabrivision optical inspection machine  this ensures that the part was cutpunched from the sheet within tolerance and that all features of the part are present as the part moves through the shop a “first piece inspection” will be done for each additional operation to ensure compliance parts that require multiple welds bends or types of hardware will have each individually checked any machined parts that may be present in a project will be checked for compliance by our optical comparator machine when a part reaches the end of the fabrication process it is put through a “final inspection” to double check tolerances aesthetic requirements and functionality if the customer insists on a more thorough inspection process we can provide a “first article inspection” or an as 9 type report at a cost in doing this we will provide reports of all dimensions balloon drawings paint certifications plating certifications material certifications or whatever else may be required by the customer to receive the traceability they need on their product if for whatever reason a customer is not satisfied with the final product they have received we are always willing to work with them to get it up to the standard they had expected engineeringour experienced manufacturing engineering staff is happy to work closely with the customer to fabricate the best product possible whether this means designing something from scratch providing feedback for a potential prototype reengineering an existing product or even something simple like selecting a material
