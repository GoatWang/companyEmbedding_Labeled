licenses maintenance and service agreements in our lifeboat distribution segment sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel in our techxtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service competitive pricing and flexible payment solutions to our customers our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of it spending and customer demand for products we distribute   we sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required to date we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments electronic ordering “edi” and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined   selling general and

factors that affect the software industry in general and other factors generally we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in this report and our annual report on form k for the year ended december     the company operates in a rapidly changing business and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict every risk factor nor can it assess the impact if any of all such risk factors on the company’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements   accordingly forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements which speak only as of their dates the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise   the statements concerning future sales future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward looking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products product mix pricing pressures market conditions and other factors which could result in a

the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities revenues from the sales of hardware products software products licenses maintenance and subscription agreements are generally recognized on a gross basis upon delivery or fulfillment with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales   on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to product returns bad debts inventories intangible assets income taxes stockbased compensation contingencies and litigation   the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates   the company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates   allowance for accounts receivable   the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors including  historical experience aging of the accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience if actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management additional expense may be incurred   accounts receivable – long term   the company’s accounts receivable longterm are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates in doing so the company considers competitive market rates and other factors   inventory allowances   the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writeoffs may be required   income taxes   the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made              sharebased payments   under the fair value recognition provision stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period we record the impact of forfeitures when they occur we review our valuation assumptions periodically and as a result we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with sharebased payments   recently issued accounting pronouncements     in may  the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance for revenue recognition for contracts superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements along with most existing industryspecific guidance the guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps  identify the contract  identify performance obligations  determine the transaction price  allocate the transaction price and  recognize revenue the new standard will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect as of the beginning of the period of adoption the standard and related amendments will be effective for the company for its annual reporting period beginning january   including interim periods within that reporting period the company is in the process of developing its conclusions on several aspects of the standard including principal versus agent considerations identification of performance obligations the determination of when control of goods and services transfers to the company’s customer which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements   in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  simplifying the measurement of inventory topic  asu  topic  inventory currently

amendments in asu  require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value asu  is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   we adopted asu  during the

payment accounting asu  asu  simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   the company adopted the provisions of asu  related to the recognition of excess tax benefits in the income statement and classification in the statement of cash flows were adopted prospectively and the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted the company has elected to account for forfeitures of sharebased awards when they occur in determining compensation cost to be recognized each period the adoption of asu  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu  leases asu  asu  supersedes the lease guidance under fasb accounting standards codification asc

statements   results of operations   the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial information derived from the company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings expressed as a percentage of net sales this comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results                     three months ended         march

income before income taxes           income tax provision           net income               net sales   net sales for the quarter ended march   increased  or  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  net sales increased in both our lifeboat distribution segment and our techxtend segment   lifeboat distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended march   increased  million or  to  million compared to  million for the same period a year earlier the increase was primarily due to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines as well as the addition of several new product lines the increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and distribution accounts due to competitive bid situations we operate in a competitive market in which some sales agreements are subject to periodic competitive bidding processes resulting in fluctuations from year to year based on the outcome   techxtend segment net sales increased  million or  to  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million for the prior year the increase was primarily due to higher sales to enterprise and public sector accounts   during the quarter ended march   we relied on two key customers for a total of  of our revenue one major customer accounted for  and the other for  respectively of our total net sales during the three months ended march    these same customers accounted for  and  respectively of total net accounts receivable as of march        gross profit   gross profit for the quarter ended march   increased  or  million to  million compared to  million for the same period in  lifeboat distribution segment gross profit increased  to  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million for the same period in the prior year techxtend segment gross profit increased  to  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million for the same period in the prior year gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes somewhat offset by competitive pressures on gross profit margins as discussed below   gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter ended march   was  compared to  for the same period in  lifeboat distribution segment gross profit margin was  for the quarter ended march   compared to  for the same period in  the decrease in gross profit margin for the lifeboat distribution segment was primarily caused by competitive pricing pressure and product mix we operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been for gross profit margins to decline for the past several years we attribute some of the decline to an increasing portion of our revenues coming from the sale of licenses maintenance and service agreements that are not associated with a physical product while our gross profit margin has declined on these products we have instituted operational efficiencies such as electronic ordering and distribution through the use of edi and other automation that increase our productivity and enable us to maintain profitability techxtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended march   was  compared to  for the same period in  the decrease in gross profit margin was due to competitive market pricing particularly on larger enterprise and public sector sales sales of large enterprise licenses and related equipment typically carry a lower gross profit margin and lower incremental selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue than smaller account sales   vendor rebates and discounts for the quarter ended march   were  million compared to  million in the same quarter last year vendor rebates are dependent on reaching certain targets set by our vendors the company monitors vendor rebate levels competitive pricing and gross profit margins carefully we anticipate that price competition in our market will continue in both of our business segments   selling general and administrative expenses   sga expenses for the quarter ended march   increased  million or  to  million compared to  million for the same period in  the increase is primarily due to increased employee related expenses salaries commissions and bonus to support our growth sga expenses were  of net sales for the quarter ended march   and  for the same period in    the company expects that its sga expenses as a percentage of net sales may vary depending on changes in sales volume as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives we plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing while monitoring sga expenses closely   income taxes   for the three months ended march   the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  million or  of income compared to  million or  of income for the same period in   the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in tax effects related to share based payments at settlement or expiration through the income statement due to the adoption of asu    liquidity and capital resources   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by  million to  million at march   from  million at december   the decrease in cash was primarily due to lower cash from operating activities and related changes in working capital and increased cash used in financing activities related to stock repurchases and dividends   net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended march   was  million comprised of net income adjusted for noncash items of  million offset by cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of  million      the increase in cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities in the first quarter of  was primarily due to an increase in net working capital accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable required to support our business the increased working capital requirement is driven by increased sales levels and extended payment terms for one of our major reseller customers   in the quarter ended march   net cash used in investing activities was  million compared to less than  million in the same quarter in prior year   net cash used in financing activities for the quarter ended march   of  million was comprised of  million of dividend payments on our common stock and  million for the stock repurchases

                                                                                         exhibit    indemnification agreement this indemnification agreement the “ agreement ” is made and entered into as of   by and between wayside technology group inc a delaware corporation the “ company ” and  “ indemnitee ” witnesseth that whereas highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve corporations as directors officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation whereas the board of directors of the company the “ board ” has determined that in order to attract and retain qualified individuals the company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis at its sole expense liability insurance to protect persons serving the company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities  although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among united statesbased corporations and other business enterprises the company believes that given current market conditions and trends such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions  at the same time directors officers and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and timeconsuming litigation relating to among other things matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the company or business enterprise itself the company’s  certificate of incorporation as amended andor amended and restated from time to time the “ certificate of incorporation ” and bylaws as amended andor amended and restated from time to time the “ bylaws ” require indemnification of the officers and directors of the company  indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the general corporation law of the state of delaware “ dgcl ”  the certificate of incorporation bylaws and the dgcl expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the company and members of the board officers and other persons with respect to indemnification whereas the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons whereas the board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the company’s stockholders and that                                     the company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future whereas it is reasonable prudent and necessary for the company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify and to advance expenses on behalf of such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified whereas this agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the certificate of incorporation bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of indemnitee thereunder and whereas indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the certificate of incorporation bylaws and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances and may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection and the company desires indemnitee to serve in such capacity  indemnitee is willing to serve continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the company on the condition that he or she be so indemnified now therefore in consideration of indemnitee’s agreement to serve as an officer andor director from and after the date hereof the parties hereto agree as follows indemnity of indemnitee   the company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law as such may be amended from time to time  in furtherance of the foregoing indemnification and without limiting the generality thereof proceedings

or on his or her behalf in connection with such proceeding or any claim issue or matter therein if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company and with respect to any criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe the indemnitee’s conduct was unlawful proceedings by or in the right of the company   indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this section b if by reason of his or her corporate status the indemnitee is or is threatened to be made a party to or participant in any proceeding brought by or in the right of the company  pursuant to this section b  indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee’s behalf in connection with such proceeding if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company provided    however  if applicable law so provides no indemnification against such expenses shall be made in respect of any claim issue or matter in such proceeding as to which indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the company unless and to the extent that the court of chancery of the state of delaware shall determine that such indemnification may be made

status a party to and is successful on the merits or otherwise in any proceeding he or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law as such may be amended from time to time against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith  if indemnitee is not wholly successful in such proceeding but is successful on the merits or otherwise as to one or more but less than all claims issues or matters in such proceeding the company shall indemnify indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim issue or matter  for purposes of this section c and without limitation the termination of any claim issue or matter in such a proceeding by dismissal with or without prejudice shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim issue or matter additional indemnity   in addition to and without regard to any limitations on the indemnification provided for in section  of this agreement the company shall and hereby does indemnify and hold harmless indemnitee against all expenses judgments penalties fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf if by reason of his or her corporate status he or she is or is threatened to be made a party to or participant in any proceeding including a proceeding by or in the right of the company including without limitation all liability arising out of the negligence or active or passive wrongdoing of indemnitee  the only limitation that shall exist upon the company’s obligations pursuant to this agreement shall be that the company shall not be obligated to make any payment to indemnitee that is finally determined under the procedures and subject to the presumptions set forth in sections  and  hereof to be unlawful contribution  whether or not the indemnification provided in sections  and  hereof is available in respect of any proceeding in which the company is jointly liable with indemnitee or would be if joined in such proceeding the company shall pay in the first instance the entire

against indemnitee  the company shall not enter into any settlement of any proceeding in which the company is jointly liable with indemnitee or would be if joined in such proceeding unless such settlement provides for a full and final release of all claims asserted against indemnitee without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the company set forth in section a  if for any reason indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any proceeding in which the company is jointly liable with indemnitee or would be if joined in such

relative benefits received by the company and all officers directors or employees of the company other than indemnitee who are jointly liable with indemnitee or would be if joined in such proceeding on the one hand and indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction or events from which such proceeding arose provided    however  that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit
