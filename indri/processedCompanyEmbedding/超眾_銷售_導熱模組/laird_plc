have fallen by as much as  today after it announced a profit warning should investors avoid it or does laird present a buying opportunity for the long term laird experienced a disappointing first half of the year and was expected to record a significant improvement in the second half of the year however its third quarter has been hugely challenging the acceleration of production for mobile devices has come much later than in previous cycles and visibility remains poor laird has also experienced margin pressure as a result of unprecedented pricing issues and some operational factors the effect of this has been a very tough quarter and laird has reduced guidance for the full year it now expects underlying pretax profit to be around £m this would represent a fall of £m from last year’s pretax profit of £m clearly investors have reacted negatively to profit warning however the company is taking action to stabilise and boost its performance it will focus on managing costs and improving cash flow laird expects year end net debt to ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation to be within covenant limits of  times furthermore laird’s business outside of its performance materials division remains strong with its wireless systems division delivering a rise in sales of  in the quarter it has also seen positive momentum in its automotive business while trading in novero remains consistent with previous guidance external factors laird’s disappointing three months is due to external factors rather than a failure by the company itself the smartphone market has been under pressure of late with apple reporting a  drop in sales of its smartphones in the most recent quarter similarly samsung has endured a tough period as product recalls are likely to have affected sales numbers as such laird remains a sound business and its strategy to become more efficient and streamlined could lead to an improved business model over the mediumtolong term however in the short run things could get worse before they get better the smartphone market remains highly uncertain and while laird may be able to meet updated guidance there can be no guarantee that this will be the only reduction in guidance before the end of the year this means that laird’s share price could fall further however in the long run the smartphone market is likely to grow demand from emerging markets should pick up as gdp per capita increases in the coming years therefore laird continues to offer sound longterm growth potential and could recover the lost ground in the aftermath of today’s profit warning buying now would be risky since laird’s shares are likely to be highly volatile but the potential rewards are also high which makes it appealing for investors who are able to take a longterm view but is this an even better buy despite this theres another stock that could be an even better buy in fact its been named as a top growth share from the motley fool the company in
