sarbanes–oxley act business portal v t e net profit also referred to as the bottom line net income or net earnings is a measure of the profitability of a venture after accounting for all costs it is the actual profit and includes the operating expenses that are excluded from gross profit in a survey of nearly  senior marketing managers  responded that they found the net profit metric very useful in accounting net profit is equal to the gross profit minus overheads and interest payable for a given time period usually the accounting periodcitation needed a common synonym for net profit when discussing financial statements which include a balance sheet and an income statement is the bottom line this term results from the traditional appearance of an income statement which shows all allocated revenues and expenses over a specified time period with the resulting summation on the bottom line of the report in simplistic terms net profit is the money left over after paying all the expenses of an endeavor in practice this can get very complex in large organizations or endeavors the bookkeeper or accountant must itemise and allocate revenues and expenses properly to the specific working scope and context in which the term is applied definitions of the term can however vary between the uk and us in the us net profit is often associated with net income or profit after tax see table below the net profit margin percentage is a related ratio this figure is calculated by dividing net profit by revenue or turnover and it represents profitability as a percentage contents

to calculate net profit for a venture such as a company division or project subtract all costs including a fair share of total corporate overheads from the gross revenues or turnover net profit  sales revenue − total costs net profit is a measure of the fundamental profitability of the venture it is the revenues of the activity less the costs of the activity the main complication is    when needs to be allocated across ventures almost by definition overheads are costs that cannot be directly tied to any specific project product or division the classic example would be the cost of headquarters staff although it is theoretically possible to calculate profits for any subventure such as a product or region often the calculations are rendered suspect by the need to allocate overhead costs because overhead costs generally don’t come in neat packages their allocation across ventures is not an exact science exampleedit here is how you reach net profit on a pl profit  loss account sales
