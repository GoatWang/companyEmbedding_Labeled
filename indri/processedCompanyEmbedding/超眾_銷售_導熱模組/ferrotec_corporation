the news all contents  07 copyright ferrotec usa corporation all rights reserved  legal information about us  ferrofluid skip to content about us repurposing magnetic fluids to solve a need of a vacuum feedthrough ferrofluid technology first appeared on the technological scene in the 960’s when a researcher at nasa tried to create a magnetic rocket fuel that could be manipulated under zero gravity by powerful magnets and fed into rocket engines this concept was abandoned for other alternatives at the time but the technology was licensed by the earliest founders of what is now ferrotec corporation and since then ferrotec has been the world leader in magnetic fluid technology manufacturing and supply by all modern standards these first magnetic fluids were crude and would have no practical use in current technologies but they laid the groundwork for the innovations that were to follow magnetic fluid technology was first licensed by nasa to avco corporation wilmington ma in the 960’s under the direction of dr ron rosensweig the name ferrofluid was first coined by rosensweig et al in 967 in a contract research report funded by nasa commercialization of ferrofluids began in  with the founding of ferrofluidics corporation by re rosensweig and r moskowitz the official name for the product was given as ferrofluid many possible applications were envisioned for ferrofluids loudspeaker technology was one of them and continues to be one of the largest market segments going into over 00 million loudspeakers each year at over 00 different companies since then ferrotec corporation formerly ferrofluidics has branched out into many areas of ferrofluid technology becoming a world leader in products for domain detection material separation and biomedical research among
