with peer tracker if you already know a listed peerpeer tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications the degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores with market screener if you have no listed peer in mindmarket screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria identifying peers searching for comparable companies in a specific business sectorabout market multiplesmany methods can be used to value a company in reality business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches one of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method the market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input to provide an objective starting point for the valuation put simply this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the market value of the businesscurrent multiples include historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period last last twelve months ltm forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones next twelve months ntm fy fycurrent multiples based on pershare metrics such as earnings per share or book value per share are calculated using the last closing price while current multiples based on companylevel metrics such as net sales ebit or ebitda are calculated using the current market cap or ev enterprise value
