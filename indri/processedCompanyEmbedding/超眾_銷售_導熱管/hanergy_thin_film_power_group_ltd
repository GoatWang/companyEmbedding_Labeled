thinfilm solar product hantile in beijing the new product integrates hanergys worldleading flexible thinfilm solar chip with roofing material capable of efficient power generation with high safety level a perfect fit for current aesthetic modern architectural design as an upgrade to current distributed solar products and traditional roof tiles in the market the hantile possesses promising prospects and its largescale promotion will surely contribute greatly to the replacement of clean energy guests attended the launch event included the following li bingren president of china building decoration association li hejun board chairman of the hanergy holding group over  potential distributors and channel partners and another odd people from local governments industrial associations financial organizations as well as domestic and foreign media they gathered together to witness the historical release of the hantile an upgradedproduct inspired from the companys original hanergy civil focusing solar products in his speech titled one tile one tree chairman li hejun remarked hanergy took advantage of the lightness thinness and flexibleness of thinfilm solar power material and creatively integrated it with roof tile this integration between technology and industrial products is a breakthrough in the history of construction even more so such creation is an innovation based on our chinese culture merging cuttingedge thinfilm technology and traditional culture qin bricks and han tiles have long been upheld in chinese literature from the weiyang palace of western han dynasty to the home of peasants tiles have been considered not only as an important characteristic of chinese architecture but also endowed with cultural significance to quote a famous folk saying home is where the tile overhead tile signifies home in the heart of the chinese all around us everything is going through tremendous changes except the material and function of tiles have remained the same as their purposes are still simply protection from wind and rain preservation of warmth and decoration as today the introduction of the hantile will change all that the hantile using laminated packaging technology encapsulates a thin light flexible and efficient cigs thinfilm solar chip into ultraclear float glass that not only able to maximized solar chips conversion rate but fulfilling architectural aesthetic demands at the same time data shows that the current average conversion rate of the hanergys flexible thinfilm chips used by the hantile is  at the manufacturing level such rate is expected to rise to  by end of the year and such consistent growth is expected at the future the hantile highly reflects the essence of chinese traditional culture and architectural philosophy the choice of material and design considers practicality incorporates aesthetic and humanistic values and creates environmentally friendly architecture reflecting the harmony between human beings and nature the product name – hantile – is taken from and develops on chinese culture as well as hanergy technology said li hejun at the event during mr lis speech an allinone construction team was building a m rooftop with hantile about  minutes later a rooftop covered with  pieces of hantile for an installed capacity of w had been completed and was ready to be displayed in front of guests upgraded products and services and pioneering automatic custom service current distributed solar power modules are generally installed on the surface of buildings which cannot be part of them as an upgraded version of these modules the hantile comes in three models curved flat and upturned c styles which can cater to the aesthetical and individualized needs of most buildings in addition to integrating the thinfilm solar chips for power generation the hantile the product series also contains accessory tiles of the same color and design to achieve consistency as a onestop service provider for complete clean energy solution hanergy provide customers with integrating consultancy system design installation grid connection user training operation and maintenance data monitoring so on as a construction material the hantile has better performances than traditional tiles in terms of thermal insulation heat preservation fire prevention infiltration prevention and hail prevention the hantile especially stands out with its waterproof performance because of its special design glass material utype weather bar and ftype slot in terms of structure this product has perfect windproof and lightning protection design it is able to generate power at a temperature from  degrees celsius to  degrees celsius at present the hantile has received the china compulsory certification and the china quality certification and passed installation testing meeting all industrial requirements in term of product quality and safety at the launch event hanergy announced the market price of the triple arch solar tile as  yuanm hanergy offers lifetime warranty and lifetime charged maintenance hanergys mature service system fostered by residential power generation product and other distributed solar
