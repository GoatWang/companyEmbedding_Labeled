ingots electric transformation metals electric transformation metals development of electric transformation metals for the first time in korea as well as iljin’s first case of technology localization  electric transformation metals are parts used to connect electric power supply facilities that supply electricity to homes or factories and is an essential part for the supply of electricity back in the s however all of these parts were imported from developed countries including the us chairman huh chin kyu regretted the fact that the supply of electricity a fundamental infrastructure that ensures national economic growth was entirely dependent on foreign technology to overcome this he embarked on the localization of this technology and succeeded in  within  years of the company’s foundation iljin’s electric transformation metal is the first technology successfully localized by iljin and the first domestically developed electric transformation metal in korea page  total  prev next electric supply metals electric supply metals substantially reducing the risk of power outages  electric transformation metals are limited in its use to electric substations within the entire process of the production and supply of electricity aluminum alloy metals for electricity on the other hand are basic materials that are widely used in the electricity industry from power transmission to power distribution iljin developed aluminum alloying techniques in  aluminum alloy metals were also imported from japan but iljin was able to develop the technology required to produce these basic materials ensuring a massive import substitution effect for the future when it was first developed these metals used an alloy of aluminum and copper as its base material which had satisfactory levels of conductivity and corrosion resistance but had a high risk of power failure because of its weak tensile strength alloy metals developed by iljin alloyed a regular amount of silicon magnesium and titanium with aluminum and carefully added calcium copper manganese and zinc this alloyed metal had an increased level of tensile strength and hardness without losing any conductivity while also prevented corrosion and cracks thereby reducing the risk of power outages as a result of disconnected lines this technology also strengthened iljin’s early position equipped with sound technology which ensured the future growth of the company aluminum alloy technology also gave birth to electric supply metals these metals connect power lines through which high voltages travel an d is a core metal that requires high levels of conductivity tensile strength and hardness iljin led the surge towards localization of the electricity industry that before was entirely dependent on imports from the us and japan by domestically developing and producing the major parts of the electricity industry which is the foundation of economic growth iljin without a doubt not only created a great import substitution effect but also largely contributed to the electricity supply movement to farming and fishing towns in the s iljin products made possible the switch from kerosene lamps to light bulbs possible in these rural areas page  total  prev next curtainwall curtainwall construction technique beautifying urban buildings with curtainwall construction  growing as a producer of metals for the transformation and supply of metals iljin first adopted the curtainwall construction technique for building exteriors and developed colored aluminum chasses curtainwalls are nondearing walls that use metals glass stone and panels to protect construction from rain and wind while also preventing excessive noise this technology realizes the beauty of architecture that beautifies the exterior of buildings by reducing the weight of buildings minimizing construction costs by allowing construction work on the interior and enabling the use of various materials to express different colors before iljin adopted the curtainwall construction technique for the first time buildings in korea all had similar exteriors that used cement and stones for reinforced concrete the cities in korea began to change colorfully with iljin’s curtainwall construction technique also iljin produced colored aluminum chasses for the first time in korea while also acquiring korea standard ks certificates for aluminum section members in  reaffirming iljin’s reputation for technology in particular iljin’s aluminum chasses including white chasses were so popular that clients had to first make their payments and wait for the products to arrive or would spend nights at iljin to receive the products page  total  prev next copperclad steel wires copperclad steel wires revolution in communication lines  copperclad steel wires are steel electrical wires that surfaces are coated with copper to increase conductivity in the s all the communication lines used outdoor phone lines produced by korean electric wire companies made out of copper however this was not enough to satisfy the needs created by the korean government’s intensive economic development plans and the modernization of rural areas project furthermore these lines were vulnerable to natural disasters such typhoons and monsoons that would disconnect these lines copperclad steel wires were perfect in replacing copper wires since it was cheaper than copper lines and also overcoming the limits of copper lines while maintaining the electric and high frequency characteristics of copper lines as a result iljin signed a contract to jointly develop copperclad steel wires in cooperation with kist by investing  million won which equaled iljin’s gross capital at the time iljin was able to develop a new technology in  which only  factories in  countries had at the time this enabled the supply of electricity to rural areas and revolutionized communication lines soon after iljin signs its first largescale product supply contract with iran the contract was won by competing with a us firm and was meaningful because it signaled international recognition of iljin’s technology the margin between iljin’s and the us firm’s contract was a mere  dollars page  total  prev next bobbin for chemical fibers bobbin for chemical fibers correcting the dependence on imports from japan occupying  of the domestic market  bobbins are reels in textile manufacturing equipment that wind threads bobbins rotate at high speeds to reel in the thread and is a difficult to produce component because the roundness has to be good in order for the thread to not snap while the strength has also be high even during the early s when korea was a textile power there were no korean companies that produced bobbins iljin realized the domestic markets complete dependence on japan and began development of bobbins at first iljin pursued technology partnerships with japanese companies but faced with their reluctance to share core technology and high royalty demands iljin founded iljin light metal co ltd currently iljin steel and began independent development after successfully developing bobbin production iljin occupied  of the domestic market until the early s and also entered the international market from the late s exhibiting the excellence of korean technology page  total  prev next foam skin cables foam skin cables stimulating the progress of korea’s communication market  in  a new technology that would impact korea’s communication technology in general was developed by iljin foam skin cables though copper covered cables opened the doors for korea’s communication industry it was limited in coping with the explosive increase in demand during the s foam skin cables were produced by insulating foampolyethylene and skinpolyethylene on  pure copper and were a great improvement from traditional lowinsulated cables in particular these cables had great telephone connections and enabled up to  people to talk over telephones at the same time realizing highquality and highquantity telephone calls iljin predicted that the lowinsulated cable market preoccupied by the major corporations would in the next few years undergo extensive change and began development of foam skin cables in  and succeeded in  iljin overcame rival major corporations to advance the qualitative replacement of domestic communication lines and contributed to the korean communication industry once again illustrating iljin’s venture spirit of challenging new frontiers and new business areas amidst competition against larger companies page  total  prev next elecfoil elecfoil the fertile grounds of the electronics industry  though unfamiliar to the average public elecfoils are important materials that are necessary to printed circuit boards pcb and rechargeable batteries elecfoils are thin copper plates produced not through rolling but through electrolysis and are the core materials that produce pcbs recently they have been widely used for negative current collectors that are the key to rechargeable batteries if semiconductors are the ‘rice’ of the electronics industry elecfoils are the fertile grounds and much like the veins in human bodies is used in almost all electronic products the technology focuses on an evenly thin surface with electronic characteristics the thinness of these plates use microns as their units which is  thousandth of a mm it is that thin in general elecfoils are ㎛ thin but recently they have become as thin as  or ㎛ to fit in miniaturization of electric wiring in electronic products elecfoil technology is extremely hightech and was selected as one of the ‘ top korean technologies during the th century’ but the ministry of science and technology in december  one asian technician once noted that “the production of elecfoils entails the same levels of stress that a potter who has spent his entire life making pottery endures when they begin to make a new piece even after  years i come across new types of defects in products” another western technician says that “elecfoil technology is a ‘black art’ it is art that is invisible no other electronic material has the same level of spirit in their products” both these statements highlight how hard elecfoils are to produce the greatest variable in the production process of elecfoil which is produced by coating a rotating drum with copper  or more pure using electrolysis methods is cleanliness impurities as small as small as a single mosquito can cause several hundred meters of defective products an appropriate temperature and humidity must be maintained in order to prevent oxidation also maintaining a  or less tolerance level is also difficult the allowable margin of error for a  meter wide ㎛ thin elecfoil product is ㎛ in addition high quality electricity is also necessary as a result elecfoil technology is only available to developed countries with strong domestic infrastructure an outage in power makes the production of elecfoils with the same quality impossible and elecfoil factories that are operated  days a year consume billions of won in electric fees alone because elecfoils are used in pcbs it also means that it is used in almost every electronic device recently they have been widely used for negative current collectors that are the key to rechargeable batteries furthermore specialized elecfoils are being used not only in small batteries for it appliances but also in secondary batteries and energy storage for automobiles chairman huh chin kyu and iljin began attempting the localization of elecfoils in cooperation with seoul national university in  but development of the technology was difficult when iljin representatives visited japanese firms in the s they were rejected by japanese engineers who told them to not even dream of this technology all they insisted was that iljin buy their equipment by paying expensive technology royalties the highly restrictive atmosphere at japanese firms made each visit less fruitful making the localization of elecfoil technology seem impossible to reach because japanese firms refused the transfer of their technology chairman huh chin kyu even went to the rooftops of nearby hotels to view japanese factories with binoculars despite these hardships chairman huh refused to give up despite two factories built in  and  for the mass production of elecfoil failed to get off the ground due to high quantities of defective products chairman huh again built the company’s third factory in  by investing several hundred billion won after almost  years iljin materials succeeded in the development of elecfoil production technology that minimized defective products after almost  years iljin materials succeeded in the development of elecfoil production technology that minimized defective products  elecfoil is called ‘copper foil’ in the us while japan uses the term meaning ‘ copper feet produced through electrolysis page  total  prev next industrial diamonds industrial synthetic diamonds becoming one of the top  producer of industrial synthetic diamonds  industrial synthetic diamonds are produced by recreating harsh natural environments required to produce diamonds such as eruption of a volcano or earthquakes artificially small powdered synthetic diamonds are created by putting a cylinder shaped mixture of graphite and catalytic metal with a cm radius and cm in height in a press then applying  atmospheres the force of  tons of weight on an area of ㎠ at ℃ for an hour this production process is a high addedvalue hightech technology certified as one of the  most extreme technologies in korea by the korean government diamonds are one of the hardest materials on the planet and also have a high level of heat conductivity with these characteristics diamonds are used in a wide array of industries including in polishers in heavy industries the production and assembly of machinery the production of semiconductor equipment medical surgery equipment the production or automobile parts the production of stone and metals as well as space research because of this it is understood that a country’s demand for diamonds is representative of that country’s industry level the demand for diamonds increased drastically with the rapid growth of korea’s automobile in the s but korea was entirely dependent on diamond imports from foreign companies such as britain’s de beers and us’ ge after embarking on development of industrial synthetic diamonds with kist iljin finally succeeded in development in june  arranging the stepping stone to becoming one of the world’s top  diamond manufacturer whenever the opportunity arose chairman huh chin kyu emphasized that “the company needs to focus on the development of new products through the development of extreme technologies in order to compete in the fiercely competitive market of the future ” the successful development of synthetic diamonds was the success of iljin group which has grown based on the development of strategic products of highadded value that target specific markets iljin’s development of synthetic diamonds signaled an important stage in the

using carbon steel and alloyed steel it is an important material used in pipe lines that need to resist fluid flows at high pressures and high temperatures in automobile heavy machinery electricity production energy plants and shipbuilding industries the greatest strength of seamless pipes is its safety because it overcomes the deficiencies of pipes that are produced by rolling thick steel plates and then welded at each end seamless pipes are produced by heating cylinder billets and drilling holes in them when iljin was developing seamless pipes the domestic demand was increasing due to the growth of related industries yet because there were no korean manufacturers korean companies were dependent on the  tons of seamless pipes imported from japan europe and other regions because of this seamless pipes were one of top products with an unfavorable balance of trade visàvis japan and desperately required localization of production iljin steel’s investment and development of seamless
