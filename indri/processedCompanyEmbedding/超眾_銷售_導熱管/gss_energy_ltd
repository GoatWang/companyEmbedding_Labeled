valuations corporate digest   october  related stocks f by ernest lim articles  profile gss energy “gss” share price plunged  percent to close at  on  jul  after the announcement that kud had terminated the services of gss’ subsidiary pt cepu sakti energy “pt cse” subsequently in tandem with the weak equity market gss continued to weaken to touch a multi month low of  before closing at  on  oct  so what caught my attention first of all gss’ chart seems like a potential base formation in the making and low valuations caught my eye below are some interesting factors which caught my eye  effects of settlement with java petral energy table  summarised the effects of the settlement agreement between gss and java petral energy “jpel” three noteworthy points caught my attention a speed of reaching settlement agreement gss first announced the termination of the cooperative agreement between kud and pt cse on  jul  recall that gss first acquired 8 percent of the issued share capital of pt cse from jpel on  sep  partly on the basis pt cse would be able to participate in the oil extraction services business in dandangilowonocolo oil fields with the termination of the agreement between kud and pt cse gss immediately renegotiated an agreement with jpel in less than a month gss announced an amicable settlement agreement with jpel see table  below b outcome may be favorable in the long run on  sep  when gss commenced its  million acquisition by acquiring 8 percent of issued share capital in pt cse pt cse only has the rights to extract oil from dandangilowonocolo and tungkul oil fields however after the settlement agreement on  aug  gss paid  million and acquired  percent of issued share capital in pt cse which has the rights to extract oil from tungkul kawengan trembul and gabus as a result the outcome might be favorable in the long run c part of the m impairment provision may be written back gss has already accounted for the impairment provision of  million due to the termination of agreement between pt cse and kud for the management of oil wells at dandangilowonocolo after this settlement agreement based on my simplistic reading there is a chance that part of the impairment provision may be able to be written back table  before and after settlement with jpel source company  pertamina cancelled kud agreement due to kud’s non compliance according to rhb pertamina cancelled the agreement with kud due to the latter’s noncompliance with contract terms this cancellation does not affect gss’ other four fields as these are contracted with state government corporations “bumds”  nav  share is likely to increase gss’ net asset value “nav” per share is around 8 with a price to book of approximately x it is noteworthy that gss’ average price to book for the past five years is around x furthermore gss’ nav  share may increase in the future given the following factors a cancellation of m consideration shares pursuant to the settlement agreement with jpel  million shares will be cancelled by way of capital reduction thus gss’ number of outstanding shares will decrease from  million shares to  million shares this should have a positive impact to its earnings per share and nav  share b one off gain amounting to m from relocation land sales according to the management there is likely to be an approximate nonrecurring rmb million gain translating to around  million due to relocation land sales in china my guess is that it is likely to be recognised in fyf c possibility of some impairment provision being written back as i mentioned above part of the  million impairment provision may be written back see point c above  hfy precision engineering net profit m compared to m for fy precision engineering “pe” has been gss’ core business for decades according to rhb nextinsight and based on company’s financial statements gss’ pe business seems to have gained traction with hfy net profit for its pe business hitting  million visàvis  million recognized in fy this segment is likely to be the bright spot in the next couple of years as firstly gss has taken on new products with good margins secondly it has retired those products which have reached their tail end of the product cycle where such products typically have lower margins thirdly the company has exercised cost management and increased automation which are likely to have helped margins in addition gss has clinched a new customer to supply machined parts for its game console commencing in the latter part of fy a more significant impact may be felt in fyf  gss’ current market price seems to ascribe zero value to its oil segment according to rhb gss current valuations seem to ascribe zero value to its oil business if a reasonable multiple is given to its pe business it is also noteworthy that gss is in a net cash position the oil business segment may have positive surprises in the next few months if management can execute on the following a potential kso gss is working to convert one of its fields to a kso arrangement at current oil prices management feels it makes more economic sense as kso allows full cost recovery according to rhb the kso arrangement typically spans  –  years and it allows all economically recoverable reserves to be recorded as reserves b gss – afco oil trading business on  jun  gss inked an agreement with afco energy pte ltd to invest into a joint venture company for the marketing and distribution of mineral oil and crude oil products and related businesses in indonesia gss’ role is akin to a broker who originates trades afco’s role is its reputation financial strength expertise in the storage and distribution of oil and oil related business management expects gss – afco oil trading business to commence this year c ramba’s west jambi exploration program on  may  gss gained access into oil and gas concession in sumatra by investing us million investment in ramba’s energy’s drilling operations at west jambi block this allows gss to gain exposure in a new geographical location where it previously has no exposure noteworthy points  confidence in gss shattered due to a series of events firstly with the clairvoyance of hindsight gss acquisition in pt cse was ill timed as oil price has halved since sep  secondly one of the attractive points in gss was its average selling price of oil which was supposed to be fixed annually by pertamina however in view of the plunging oil price pertamina amended the fixed price arrangement to market price thirdly the sudden termination of the agreement between kud and pertamina was another negative shock which reduced yet again market’s confidence in gss sentiment and confidence in gss’ management and business are likely to take some time to recover  exposure to one of the unloved industries at the moment gss’ exposure to the oil industry one of the most unloved industries besides commodities is unlikely to help its sagging share price nevertheless according to world bank imf and eiu oil price is likely to bottom in  see chart  below chart  oil price likely bottom in  chart analysis gss has been range bound between  –  since  jul  both rsi and macd are exhibiting bullish divergence with price any upside  downside breakout at    with volume on a sustained basis points to a measured technical target price of    based on current chart observation the odds of an eventual upside breakout is more than  percent see chart  below near term supports      near term resistances 8  8   chart  gss range bound since  jul  source cimb chart as of  oct  conclusion personally in order for gss share price to rerate we have to see that it clinches its st kso commencement of its gss – afco oil trading venture positive news on west jambi block and continued strength

gss energy provides clean sustainable and cost effective solutions to the problems of waste management and continuously increasing energy costs using advanced state of the art technologies which do not utilise a combustion process emissions are minimal and even the byproduct has a monetary and environmental value our core technology is pyrolysis which has been known for a long time to be an ideal solution for the conversion of troublesome waste materials into useful energy cleanly more importantly until now it has long been unknown how to achieve this on a commercial scale both efficiently and cost effectively gss energy has designed and produced a process and technology to achieve thisfurthermore gss energy has been successful in turning this process into a compact and portable form achieving levels of efficiency that create a ratio of  that is ‘one tonne of waste producing mw of electrical energy dependent on the energy content of the waste feedstock gss is managed by a dedicated team with a long history in the energy  biorenewables sector with a broad skillset they are acutely aware that if we are to continue to expand the infrastructure essential to support the increase of population and the resultant drive for a better standard of living in all parts of the world we must find a cleaner more efficient sustainable process for generating power and dealing

have developed an intense and passionate motivation to apply their knowledge and experience to develop a clean highly efficient method of power generation that delivers not only the lowest achievable emissions but also reduces the increasing reliance on valuable natural resources find out more about the gss team read more the technology the  technology of pyrolysis pyrolysis is essentially the thermal decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygenit involves the simultaneous change of the chemical composition and physical phase of a waste material converting the waste to its simplest gaseous form of hydrogen and carbonthe word is coined from the greekderived elements pyr “fire” and lysis “separating” the practice of pyrolysis was used thousands of years ago in the amazon rainforest to create bio char the indigenous peoples started fires and when the fuel was hot enough covered it with earth to deprive the fire of oxygen the high temperature would continue to break down the fuel but in the absence of oxygen bio char was produced rather than ash more recently pyrolysis was used with wood waste feedstock during the two world wars to produce transportation fuel when fossil fuels were unavailable by  trucks buses and agricultural machines were powered by gasification it is estimated that there were close to  vehicles running on bio derived gas all over the world read more using advanced state of the art technologies with a  output emissions are minimal… the units portable advanced pyrolysis system we have taken pyrolysis and adapted and developed it into our own hybrid process plus we have gone even further and miniaturised the system so that the whole process fits within a box that is easy to transport deploy and set up even in
