search it has been suggested that this article be merged with salt chemistry discuss proposed since june  the crystal structure of sodium chloride nacl a typical ionic compound the purple spheres represent sodium cations na and the green spheres represent chloride anions cl− in chemistry an ionic compound is a chemical compound composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding the compound is neutral overall but consists of positively charged ions called cations and negatively charged ions called anions these can be simple ions such as the sodium na and chloride cl− in sodium chloride or polyatomic species such as the ammonium nh  and carbonate co−  ions in ammonium carbonate individual ions within an ionic compound usually have multiple nearest neighbours so are not considered to be part of molecules but instead part of a continuous threedimensional network usually in a crystalline structure ionic compounds containing hydrogen ions h are classified as acids and those containing basic ions hydroxide oh− or oxide o− are classified as bases ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent precipitation freezing a solidstate reaction or the electron transfer reaction of reactive metals with reactive nonmetals such as halogen gases ionic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points and are hard and brittle as solids they are almost always electrically insulating but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive because the ions are mobilized contents  history of discovery  formation  bonding  structure  defects  properties  aciditybasicity  melting

the greek ἰόν ion going the present participle of ἰέναι ienai to go this term was introduced by english physicist and chemist michael faraday in  for the thenunknown species that goes from one electrode to the other through an aqueous medium xray spectrometer developed by bragg in  the crystal structure of sodium chloride was determined by william henry bragg and william lawrence bragg this revealed that there were six equidistant nearestneighbours for each atom demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates but instead as a network with longrange crystalline order many other inorganic compounds were also found to have similar structural features these compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral atoms but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mids when xray reflection experiments which detect the density of electrons were performed principal contributors to the development of a theoretical treatment of ionic crystal structures were max born fritz haber alfred landé erwin madelung paul peter ewald and kazimierz fajans born predicted crystal energies based on the assumption of ionic constituents which showed good correspondence to thermochemical measurements further supporting the assumption formationedit halite the mineral form of sodium chloride forms when salty water evaporates leaving the ions behind ionic compounds can be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation precipitation or freezing reactive metals such as the alkali metals can react directly with the highly electronegative halogen gases to form an ionic product they can also be synthesized as the product of a high temperature reaction between solids if the ionic compound is soluble in a solvent it can be obtained as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution as the solvent is evaporated the ions do not go into the vapour but stay in the remaining solution and when they become sufficiently concentrated nucleation occurs and they crystallize into an ionic compound this process occurs widely in nature and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates insoluble ionic compounds can be precipitated by mixing two solutions one with the cation and one with the anion in it because all solutions are electrically neutral the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges to ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound it is important to ensure they do not also precipitate if the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions if the solvent is water in either the evaporation or precipitation method of formation in many cases the ionic crystal formed also includes water of crystallization so the product is known as a hydrate and can have very different chemical properties molten salts will solidify on cooling to below their freezing point this is sometimes used for the solidstate synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants which are first melted together in other cases the solid reactants do not need to be melted but instead can react through a solidstate reaction route in this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of nonvolatile ions which is heated to drive off other species in some reactions between highly reactive metals usually from group  or group  and highly electronegative halogen gases or water the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer a process thermodynamically understood using the born–haber cycle bondingedit a schematic electron shell diagram of sodium and fluorine atoms undergoing a redox reaction to form sodium fluoride sodium loses its outer electron to give it a stable electron configuration and this electron enters the fluorine atom exothermically the oppositely charged ions – typically a great many of them – are then attracted to each other to form a solid main article ionic bonding ions in ionic compounds are primarily held together by the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies and in particular the ionic bond resulting from the longranged coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations there is also a small additional attractive force from van der waals interactions which contributes only around – of the cohesive energy for small ions when a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells most simple ions have closed shells to overlap a shortranged repulsive force occurs due to the pauli exclusion principle the balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance if the electronic structure of the two interacting bodies is affected by the presence of one another covalent interactions nonionic also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic ie held together only by electrostatic forces the bonds between even the most electronegativeelectropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency conversely covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial ionic character the circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using fajans rules which use only charges and the sizes of each ion according to these rules compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge more generally hsab theory can be applied whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases small highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation this difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation and resulting dipole moment is maintained even when the ions are in contact the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations structureedit the unit cell of the zinc blende structure ions typically pack into extremely regular crystalline structures in an arrangement that minimizes the lattice energy maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions the lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites for unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy for any particular ideal crystal structure all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance so for each possible crystal structure the total electrostatic energy can be related to the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an ewald sum when a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy the total lattice energy can be modelled using the born–landé equation the born–mayer equation or in the absence of structural information the kapustinskii equation using an even simpler approximation of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres the arrangement of anions in these systems are often related to closepacked arrangements of spheres with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral interstices depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound and the coordination principally determined by the radius ratio of cations and anions a variety of structures are commonly observed and theoretically rationalized by paulings rules common ionic compound structures with closepacked anions stoichiometry

mixtures of anions or cations can be cooled rapidly enough that there is not enough time for crystal nucleation to occur so an ionic glass is formed with no longrange order defectsedit frenkel defect schottky defect see also crystallographic defect within an ionic crystal there will usually be some point defects but to maintain electroneutrality these defects come in pairs frenkel defects consist of a cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in the bulk of the crystal occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size if the cations have multiple possible oxidation states then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers resulting in a nonstoichiometric compound another nonstoichiometric possibility is the formation of an fcenter a free electron occupying an anion vacancy when the compound has three or more ionic components even more defect types are possible all of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration because they are energetically costly but entropically beneficial they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures once generated these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another by hopping between lattice sites this defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity when vacancies collide with interstitials frenkel they can recombine and annihilate one another similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal schottky defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters reducing the overall density of the crystal defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments which causes them to experience a different crystalfield symmetry especially in the case of different cations exchanging lattice sites this results in a different splitting of delectron orbitals so that the optical absorption and hence colour can change with defect concentration propertiesedit aciditybasicityedit ionic compounds containing hydrogen ions h are classified as acids and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide oh− or oxide o− are classified as bases other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions if the compound is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base the result is an acidic salt if it is the result of a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid the result is a basic salt if it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base the result is a neutral salt weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion such as ammonium acetate some ions are classed as amphoteric being able to react with either an acid or a base this is also true of some compounds with ionic character typically oxides or hydroxides of lesselectropositive metals so the compound also has significant covalent character such as zinc oxide aluminium hydroxide aluminium oxide and leadii oxide melting and boiling pointsedit electrostatic forces between particles are strongest when the charges are high and the distance between the nuclei of the ions is small in such cases the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and ironiii chloride show moleculelike structures in the liquid phase inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions and thus have high melting points so are solids at room temperature some substances with larger ions however have a melting point below or near room temperature often defined as up to  °c and are termed ionic liquids ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt even when the local structure and bonding of an ionic solid is disrupted sufficiently to melt it there are still strong longrange electrostatic forces of attraction holding the liquid together and preventing ions boiling to form a gas phase this means that even room temperature ionic liquids have low vapour pressures and require substantially higher temperatures to boil boiling points exhibit similar trends to melting points in terms of the size of ions and strength of other interactions when vapourized the ions are still not freed of one another for example in the vapour phase sodium chloride exists as diatomic molecules brittlenessedit most ionic compounds are very brittle once they reach the limit of their strength they cannot deform mealleably because the strict alignment of positive and negative ions must be maintained instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage as the temperature is elevated usually close to the melting point a ductile–brittle transition occurs and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations compressibilityedit the compressibility of an ionic compound is strongly determined by its structure and in particular the coordination number for example halides with the caesium chloride structure coordination number  are less compressible than those with the sodium chloride structure coordination number  and less again than those with a coordination number of  solubilityedit when ionic compounds dissolve the individual ions dissociate and are solvated by the solvent and dispersed throughout the resulting solution because the ions are released into solution when dissolved and can conduct charge soluble ionic compounds are the most common class of strong electrolytes and their solutions have a high electrical conductivity the aqueous solubility of a variety of ionic compounds as a function of temperature some compounds exhibiting unusual solubility behaviour have been included the solubility is highest in polar solvents such as water or ionic liquids but tends to be low in nonpolar solvents such as petrolgasoline this is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ioninduced dipole interactions so the heat of solution is higher when the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule the solid ions are pulled out of the lattice and into the liquid if the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid in addition the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases there are some unusual ionic compounds such as ceriumiii sulfate where this entropy change is negative due to extra order induced in the water upon solution and the solubility decreases with temperature electrical conductivityedit although ionic compounds contain charged atoms or clusters these materials do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid in order to conduct the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice this is achieved to some degree at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed when the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile this conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds in some unusual ionic compounds fast ion conductors and ionic glasses one or more of the ionic components has a significant mobility allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid this is often highly temperature dependant and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration these materials are used in all solidstate supercapacitors batteries and fuel cells and in various kinds of chemical sensors colouredit anhydrous cobaltii chloride cocl cobaltii chloride hexahydrate cocl·ho see also color of chemicals the colour of an ionic compound is often different to the colour of an aqueous solution containing the constituent ions or the hydrated form of the same compound the anions in compounds with bonds with the most ionic character tend to be colourless with an absorption band in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum in compounds with less ionic character their colour deepens through yellow orange red and black as the absorption band shifts to longer wavelengths into the visible spectrum the absorption band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength when they are involved in more covalent interactions this occurs during hydration of metal ions so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution usesedit ionic compounds have long had a wide variety of uses and applications many minerals are ionic humans have processed common salt sodium chloride for over  years using it first as a food seasoning and preservative and now also in manufacturing agriculture water conditioning for deicing roads and many other uses many ionic compounds are so widely used in society that they go by common names unrelated to their chemical identity examples of this include borax calomel milk of magnesia muriatic acid oil of vitriol saltpeter and slaked lime soluble ionic compounds like salt can easily be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions this is a simple way to control the concentration and ionic strength the concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties including increasing the osmotic pressure and causing freezingpoint depression and boilingpoint elevation because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution the increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions the chemical identity of the ions added is also important in many uses for example fluoride containing compounds are dissolved to supply fluoride ions for water fluoridation solid ionic compounds have long been used as paint pigments and are resistant to organic solvents but are sensitive to acidity or basicity since  pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metalcontaining ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks under intense heat the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited these electrons later return to lower energy states and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present in chemistry ionic compounds are often used as precursors for hightemperature solidstate synthesis many metals are geologically most abundant as ionic compounds within ores to obtain the elemental materials these ores are processed by smelting or electrolysis in which redox reactions occur often with a reducing agent such as carbon such that the metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms nomenclatureedit see also iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry according to the nomenclature recommended by iupac ionic compounds are named according to their composition not their structure in the most simple case of a binary ionic compound with no possible ambiguity about the charges and thus the stoichiometry the common name is written using two words the name of the cation the unmodified element name for monatomic cations comes first followed by the name of the anion for example mgcl is named magnesium chloride and naso is named sodium sulfate so−  sulfate is an example of a polyatomic ion to obtain the empirical formula from these names the stoichiometry can be deduced from the charges on the ions and the requirement of overall charge neutrality if there are multiple different cations andor anions multiplicative prefixes di tri tetra  are often required to indicate the relative compositions and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order for example kmgcl is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from kmgcl magnesium dipotassium tetrachloride note that in both the empirical formula and the written name the cations appear in alphabetical order but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is k when one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name the alternate multiplicative prefixes bis tris tetrakis  are used for example babrf is named barium bistetrafluoridobromate compounds containing one or more elements which can exist in a variety of chargeoxidation states will have a stoichiometry that depends on which oxidation states are present to ensure overall neutrality this can be indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements present or the charge on the ions because of the risk of ambiguity in allocating oxidation states iupac prefers direct indication of the ionic charge numbers these are written as an arabic integer followed by the sign   − −    in parentheses directly after the name of the cation without a space separating them for example feso is named iron sulfate with the  charge on the fe ions balancing the − charge on the sulfate ion whereas feso is named iron sulfate because the two iron ions in each formula unit each have a charge of  to balance the − on each of the three sulfate ions stock nomenclature still in common use writes the oxidation number in roman numerals   −ii −i  i ii  so the examples given above would be named ironii sulfate and ironiii sulfate respectively for simple ions the ionic charge and the oxidation number are identical but for polyatomic ions they often differ for example the uranyl ion uo  has uranium in an oxidation state of  so would be called a dioxouraniumvi ion in stock nomenclature an even older naming system for metal cations also still widely used appended the suffixes ous and ic to the latin root of the name to give special names for the low and high oxidation states for example this scheme uses ferrous and ferric for ironii and ironiii respectively so the examples given above were classically named ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate see alsoedit bonding in solids ioliomics ionic bond notesedit  this structure type has a variable lattice parameter ca ratio and the exact madelung constant depends on this  this structure has been referred to in references as yttriumiii chloride and chromiumiii chloride but both are now known as the rhbr structure type  the reference lists this structure as mocl which is now known as the rhbr structure  the reference lists this structure as fecl which is now known as the bii structure type  this structure type can accommodate any charges on a and b that add up to six when both are three the charge structure is equivalent to that of corrundum the structure also has a variable lattice parameter ca ratio and the exact madelung constant depends on this  however in some cases such as mgalo the larger cation occupies the smaller tetrahedral site
