technology home›technology›technology technology technology strengths key technology crystal growth wafering epitaxy wafer works is developing its core technologies and products both vertically and horizontally vertical integration based on core silicon technology wafer works provides complete product portfolio and technical services with its vertically integrated technologies from ingot growth wafering to epitaxiallayer process horizontal development positioned as a customer centered solution provider of si semiconductor materials wafer works with its subsidiary in charge of production and sales is also extending its core technologies to the materials development of si single crystal ingots for solar cells and sapphire substrates for leds   overview of key technologies technological category key technologies   crystal growth technology hot zone design control system design crystal growth simulation technology ultralow resistivity crystal growth technology ultralow oi crystal growth technology wafering technology wafer stress control technology edge profile and roughness control technology surface grinding technology extrinsic gettering technology lto film technology polishing technology   the trend of extended applications in semiconductor power mosfets is moving to the increasing requirement for small form factor and higher power efficiency the driving of smaller rdson for power mosfets to reduce power consumption becomes a challenge and vital for the development of power semiconductor devices therefore the continual push for lower substrate resistivity has also been highly focused in the crystal growth technology development in wafer works   other than resistivity the control of oxygen content in silicon is another key index in silicongrowth technology which also plays a crucial role on the device performance wafer works has developed mcz technology that allows us to precisely control the oxygen content to meet the demand of highend device market   the shrink of device pitch follows moor’s law as the device density increases the demand for higher substrate quality better wafer site flatness and higher purity wafer surface is also increasing with time wafer works endeavors to improve wafer product quality as well as crystal growth technology and the key factors involved in the wafering technology development are listed in the following technology of wafer stress control the warp represents the distribution of stress on the wafer its variation is well contained within um cpk  in wafer works through proper control of the run times of wire guide the control of slurry quality and other slicing process parameters to meet the stress requirement in subsequent wafering processes technology for shape of edge profiling and roughness control wafer works has extensive experience on wafer edge grinding various design selections of edge profiles are available to meet different customer’s demands also we cowork with customers to develop special edge profiles besides wafer works has developed helical process a solution for special and strict specification of edge condition and can greatly improve both the edge profile and edge roughness extrinsic gettering technology wafer works is capable of depositing single or multiple poly crystalline thin film layers on silicon wafer to enhance extrinsic gettering capability of si wafer and adjust wafer warps polishing technology the technology of wafer polishing has always been improving in wafer works to satisfy the arising demand from customers for superior quality of wafer surfaces the unrelenting demand of improved ttv and stir which is becoming more critical on the products of deep submicron generation is accomplished through the advancement of polishing technology and the introduction of new polishing equipment in wafer works   wafer works epitaxial corporation a subsidiary in shanghai china is established to provide epi layers and making a complete si substrate product portfolio in wafer works and providing onestop shopping opportunity for our customers   the experience wafer works has accumulated over the past years on the substrate technology development and manufacturing enables it to optimize substrate products to be suitable for the development of epitaxial process for either single layer or multilayer products the multilayer epitaxial technology makes it possible in offering diversified silicon wafers which realize device designs for specific product applications applications power mos igbt fred diode schottky diode

separate graphics card brands for nvidia and amd chips the two brands have been no  in market share in chinas discrete graphics card market since  product strategy is based on developing products targeted at different user segments a variety of overclocked editions has been developed for highend users and these cards have set new records in overclocking competitions on many occasions innovation was also emphasized with the development of proprietary silver plating pcb one key oc and biomimetic fan technologies that have built up a strong following among highend users dedicated models were developed for internet cafes and enterprise users that emphasized low rma rate high compatibility and excellent stability customization services are also available for enterprise users examples include the development of ultraslim graphics card for medical use and multidisplay graphics cards for surveillance and tv monitoring chaintechs odm graphics cards for colorful are now no  by market share in chinas internet cafe market and custom graphics cards from colorful are gaining increasing acceptance among industrial users as well graphics cards that offer a better cost vs performance ratio have been developed for general consumers these graphics cards have proven very popular with customers due to their guarantee of quality workmanship and reasonable pricing  about chaintech mainboards         the strong partnership that chaintech and colorful enjoys with intel and amd has led to the release of mainboards based on intel and amd chipsets colorful mainboards are currently ranked th by market share in china and the current marketing strategy is based on targeting each user segment with a different set of features         for highend users the selling point is highquality workmanship materials and extreme cpu overclocking the mainboards marketed alongside highend graphics cards have won countless awards from the media and has attracted a loyal following         distinct models have also been developed for internet cafe users and have their own product support chaintech mainboards market share in chinas internet cafe market is now growing rapidly and the collaboration with graphics cards is also becoming closer as well         for general users chaintech strives to be the no  choice for diy installations through good cost to performance ratios about chaintech graphics card distributors and marketing         our alliance with colorful is limited to market development only at the channel level chaintech is trying to consolidate the mainboard and graphics card markets while pushing for greater differentiation between nvidia and amd graphics card products this move is intended to maximize market share and identify partnership opportunities both online and traditional channels are now being used         the online distribution channel includes online distributors and ecommerce platforms online distribution mainly consists of ccbc sales through taobao taobaocoms total transaction value exceeded  trillion rmb in  while graphics card sales in  also increased by an average of  jdcom generated transactions of more than  billion rmb in  with graphics card sales increasing at the same rate as taobaocom demonstrating the increasing importance of ecommerce in china chaintech has leveraged colorful to set up an online sales framework with reasonable controls put into place to avoid any conflicts between the online and traditional channels         traditional channels have been affected by ecommerce but only to a limited extent we have now worked with colorful to set up more than  core channel stores in major cities throughout china by adjusting the relationship between online and offline channels we have identified and taken advantage of the best features of both to maximize our market share in  chaintech and our sales partner saw our sales in traditional channels grow by          with regards to marketing we are continuing to work closely with the local and foreign media and have won more than  media awards advertisements aimed at large computer retailers road shows campus events product training courses and overclocking competitions have generated massive user participation new marketing tools such as weibo wechat and online multimedia are also being used for user interaction as part of our efforts to
