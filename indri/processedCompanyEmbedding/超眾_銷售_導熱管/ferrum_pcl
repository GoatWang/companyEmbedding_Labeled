the oh in alcohols by a halogen replacing the oh group in alcohols by a halogen this page looks at reactions in which the oh group in an alcohol is replaced by a halogen such as chlorine or bromine it includes a simple test for an oh group using phosphorusv chloride reactions involving hydrogen halides the general reaction looks like this reaction with hydrogen chloride tertiary alcohols react reasonably rapidly with concentrated hydrochloric acid but for primary or secondary alcohols the reaction rates are too slow for the reaction to be of much importance a tertiary alcohol reacts if it is shaken with concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature a tertiary halogenoalkane haloalkane or alkyl halide is formed note  if you dont know what primary secondary and tertiary alcohols are you should read the introduction to alcohols before you go on the terms primary secondary and tertiary are used in exactly the same way with halogenoalkanes use the back button on your browser to return to this page replacing oh by bromine rather than using hydrobromic acid you usually treat the alcohol with a mixture of sodium or potassium bromide and concentrated sulphuric acid this produces hydrogen bromide which reacts with the alcohol the mixture is warmed to distil off the bromoalkane note  you will find practical details of this reaction on the page about preparation of halogenoalkanes you dont need to read the beginning of that page because it is just a modification of this one use the back button on your browser to return to this page replacing oh by iodine in this case the alcohol is reacted with a mixture of sodium or potassium iodide and concentrated phosphoricv acid hpo and the iodoalkane is distilled off the mixture of the iodide and phosphoricv acid produces hydrogen iodide which reacts with the alcohol phosphoricv acid is used instead of concentrated sulphuric acid because sulphuric acid oxidises iodide ions to iodine and produces hardly any hydrogen iodide a similar thing happens to some extent with bromide ions in the preparation of bromoalkanes but not enough to get in the way of the main reaction there is no reason why you couldnt use phosphoricv acid in the bromide case instead of sulphuric acid if you wanted to note  if you are interested in the reactions between halide ions and concentrated sulphuric acid you could follow this link in the present context all you would need to do is read the beginning of that page if you choose to follow this link use the back button on your browser to return to this page reacting alcohols with phosphorus halides reaction with phosphorusiii chloride pcl alcohols react with liquid phosphorusiii chloride also called phosphorus trichloride to make chloroalkanes reaction with phosphorusv chloride pcl solid phosphorusv chloride phosphorus pentachloride reacts violently with alcohols at room temperature producing clouds of hydrogen chloride gas it isnt a good choice as a way of making chloroalkanes although it is used as a test for oh groups in organic chemistry to show that a substance was an alcohol you would first have to eliminate all the other things which also react with phosphorusv chloride for example carboxylic acids containing the cooh group react with it because of the oh in cooh and so does water hoh if you have a neutral liquid not contaminated with water and get a violent reaction producing clouds of steamy fumes of hydrogen chloride when you add phosphorusv chloride then you have an alcohol group present there are also side reactions involving the pocl reacting with the alcohol other reactions involving phosphorus halides instead of using phosphorusiii bromide or iodide the alcohol is usually heated under reflux with a mixture of red phosphorus and either bromine or iodine the phosphorus first reacts with the bromine or iodine to give the phosphorusiii halide these then react with the alcohol to give the corresponding halogenoalkane which can be distilled off reacting alcohols with sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride the reaction sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride has the formula socl traditionally the formula is written as shown despite the fact that the modern name writes the chlorine before the oxygen alphabetical order the sulphur dichloride oxide reacts with alcohols at room temperature to produce a chloroalkane sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are given off care would have to be taken because both of these are poisonous why this reaction is useful the big advantage that this reaction has over the use of either of the phosphorus chlorides is that the two other products of the reaction sulphur dioxide and hcl are both gases that means that they separate themselves from the reaction mixture questions to test your understanding if this is the first set of questions you have done please read the introductory page before you start you will need to use the back button on your browser to come back here

relates to a device such as a bioreactor or a bioreactor module for expression or proliferation of a biologic material and a process creating a stem cell or living cell or biological cell or micro organism friendly environment for use in a bioreactor and methods for operating said bioreactor background of the invention bioreactor design and operation is a complex engineering task under optimum conditions cultivated stem cells and living cells must be able to perform their desired production with a  percent rate of success the bioreactors environmental conditions like gas content ie air oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide flow rates temperature ph and agitation speedcirculation rate need to be closely monitored and controlled a bioreactor is a suitable device for cultivating stem cells or living cells or micro organisms being adherent and semiadherent dependent or in suspension ideally any stem cell or living cell or micro organism cultivating bioreactor must maintain sterile conditions in the aerobic process optimal oxygen transfer and access is perhaps the most difficult task to accomplish oxygen is poorly soluble in water at atmospheric pressure even less in cultivation broths usually helped by agitation which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the production homogeneous there are however limits to the speed of agitation in stirred tank bioreactors due both to high power consumption and damages to the cultivated stem cells or living cells or micro organisms in bioreactors the goal is to cultivate stem cells or living cells or micro organisms for mass production of stem cells or living cells for medical application as regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications or drugs or more traditional expression from living cells or micro organisms of molecules for therapeutic purposes or as drugs prior art us   new brunswick scientific describes the celligen system in the form of a packed bed of fibracell polyester fibre based flat carriers the system currently on the market from new brunswick scientific demonstrates that cells at least semiadhere well to a polyester fibre but the celligen system is heavily limited by the thickness of the bed as an increased bed thickness introduces or increases undesirable gradients in the bioreactor l the bioreactor device is not scalable and can be used for cultivations on a benchtop scale only us  yeda discloses a matrix of a thickness of from  to  μηη and a surface area of  millimetre the matrix is based on a polyester fibre and is in the form of a very small carrier know in the industry under the trade name fibracell supplied by both nbs and bibby sterilin ltd uk fibracell is a mini body approx  millimetre in diameter and  millimetre thick fibracell has been used for various applications among others by nbs new brunswick scientific usa for manufacturing the celligen product in which fibra cell bodies are randomly and efficiently packed in volumes of up to  litre larger reactor volumes are not possible due to gradient problems us  stoll corp discloses a cylindrical device with fibres positioned around a tubular inlet  a spindle the volume for the fibre matrix between the spindle and the cartridge inner wall are filled with loosely packed fibres only us  pall inc describes a special pleating method improving among others also the potential areavolume ration and as described for filtration purposes only us  ohio state university is concerned with a packed bed structure based on cotton cloth in sheet shape wo amprotein corp discloses a method for increasing dissolved oxygen in a culture medium for semiadherent or suspension culture of mammalian cells in a vessel the vessel concept exploits constant height and varies the diameter in order to vary the fermenter volume in order to handle the gradient issue wo artelis discloses a complicated flow pattern vessel device which has an integrated mixer operating as circulation pump the device is not suitable for upscaling due to an undesirable increase in nutrient andor oxygen gradients media recirculation is performed by a mixer device internally in the vessel and this feature also seriously limits the prospects for upscaling only perfusion mode operation is described gradients occurring in the central inlet zone results in the generation of an uneven cell density in the modules the invention is based on packed micro porous nonwoven micro carriers present inside modules envelopes for cell support andor empty modules suitable for the suspension of cells each radial fluid inlet between two envelopes supply

one or more centrally located feeding tubes which supplies feeding liquid comprising nutrients required for biological cell cultivation to the feeding spacers through a plurality of holes or openings or feeding liquid outlet ports located in said one or more centrally located feeding tubes the feeding spacer sections provide feeding liquid to the matrix sections which in turn ensure an optimised radial and orbital flow pattern of the feeding liquid the centrally located feeding tubes can also supply oxygen and distributes the oxygen efficiently thereby solving the gradient problems which are typically a limiting factor when performing biocultivations the concept of stacking the individual matrix sections allows significant matrix diameters and matrix heights to be employed while at the same time having a control of feeding liquid distribution and drainage the matrix sections can also in one embodiment be covered by or surrounded by independent membranes based on thin sheets having a pore size less than that of the preferred biological cells to be cultivated the membranes are alternatively mounted on the outlet side of each matrix section  thereby creating a pressure drop eliminating nutrient concentration gradients across the inlet matrix section side  and thereby eliminating such gradients from the entire matrix surface the matrix sections or cassettes comprising such sections can alternatively be assembled into a supporting base a cartridge or a housing eg having a central inlet and a circumferential outlet such matrix sections can be fabricated from fibres

excellent liquid flow along and within the thickness of the spacer spacers may be layers of flownets screens porous rigid foam alike structures and corrugated sheets nettings assembled with different properties creating an asymmetric structure hereby the pressure drop along the feed and drainage layer is considerably lower than the pressure drop perpendicular to and through the matrix materials may also be of hydrophobic character to avoid fouling trapping of micro organisms some extruded flat flownet separators may have a first set of parallel strands and a second set of parallel strands

matrix core materials in particular for figures     such lamination method is highly suitable figure  is a pleated type of design with the pleats arranged both curved and combined radial and symmetrical around the centre line from which spacers extent alternatively the spacer may be a cast rapid prototype printed moulded device round rectangular square or of any shape for lamination with the individual matrix sections examples include a round feed spacer eg based on a radial rib design thicker higher at the feed entrance and thinner lower closer to the collection volume entity the drainage spacers are of the opposite design  ie thinner higher at the feed entrance and thicker lower closer to the collection volume entity spacers preferably include seals connections mechanical support etc for stacking purposes spacers can eg be cast bodies with rib design channel design pore size material shape and choice with design specifically to be laminated with matrix sheets such as being part of description in figures    and  flow net spacers could alternatively be designed with ribs and fluid flow paths suitable for integration during production of the porous matrix and hereby be fully embedded the purpose is to simultaneously give mechanical support to the structure and act as either or both feed and drainage spacers for the fluid to pass the porous matrix of the

pps with difference in fibre thickness of at least   preferably higher layers of nonwoven and woven materials may further be oriented according to need and are not limited in any method of assembling alternatively the spacers or parts of the spacers may be manufactured from natural vegetable organic materials for natural recycling purposes after its use in general the physical dimensions of the spacer sections are determined by the size of the practical circumstances characterising a particular cultivation of biological cells if the bio reactor is manufactured with a large diameter the feed inlet in operable liquid contact with a spacer section must be larger than a feed inlet in operable liquid contact with a spacer section when a smaller diameter bioreactor is used one other embodiment

alternatively the drainage spacer is encapsulated or both feed and drainage spacers are encapsulated on the feed side of the envelopes before the packed bed spacer devices insure even radial flow pattern to the twin packed beds simultaneously the envelope walls on the drainage side of the twin packed beds are next to a radial fluid collection volume which continue the radial flow pattern from the twin packed beds simultaneously the envelope membranes are in no way limited to have parallel walls or being of flat design multiple envelope bodies may be stacked inside a container a vessel or a disposable capsule further one way of manufacturing such envelope bodies is by packing a suitable amount of powder mixture material andor fibres into a casting mould offering some handling strength

stacking and feed andor drainage spacer integration further one embodiment of the present invention version   pleated sheet into cylinder shape is a pleated bioreactor based on pleating of a nonwoven sheet matrix into a compact reactor fig  a pleat is a type of fold formed by doubling fabric sheets backed upon itself and securing it in place pleating is a compact method of obtaining high loads of fabric porous sheets and used extensively in the filtration industry and the manufacturing method is often called knife pleat if order to avoid each pleat gets in contact to the neighbour pleat separators spacers with fluid capability are arranged between the pleats the pleat matrix thickness is selected in order to get the desired flow and pressure drop over the matrix the pleat will typically be of the same thickness all through the core the pleats are typically arranged on the straight radial lines of the cylindrical core though higher pleat density is obtained if the lines are curved and not starting from the core centre two individual diameter pleated bodies may be arranged into the same housing with one pleated body surrounding the other with the upstream volume shared being in between the two bodies so one downstream becomes the centre of the in diameter smaller body and the other downstream the circumference of the in diameter larger body module dimensions ranging

central perforated fluid collection tube fig  the drainage spacer is shorter and less wide than the matrix sheet and on three sides sealed from the feed stream with seals between andor bonding of the matrix sheet edges which hereby form an envelope around the drainage spacer though the drainage spacer is open to connected to and in unhindered permeate fluid correspondence with the perforated fluid collection tube the feed spacers are open on all four edge sides and with no fluid connection to the fluid collection tube receiving the permeate antitelescopic members are mounted at both end surfaces of the sandwich like circular core matrix typically operating in crossflow mode with longitudinal flow the feed are supplied from one end face being conveyed in axially direction inside the coarse and somewhat thick feed spacers to the opposite end face exiting as retentate a slight over pressure drives the fluid perpendicular to and through the matrix core collected on the other side of

spacers perpendicular to the core feed and drainage spacers can eg be a layer of flownet screens corrugated sheets netting rib stiffener set of ribs in general set of ribs arranged randomly set of ribs arranged symmetrically section with a radial set of ribs having suitable edge flow characteristics  excellent liquid flow along and within the thickness of the spacer spacers may be layers of flownets screens porous rigid foam alike structures and corrugated sheets nettings assembled with different properties creating an asymmetric structure hereby the pressure drop along the feed and drainage layer is considerably lower than the pressure drop perpendicular to and through the matrix materials may also be of hydrophobic character to avoid fouling trapping of micro organisms compared to the typical and in the industry well known spiral wound membrane filter which need to fulfil high demands to trapping efficiencies the spiralbioreactor has low demands to filtration efficiency module dimension ranging  millimetre in diameter and length  millimetre preferable  millimetre according to further embodiment of the present invention version   cast bodies is a rigid foam based porous matrix structure the foam alike scaffolding and permeable bodies may take any shape thickness as discussed in other parts of the present invention such as discs shaped plate shaped saucer shape honeycomb shaped be single and double density biopolymer foams composite biopolymer foams including both single and double density foams the foam alike scaffolding may be cast or d printed or manufactured by stereolithography methods solid foams form an important class of lightweight cellular engineering materials these foams can be classified into two types based on their pore structure the first type of foams is called open cell structured foams these foams contain pores that are connected to each other and form an interconnected network which is relatively soft the second type of foams does not have interconnected pores and are called closed cell foams the foam may be semi rigid or soft bodies based on pure natural sponges from the in sea living marine organism such as spongia officinalis or fresh water sponges like spongilla lacustris foam structures based on traditional manufacturing methods where polyurethane foam are exposed to and impregnated with a ceramic fine grained slurry followed by drying and high temperature firing specification of the hereby negative skeleton are typically with a maximum of  ppi pores per inch corresponding to pores as small as  millimetre in diameter a new and promising process for fabricating ceramic foams or calcium phosphate containing foams pass a route of stable welldispersed high solids content aqueous ceramic suspension is prepared which also incorporates an acrylate monomer together with an initiator and catalyst the latter is used to provide insitu polymerisation after the further addition of a foaming agent a high shear mixer is used to provide simple mechanical agitation that result in the formation of wet ceramic foam that can be dried and then fired foams can now be produced with largest pores  millimetre and densities as high as  of theoretical whilst  dense foams have been produced with pores as small as  μηη bio ceramic containing foams are known for promoting cell growth and being bio friendly in the bio medical industry according to another embodiment of the present invention is a body version   cast bodies with a set of inlet channels and outlet channels traditional honeycomb bodies are all characterised by thin walls with limited wall porosity and channels as small as possible measured in cpsi  cellschannels per square inch  being in the range of  to  cpsi in specific traditional flowthrough honeycomb bodies are designed only for fluid flows along the channel and not transthrough the wall  and in specific not for growing micro organisms within the wall matrix pores one embodiments of the present invention is a honeycomb body which differs vastly from traditional honeycombs exhibiting unusual thick walls and wide channels and high internal surface area within the wall matrix pores highly suitable for biofilm attraction also the present invention takes advantage of the wallflowfilter principle the media fluid passing through the bioreactor differs from known technology as the fluid the medium is passing through the wall matrix furthermore the media flow through such bioreactor preferably sees a relatively higher pressure drop when combining a membrane with said porous wall matrix as the added membrane with significant higher pressure drop support an even fluid flow all over the inlet wall surface area the reduced nutrient content gradient improves the yield of the present invention significantly pore size in the threedimension matrix operating as a the invented bioreactor ranging   μηη preferably  μηη creating  m internal wall surface area per litre matrix porosity ranging   in the matrix if the said bioreactor is fabricated from grain particles though often with practical porosity ranging   the coarse matrix gives permeability ranging   darcy preferably closer to   darcy also it is very advantageous to have thick walls for optimum internal surface area such as figure  and  otherwise the wall thickness may be eg   millimetre preferably  millimetre the cell pitch which is the combined measured figure in millimetres of the wall thickness and the channel width may be in the range of   millimetre preferably  millimetre in one embodiment the bioreactor will in a single body designed with   cpsi cells per square inch configuration and outer dimension of od x l millimetre offer the volume of  litre for the conical channel cast version cell density may range from   cpsi with non circular channels bodies like figure  are not known in the industry and not measured via cells per square inch a significant feature of the present invention is the threedimensional very thick porous walls to which potentially membranes are adhered conventional wallflowfilter or crossflow filtration devices preferably have very thin walls in order to minimise wall andor transmembrane pressure drop a pressure drop comparison between the high volume flow wall flowfilter and crossflowfiltration with the present invention reveal difference one way of manufacturing such rigid carrier body is obtained by pressure casting vacuum casting or casting supported by vibration or pressing particles into the desired shape followed by sintering a bimodal powder mixture comprising coarsegrain material and a finegrain substance melting at a higherthansintering temperature gluing the coarse grains together in the contacts points alternatively ways of manufacturing such rigid carrier body is obtained by casting or pressing monomodal particles into the desired shape followed by sintering the powder mixture at higherthanmelting temperature gluing the grains together in the contacts points the channels of the typical extruded honeycomb body are limited to exclusively parallel wall design as obtained from the extrusion process better gradient eliminating design is obtained by conical channels with larger free end face openings and conical walls towards the end of the particular channel but such design needs to be cast slip cast pressed vacuum cast etc the design in order to optimise exclude environmental gradients along the channels and through the channel separating walls both the feed and drainage channels being conical along the body may be round square hexagonal octagonal or any other shape which offer identical wall thickness anywhere in the body further both the feed and drainage channel form may be mixed into any desired design according to further embodiment of the present invention is porous discs version   cast bodies with pore size in the threedimension matrix ranging   μηη preferably  μηη porosity ranging   in the matrix if the bioreactor is fabricated from fibres often practical porosity ranging   the discs arranged towards each other in sets forming feed spaces and drainage space as illustrated in figure  cast from either powder based material or from fibre based materials or both combined assembling sets of the discs by stacking create the bioreactor device to be housed in a standard stainless steel dome covered system with bottom plate which contains inlet and outlet if manufactured from fibres methods are known under the names knitting weaving and braiding potentially followed by a gently sintering process which increase mechanical strength of the discs also mixing of metal fibres with organic fibres is known as multifilament yarns in the industry such multifilament yarns will give interesting properties with partly electrical conductivity allowing selectable charging of the mesh one further embodiment of the present invention is a body version   cast bodies with a set of inlet channels and outlet channels manufactured by vacuum forming such as when a porous mould is exposed to dipped into a volume of and in contact with a suspension including flocculated fibres low pressure on the back side of the perforated surface convey the carrying suspension slurry to flow towards and through the mould where the fluid are drained through the porous screen retaining the fibres which is collected and deposited on the mould surface exposure time to casting suspension strength determine the thickness of the accumulated fibrous matrix body on the mould surface after the vacuum casting process the body is removed and the remaining fluid is finally removed by drying and the body appear semi rigid typically a binder system is mixed into the suspension in order to facilitate anchoring the fibres internally for higher product stiffness the initial vacuum casting process may be followed by further similar process in order to obtain asymmetric matrix properties the matrix may for improved mechanical strength include a skeleton of preshaped thicker fibre or thread based mesh arranged prior to the vacuum casting process so the mesh becomes fully embedded in the structure after the vacuum casting process further ways of improving mechanical strength after the vacuum casting method is possible by adding resins or by heat treatment such heat treatment may further shrink the body hereby reducing the pore size making up such body will follow the alternative procedure which is here described with particular reference to the embodiment illustrated in figure  and fig   by uniaxial pressing such as when a set of moulds is exposed to a fluid suspension containing at least one type of fibres and possible binders andor resins a suitable volume of the suspension is allowed to flow into the casting cylinder for uniform settling containing at least one mould pistons the suspension may be kept floating by gas introduced added from the bottom piston in order to improve suspension uniformity the gas added under pressure from a series of holes in the piston or cylindrical wall after filling the open casting chamber with suspension the top mould piston is moved into closing the cylinder at least one of the mould pistons is manufactured from macro porous materials perforated or supplied with a multiple small drilled holes or variations thereof which allow the suspension fluid passes out through the two pistons while forcing the two pistons towards each other the fibres left in the cylinder is orienting and compacting to an embodiment of desired design after the moulded article has obtained final shape the soft felt embodiment is removed from the casting machine and the remaining fluid is removed by drying until the body appear semi rigid typically a binder system is mixed into the suspension of fibres in order to permanently anchor adhere bond the fibres at their contact points for higher embodiment stiffness alternatively the semi finished matrix embodiment after casting is further impregnated exposed to a binder system dispersed diluted in an aqueous solution for a soaking time based on wall thickness the binder system may be cured by temperature uv lights reacting with a catalyst etc bonding the fibres together pore size in the threedimension matrix ranging   μηη for depth filter

for continuous protein expression and micro organism separator in just one system outlet membrane with pores ranging selectively insures the cells micro organism or biofilm do not penetrate the growth body but only the product and nutrient pass the membrane mounted on the drainage side the membranes permeability is in the range of   times less than the threedimension matrix being the wall the membrane is designed from particles andor fibres creating a smaller pore size than the growth body and applied on the fluid outlet side surfaces of the carrier body with macro pores the membrane having pore diameter of   μηη typically such membrane is required when separating or allowing very small particles or suspended matter only to pass the membrane attached to the inlet side of the carrier for the present invention the purpose of the membrane is opposite and works backwards as the membrane is attached to the outlet drainage side which prevents release of anchored particles or cells oriented carefully inside the porous matrix  and only the product from the cells are allowed to pass the membrane this principle is advantageous as the micro organisms are not removed from the interior of the carrier body inorganic membranes  the honeycomb and cast body design of the invention may be combined with a separating micro porous membranes for selective passage of particles and fluids the possible extra membranes mounted on the outlet side of the matrix outlet surfaces and hereby created pressure drop eliminate nutrient concentration gradients across the matrix and the entire threedimension matrix surface the micro organisms hereby trapped inside the threedimension matrix before the membranes creating a biotech growth method for continuous protein expression and micro organism separator in just one system outlet membrane with pores holes ranging selectively from  to  nm sizes insures the cells micro organism or particles do not penetrate the body but only the product and nutrient does the membranes permeability being in the range of   times less than the carrier the threedimension matrix of the wall a membrane may be designed from particles or fibres creating a smaller pore size than the growth body and applied on the fluid outlet side surfaces of the carrier body with micro pores having a diameter size of   μηη the asymmetrical membrane applying a pressure drop being at least one order of magnitude higher than the pressure drop obtained from the carrier the membrane material selected may be determined from its zeta potential some materials like zeolites may easily be altered membrane with pore sizes smaller than pores of the carrier body material deposited on the membrane carrier increases the separation efficiency of the device this membrane also prevents particles from exiting the porous carrier typically such membrane is required when separating or allowing very small particles or suspended matter only to pass the membrane for the present invention the purpose of the membrane is opposite and works backwards  the outlet drainage side mounted membrane prevents release of anchored particles or cells oriented carefully inside the porous matrix  and only the product from the cells are allowed to pass the membrane this principle is advantageous as the micro organisms are not removed from the interior of the carrier body hereinafter the term ceramic bioreactor device encompasses a porous monolith support for both the active micro organisms as well as potentially the membrane device and then the term bioreactor encompasses permeate extracted from a membrane device such membranes can include separation barriers suitable for microfiltration ultrafiltration nano filtration in order to be selective to the inclusions in the permeate bioreactor design the invention is not limited by dimensions or in any way to a symmetrical shape the core may be of non cylindrical design inlet volume shape or outside shape may be independently different with non parallel sides trapeze design as yet an input for flow distribution control and gradient elimination asymmetrical porous matrix assembly with decreasing pore size perpendicular to the disc may further be combined with the shape for flow distribution control purposes permeable bodies discs or envelopes with different properties different materials may be stacked in any order and thickness when the invention is designed into a disposable plastic container construction the container may further house a heating element or temperature conditioning devise as well as appropriate sensors a heating element may also be located within the inlet volume fully surrounded by the fluids to pass the core in large bioreactor systems the heating elements may further be oriented within the spacers preferably be integrated with the inlet zone spacers fluid analysis work has been performed with the cad computer program solidworks® fluid analysis tool flowworks on powerful intel® workstations in order to finally design the spacer shape a b and matrix   dimensions the result is a flux with less than  variation over the entire matrix feed surface and the figure  design is specifically a result of such work performed by stobbe tech a s in denmark housing design the bioreactor permeable bodies is preferably enclosed inside a container made by bio compatible polymers plastics as housing with connected silicon or plastic hoses andor flanges the plastic container enclosure is an alternative design with the purpose of being disposable and of a relatively low cost the plastic container or bag may be semi rigid as the reactor is both compact but also of fixed dimensions and rigid with a tight fit for the plastic film bag around the matrix core the complete setup becomes self supportive and need no extra external support like empty singleuse plastic bags which all need a rigid container as support the plastics selected should offer low levels of leachable and extractable compounds plastic film sheets formed into desired size shape and by one or several of various welding methods seamed at the edges into a liquid tight container around the bioreactor more rigid plastics based capsules systems self supportive design will allow for stacking purposes and may on the outside appear symmetrical and the core on the inside may be asymmetrical stacking will arrange the capsules next to each other with interconnecting fluid exchange flanges sealed insuring liquid tight performance improved mechanical strength for plastic parts is well known in the industry by adding fibres to the hot plastic during forming also electrical properties can be altered by specific substances added to the polymers the disposable capsules may be of tangential flow principle radial flow principle cross flow principle with symmetric or asymmetric porous matrix core design and either of round design rectangular or combinations hereof yet a variation is non round capsules or cassettes with at least one fluid inlet and at least one fluid outlet integrated within the capsules overall design such as the plate  frame design an expression for old fashion assembling of a larger number of cassettes into a holder system with the typically square or rectangular plates operation typically in parallel also known as filter presses or membrane plate filters in the industry a very common principle in the filtration industry and the design column principle may be used for the present inventions bioreactor the ceramic and metal based bioreactor permeable body is extremely tolerant around the cleaning issue sterilization may be performed with steam high temperature exposure like ° celsius and exposure to warm fluid in the ph range of   ph the bioreactor permeable body mounted in a housing manufactured from stainless steel or plastics suitable for fluid tights assessment and with mechanical strength for enclosure sensor integration online measuring of  ph temp c glucose lactate flow cell mass pressures etc for understanding and perform the process control is mandatory for optimum metabolism in the bioreactor any of the inventions variations may include passageways incorporated for correspondence with traditional  millimetre sensors probes for monitoring sensors as supplied from hamilton mettler fogale finesse etc with pg thread are used in the industry and inserted in ports via sealed connections being twisted open during insertion it is preferable to use singleuse sensors as to the fact that the industry shift to disposable bioreactors bags as to this the need for disposable sensors becomes important and a significant improvement the above invented bioreactor core arranged in a bag of flexible materials or in cassettes containers capsules or the like from non flexible materials allow the bioreactor to be singleuse and disposable it is advantageous to avoid introduction of any foreign articles such as standard  millimetre diameter sensors probes transmitters after bioreactor sterilization and such sensors will not accept the sterilization or they loose their calibration relevant realtime sensors are such as for measurements of gases dissolved gases liquids temperature cell density organics pressures etc the present invention in one embodiment do benefit from disposable sensors being integrated into the bioreactor bag containers or capsule sensors have the advantages that they can be engineered to be noninvasive or introduced into the bioreactor before gamma sterilization occurs generally do not have stringent grounding requirements and can often provide enhanced performance over existing chemical or electrochemical methods a variety of sensors principles are used chemicaloptical optical fluorescence near infrared spectroscopic  nir partial least squares  pls principal component analysis  pcs radio frequency impedance capacity capacitance or others compact singleuse sensors are manufactured by the german company presens precision sensing gmbh being flat to less than   millimetres less than  millimetre in diameter the sensor elements are attached to the inside of the bioreactor container corresponding through the translucent container wall material to a transmitter on the outside for noninvasive and nondestructive operation an alternative product is from finesse corp from usa who offers a line of disposable optical sensors for detection of dissolved oxygen and ph operation modes perfusion mode operation of a bioreactor allow for continues expression and hereby constant harvest the bioreactor is operated in a configuration with at least one inlet and at least one outlet the majority of the media volume is passing the matrix being recirculated in orbital motion rotational symmetrical around the bioreactor centre continuously a suitable flow is taken out continuously including the expressed product and processed separately a similar volume is added as fresh nutrient to control metabolites concentrations alternatively the expressed product is harvested separated from the used media discharge which is drained separately a fresh media volume is added corresponding harvest volume and used media drained volume in order to keep a constant media volume and nutrients level inside the bioreactor the harvested and desired product may be filtered inside the bioreactor or directed to the downstream processing filtering for separation of cells cell debris or the like such as recirculation of cell suspended in the harvest fluid stream and further in the used media drainage fresh media may be selected advantageous to supply with selected concentration levels of various nutrients according to the process used media may be recycled external of the bioreactor and reused in said bioreactor after removal of lactate or metabolism biproducts in general flow speed liquid velocity flux of the media passing the porous matrix of the invention perpendicular to the permeable bodies should be in the range of   cmmin preferably   cmmin eg   cmmin measured per cm and perpendicular to the permeable bodies inlet surface too high media velocity will not allow the micro organism to be stationary inside colonise the entire matrix and to low media velocity will not supply sufficient nutrient and oxygen to keep the micro organism healthy and productive crossflow or tangentialflow operation gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels axially along the matrix core centre rather than perpendicular across the matrix the reactor feed fluid flow volume is significant larger than in pure perfusion mode the technology offer continues expression and constant harvest as the advantage in crossflow mode the bioreactor is operated in a configuration with one inlet and two fully independent and separated outlets the feed flow volume to the reactor is the combined retentate fresh nutrient passed the reactor unused and the permeate used nutrient including product flow the advantage is unlimited individual adjustments of the three flows which controls accurately   the feed flow through the matrix containing the micro organism and  the reactor operating pressure and  equally important the retentate flow of fresh nutrient all along the inlet volume in the bioreactor eliminating gradients factors which insures that any individual porous matrix bodies receive equal nutrient flow for elimination of gradients in each individual porous matrix cores crossflow operation also allows precise control of the fluid shear forced in order to avoid removal of adhered cells from matrix surfaces as no head space is needed and dissolved oxygenation is selected no bubbles or sparging outside the reactor the foaming problem is eliminated growing and expanding tissues in vitro from donor cells require four components stem cells a scaffolding made of polymers a bioreactor and cytokines such as polypeptides that bind cell specific receptors in the cell membranes of target cells to trigger a response the process involves seeding loading and cultivation of the biodegradable scaffold with cells and cytokines and expands the cells in the bioreactor the loaded scaffold may be removed as is or the cells removed from the scaffold and finalised by cell assembling to engineered simple tissues such as skin bone and cartilage or complex shaped body spare parts organs by d printing or stereolithography methods human made semi synthetic inorganic powder materials an alternative material for rigid

bekinox available from the belgium company bekaert typically the fibres are alloyed from at least elements like ferrum chromium nickel aluminium and preferably small parts of rare earth elements other selections from the elements and alloys may serve the task of attracting the micro organism if the porous matrix is fabricated from metal fibres then porosity range from  such as from  and higher than  human made synthetic organic fibres synthetic fibres are the result of extensive research by scientists to improve upon naturally occurring animal and plant fibres in general synthetic fibres are created by forcing usually through extrusion fibre forming materials through holes called spinnerets into the air forming a thread before synthetic fibres were developed artificially manufactured fibres were made from cellulose which originates from plants polyester is a category of polymers which contain the ester functional group in their main chain although there are many types of polyester the term polyester as a specific material most commonly refers to polyethylene terephthalate pet polyesters include naturallyoccurring chemicals such as in the cutin of plant cuticles as well as synthetics such as polycarbonate and polybutyrate polyester is like all artificial crude oil based fibre materials hydrophobic but the least hydrophobic and with less hydrophilic alike behaviour compared to than polypropylene biodegradable aliphatic materials bio plastics eg polyester fibers generated from agro resources sees increasing interest and may be the future for the disposable bioreactors such as polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates polyester is a category of polymers which contain the ester functional group in their main chain although there are many types of polyester the term polyester as a specific material most commonly refers to polyethylene terephthalate pet polyesters include naturallyoccurring chemicals such as in the cutin of plant cuticles as well as synthetics such as polycarbonate and polybutyrate polyester is like all artificial crude oil based fibre materials hydrophobic but the least hydrophobic and with less hydrophilic alike behaviour compared to than polypropylene the basic product is melt blown fibres or yarn cut into desired length and with thousand of needles from each side of a belt of fibres machining the fibres into a fabric called nonwoven biodegradable aliphatic polyester fibers bio plastics generated from agro resources sees increasing interest and may be the future for the disposable bioreactors such as polylactic acid and polyhydroxyalkanoates based organic vegetable natural grown biological fibres vegetable fibres are generally comprised mainly of cellulose examples include cotton jute flax ramie sisal coconut and hemp cellulose comes in several variations and the fibres serve world wide in the manufacture of paper and cloth cellulose in general offer hydrophilic behaviour and the fibres may be further categorized into the following • seed fibre fibres collected from seeds or seed cases eg cotton and kapok · leaf fibre fibres collected from leaves eg sisal and agave • bast fibre or skin fibre fibres are collected from the skin or bast surrounding the stem of their respective plant these fibres have higher tensile strength than other fibres therefore these fibres are used for durable yarn fabric packaging and paper some examples are flax jute kenaf industrial hemp ramie rattan soybean fibre and even vine fibres and banana fibres • fibre fibres are collected from the fruit of the plant eg coconut coir fibre • stalk fibre fibres are actually the stalks of the plant eg straws of wheat rice barley and other crops including bamboo and grass cellulose from trees wood is also such a fibre the most used natural fibres are cotton flax and hemp although sisal jute kenaf and coconut are also widely used hemp fibres are mainly used for ropes and aerofoils because of their high suppleness and resistance within an aggressive environment hemp fibres are for example currently used as a seal within the heating and sanitary industries and as part of composites for the automobile industry the use of cellulose materials as supports for immobilization of small molecules proteins and cells has received considerable attention for many years and possible applications have been pursued extensively chemically cellulose is composed of βdglucopyranosyl units linked by →  bonds and with additional inter chain interaction through hydrogen bonds some of which form the socalled elementary fibrils elementary fibrils contain highly ordered crystalline regions and more accessible amorphous regions of a low degree of order cellulose is available in many different physical forms such as fibres micro granules micro crystals beads gel particles capsules and membranes less pure cellulosic materials are used in industrial processes in the form of ropes pulps chippings cloths and paper surface properties such as the zeta potential defines the electrical charge on particles and surfaces or charge at the double layer surrounding the particles in aqueous suspension and may be measured with a zeta potential meter by means of known electroforesis or flow of sedimentation potential measurements the inventive step in this context is therefore to measure the zeta potential of the suspension or solution which is going to be in contact with the substrate material and thereafter establish a proper coating if necessary on the substrate in order to adhere the particles or micro organisms to the surface during growth recycling or cleaning of the matrix surface is then performed either by changing the phvalue of the suspension or by applying a suitable voltage or charge on the surface while cleaning the substrate table  the ph of isoelectric point at  °c for selected materials in water are every surface of a material has a tendency to adsorb electric charges the electrical state of a surface depends on the spatial distribution of free charges in its neighbourhood the zeta potential is a very important factor for the attraction of micro organism to the offered surface inside the porous matrix via selection of the correct materials it is possible to design the surfaces to be more or less micro organism adhesion friendly if the base carrier materials are selected from a material type not really suited for anchoring the micro organisms then an ultra thin surface treatment with more suitable materials or charge is one way of designing the surface properties according to the needs one example being that a re crystallized silicon carbide grain based wallflow carrier with relative low zeta potential may be modified via a surface coating with a zeta potential more suitable by an ultra thin tio or zeolite coverage such coating thickness ranging from a few nano meters to a few microns typically zeta potential range for micro organism culture support should be between  to  for mammalian micro organism like cho culture  to  for sf insect cells and  to  for hi cells and in general ph gradient should be reduced or eliminated being a feature of the present invention according to the selected micro organisms surface properties determined by hydrophilic or hydrophobic actions must be taken into account and different surface properties within the same container should be selected careful polyester fibres are typically less hydrophobic or become easier wetted more hydrophilic so to speak compared to the more hydrophobic materials like polypropylene surface coating of fibre surfaces grain surface membranes surfaces and matrix surfaces with extra cellular matrices ecm promotes micro organism semiadhesion and agglomeration such absorbent as organic matters like peptides proteins amino acids such as the artificial molecule polyllysine or the protein product alginate matrigel collagen fibronectin laminin or fibroblast or gelatine suspension as coating supporting becoming more hydrophilic for the micro organisms to anchor faster give higher level of affinity the cell agglomeration within the pores of the nonwoven polyester based matrix will benefit from pretreatment of washing with methanol or ethanol followed a plasma torch corona field treatment potentially sterilized under a uv light and alternatively immersed in a solution of  μg ml polydlysine and finally rinsed with sterile water some biomimetic materials offer even stronger electrostatic attraction than the amino acids like polyllysine such as the laminin family containing the protein domain isoleucine lysinevalinealaninevaline ikvav the examination of micro organism stem cells living cells being semiadherent of in suspension is a large scientific discipline usually manufacturers use inexpensive materials like synthetic polymers or glasses which easily can be formed in different structures in large quantities synthetic polymers are however usually hydrophobic and cells prefer to attach to polar or charged surfaces therefore surface treatment of the polymer by radiation or coating by hydrophilic compounds or nano coatings has been used in different context coating of surfaces with feeder cells are terms used to describe cells of one type that are cocultured with cells of another type to provide an environment in which the cells of the second type can be grown in suspension or to provide a surface on which the cells of the second type can be grown semiadhered the feeder cells are optionally from a different species as the cells they are supporting feeder cells may be one of the fibroblast types or the extracellular matrices such as matrigel and laminin coating of fibre surfaces does have other purposes like anchoring the fibres to each other in order to increase stiffness mechanical strength of the permeable body such a binder in solutions could be resins epoxy melamine polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl acetate or the like surface coating may also be impregnation with absorbent powders such as activated carbon pyrolytic carbon diatomaceous earth perlite cay or such similar or other materials molecules or proteins embedded in the matrix material carrying a positive cationic electro kinetic charge and chemically bonded to the matrix will further improve also the mechanical strength since most micro organism and contaminants found in the media are negatively charged anionic they will be inherently attracted to the charged matrix media composition today there is a multitude of different nutrient compositions for specific cell or micro organism types basically they are all based on • carbon source andor energy source · organic nitrogen source • minerals • vitamins glucose concentration should not fall below      gl with initial glucose concentration of   gl though highly depending on the micro organism cultivated c concentration is an important factor for adjusting the ph level with ratio to    and tension of c ranging    oxygen supply considerations in an aerobic process optimal oxygen transfer is perhaps the most difficult task to accomplish oxygen is poorly soluble in water even less in cultivation or bioreactors oxygen content in the nutrient is highly important and cells like cho constantly need  pmolcellh as oxygen is poorly dissolved in water o access often becomes the limiting factor for cell growth and protein expression oxygen transfer is usually helped by sparging gas bubble flushing and agitation which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the cultivation homogeneous in stirred tanks there are however limits to the speed of agitation due both to high power consumption which is proportional to the cube of the speed of the electric motor and to the damage to the micro organisms caused by excessive impellor tip speed in traditional suspension vessels or bags one feature of the present invention is the compactness which allows the matrix to be included permanently within a singleuse container also including a micro bubble sparging oxygenator unit and by controlling the media flow and direction including the bubbles its possible to separate bubble to micro organism contact by introduction of membranes within the vessel such separation membrane with selected porosity acts as a barrier to the bubbles allowing media to pass unrestricted keeping bubbles on the opposite side of the bioreactor the principle figures  and  also allow a setup where the impeller of pump b b is included within a container mutually with the oxygenator   detailed described in example  another attractive method is the use of the oxygenator which is a medical device capable of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of human patient in surgical procedures that may necessitate the interruption or cessation of blood flow in the body a critical organ or great blood vessel its a disposable device and contains about  m of a membrane permeable to gas but impermeable to fluids in the form of hollow fibre module pore size in such hollow fibres range   nm though operating at several bars of pressure combined in the bioreactor external fluid circuit fig  and fig  the oxygenator is most likely located outside the bio reactor as a separate reactor to which the nutrient pass through before being entered to the bio reactor the oxygenator sees on the other side of the membrane either air oxygen or a controlled gas composition in order to control the dissolved gases in the media seeding considerations nutrient velocity dynamics and flow profile though the matrix have huge impact on the spontaneous deposits of the micro organism prior to colonization of the matrix relative strength of adhesion are related to initial surface tension of the matrix surface and reflects the integrity of the first conditioning films which is usually dominated by proteins fluid flow effects such as shear stresses also play a critical role in the process of inoculation for semiadherent and suspension cells the dynamics are somewhat different as the fluid flow forces play an important role for where in the porous structure the micro organisms agglomerate and start to colonise the matrix expression considerations current expression rates by mammalian cells depend upon the type of molecule to be expressed and the basic rule is that high surface area enables high cell yields for adherent cells for suspension cell lines in general present day technologies are faced with the fact that cell density drop from x cellml on

editorial review board at a glance test sample the test common questions ask us related pages the test how is it used when is it ordered what does the test result mean is there anything else i should know how is it used a bilirubin test is used to detect an increased level in the blood it may be used to help determine the cause of jaundice andor help diagnose conditions such as liver disease hemolytic anemia and blockage of the bile ducts bilirubin is an orangeyellow pigment a waste product primarily produced by the normal breakdown of heme heme is a component of hemoglobin which is found in red blood cells rbcs bilirubin is ultimately processed by the liver to allow its elimination from the body any condition that accelerates the breakdown of rbcs or affects the processing and elimination of bilirubin may cause an elevated blood level two forms of bilirubin can be measured or estimated by laboratory tests unconjugated bilirubin—when heme is released from hemoglobin it is converted to unconjugated bilirubin it is carried by proteins to the liver small amounts may be present in the blood conjugated bilirubin—formed in the liver when sugars are attached conjugated to bilirubin it enters the bile and passes from the liver to the small intestines and is eventually eliminated in the stool normally no conjugated bilirubin is present in the blood usually a chemical test is used to first measure the total bilirubin level unconjugated plus conjugated bilirubin if the total bilirubin level is increased the laboratory can use a second chemical test to detect watersoluble forms of bilirubin called direct bilirubin the direct bilirubin test provides an estimate of the amount of conjugated bilirubin present subtracting direct bilirubin level from the total bilirubin level helps estimate the indirect level of unconjugated bilirubin the pattern of bilirubin test results can give the healthcare provider information regarding the condition that may be present in adults and older children bilirubin is measured to diagnose andor monitor diseases of the liver and bile duct eg cirrhosis hepatitis or gallstones evaluate people with sickle cell disease or other causes of hemolytic anemia these people may have episodes called crises when excessive rbc destruction increases bilirubin levels in newborns with jaundice bilirubin is used to distinguish the causes of jaundice in both physiologic jaundice of the newborn and hemolytic disease of the newborn only unconjugated indirect bilirubin is increased in much less common cases damage to the newborns liver from neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia will increase conjugated direct bilirubin concentrations as well often providing the first evidence that one of these less common conditions is present it is important that an elevated level of bilirubin in a newborn be identified and quickly treated because excessive unconjugated bilirubin damages developing brain cells the consequences of this damage include mental retardation learning and developmental disabilities hearing loss eye movement problems and death  back to top when is it ordered a health practitioner usually orders a bilirubin test in conjunction with other laboratory tests alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase when someone shows signs of abnormal liver function a bilirubin level may be ordered when a person shows evidence of jaundice has a history of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol has suspected drug toxicity has been exposed to hepatitiscausing viruses other symptoms that may be present include dark ambercolored urine nauseavomiting abdominal pain andor swelling fatigue and general malaise that often accompany chronic liver disease measuring and monitoring bilirubin in newborns with jaundice is considered standard medical care tests for bilirubin may also be ordered when someone is suspected of having or known to have hemolytic anemia as a cause of anemia in this case it is often ordered along with other tests used to evaluate hemolysis such as complete blood count reticulocyte count haptoglobin and ldh  back to top what does the test result mean adults and children increased total bilirubin that is mainly unconjugated indirect bilirubin may be a result of hemolytic or pernicious anemia transfusion reaction cirrhosis a relatively common inherited condition called gilbert syndrome due to low levels of the enzyme that produces conjugated bilirubin if conjugated direct bilirubin is elevated more than unconjugated indirect bilirubin there typically is a problem associated with decreased elimination of bilirubin by the liver cells some conditions that may cause this include viral hepatitis drug reactions alcoholic liver disease conjugated direct bilirubin is also elevated more than unconjugated indirect bilirubin when there is blockage of the bile ducts this may occur for example with gallstones present in the bile ducts tumors scarring of the bile ducts rare inherited disorders that cause abnormal bilirubin metabolism such as rotor dubinjohnson and criglernajjar syndromes may also cause increased levels of bilirubin low levels of bilirubin are generally not concerning and are not monitored newborns an elevated bilirubin level in a newborn may be temporary and resolve itself within a few days to two weeks however if the bilirubin level is above a critical threshold or increases rapidly an investigation of the cause is needed so appropriate treatment can be initiated increased bilirubin concentrations may result from the accelerated breakdown of red blood cells due to blood type incompatibility between the mother and her newborn certain congenital infections lack of oxygen hypoxia  diseases that can affect the liver in most of these conditions only unconjugated indirect bilirubin is increased an elevated conjugated direct bilirubin is seen in the rare conditions of biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis biliary atresia requires surgical intervention to prevent liver damage  back to top is there anything else i should know though unconjugated bilirubin may be toxic to brain development in newborns up to  weeks of age it does not pose the same threat to older children and adults in older children and adults the bloodbrain barrier is more developed and prevents bilirubin from gaining access to brain cells nevertheless elevated bilirubin strongly suggests that a medical condition is present that must be evaluated and treated bilirubin is not normally present in the urine however conjugated bilirubin is watersoluble and may be eliminated from the body through the urine if it cannot pass into the bile measurable bilirubin in the urine usually indicates blockage of liver or bile ducts hepatitis or some other form of liver damage and may be detectable early in disease for this reason bilirubin testing is integrated into common dipstick testing used for routine urinalysis bilirubin concentrations tend to be slightly higher in males than females african americans routinely show lower bilirubin concentrations than nonafrican americans strenuous exercise may increase bilirubin levels drugs that can decrease total bilirubin include barbiturates caffeine penicillin and high doses of salicylates the drug atazanavir increases unconjugated indirect bilirubin  back to
