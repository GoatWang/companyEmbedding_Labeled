describes petroleum production consumption and export but also natural gas and electricity production saudi arabia is the worlds top oil exporter and producer saudi arabias economy is petroleumbased oil actually accounts for  of the countrys exports and nearly  government revenues the oil industry produces about  of saudi arabias gross domestic product against  from the private sector saudi arabia has per capita gdp of  the economy is still very dependent on oil in spite of a diversification effort in particular in the petrochemical sector for many years the kingdom has been the world largest petroleum producer and exporter in  it pumped approximately  million barrels per day × md of petroleum while most of this is exported domestic use is rapidly increasing primarily for electricity production saudi arabia also has the largest or one of the largest proven crude oil reserves ie oil that is economically recoverable in the world  of global reserves over  billion barrels × m saudi arabia has one of the largest reserves of natural gas in the persian gulf proven natural gas reserves are over  trillion cubic metres  trillion cubic feet global production in  reached  billion barrels × m of oil and  trillion cubic metres  trillion cubic feet of natural gas but due to its sizeable domestic gas markets is unlikely to become lng exporters anytime soon saudi arabia is prioritising upstream gas investment but for use in the domestic power generation market not for export the country has had plans to diversify its energy sources for some time developing solar and

of january  saudi aramcos proven reserves were estimated at  billion barrels × m comprising about  of the world total they would last for  years at the current rate of production  of saudi oil fields found have not produced oil yet the ghawar oil field is the largest oil field in the world holding over  billion barrels × m ghawar is able to produce  million barrels per day × md of oil aramco announced  thousand barrels per day × md expansion and integration with neighboring petrochemical plants in ras tanura and yanbu by  to  however according to journalist karen elliott house some energy experts are convinced that current reserves are substantially lower than those officially claimed by saudis and that the depletion rate is substantially faster according to a former senior executive of the staterun aramco oil company sadad ibrahim al husseini the countrys real oil reserves are  lower than the official estimate of  billion barrels of oil house states no convincing evidence ever has been provided to support the increase in saudi oil reserves and tellingly in  the kingdom and other opec oil producers ceased releasing production data by field  finally saudi arabia has not revised its reserve estimate since  even though it has pumped somewhere between  million and  million barrels a day for the intervening two decades for a total of nearly  billion barrels new oil fieldsedit new oil fields will add up to  million barrels per day × md to production capacity by  the new fields are haradh khurais khusaniyah manifa neutral zone shared with kuwait nuayyin and shaybah i ii  iii productionedit see also history of the oil industry in saudi arabia saudiarabia is the major oil producer in the world accounting for  of the global production saudi arabia produces over  million barrels per day × md of oil exporting  million barrels per day × md the government is investing over  billion to increase oil production to near  million barrels per day × md by  and up to  million barrels per day × md by  this may be attributed to the report that  thousand barrels × m of excess capacity are needed to compensate for a natural decline in availability the future of saudi arabian oil is complicated by the fact that the major saudi oil fields are extremely old and have been producing oil for decades corrosion is becoming a large problem in addition to many other problems that come over time the result is that most of the easily produced oil is gone from these fields and tapping the rest of the oil is probably going to be much more difficult and more expensive such increased difficulty and expense may indicate that saudi arabian oil fields have already peaked shippingedit the majority of the oil is shipped via supertankers to refineries around the world three major ports are used for the shipping ras tanura is the worlds largest offshore oil loading facility with  million barrels per day × md capacity the ras aljuaymah facility on the coast of the persian gulf loads nearly  of the exports the last of the three largest terminals is the yanbu terminal located on the red sea the enormous sea shipping capacity is vital to saudi arabia given the absence of international pipelines exportedit for many years saudis ability to increase production of oil and stabilize price spikes led it to be compared to an international central bank and be called a central bank of oil‘ consumptionedit the kingdoms consumption of its own oil production has steadily increased and it now consumes about one quarter of its oil production approximately three million barrels per day as of  petrol in saudi arabia was sold at a price cheaper than bottled water—approximately  us per gallon according to jim krane saudi arabia now consumes more oil than germany an industrialized country with triple the population and an economy nearly five times as large according to a report by citigroup’s analyst heidy rehman as a result of its subsidies we calculate lost oil and gas revenues to saudi arabia in  to be over  billion adding that at the domestic level we believe the only real way to rationalize energy consumption would be to reduce subsidy levels aramcoedit until  the government did not receive a share of the oil drilled within its boundaries in  the saudi government gained a  share of the interest from aramco in  the saudi government purchased nearly  of the aramco oil business giving saudi officials complete control over prices and production in  the oil company was renamed saudi aramco the company is controlled by the government but also has a board of advisors and a ceo the current ceo and president of saudi aramco is amin h alnasser future perspectivesedit the future prospects of energy in saudi arabia have been studied extensively by the king abdullah pertroleum studies and research center kapsarc furthermore saudi officials are not concerned about alternative energy sources hurting the market for its exports in a recent interview with cbs they asked saudi arabia’s oil minister the following question let me be blunt okay and ask you to be candid is it aramco’s hope to prevent a switch away from oil somebody said the country is the oil business you absolutely need to do this for your own survival the minister responded by stating that “yeah we admit a fact that yes we depend on the oil industry we want it to help us you know to develop our economy and develop the economy of the world so what is good for the wellbeing of saudi arabia should be good for the wellbeing of the world too… we have to be realistic we dont have the alternatives today” saudi oil policy is shaped by multiple factors and as these factors change andor as new information becomes available saudi arabia’s oil policy will also change natural gasedit saudi arabia has the worlds fourth largest reserves of natural gas of  trillion cubic feet  trillion cubic metres onethird of this reserve is found in the ghawar before the master gas system the oil company flared burned the gas as it came from the oil well until recently production of natural gas was tightly controlled as it is so closely linked to oil production the world trade organization criticized the government and aramco for heavily subsidizing natural gas according to the energy information administration the price was  mmbtu american dollars electricityedit power line in the desert near riyadh saudi arabia is the fastest growing electricity consumer in the middle east particularly of transportation fuels in  saudi arabia was the worlds th largest consumer of primary energy of which over  percent was petroleumbased the remainder was made up of natural gas two ministries share responsibility for the energy sector the ministry of oil and the ministry of water and electricity the ministry of water was created in  by merging water related subdepartments its stated purpose is to prepare a comprehensive plan to establish water and sewage networks all over the kingdom it will also develop the country’s water policies and propose new regulations to preserve water in  this department was expanded electricity consumptionedit electricity consumption in saudi arabia increased sharply during the – period due to rapid economic development peak loads reached nearly  gw in — times their  leveland are expected to approach  gw by  the investment needed to meet this demand may exceed  billion consequently there is an urgent need to develop energy conservation policies for sustainable development electricity generation is  from oil  from natural gas and  from steam generation capacity is approximately  gw a looming energy shortage requires saudi arabia to increase its capacity capacity is planned to be increased to  gw by  the government has approved the construction of a  million facility to turn waste into energy the facility will process  tons of waste per day producing  mw of electricity and  us gallons  m of distilled water conservationedit towards the end of  the electricity sector embarked upon a major restructuring program one of its aims was to achieve sustainable performance although progress has been made remaining challenges include high demand growth low generation capacity reserve margins inefficient energy use absence of timeofuse rate adjustments and the need for large capital investments to fund expansion current sustainable policies particularly those encouraging energy conservation led to peak load savings of more than  mw in  mainly as a result of collaboration between the ministry of water and electricity and the saudi electricity company policies and programs are being developed for public awareness energy regulation and legislation and energy information and programming if energy conservation is successful demand can be reduced by – this is equivalent to – gw of additional capacity which represents a possible – billion saving over  years typically investment in energy efficiency is  of utility sales revenues which for a country like saudi arabia could be – million annually if only savings on air conditioning are considered the return on investment is equivalent to – mw of generating capacity—a saving of up to  billion pa bureaucratic historyedit the development of electricity in the kingdom of saudi arabia can be divided into two stages phase  initially electricity generation was left to small local companies such companies sold power at varying rates according to local costs in   ah the department of electricity affairs was established within the ministry of commerce with a mandate to regulate the electricity generation sector and to issue permits and licenses to electricity companies and to encourage national investment in   ah the department of electricity services was established this department was separated from the ministry of commerce and was given the additional responsibility of planning electrical services for the kingdom as a whole in   ah the ministry of commerce was divided into the commerce agency and the industry and electricity agency in that same year the electricity tariff was set for all companies at a level below their actual costs in   ah the government adopted ambitious plans for economic development requiring investment in industry and electrification the ministry of industry and electricity was formed with an industrial affairs agency and an electricity affairs agency the electricity affairs agency expanded the planning coordination and regulatory roles for providing electrical services the electricity corporation was established in   ah to coordinate the electricity plans contained in the kingdoms development plan from  to   –  ah all community electricity generation was gradually subsumed under the four regional saudi consolidated electricity companies scecos located in the central eastern southern and western regions with the formulation of a coherent development plan and the establishment of the scecos the government was able to bring electricity to the towns villages and settlements throughout the kingdom the number of electricity customers grew from  in   ah to  in  and  in  in may  electricity was made the responsibility of the ministry of water and electricity saudi consolidated electricity companies scecosedit the first sceco scecoeast was created in   ah this was followed in   ah by scecosouth electricity for the southwest is provided by another consolidated company and the central region is served by scecocentral the general electricity corporation gec had overall responsibility for the kingdoms electricity system and had direct responsibility for the provision of electrical supplies to rural areas not then covered by the consolidated companies the gec represented the government equity holdings in all the independent electricity generating companies and was a source of finance for those companies capital requirements in  the government announced the reorganization of the electricity sector by establishing a stock market company named the saudi electric company through the merger of all the electricity companies operating in the kingdom solar

the  mw andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant located in spain the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store captured solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun isnt shining this is a list of energy storage projects worldwide many individual energy storage projects augment electrical grids by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an electrical grid the energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or lowcost energy typically during night time for conversion into resources such as hot water cool water or ice which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour kwh such thermal energy storage is often employed at enduser sites such as large buildings and also as part of district heating thus shifting energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand some notable energy storage projects include sir adam beck
