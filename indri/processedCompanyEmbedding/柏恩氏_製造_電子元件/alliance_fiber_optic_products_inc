inc corning ny and sunnyvale calif  corning incorporated  april   acquisition to support corning’s plan for growth in cloud data center market corning incorporated nyse glw and alliance fiber optic products inc nasdaq afop announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which corning will acquire alliance fiber optic products inc under terms of the agreement corning will make an allcash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of alliance fiber optic products inc afop for  per share representing a transaction value of approximately  million afop designs and manufactures highperformance passive optical components these products are used by cloud datacenter operators and leading datacom and telecom oems original equipment manufacturers these components are used in several of corning’s existing connectivity solutions afop founded in  and headquartered in sunnyvale california has manufacturing and product development capabilities in the us taiwan and china upon closing of the acquisition corning will integrate afop into its optical communications business segment corning expects the acquisition to expand its market access to cloud datacenter operators and oems broaden its presence in asia and provide product and cost synergies corning expects the acquisition to be accretive to its earnings per share during the first year “combining afop’s components expertise with corning’s broad portfolio of connectivity solutions further strengthens our position in the highgrowth cloud datacenter market segment” said clark s kinlin executive vice president corning optical communications “and it adds additional products that corning can offer our broad customer base while providing an opportunity for manufacturing synergies” peter c chang afop founder and ceo commented “we are excited to join forces with corning we believe corning’s scale provides an excellent platform for our products to access a broader customer base and drive a higher level of growth than we would be able to achieve as a standalone company our board believes that this transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders
