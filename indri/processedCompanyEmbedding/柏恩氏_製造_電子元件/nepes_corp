jul    jongmyeong park seunghyun kim youngbae park  andong national university myeonghyeok jeong  nepes corporation growth behaviors of intermetallic compounds imcs and kirkendall voids in cusncu microbump were systematically investigated by an insitu scanning electron microscope observation cu–sn imc total thickness increased linearly with the square root of the annealing time for  h at °c which could be separated as first and second imc growth steps our results showed that the growth behavior of the first void matched the growth behavior of second cusn and that the growth behavior of the second void matched that of the second cusn it could be confirmed that doublelayer kirkendall voids growth kinetics were closely related to the cu–sn imc growth mechanism in the cusncu microbump
