leading provider of sapphire substrates and products to the led optical and semiconductor industries today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended december   the company reported fourth quarter revenue of  million lower than the prior quarter revenue of  million due to a temporary decline in wafer sales and weaker sapphire demand for two and fourinch core sold into the mobile device and led markets wafer revenue declined from  million in the third quarter to  million in the fourth quarter but the company expects wafer revenue to rebound to or exceed the level of third quarter wafer revenue in the first quarter of  driven by growth in sixinch pss wafer sales additional growth in the wafer business is expected in the second quarter excess sapphire capacity and fluctuations in inventory levels in the led and mobile device supply chains continues to depress pricing in the sapphire market the company limited the amount of two and fourinch core sold in the fourth quarter due to the particularly challenging pricing bill weissman rubicons ceo said there continues to be excess sapphire capacity in the market however we are working with developers of some very interesting potential new applications for sapphire which fit particularly well with rubicons unique set of sapphire knowledge and capabilities the company also continues to work on developing

unprecedented in the market we also expect to move sapphirex into production later this year and we are pleased with the initial interest in that product the companys gaap loss per share was  for the

changes that we expect to reduce wafer costs over the next several months and expect cash flow from operations to improve first quarter  guidance the company expects revenues to increase to between  and  million in the first quarter with increased wafer revenue particularly from sixinch pss wafers and an increase in fourinch core sales gaap loss per share is expected to be between  and

companys historical and prospective operating performance the nongaap measures exclude the impact of certain noncash charges which are described in the footnotes to the table below management excludes these items because they believe the impacts do not reflect expected future results and that their exclusion aids in the comparison of the companys current results with past and future operating results these nongaap financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the companys results as
