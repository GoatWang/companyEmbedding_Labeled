with fire resistance class ei  the maximum dimension of this fire partition is  x  meters products which combine a couple of qualities essential for the user such as eg high fire resistance class optimum space management simple assembling of fire partition in the wall advanced mechanical resistance and  last but not least  an acceptable price are more and more wanted among our customers ms beata zgrajka commercial manager department of fire partitions at mercor sa says flexible rollup door a brandnew item in our portfolio is the result of the attempts to meet such market expectations  beata zgrajka adds mcr ebr  ie flexible rollup door has acquired a technical approval from the building research institute in warsaw in june this year from the functional point of view the product combines the best qualities of two products from our fire partitions portfolio it is as reliable as the steelarmour rollup door and almost as lightweight as the draft curtain made of special fabric mcr ebr is a newgeneration proposal which if required may substitute our mcr rollfire steel door and mcr profire curtain the new product offers the guarantee of fire resistance and insulating integrity according to ei  class ie up to two hours simultaneously it is definitely lighter than a steel product and less expensive which is essential for our customers  beata zgrajka recapitulates it is worth mentioning that the customers have been interested in this novel solution since its opening presentation on the day mcr ebr was commercialised it had already found its way to several investment projects among them a new nanotechnology centre building at the gdansk technical university a building designed by arch deco a famous gdanskbased design studio back previous      next ﻿
