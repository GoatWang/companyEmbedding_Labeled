productconnecting with the buyerselling products as an owner salespersoncommunity qa selling a product doesn’t have to be complicated at its most basic level a sales program is defined principally by what you sell who you sell it to and how you sell it beyond that sales involves staying focused on the details of your product and customers as a sales program continues you will want to keep paying attention to changing trends and the needs or desires of your customers by observing these changes you will be able to adjust your program and keep your sales strong steps method  showing enthusiasm for the product  study your product if you are able to convey knowledge about the product and to answer questions that customers may have then they will understand that you really care about the product if you find the product worthwhile they are more likely to as well it is absolutely vital to know your product inside out if you do not know something a customer asks of you try saying something like “i don’t know the exact answer for that but i’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away what’s the best way to contact you when i find the answer”  emphasize the perks of the product to customers as well as getting good product information to the right people it is important to translate the products features into benefits this makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product think about things like will the product make the customer’s life easier will the product create a sense of luxury is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people is the product something that can be used for a long time  ensure that the product has been adequately explained if you are not doing direct persontoperson sales then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging pointofpurchase displays and any marketing materials even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch having good product information on display will help you convince customers make sure that all product information is informative true and complete make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear direct and easy to read invest the time and money to ensure that your product packaging and marketing materials look good—highquality photos vivid colors etc method  connecting with the buyer  share your love of the product a good salesperson believes in the product that is being sold and transfers this enthusiasm to the customer there are numerous ways to show your love of a product don’t neglect body language and tone you will convey energy and enthusiasm if you speak clearly about a product and show expression when discussing it on the other hand if you mumble when customers ask questions about a product or cross your arms over your chest then it will appear like you are distant and don’t care about the product be prepared to discuss how you use the product or how other satisfied customers have specific stories about the product make it relatable to customers for instance if you’re selling a shampoo you can tell a customer something like “my hair is usually so frizzy but ever since i’ve started using this it’s been as smooth and straight as it is right now”  anticipate your customers’ motivations you want to be able to answer any questions that customers may have about a product but even more importantly you want to anticipate those questions this shows that you understand customer needs make sure that you are able to connect emotionally with customers by addressing those needs think about your typical customers what motivates them what needs do they have are they young single wealthy do they have families once you have an idea of your customers in mind think about how your product can help them meet their needs or reach their desires  practice breaking the ice with customers if you are working in direct sales the way you connect with people is critical instead of asking the closeended question may i help you” ask the more positive openended questions like are you looking for something for yourself or a gift for someone special in addition be ready to make remarks about your product that will interest customers and start deeper conversations for instance if you are in clothing retail you might say “you know ugly christmas sweater parties are really popular right now have you ever been to one”  convert the customers motivations into the products characteristics in marketing this is known as positioning and it consists of equating the product with the customers hopes and desires a number of factors are important when positioning a product position the product in the best spectrum of the market possible don’t pitch the product too high or too low in terms of affordability and luxury position the facts about the product according to the person youre selling it to you may have a handful of different facts but its up to your skill to know which of those facts best serve each individual sale dont fudge facts or lie outright product positioning is about perception not deception position the facts so that they transcend the product itself this means that the desirable positive values associated with the product are what sell it companies that excel at this include cocacola apple and many designer goods or labels think about how your product will connect with a customer’s lifestyle or values and not simply serve a function for instance if you are trying to sell a relatively highend minivan to a wealthy older person you might mention its luxurious features do this by saying things like “take a look at that wood trim—it’s just beautiful and those soft leather seats—they’re so comfortable they’re perfect for taking a nice sunset drive” if you were trying to sell the same minivan to a family with three children however you would emphasize its more utilitarian features for example you could say things like “the third seat adds lots of room for carting friends around it also folds down when you need room for hauling groceries sporting gear and things like that and did i mention that side air bags and antilock brakes come standard”  be honest about your product longterm lovers of your product will only come about if youve been honest with them this means being transparent in your delivery of product information and also admitting your own lack of knowledge or mistakes youve made dont be afraid of honesty it builds trust if you ever are not able to answer customers’ questions or supply them with what they need offer to follow up with them later as soon as you are able to make sure customers know they can come back to you later if they have questions or concerns if it ever turns out that a product isn’t right for a customer be honest about it and help the customer find what he or she really needs even if you don’t make the sale today your honesty and generosity will be remembered and can translate into future sales for instance if you are trying to sell a sports car to customer who eventually tells you that he has five young children who he drives to school everyday you could say something like “well maybe you’d be better off with a good minivan or suv but if you’re ever in the market for a second vehicle come back and talk to me and i’ll help you get a good deal”  close the sale there are many styles and methods of closing a sale but one of the most effective has the mnemonic abc always be closing as you confirm your prospective buyers interest in the product put forward trial closes like does this sound like the product you want or “so what do you think will this meet your needs”  give customers time to consider appearing overly pushy is a turnoff for many buyers they may want to go home and do a quick online search for more information let them do so with your enthusiastic and supportive pitch in mind if youve been truthful helpful considerate and enthusiastic and the information youve given them matches with what they read online they are likely to come back to your product sometimes it pays to let your customers take the lead give them time to consider and keep quiet while they do only offer more information when they request it don’t let customers get away without knowing how to contact you if you are working in a store or on site make sure customers will know how to find you again especially if you will be moving around make sure to tell customers something like ill be right here at the counter if you need me or just ask any sales associate to page me if you have any questions you can also give customers your contact information so they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want more information slip the customer your business card or other contact information and say something call me anytime if you have questions and you can also find me right here in the store on weekdays use your instincts if you think a customer is close to buying stay nearby without being intrusive you’ll want the customer to be able to find you quickly the last thing you want is for a potential buyer to decide to purchase and then be unable to find you method  selling products as an owner salesperson  familiarize yourself with all aspects that feed into the end sale of a product as an owner salesperson that is one who owns the business that is selling the product you have the ability to affect more than just the interaction with buyers in addition to the strategies mentioned in the rest of this article you can also

how are your competitors performing being able to answer these questions will help you maximize your sales and keep growth steady  troubleshoot sales if necessary if you are not selling well you will need to enter problemsolving mode improving your sales will involve reassessing your product customer base and marketing change your tactics periodically if customers hear the same sales routine over and over again or see the same display month in and month out your product might start to seem irrelevant consider deleting a product from your line if it is not selling well stock can be sold at discounted prices to liquidate it review your target market and sharpen your sales focus your buyers might be changing and you will want to keep up with them or else find a new market reevaluate the product design distribution packaging etc tweaking the product with your target market and sales strategy in mind can improve your sales change the price of your product by studying your sales data and competitors’ performance you may be able to tell if you are charging too much or too little for your product make the product exclusive or available for a limited time only sometimes controlling supply in this way will increase demand and sales make sure that this tactic works with your overall sales strategy however if you are marketing a product as perfect for everyday use it may not work

help answer questions learn more  marketing theories  the ps of the marketing mix marketing theories – the marketing mix – from  p’s to  p’s advice and blog marketing theories – the marketing mix – from  p’s to  p’s marketing theories – the marketing mix – from  p’s to  p’s visit our marketing theories page to see more of our marketing buzzword busting blogs  marketing is a continually evolving discipline and as such can be one that companies find themselves left very much behind the competition if they stand still for too long one example of this evolution has been the fundamental changes to the basic marketing mix where once there were  p’s to explain the mix nowadays it is more commonly accepted that a more developed  p’s adds a much needed additional layer of depth to the marketing mix with some theorists going even going further before we get carried away though what is the marketing mix and what is the original  p’s principle the marketing mix simply put the marketing mix is a tool used by businesses and marketers to help determine a product or brands offering the  p’s have been associated with the marketing mix since their creation by e jerome mccarthy in  you can see why there may have been some need to update the theory the marketing mix  p’s product  the product should fit the task consumers want it for it should work and it should be what the consumers are expecting to get place – the product should be available from where your target consumer finds it easiest to shop this may be high street mail order or the more current option via ecommerce or an online shop price – the product should always be seen as representing good value for money this does not necessarily mean it should be the cheapest available one of the main tenets of the marketing concept is that customers are usually happy to pay a little more for something that works really well for them promotion – advertising pr sales promotion personal selling and in more recent times social media are all key communication tools for an organisation these tools should be used to put across the organisation’s message to the correct audiences  in the manner they would most like to hear whether it be informative or appealing to their emotions in the late ’s it was widely acknowledged by marketers that the marketing mix should be updated this led to the creation of the extended marketing mix in  by booms  bitner which added  new elements to the  p’s principle this now allowed the extended marketing mix to include products that are services and not just physical things the extended  p’s people – all companies are reliant on the people who run them from front line sales staff to the managing director having the right people is essential because they are as much a part of your business offering as the productsservices you are offering processes –the delivery of your service is usually done with the customer present so how the service is delivered is once again part of what the consumer is paying for physical evidence – almost all services include some physical elements even if the bulk of what the consumer is paying for is intangible for example a hair salon would provide their client with a completed hairdo and an insurance company would give their customers some form of printed material even if the material is not physically printed in the case of pdf’s they are still receiving a “physical product” by this definition though in place since the ’s the  p’s are still widely taught due to their fundamental logic being sound in the marketing environment and marketers abilities to adapt the marketing mix to include changes in communications such as social media updates in the places which you can sell a productservice or customers expectations in a constantly changing commercial environment is there an th p in some spheres of thinking there are  p’s in the marketing mix the final p is productivity and quality this came from the old services marketing mix and is folded in to the extended marketing mix by some marketers so what does it mean the th p of the marketing mix productivity  quality  this p asks “is what you’re offering your customer a good deal” this is less about you as a business improving your own productivity for cost management and more about how your company passes this onto its customers even after  years or  in the case of the original p’s the marketing mix is still very much applicable to a marketer’s day to day work a good marketer will learn to adapt the theory to fit with not only modern times but their individual business model at professional academy the marketing mix is used across all of our marketing qualifications and first taught as part of the cim foundation certificate in professional marketing but every level of qualification there are nods back to the marketing mix p’s in some way shape or form so making them key knowledge for any marketer to be used alongside other marketing theories such as swot analysis pestel theory the boston consulting group matrix and stakeholder mapping for more information on the professional academy’s marketing qualifications please download a
