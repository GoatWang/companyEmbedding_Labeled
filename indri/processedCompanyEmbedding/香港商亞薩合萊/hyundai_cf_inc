the korean war however the company regained its footing to distinguish itself as one of koreas leading construction enterprises during the s by the late s chung had turned his attention to the automobile industry the korean government at that time believed that it made more sense to import vehicles than produce them domestically and had made its opinion known still chung opted to follow his own convictions and in  he founded the hyundai motor company the company quickly established an alliance with one of the industrys oldest automakers signing a twoyear contract with ford in  to share assembly technology hyundais first car the cortina was created from that partnership the manufacturers first car to be designed and built in korea was the compact pony although the car was based on
