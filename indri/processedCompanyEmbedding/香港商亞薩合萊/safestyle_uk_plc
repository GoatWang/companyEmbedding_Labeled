to report that safestyle uk achieved record sales and profitability in  and is well placed to continue its progress in    business review   in  safestyles market share as measured by fensa installations increased for the twelfth consecutive year to  from  in  consolidating our sector leading position during the period we carried out a record  installations up  on  consisting of  window and door frames up  on  our average frame sales price excluding vat increased by  to £ and our average installed order value increased from £ to £ this strong operational performance resulted in increased revenue up  to £m  £m and underlying profit before tax up  to £m  £m   we continued to expand our sales branch network during the year with new sales branch openings in guildford and norwich  in addition we added an installation depot in south wales in february  to increase our capacity and customer service levels in that region and now have a network of  sales branches and  installation depots across the uk there still remain significant opportunities to widen our sales network and over the course of  we will remain focused on identifying further locations in which we are relatively underrepresented in relation to our target customer base   we have continued to increase our activity in generating enquiries from lower cost digital media and direct response channels which accounted for  of all orders in  compared to  in  lead generation from our traditional door canvassing remains an important part of the marketing mix and the value of business from this source increased by  in   our planned increased investment in direct and digital marketing will remain an important factor during  as we aim to continue growing our market share and reducing average lead generation costs   the weakness in sterling following the eu referendum resulted in industry wide increased raw material costs in the second half of  however we have been able to fully offset these costs through an increase in our prices from st january   going forward the strength of our market position low cost manufacturing capabilities as well as our track record in delivering sustainable price increases leaves us well positioned to manage any further input cost pressures   factory expansion plan on target   we are pleased that construction of the new factory which commenced in  is nearing completion and is progressing to plan and budget we have received and installed the new glass toughening furnace high speed cutting table and high speed igu line by june  we will have transferred the existing glass manufacturing process to the new factory  the manufacturing of both the frames and double glazed units on a single site will reduce handling improve quality increase efficiency and enhance capacity as the group broadens its product range and continues to grow its market share   product and other developments   following the launch and proof of concept of our conservatory upgrade product in  growth accelerated during  and we installed  conservatory upgrades against our target of  we are pleased with the progress made and expect continued growth of this exciting area in  as the contribution from this revenue stream increases   the new premium products and colours we introduced in  have steadily gained traction and are contributing to our broader product offering and appeal   as part of our strategy to further improve our sales effectiveness in  we provided all of our sales representatives with digital tablets which contain a range of sales presentation aids including finance application results whilst in the customers home we have received positive feedback from our sales representatives and in  will continue to develop software tools for both our sales and canvass forces which aim to make the sales process more efficient   outlook   whilst we anticipate the macroeconomic outlook to remain uncertain the longterm fundamental drivers underpinning the uk rmi market remain robust our proven track record in growing market share and implementing price increases means we are well positioned as market leader to build on the momentum achieved over the past year   during  we will continue our drive to grow market share and develop our sales branch network we continue to invest in our manufacturing equipment and look forward to achieving a key milestone when the major expansion of our factory is complete   we have already experienced strong growth following our entry into the conservatory refurbishment market and expect further growth in    our robust cash generation and strong financial position enables the group to continue to make substantial investment in its infrastructure without compromising returns to shareholders   we believe that our broad range of energy efficient products attractive promotional consumer finance options and lowcost value proposition are compelling differentiators in a highly fragmented market and will continue to separate safestyle from its competitors   the group again delivered record results in  and it is our intention to continue our successful growth in    sj birmingham fca chief executive officer  march      financial review   revenue   revenue for the period was £ million against £ million for the same period last year representing growth of   average unit prices increased by  in the year from £ to £  this followed a price list increase implemented at the start of  to counterbalance the additional costs of the new consumer finance products introduced in june   it also reflected the growth in conservatory upgrades with a total of  installations during the year and a change to the timing of revenue recognition for survey fees that increased sales by £ million in the period   the volume of frames installed in  was  an increase of  over the previous year    average order value also showed encouraging growth from £ inc vat in  to £ in    leads generated from direct response continued to be the engine for growth  leads from this source were  in the year compared to  in  an increase of    gross margin   the basis of calculating gross margin has been changed from the beginning of  and the prior period comparatives have been restated accordingly  marketing costs that are directly linked to lead generation and previously included as operating expenses have been reclassified as cost of sales as explained in note    on this basis gross profit increased by  in the period from £ million in  to £ million in   as was indicated in the half year results gross margin continued to improve in the second half of the year ending the year at  compared to  in the full year   as expected average sales prices were higher in the second half more than offsetting the increased costs from the impact of sterling weakness   other operating expenses   other operating expenses in  were £ million  £ million an increase of   the costs in the period included oneoff employer national insurance costs of £ million which were incurred as a result of the exercise in april  of ltip options granted when the company floated in    an increase in the provision for doubtful debts impacted operating costs in the period by £ million  the majority of the increase relates to outstanding debts over  year old  much of this debt has been secured with a charge over the customers property the recent rate of recovery has been very slow and it has been decided to make a full provision for these amounts   other overhead costs grew at a slower rate than revenues and resulted despite the above costs in the pretax profit margin increasing slightly to      profit and eps   profit before tax increased by  from £ million in  to £ million in   this was after charging share based payments of £ million in   £ million the current year being impacted by the oneoff cost of £ million from the ltip exercise underlying pbt before share based payments was £ million for the period  £ million an increase of    basic earnings per share for the period were p compared to p for the same period last year  the value for  has been impacted by the oneoff ltip cost and by the dilution effect on the weighted average number of shares of the ltip exercise and  warrant exercise  the basis for the calculation is detailed in note  to the accounts   cash   the cash balance at  december  was £ million a reduction of £ million in the period  this was after paying total dividends of £ million  £ million including a special dividend of £ million  nil   operating cashflow in the year was £ million up £ million from the previous year  this was helped by a reduction in the working capital level which reduced by £ million compared to a £ million increase in    capital expenditure in the period was £ million  £ million  the factory expansion including the new glass furnace accounted for £ million of this years investment  this leaves a balance of £ million still to be spent on this project which is scheduled to complete in q    dividends   the board is proposing a final dividend of p per share subject to approval of shareholders at the agm  the dividend will be paid on  july  to shareholders on the register at close of business on  june    mj robinson chief financial officer  march      consolidated statement of comprehensive income for

jersey law    safestyle uk plc is a public listed company incorporated in jersey the companys shares are traded on aim the company is required under aim rule  to provide shareholders with audited consolidated financial statements  the registered office address of the safestyle uk plc is  esplanade st helier jersey je bd the company is not required to present parent company information   basis of preparation the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  financial statements  have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrss as adopted by the eu and the international financial reporting standards interpretations committee interpretations issued by the international accounting standards board iasb that are effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these financial statements safestyle uk plc was incorporated on  november  on

revenue from contracts with customers not yet endorsed ·     classification and measurement of sharebased payment transactions  amendments to ifrs  not yet endorsed ·     ifrs  leases not yet endorsed the group is currently considering the implication of those standards not yet endorsed and has completed an initial assessment of the impact it is anticipated the impact of ifrs  on the financial position and performance of the group will be minimal and effects will principally relate to amendment and extension of current disclosures the board is aware of the effective dates and will continue to review the potential impact on the financial statements in respect of ifrs  the group is undertaking an assessment of the impact of this standard on the financial position of the group this is expected to result in a material change given the annual value of operating lease costs in respect of ifrs  the group is undertaking an assessment of the impact given the addition clarity provided by the standard basis of consolidation subsidiaries are entities that the company has power over exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power to affect those returns  in

revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of business and is shown net of value added tax  the group primarily earns revenues from the sale design manufacture and installation of domestic doubleglazed replacement windows and doors  product sales revenues are recognised once the goods have been installed survey fees are recognised at the point at which they become nonrefundable the group received no commissions for introducing finance products to customers in  only paying subsidies which are recognised as a cost of sale revenue from maintenance is recognised on completion of the work carried out change in accounting policy during the year the revenue recognition policy was voluntarily updated to recognise survey fees at the point at which they become nonrefundable previously this income was deferred until the goods were installed and was held within accruals and deferred income the impact in current year financial statements was to increase revenue by £m the directors do not consider that the change in accounting policy is material to the users of the accounts and consequently have not restated the comparatives for the effect of this change the effect in  would have been to increase revenue by £m this amount was recognised in  in line with the old accounting policy reclassification of costs in the current year costs of £m fy  £m relating to the cost of generating of customer leads were reclassified as a cost of sale previously these were classed as other operating expenses the board of directors decided this reflected the true nature of the cost there is no resulting change to operating profit in the period and there are no prior year adjustments to profit the previous years figures have been restated to allow comparison with the current year           accounting estimates and judgements details of the groups significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial statements and include recoverability of trade receivables the assessment of whether trade receivables are recoverable requires judgement
