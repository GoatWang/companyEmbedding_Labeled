already a member login here since peaking at a price of over s in  shares of global logistic properties ltd sgx mc have tumbled at the time of writing shares of the company are exchanging hands at s up by a fifth from a week low price of s given the sharp decline in global logistic properties’ share price over the past three years is the company possibly a bargain global logistic properties as its name suggests has a focus on logistics facilities the company is currently one of the largest owners and managers of logistics properties in the world it has a strong presence in its four main geographical markets china japan brazil and the united states in fact the company has the largest base of modern logistics facilities in china japan and brazil when compared to its competitors there if we’re looking at earnings on a trailing basis global logistic properties does not look expensive at its current share price the company only trades at  times trailing earnings a peek at the trailing earnings multiple of one of the company’s largest competitors the uslisted prologis inc also lends weight to the view prologis is currently trading at  times trailing earnings but just because a company has a lower valuation than its peer does not mean it really is undervalued after all its peer could be the one that’s overvalued for global logistic properties using the pricetoearnings ratio might not be the best measurement of value the company in a similar manner to prologis records significant fair value gains from its properties from time to time and these go into the earnings number used to calculate the pe ratio given that property revaluations do not generate recurring revenue and are noncash in nature using them to value the company may be dangerous for investors a more appropriate metric to value global logistic properties would be the pricetotangible book ratio given that the company is propertyfocused and regularly revalues its properties source sp global market intelligence in looking at the history of global logistic properties’ pricetotangible book ptb ratio in the chart above i see an interesting story too at the moment the company’s ptb ratio of  is below the annual average ptb ratios in each year from  to  a ptb ratio of  also means that global logistic properties is priced at a discount to its assets – net of all liabilities – by the market so with global logistic properties’ low ptb ratio is that a sign that it’s the real deal thing is investors may not want to take the low ptb ratio as a sign that the company’s really undervalued and thus rush to buy the stock often the stock market is forwardlooking in nature the company’s low valuation right now could mean that the market’s seeing some storm clouds ahead because of that investors have to ask themselves why is the market negative about the company is the slowdown in the global economy going to hurt global logistic properties’ business are there propertyprice bubbles in the logistics sector in any of the four main geographical markets of the company if there are does that mean that the company may have overpaid for some of its property acquisitions in the past and thus might suffer writedowns in the future investors would have to think through all these issues and risks before being able to come to a conclusion on whether global logistic properties is indeed a bargain right now to keep up to date on the latest financial and stock market news sign up for a free subscription to the motley fools weekly investing newsletter take
