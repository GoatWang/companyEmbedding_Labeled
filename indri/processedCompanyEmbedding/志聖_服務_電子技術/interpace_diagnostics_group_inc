group inc aug    et share this article parsippany nj aug   prnewswire  interpace diagnostics group nasdaq idxg a company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for better patient diagnosis and management reported today that the company has launched a new version of their accucea™ product called insights for gastroenterologists who focus on diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer the new accucea insights service provides physicians for whom the company has already provided first line testing with additional information on how those results compare to those of other patients in the companys proprietary database of over  patients thus reporting incremental and valuable information on the patients potential molecular profile and overall risk for developing pancreatic cancer when the report is delivered to the ordering physician they have an opportunity to speak with one of the companys expert molecular pathologists and discuss the potential benefits of conducting a full molecular pathology review using pancragen® the companys fully integrated product that considers all the results from first line testing imaging cytology and molecular testing and stratifies the patient in one of  risk categories interpace diagnostics who has offered their accucea product to customers for over  years will continue to offer accucea in addition to accucea insights the primary benefit of the accucea product vs traditional carcinoembryonic antigen or cea testing available from other labs is that accucea is the only cea assay that has been validated on small ul amounts of cyst fluid interpace currently performs over  accucea tests per year for their customers  cea is a blood fluid chemistry test that is commonly done as part of an initial screening performed on patients suspected of having pancreatic and other types of cancer  this test along with other common fluid chemistry tests like amylase may also be referred to as first line testing the additional information provided via accucea insights provides physicians a more expansive view of their patients status and enables them to make an informed decision regarding the most appropriate next steps said interpace president and ceo jack stover we believe customers who currently order first line testing services only will see the value in not only the incremental information provided via accucea insights but the full benefits of our fully integrated molecular product pancragen about pancragen® pancragen® is a pancreatic cyst molecular test that by using a small sample of pancreatic cyst fluid can aid in pancreatic cancer risk assessment pancragen® is  accurate according to clinical studies enabling effective risk stratification of patients  pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced because of this and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths about interpace diagnostics group inc interpace diagnostics provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the

launching tert the company served as a major sponsor of the event in support of the meeting’s objective to educate physicians and others about diagnosing and treating thyroid cancer   the tert marker is a strong molecular predictor of the aggressiveness of thyroid cancer and adds additional insights into a patient’s molecular profile  currently the thygenx™ mutation panel includes the following markers that are predictive of thyroid cancer from cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules braf hras kras nras retptc paxppary and pikca  by adding tert the panel will not only continue to be a strong positive predictor of thyroid cancer but will also provide evidence that a positive result indicates the cancer is likely to be more aggressive in nature published data indicates that tert mutations can extend the life span of tumor cells and allow time for other mutations to develop mutations in the tert promoter region are found in thyroid cancers and seem to act synergistically when they occur with the braf v mutation  the coexistence of mutations in tert and braf genes has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of thyroid cancer aggressiveness tumor recurrence and thyroid cancerspecific deaths physicians are now able to order tert as part of the thygenx mutation panel or on an individual basis the thygenx thyramir® test is the only test in the market that combines the

approximately  to  of the  thyroid fine needle aspirations fnas performed on an annual basis in the us are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation and thus are candidates for thygenx and thyramirthygenx and thyramir reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules  the combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decisionmaking when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancerthygenx utilizes stateoftheart nextgeneration sequencing ngs to identify more than  genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas the two most common forms of thyroid cancer thyramir is the first microrna gene expression

services announced today the acceptance of four posters to be presented at the upcoming united states and canadian academy of pathology uscap meeting being held march   in san antonio texasthe posters reflect a review of data from the companys extensive experience in molecular thyroid testing including experience with over  analyses of indeterminate thyroid nodules using its combined mutational thygenx® and microrna classifier thyramir® testing format fundamental insights into the mechanism of thyroid cancer development and progression are reported as well as a comprehensive statistical analysis of the mutational and microrna profiling features representing the largest integrated analysis of dna and rna alterations in existence for commercially available molecular products in the area of thyroid cancerthe united states and canadian academy of pathology uscap has been the most prestigious provider of continuing medical education cme for pathologists globally for more than a century superbly integrating cme into the process for improving professional practice and patient outcomes by reducing the gap between evidencebased practices and adoption of those practices into clinical care  the organization boasts a membership of  pathologists and other practitioners committed to this goal the accepted posters that will be presented at the conference are entitled the role of mirna expression analysis in needle aspirate cytology of indeterminate thyroid nodules clinical and biological significance of common mutational genotypes of thyroid follicular neoplasia biological aggressiveness of thyroid neoplasia depends on the strength of the genetic mutation and associated cellular interaction and microrna profiling complements microscopicmutational analysis by defining alternative pathways of carcinogenesis according to jack stover president  ceo of interpace we are pleased that this work has been accepted for presentation at the upcoming uscap meeting the acceptance of these four posters by this prestigious international organization reflects the strength of our ongoing commitment to demonstrate the exceptional clinical utility of our tests globallyabout thyroid nodules thygenx and thyramir testingaccording to the american thyroid association approximately  to  of the  thyroid fine needle aspirations fnas performed on an annual basis in the us are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation and thus are candidates for thygenx® and thyramir®thygenx and thyramir reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules  the combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decisionmaking when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancerthygenx utilizes stateoftheart nextgeneration sequencing ngs to identify more than  genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas the two most common forms of thyroid cancer thyramir is the first microrna gene expression classifier  micrornas are small noncoding rnas that bind to messenger rna and regulate expression of genes involved in human cancers including every subtype of thyroid cancer thyramir measures the expression of  micrornas  both thygenx and thyramir are covered by both medicare and
