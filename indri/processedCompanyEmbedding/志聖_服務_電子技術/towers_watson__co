and removal of preexisting condition requirements – are included the plan also offers renewable annual rates on a block or portfolio basis by country to minimise fluctuation global access is available in  countries and aims to give employers easy access to competitive benefit coverage solutions when customisation is not required very low minimum headcount is required of cover the plan has been
