to find the ideal candidate if this was the pentagon or heck  google i understand but for a firm that isnt even ranked on the top  companies to work for reallyalso the recruiter has an attitude problem she definitely gave me an odd holier than thou attitude when i approached her for questionsconcerns she is supposed to channel the exuberance of company about a candidate not give vague answers that instill uncertainty in bothso imagine then if you will a company that considers a month long process the de facto standard for their hiring process for this role then imagine if you were indeed hired how long would it take to get your message across to upper management and how soon it would be heard seems to exhibit a constant up hill struggle in places there shouldnt beinterview
