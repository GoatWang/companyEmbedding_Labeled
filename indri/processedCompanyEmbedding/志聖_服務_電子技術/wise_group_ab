operationsdense matrix and array manipulation this page aims to provide an overview and explanations on how to use eigens array class what is the array class the array class provides generalpurpose arrays as opposed to the matrix class which is intended for linear algebra furthermore the array class provides an easy way to perform coefficientwise operations which might not have a linear algebraic meaning such as adding a constant to every coefficient in the array or multiplying two arrays coefficientwise array types array is a class template taking the same template parameters as matrix as with matrix the first three template parameters are mandatory arraytypename scalar int rowsatcompiletime int colsatcompiletime the last three template parameters are optional since this is exactly the same as for matrix we wont explain it again here and just refer to the matrix class eigen also provides typedefs for some common cases in a way that is similar to the matrix typedefs but with some slight differences as the word array is used for both dimensional and dimensional arrays we adopt the convention that typedefs of the form arraynt stand for dimensional arrays where n and t are the size and the scalar type as in the matrix typedefs explained on this page for dimensional arrays we use typedefs of the form arraynnt some examples are shown in the following table type typedef arrayfloatdynamic arrayxf arrayfloat arrayf arraydoubledynamicdynamic arrayxxd arraydouble arrayd accessing values inside an array the parenthesis operator is overloaded to provide write and read access to the coefficients of an array just as with matrices furthermore the  operator can be used to initialize arrays via the comma initializer or to print them exampleoutput include eigendense

applying this recursively and performing the additions in parallel as well one obtains an algorithm that runs in θlog n time on an ideal machine with an infinite number of processors and has a maximum possible speedup of θnlog n on any real computer although the algorithm isnt practical a more practical variant achieves θn speedup it should be noted that some lower timecomplexity algorithms on paper may have indirect time complexity costs on real machines communicationavoiding and distributed algorithmsedit on modern architectures with hierarchical memory the cost of loading and storing input matrix elements tends to dominate the cost of arithmetic on a single machine this is the amount of data transferred between ram and cache while on a distributed memory multinode machine it is the amount transferred between nodes in either case it is called the communication bandwidth the naïve algorithm using three nested loops uses ωn communication bandwidth cannons algorithm also known as the d algorithm partitions each input matrix into a block matrix whose elements are submatrices of size √m by √m where m is the size of fast memory the naïve algorithm is then used over the block matrices computing products of submatrices entirely in fast memory this reduces communication bandwidth to on√m which is asymptotically optimal for algorithms performing ωn computation in a distributed setting with p processors arranged in a √p by √p d mesh one submatrix of the result can be assigned to each processor and the product can be computed with each processor transmitting on√p words which is asymptotically optimal assuming that each node stores the minimum onp elements this can be improved by the d algorithm which arranges the processors in a d cube mesh assigning every product of two input submatrices to a single processor the result submatrices are then generated by performing a reduction over each row this algorithm transmits onp words per processor which is asymptotically optimal however this requires replicating each input matrix element p times and so requires a factor of p more memory than is needed to store the inputs this algorithm can be combined with strassen to further reduce runtime d algorithms provide a continuous tradeoff between memory usage and communication bandwidth on modern distributed computing environments such as mapreduce
