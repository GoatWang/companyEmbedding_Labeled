sustainability award” at the th mena social impact and csr forum see all news opeds leveraging partnerships will be key to business success in   jan  interview with hussein hachem aramex ceo  will go down as one of the most unprecedented years in history from the uk’s decision to leave the eu to the presidential election in the united states there were historic political and economic upsets that caught many by surprise global markets and stock exchanges are still struggling to cope and as we enter the new year it is clear that  will also be challenging the one thing that has remained relatively constant in the midst of these unpredictable times is consumer demand while the world goes through fundamental changes the need for the efficient and effective movement of goods and services has not changed at aramex our focus has been to stay alert responsive and agile to meet these demands and we have succeeded why have we been able to navigate these turbulent times innovation in technology this has been the underlying reason why we have been able to keep pace with changing consumer preferences in  we launched our mobile app for consumers to improve our customers’ experience giving them the option to live track their package make inapp payments and schedule deliveries we also partnered with whatwords the global address system to reach more customers in offthegrid locations technology is ultimately behind every fundamental business decision we make and is critical to the growth of our ecommerce business and global footprint other companies have also leveraged technology to succeed with uber air bnb and uae company careem using platforms to aggregate data predict consumer behaviour and develop new and innovative products and services and while we can celebrate these achievements the harsh reality is that technological innovation is now essential if you are a business and want to compete having innovative technologies is no longer an option it is a requirement but as we move into an unpredictable  i believe the recipe for business success calls for a different order innovation in technology alone will no longer be enough to navigate the current environment  businesses must do more in my opinion businesses must pursue strategic partnerships while continuing to leverage innovative technologies we partnered with australia post this year to give us reach across all post offices worldwide partnerships are important because they give companies unique opportunities to further leverage their technologies such as longterm personal relationships with new business partners local market insights expanded product and service portfolios and even future business deals we aren’t the only company to have taken this idea on board careem recently partnered with the roads and transport authority and deliveroo to allow customers to book rta cars and order food through their app ironically technology has always played an important role in enabling communication as we wouldn’t often be able to connect with other companies without it yet in today’s environment pursuing synergistic partnerships also allows businesses to leverage technology more effectively today aramex exports our technologies to new business partners and integrates other business’ platforms into our operations new partnerships also make us more cost effective by outsourcing logistics services to third party suppliers who have the appropriate technologies in place our ecommerce platform has also benefitted from more partnerships with online shopping vendors who have the necessary technological hardware with all of this in mind one thing remains very clear companies are succeeding by disrupting their business models through innovation in technology but moving forward the key to more success in  will be how companies leverage strategic partnerships to help them adapt to global market uncertainty take advantage of innovative technologies and capitalize on opportunities for growth the author is hussein hachem ceo of aramex a leading global logistics and transportation solutions company in dubai view all opeds faq search
