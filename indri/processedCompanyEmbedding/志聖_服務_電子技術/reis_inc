next release » reis inc launches “transaction analytics™” for commercial property sales product empowers investors and portfolio managers to create custom commercial real estate sales trend and forecast analyses new york october   new yorkbusiness wirereis inc nasdaq reis today responded to the current banking and financial crisis by launching reis transaction analytics™ a tool that empowers commercial real estate investors and portfolio managers to identify sales and capital markets trends that are directly impacting the value of their assets the resulting precision supports more informed valuations and decisions with regard to troubled debt and associated commercial real estate collateral at a time when economic distress is prompting market participants to continually revalue their holdings transaction analytics™ frees investors and portfolio managers from a dependence on broader measures of real estate capital market activity such as the average cap rate in a metropolitan area which typically mask market volatility many portfolio managers and investors are used to relying on overall metro indications of value simply because that is what they have had to work with in the past said michael richardson reiss senior vice president of sales and marketing transaction analytics™ allows users to dig beneath the market averages for a closer look at the relevant trends in asset values for all of reiss metro areas and regions users of transaction analytics™ can obtain on demand a customized read on historical current and forecasted capital market conditions offering key measurements of sales transaction activity including mean median and month rolling cap rates total sales price price per unit or square foot and total transaction volume the user may refine this analysis by including only properties that meet specified sales transaction characteristics price or cap rate or physical characteristics size age or class all property level transactions are accessible within the module providing complete transparency transaction analytics™ unleashes the full power of the reis sales comparables database said reis product manager kevin varley at a time when there is a virtually unprecedented interest in all things real estate this module addresses the critical questions that influence the valuation of commercial properties reis has a deep tradition of helping its clients respond to crises with facts and data we helped the resolution trust corporation assign value to billions of dollars worth of troubled debt collateral in the early s since that

worked at reis fulltime more than a yearprosthe product is a market leader and is essential to many cre professionals daily workconsthe company is sadly losing what has made it great as sales have dropped off due to market saturation they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process this is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls and the results

termination morale is at an all time low with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible as the damage created is irreparableadvice to managementseek advice from your employees so many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most its so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce

collection of historical cre data that could be the foundation for solid company growth if an executive team were to be brought in that had the ability to lead innovate and motivate its employeesconsall of the executive leadership of the company have no presence in the industry completely lack leadership skills offer no strategic vision they consider minor long overdue product upgrades to be revolutionary new products and worst of all encourage a gossipy dreary infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation they prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events engage their customers and prospects and believe they are above listening to their employees rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failuresadvice to managementmy advice would be for the founding partners  your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change you have made numerous changes to your organization both individual contributors and middle management to no avail  at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them you need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your employees will respect and followshare on facebookshare on twittershare on whatsappshare via

success in fact management is completely unhelpful and overall employee morale is at an alltime low reis cares more about quantity over quality and does not instill any positive reinforcement into their employees not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality depth or accuracy at reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more did i mention our performance is based solely on the amount rather than any other factor doesnt make for a very accomplished feeling also the positive reviews on this site are from management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any true review like the one you are reading with a very untrue inaccurate

results for the first quarter of  has been impacted by  of revenue from a significant custom data deliverable in the first quarter of  which was not replicated in the  period offset by the effects of an improving renewal rate and continuing strong new business in order to provide insight into  and  relative performance we have disaggregated total revenue into two components subscription and

subscription revenue subscription revenue increased by approximately  or  from the first quarter of  to  it also grew on a consecutive quarter basis by  or  the two factors that have led to our modest subscription revenue growth to start  included  improvement in our trailing twelve month ttm renewal rates and  continued strong new business renewal rates  the companys improving renewal rates over the last three consecutive quarters has been raising its ttm renewal rates for the ttm ended march   the companys base renewal rate renewal rate excluding price increases was  and the renewal rate including price increases was  these rates represent an improvement over the comparable rates as of december   at which time the companys base renewal rate was  and the renewal rate including price increases was  reiss march   and december   ttm renewal rates continued to be negatively impacted by the cancellation of contracts primarily in the second quarter of  associated with reiss intellectual property ip compliance initiatives from customer losses from subscribers that exited the cre business and from aggressive repricing on contract expirations however the companys  quarterly renewal rate including price increases increased by  basis points during the  first quarter    table of contents many of the  cancellations involved contracts which had prior longterm unauthorized access to reis data and a substantial monetary settlement as reis worked through the renewal cycle of these older and more egregious cases of unauthorized usage our renewal rates for these compliance accounts and overall renewal rates began to improve in the second half of  and into the first quarter of  on a goingforward basis the prompt discovery of unauthorized usage allows for more satisfactory resolution typically by having the noncompliant entity enter into a marketrate subscription and without requiring a monetary settlement and the attendant illwill operationally in the latter half of  reis allocated senior account management and customer service resources to work with these accounts we believe that upgrading the onboarding and account management experience has contributed to improved renewal rates for these accounts and should continue to do so in the future on a goingforward basis management believes that the reduction in compliancerelated cancellations will help to restore our ttm renewal rates over time to be more in line with our historic levels in addition to cancellations of ip infringementrelated subscribers other factors combined to exert downward pressure on our ttm renewal rates in  which included  customer losses from subscribers that exited the cre business or were mergerrelated and  reiss aggressive stance on renewal pricing to ensure equitable alignment among subscribers as it relates to report consumption number of users propertytype and geographic coverage length of contract and the associated subscription fee among other factors aggressive repricing on contract expirations in the circumstances noted above also placed downward pressure on renewal rates during the first and second quarters of  although many firms were successfully repriced to levels consistent with their usage and value received price increases did lead to instances of cancellation as always competition is a factor both with respect to new accounts and renewals with existing subscribers we believe that our twopronged strategy of expanding our property types and geographic coverage and the addition of many more property records and granular propertylevel details has allowed reis to consolidate its leadership position among vendors of cre market data and analytics this assessment is supported by the significant increase in winbacks we experienced in  and in the first quarter of  especially as contracts expired between former subscribers and competitive vendors and these firms had the opportunity to return to reis without the expense associated with maintaining multiple vendors as a result of these focused efforts on the improvement of our renewal rates in the second half of  and in the first quarter of  we have realized significant positive momentum in the first quarter of  the companys base renewal rate rose to  and the renewal rate including price increases reached  a positive and promising trend of quarter to quarter improvement in contrast during the second quarter of  the companys quarterly renewal rates hit their recent quarterly lows at a base renewal rate of  and a renewal rate including price increases of  quarterly renewal rates increased to a base renewal rate of  and a renewal rate including price increases of  for the fourth quarter of  new business  the first quarter of  continued to build on the new business successes of the fourth quarter of  with sales that were directly tied to recent product improvements including sales of affordable housing within our existing customer base and wins associated with our expanded sales transaction database with investment sales brokers property tax appeal firms and tax assessors other revenue the companys other revenue includes nonsubscription revenue comprised of  nonsubscription custom data deliverables and  onetime settlements custom data deliverables  the company recognized significant revenue in the first quarter of  from a custom data deliverable for one of our existing reis se subscribers the revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom data files that was delivered in february  positively impacting results for the first quarter of  revenue related to this deliverable aggregated  in  all in the first quarter of  in  and through march   reis did not replicate similar custom data sales as we move forward into  management hopes to be able to identify opportunities to sell custom data files but structured as a subscription agreement with periodic quarterly updates in order to record revenue ratably consistent with how the company recognizes revenue for reis se  intellectual property settlements  reis continues to successfully resolve cases in which our intellectual property rights have been violated in  and  the company was very active in protecting its intellectual property by pursuing firms and individuals who had previously gained unauthorized access to our services the discovery of the instances of unauthorized usage creates opportunities for reiss compliance team to engage in productive conversations with firms regarding ongoing access to reis data in accordance with    table of contents the terms and conditions of a subscription agreement reis has developed a programmatic approach to promptly resolving cases of unauthorized usage and is devoting significant client services and account management resources to increase the renewal rates of ip infringement related accounts to levels typical of all other reis subscribers as a result of these compliance procedures the company has been able to generate revenue through either onetime settlement payments or by signing up the noncomplying firm or individual to an annual or multiyear reis se subscription revenue from onetime settlement payments aggregated  and  in the three months ended march   and  respectively although identified instances of noncompliance remains steady the frequency and dollar amount of onetime settlements can fluctuate each quarter as our compliance team continues to identify instances of unauthorized access the period of unauthorized usage is much shorter and report consumption is not as significant as cases that were settled in  and  management believes that compliance resolutions will yield a continuing and significant volume of subscription contracts and recurring revenue for the foreseeable future other items affecting revenue in order to increase the predictability of fees from our subscribers and reiss own revenue and cash flow we have made a concerted effort to encourage multiyear contracts when appropriate with terms of two or three years and in some cases four years at december   approximately  of our subscribers were in multiyear contracts for multiyear contracts the average life of multiyear contracts signed in each of the last three years was approximately  years there are significant benefits on a selective basis of multiyear contracts including locking in recurring subscription revenue for longer periods thereby improving our renewal rates and increasing the predictability of future revenues operationally multiyear contracts free up account management resources to focus on subscribers requiring a higher level of attention and upselling opportunities across our account base finally multiyear deals also insulate us from competitive pressures and increase the likeliness that reis data and analytics will become embedded in the work flow of our clients in accordance with gaap our revenue recognition policy is to record revenue ratably over the life of a subscriber contract therefore any increases in the price of the subscription after the first year of a multiyear contract are considered in the total amount being straightlined over the contract term if a multiyear contract includes pricing steps on and after the first anniversary there will be increasing cash flow from the contract but no growth in revenue during the subsequent years under that contract there has been and in the future can be resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a significant segment of our subscriber base under multiyear agreements deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract two balancesheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into reis servicess future financial performance deferred revenue which is a gaap basis accounting concept and is reported by the company on the consolidated balance sheet represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed andor received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period aggregate revenue under contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue under noncancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions or in the case of future custom reports or projects will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer provided no significant company obligations remain at any given date both deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract can be either positively or negatively influenced by  the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed  the quantity and timing of contracts that are multiyear and  the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multiyear contract which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year the following table reconciles deferred revenue to aggregate revenue under contract at march   and  respectively a comparison of these balances at march  of each year is more meaningful than a comparison to the december   balances as a greater percentage of renewals occur in the fourth quarter of each year and would distort the analysis    table of contents      march

decreases discussed above the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin was  for the first quarter of  net income for the three months ended march   was  a decrease of  or  from the first quarter  reported net income of  this decrease reflects the revenue decrease of  operating expense increases of  the effects of increased amortization expense in  in connection with database and website investments of  as well as from increased depreciation expense from the build out and furnishing of our new corporate headquarters which was completed in october  of  and an increase in other expenses of  offset by the decrease in the consolidated tax provision of  due to the recognition of a windfall tax benefit on stock options exercised in the  first quarter the company continues to make significant investments in our business including our core reis se platform and in our portfolio analytics offering as a result of these initiatives our employment related costs increased throughout  across all departments including strategic hires in sales and operations the pace of our database and website enhancements accelerated in  and into  management believes that the investments it has made in  and is continuing to make in  will further the differentiation between reis and other us commercial real estate market information providers reconciliations of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda we define ebitda as earnings net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and stock based compensation although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information which may assist investors in evaluating and understanding  the performance of the reis services segment the primary business of the company and  the companys consolidated results from year to year or period to period as applicable further these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization expenses as well as other nonoperating items such as interest income interest expense and income taxes and in the case of adjusted ebitda isolates noncash charges for stock based compensation management also believes that disclosing    table of contents ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector however because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated in accordance with gaap they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented both for the reis services segment and on a consolidated basis we believe that these metrics for reis services provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core reis services business excluding public company costs and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that standalone business to a potential acquirer management primarily monitors and measures its performance and is compensated based on the results of the reis services segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the companys common stock including expenses related to operating as a public company however investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income loss operating income or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of ebitda and adjusted
