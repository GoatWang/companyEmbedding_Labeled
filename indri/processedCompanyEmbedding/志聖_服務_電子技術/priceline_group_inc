parent the priceline group website wwwpricelinecom pricelinecom is an american company and a commercial website that helps users find discount rates for travelrelated purchases such as airline tickets and hotel stays the company is not a direct supplier of these services instead it facilitates the provision of travel services by its suppliers to its customers it is headquartered in norwalk connecticut united states pricelinecom is wholly owned by the priceline group priceline was founded by jay s walker who left the company in  hong kong company cheung kong holdings later purchased a significant portion of pricelines stock in  brett keller was named ceo of the pricelinecom brand contents  history  other services  spokespeople  william shatner  theresa caputo  kaley cuoco  criticisms  references  external links historyedit priceline first became known for its name your own price system where travelers would name their price for airline tickets hotel rooms car rentals and vacation packages while the purchaser can select a general location service level and price the hotel rental car company andor airline as well as the exact location of the hotel and the exact flight itinerary is disclosed only after the purchase has gone through with no rights to cancel pricelines cut of the proceeds is the difference between the price an individual named and the price charged by the service establishment more recently it has added a more traditional model called express dealswhere travelers are presented prices but are not told the name of the establishment travelers can still choose to name their price for airline tickets hotel rooms and rental cars the number of airlines hotels and car rental company participants in the name your own price program has increased as these suppliers utilize this opaque market priceline created to sell their perishable inventory without lowering prices through other traditional sales channels priceline now also sells discounted cruises as well as tours and attractions in  priceline licensed its name your own price travel system to ebay during november  priceline “permanently” eliminated all booking fees on published airfares in april  pricelinecom incorporated announced that it has changed its name to the priceline group inc this corporate name change was intended to create a clear delineation between the global priceline business now pricelinecom is one of six primary brands of the priceline group priceline announced in may  that it would invest an additional  million in chinese online travel company ctrip to tap the fastgrowing china market other servicesedit pricelinecom experimented with selling gasoline and groceries under the name your own price model in  at the height of the dotcom bubble through a partially owned affiliate webhouse club priceline got into the online auction business with priceline yard sales where individuals would use the priceline system to haggle for various secondhand items and trade them in person priceline sold long distance telephone service and automobiles under the name your own price model these experiments were terminated in  another experiment the name your own rate system for home loans continues under a license with everbank spokespeopleedit william shatneredit in  william shatner became the spokesman for pricelinecom agreeing to do the spots in exchange for stock in the company the arrangement turned out to be quite profitable for shatner who sold much of the stock shortly before its value plummeted in the dotcom bust and has since made approximately  million from pricelinecom this reported sum has been met with some skepticism from the financial press an early ad campaign featuring shatner had him belt out popular songs in spoken word in the style of his album the transformed man he was replaced in  by his star trek costar leonard nimoy shatner still appeared in spots for priceline running into nimoy as his replacement when that campaign ended shatner again became pricelines sole spokesperson in  an ad campaign by butler shine stern  partners had shatner take on the role of the priceline negotiator in commercials that began airing january   shatners negotiator character apparently dies as a bus falls off a bridge and explodes subsequent ads have featured his spirit still advertising pricelinecom from beyond the grave in august  shatner was brought back in a commercial located on a stormy cloudy beach parodying the end of the film point break a man apparently an investigator stands next to shatner shatner is holding a wooden surfboard wearing a suit with shortened pants and pitching the new way of booking a hotel he states that surfing is his life now and well see where the waves take me sayonara and goes charging into the waves priceline has been parodied on the tonight show by jay leno and in multiple saturday night live skits in a september  snl skit during the opening monologue by olympian michael phelps shatner rose from the audience to give phelps tips on product endorsementscitation needed theresa caputoedit in june  theresa caputo star of the television show long island medium appeared in a commercial for pricelinecom in which she portrayed herself connecting with the late priceline negotiator character previously played by william shatner however this commercial has sparked controversy since the commercial appears to make light of the native american belief of smudging jref president dj grothe released an open letter calling out pricelinecom for endorsing caputo stating it is difficult to watch the show and not feel heartbroken for those who are desperate to hear from the departed and even more so if they are being manipulated by a charlatan grothe urges pricelinecom to invite your new representative to take the james randi million dollar challenge and prove her credentials kaley cuocoedit in january  kaley cuoco from the sitcom the big bang theory joined william shatner as his fictitious daughter in pricelinecom commercials criticismsedit priceline does not include resort fee amounts in the bidding therefore its possible to win a bid for a hotel and then be forced to pay mandatory resort fees for example often  per night for resort hotels in las vegas priceline continues this practice despite a  warning to the industry from the federal trade commission ftc the ftc continues to state the following regarding how hotels and third parties should disclose such fees listing the “resort fee” near the quoted price or in the fine print — or referring to other fees that “may apply” — isn’t good enough priceline is one of the companies accused of using the services of wikipr a public relations firm specialized in editing of wikipedia that
