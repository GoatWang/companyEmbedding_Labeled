group business year  was absolutely a record year we achieved volume and sales growth in all sectors and thus continued our positive development of the past years group sales rose by  percent to dm million the consolidated financial statement shows a profit after taxes of dm  million the key basis for the positive development in recent years is the restructuring that was completed in  and implemented in a strategically effective manner beginning in the departure from a locationcentered port concept and concentration on logistics perspectives in networks have generated positive impacts for all subsidiaries and shareholdings of the blg logistics group our core competence logistics is given the greatest emphasis in blg international logistics through specialization in automotive logistics consumer goods and business electronics we serve growing sectors that basically favor our further development significant growth was attained in all sectors the focus of the services  percent of the volume was on automotive logistics which we also support worldwide and in europe through our shareholding dialog our main customers are daimlerchrysler vw and audi we act as the system provider for the production of these manufacturers in several projects in the meantime we have become an integral element and production partner for industry our large industrial facility in the bremen logistics center in which we harden and clean bonded body parts as well as our preservation facilities are currently unique for a logistics provider worldwide in the market segment of extremely advanced automotive logistics we have very few genuinely competent competitors though they give rise to fierce competition in the acquisition of new orders to round off international logistics and complete the chain of services we established a freight forwarding joint venture blg leschaco logistics gmbh bll bll launched operative business at the beginning of this year and has already processed a number of specific orders these business activities are supplemented by the recent establishment of blg leschaco logistics of south africa pty ltd with headquarters in johannesburg and branches in port elizabeth and east london one of the focal points of the services provided by our automotive logistics is in south africa foundation initiative as the board of management of bremer lagerhausgesellschaft we have decided that the company shall take part in the foundation initiative of the german industry entitled remembrance responsibility and the future organization organization  with over million finished vehicles blg automobile logistics again surpassed the record level of the previous year slightly and maintained its position as the market leader among european automobile ports the weak domestic demand which led to declining imports contrasted with a strong rise in exports the result in volume was additionally supported by substantially increasing business with used cars as well as in the high  heavy segment we responded to the changes in the automobile markets by establishing blg automobile logistics italia srl operation of the new auto terminal in gioia tauro commenced in september last year the objective is to set up a transshipment hub there for the entire mediterranean region the central location in this region offers the ideal basis for this in terms of transport geography as a transshipment center gioia tauro is a strategic investment in the future that will unfold its effect in the medium term the target handling volume is  vehicles a year the predominantly conventionally operating companies blg forest logistics and in particular blg project logistics benefited from the upswing in their respective markets last year the cargo handling volumes rose considerably and both companies achieved positive results however good returns on capital cannot be attained at present because of the market conditions and the resulting fierce competition our base in russia in the form of blg east european logistics represents a strategic move however the market holds considerable risks and development cannot yet be assessed reliably blg data services develops a new focal point of services in the modern ebusiness sector internet applications play a major role here this development is strengthened through shareholdings in two other companies changing the name of port and transport consulting bremen gmbh ptc to blg consult gmbh is linked to extension of our performance profile to include logistics and business development this broadens the business base of the company and will foster further development  organization blg coldstore logistics gmbh has been a new member of the group of  subsidiaries since the end of it was created out of bremerhavener kühlhäuser frigoscandia gmbh in which we held  percent of the shares the contracts with partner frigoscandia elapsed at the end of  and were not extended by mutual agreement blg coldstore logistics runs the cold store at the bremerhaven container terminal in spring  an annex was officially opened to strengthen our international presence we renamed the holding company blg logistics group ag  co kg we have been operating externally with this name for around two years the renaming of the company made improvement of the linguistic understanding in the international market official on the basis of commercial law in business year  development of the volume handled by the blg logistics group was also supported very strongly by container business on the basis of the high degree of containerization in maritime traffic in bremerhaven the cargo handled by the end of the year totaled nearly  million standard containers teu this corresponded to a growth rate of  percent over currently bremerhaven has the strongest growth among container ports in northern europe the joint venture eurogate performs a key function in the development of container transport under the roof of the blg logistics group departure from the traditional exclusively locationbased orientation clearly manifests itself in the successful development of this enterprise the cargo handling volume of the terminal network with its focal points in northern europe and in the mediterranean rose by  percent to around  million teu last year all locations recorded overproportional growth as far as the question of the location of a german deepwater port is concerned we welcome the location decision in favor of the jadeweserport made at the end of march this year wilhelmhaven s advantages are obvious we clearly preferred this location because of the existing nautical qualities with a water depth of meters and future development options with respect to the available areas furthermore we require additional terminal capacity by  at the latest due to strong growth at the container terminals in bremerhaven and hamburg including project stages ct iiia and ct iv bremerhaven will then be at full capacity utilization despite all the optimization measures wilhelmshaven is an ideal complement to our terminals in bremerhaven and hamburg in addition however further adaptation of the navigation channels in the outer weser and in the elbe is urgently necessary bremerhaven and hamburg have to be able to serve the large standard vessels operating in container transport independent of the tide for this reason we need a water depth of over  meters under chart datum organization organization   the success of the strategic development of the blg logistics group is very substantially based on our capability of forming alliances and acquiring shareholdings we will continue to pursue this course in a vigorous manner the fact that we are able to show impressive results for business year  is also due to the constructive cooperation with our works councils and in particular to the quality and commitment of our employees overall the year  was an extremely gratifying and successful business year for the corporate group this cannot be explained alone by the good conditional framework in the world economy and the resulting generally positive market development the blg logistics group and thus the ports of bremen and bremerhaven as well have grown to a significantly overproportional extent and achieved clear market share gains since the annual financial statement of bremer lagerhausgesellschaft aktiengesellschaft von  is decisive for the appropriation of net income we propose to the shareholders meeting in agreement with the board of directors that a dividend of eight percent be distributed furthermore it possible to make a special distribution to an amount of dm  per share for business year it results from the corporate tax credit of the company which is paid out on the basis of the conditions that have changed through the tax reform in order to secure the assets for the company and its shareholders we thank our shareholders for the trust they place in the company we are convinced that we will be able to justify this trust in full through continued successful development in the future as well  organization report of the board of directors the board of directors has followed and supported the development of blg bremer lagerhausgesellschaft aktiengesellschaft von  the blg logistics group ag  co kg and its shareholdings at five meetings in business year  and performed the tasks for which it is responsible according to law and the bylaws in full the body placed emphasis on the strategic orientation which is primarily expressed in new shareholdings and changes in the shareholding relationships key factors included the establishment of blg automobile logistics italia and the building of the new auto terminal in gioia tauro the establishment of the joint venture bll blg leschaco logistics to expand the profile of logistics services of blg international logistics and the formation of blg coldstore logistics as a hundred percent subsidiary of the blg logistics group the board of directors additionally dealt intensively with development in the individual divisions with mediumterm corporate planning as well as with riskconscious corporate control the board of management informed the body regularly and comprehensively both in writing and orally of the development of the earnings and financial situation as well as all major business transactions the following committees exist in the board of directors personnel committee balance sheet committee and mediation committee in

treuhandgesellschaft reifenrath  co wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft steuerberatungsgesellschaft bremen the auditing firm selected by the shareholders meeting for the annual audit took part in the

and the works council for the successful work they performed in business year  and explicitly extends its recognition of the efforts made by the employees of the blg group bremen june  the board of directors josef hattig chairman global view  organization  group management report economic background the blg logistics group with its core competencies is involved in the international market as an efficient provider of logistics services the worldwide procurement production and sales strategies of large companies that are required due to globalization depend on logistically reliable operational processes supply chains the blg group with its service focal points has successfully established itself in this new and growing worldwide market this is reflected in the significant growth of the company the official renaming of the management holding company blg bremer lagerhaus gesellschaft ag  co to blg logistics group ag  co kg blg logistics group initiated in  gives consideration to the expansive international commitment of the blg group bremer lagerhausgesellschaft aktiengesellschaft von  which is quoted on the stock exchange operates unchanged as general partner and manager of the management holding company blg logistics group kg limited partnership the city of bremen also remains sole limited partner of the holding company the leading economic institutes have adjusted their forecasts for the current year downwards with respect to growth of the world economy and economic development in germany and europe the declining trends in the usa and japan are explicitly mentioned as the reason for this international development the eu commission therefore forecasts weak growth of  percent for the world economy and  percent for the european union this year in its assessment of april growth of  percent is predicted for the german economy the effects of the forecast development were not observed in the business activities of the blg logistics group in the st quarter of all business fields remained on a solid growth course since we develop our business activities in the international market however impairments for the further course of the year cannot be ruled out due to the general economic development group management report group management report  business development group sales increased by  percent to dm million in business year with a total volume of goods of  million tons of general cargo  percent growth was achieved at the logistics centers and terminals of the blg group the dynamic and expansive development of the group is based on the restructuring that was completed in it provides the corporate basis according to commercial law for consistent implementation of the new corporate strategy which is expressed particularly in logistic alliances joint ventures and cooperation an excellent example of how the company has pursued its strategic course is the bremen hamburg joint venture eurogate which was established with headquarters in bremen in  on the basis of the container activities of blg bremen and those of eurokai hamburg as a result the traditional location concept was transformed into a modern and marketoriented network strategy with a european dimension the significantly overproportional growth at all locations is evidence of the effectiveness of the network strategy also in container business another example is the establishment of an automobile terminal in gioia tauro in southern italy in business year the two partners blg automobile logistics  and contship italia  jointly established for this purpose blg automobile logistics italia srl modelled after bremerhaven as a hub for international trade with finished vehicles in northern europe gioia tauro will perform a comparable function for the entire mediterranean region in the medium term the terminal in gioia tauro launched operations in september group management report the extension of the performance profile is supplemented by the recent takeover of a technical center for technical services on vehicles in bremerhaven as a consequence we have gained a major additional competence in the automobile sector that we can also make use of at the new terminal in gioia tauro through this takeover the workforce of the blg logistics group has increased by around  employees also of great importance for the development of the vertical range of logistics service is the establishment of the freight forwarding company blg leschaco logistics gmbh bll bremen the company started up operative business at the beginning of bll is a joint venture of blg international logistics and the renowned bremerhaven freight forwarding group lexzau scharbau gmbh  co the objective of this newly established enterprise is to round off blg s chain of logistics services in the meantime bll has its own branch office in south africa ie blg leschaco logistics of south africa pty ltd with headquarters in johannesburg and branches in east london and port elizabeth furthermore there were other shareholdings takeovers and changes in the shareholding relationships in business year  as well as in the course of this year this will be examined in more detail in the segment reporting of this business report the positive development of results in the blg group was continued in business year  with a substantial rise in the surplus in the group s profit and loss account over the previous year the result also benefited from the unique opportunity of realizing a corporate tax credit to the amount of around dm  million which we would like to pass on to our shareholders in the form of a special distribution overall the year  was an extraordinarily successful business year the blg logistics group and thus the ports of bremen and bremerhaven as well have undergone overproportionate growth and attained significant gains in market shares this is also clearly reflected in the financial result of our corporate group group management report group management report  risks of future development for the blg group responsible handling of possible risks from operative activities on the part of our subsidiaries is an integral part of corporate action and an essential basis for all strategic decisions to achieve our goals the broad spectrum of our logistics service processes requires early identification of potential threats this is done within the framework of continuous risk controlling as well as risk management and reporting that are appropriate to the corporate structure in the framework of the established control and monitoring systems operational risks are identified and assessed systematically according to the requirements of kon trag law on control and transparency within businesses at all levels of performance and responsibility special focus here is placed on maintaining functional it systems and their continuous further development the use of reliable software as well as the selection and training of qualified personnel are major elements of our risk management system at the same time the organizational structure of our group guarantees a flexible response to changes in conditions in the world economy and sectorspecific developments at all times the formulation of risk policy principles and resultoriented control of the total risk are the responsibility of the board of management of blg ag the board of management regularly informs the board of directors on riskrelevant decisions with respect to proper compliance with its corporate responsibility our internal auditing department is integrated into risk communication within the blg group as a monitoring body independent of processes thanks to intensive preparation and successful adjustment of our administrative and operative systems the move into the new millennium was completed successfully in all divisions  group management report the euro will be introduced in the blg group as the group currency on january  the necessary system adjustments are currently being intensively prepared by a project group assigned groupwide according to an overall analysis no risks are seen for the current situation or the future development of our company at present rather the solid financial endowment and our established position in the worldwide logistics market offer good prospects of successful continuation of our initiated growth strategy however we are indirectly exposed to the respective risk environment of the blg companies through our subsidiaries on the basis of the corporate structure therefore burdens may result due to legal or contractual liability relationships at the beginning of the new business year the bremen port authority transformed the dock charges previously charged under public law into private charges and transferred the related charges due to repair and maintenance as well as dock use to the individual port companies involved this change in law as well as the intensifying competition between the port locations in northern europe may indeed have an influence on the profit situation in our core activities ie cargo handling and storage competition with competing ports has substantially increased for automobile transshipment in bremerhaven in business year we respond to this development with marketoriented and comprehensive logistics services that ensure strong customer loyalty in the automotive logistics segment the automobile manufacturers whose numbers are declining worldwide tend to be subjected to economic fluctuations and possibly shorter product life cycles with growing cost pressure at the same time the persistent process of concentration in the automobile industry with its impacts on competition and the price structure for comprehensive logistics services will continue to represent a major challenge for this division in future group management report group management report  the future development of our joint venture eurogate is affected by an increase in consortium agreements between shipping companies with relatively short terms of contract for container handling the creation and utilization of additional cargo handling capacity in hamburg will lead to increased competitive pressure on the german container terminals in the medium term due to the natural growth in volume resulting from the increase in international flows of goods and farreaching enhancement of efficiency in vessel clearance however another improvement in results is forecast for business year  by the management our globally oriented growth strategy involves targeted investments in selected markets and technologies as well as in permanent expansion of the performance profiles of our subsidiaries and provision of the necessary resources as in all forwardlooking commitments imponderables in the achievement of mediumterm goals cannot be completely ruled out outlook since the transport and logistics needs increase more rapidly than production against the background of the continuing process of globalization considerably higher growth rates may continue to be realized in the sector than in the world economy as a whole this also applies in particular to the blg logistics group which demonstrates through its overproportional growth that with its successful strategy and performance profile it belongs to the top group in the sector however euphoric expectations cannot be justified leaps in growth and top results as in business year  with a growth of over  percent in the volume of goods and a doubling of the group profit cannot be repeated this year despite all efforts the quantitative development will also show its effects in the financial result based on the volume of goods the expectation of achieving a twodigit growth rate is certainly realistic however  group management report reporting according to segments in accordance with section   sentence  of the german commercial code hgb the following information is provided

acceptance on the part of the established shipping companies has led to onschedule development of the new terminal     group management report   automotive logistics consumer goods business electronics the expansive corporate strategy of blg international logistics was successfully continued in business year  with significant sales growth the business volume for logistics services was able to be increased for nonfood articles through quantitative growth resulting from positive development of the domestic market and for business electronics through newly acquired business in automotive logistics the positive business trend was supported by the rising markets in south africa and south america as well as by the high demand for the new c class model from daimlerchrysler after the change in model of the mercedes c class consolidation logistics for worldwide parts supply started up on schedule in the further course of the year the vertical range of services developed to such an overproportionate extent that the planned sales volume was surpassed in autumn consolidation and parts supply were taken over as a further service segment for production in brazil through the launch of parts logistics for the new c class productionrelated functions were integrated into the service process by applying new technologically more sophisticated preservation techniques for unfinished components thus extending the vertical range of services in addition a technical facility for hardening bonded unfinished components was incorporated for worldwide supply of daimlerchrysler assembly plants so the vertical range of services was expanded towards the production sector  group management report  group management report  to supplement inhouse business activities blg leschaco

need  employees were taking part in vocational training investments were not only made in enhancement of efficiency and quality but above all in the expansion of logistics service capacity the investments primarily consisted of extensions at the logistics center bremen in the form of a new building with an area of  square meters including an office building  group management report the worldwide growth in the automotive logistics market is strengthened by the decentralization of production locations of the automobile industry for blg international logistics as a renowned provider of holistic highly intelligent logistics system chains with a pronounced vertical range of services and extensive provision of resources there are very good prospects of expanding existing business and acquiring new business thus the objective is to continue the expansive course and strengthen the international presence a holding company was established in east london in spring  as the basis for

the sepetiba container terminal brazil the performance profile of the group goes far beyond the operation of container terminals and includes intermodal networking via rail road and sea as well as contract logistics and freight forwarding activities in container business container depots repair and packing enterprises in addition highly qualified technical services are offered for inhouse and affiliated companies of the group as well as for external customers  group management report  group management report   teu      the commitment with north sea terminal bremerhaven gmbh  co ntb which is run as a joint venture by eurogate and maersk deutschland gmbh is part of the eurogate group the alliance already existed with the former blg container gmbh  co and was integrated into the new corporate group through the establishment of eurogate ntb operates container terminal iii in bremerhaven independently through the ntb joint venture the largest container shipping company in the world has made a longterm commitment to bremerhaven and gives the location strong positive impulses the strong growth in bremerhaven urgently necessitates expansion of cargo handling capacity with the two planned project stages ct iiia and ct iv by the year  in order not to jeopardize further development at this location the two measures would increase the number berths by  to a total of  for large container vessels however this capacity expansion will be fully utilized by the end of this decade at the latest this applies with average growth rates between seven and eight percent which are forecast for longterm world container traffic higher growth rates as currently would lead to an even earlier exhaustion of terminal capacity the situation in hamburg is similar there too the expansion potential of the eurogate terminal is limited and will also be exhausted towards the end of this decade particularly in view of current growth this applies to both locations even with consistent implementation of all conceivable optimization measures and productivity improvements the ideal complement to bremerhaven and hamburg in the long run is the construction of the jadeweserport which has now been decided on ie the new german deepwater container terminal in wilhelmshaven agreement on this was reached by the mayors of bremen and hamburg together with the minister president of lower saxony at the end of march this year  group management report bremen and hamburg link their decision in favor of construction of the jadeweserport to the demand that the container terminals at both locations be further expanded and the navigation channels in the elbe and outer weser be deepened again by  meters to over  meters below chart datum and this must be done prior to completion of the jadeweserport this is important for maintaining competitiveness because vessels with a cargo capacity of up to  teu are already standard size in container traffic the ships have to be able to call at the large container gateways in bremerhaven and hamburg at any time independent of the tide the eurogate group has a total of  employees of whom  are employed in bremen bremerhaven and hamburg in addition there are  ghb employees on a daily average the business risks facing eurogate are very closely connected to the question of whether the foreseeable capacity bottlenecks can be countered in time through rapid expansion of the terminals and adjustment of the navigation channels another factor is the competitive behavior of the european port operators who compete very strongly via the price and thus initiate corresponding impacts not only on their own business results however this risk is not very great in view of the complex performance profile of eurogate and the related high degree of competitiveness the further development of the eurogate group of course primarily depends on the demand in the international container shipping sector twodigit growth rates cannot be repeated at will in this market overall however eurogate s market position absolutely justifies optimistic forecasts therefore mediumterm planning not only assumes a substantial growth in volume but also a positive development of results group management report group management report  services the services segment encompasses the service companies that do not conduct operative business
