 software maintenance processes  categories of maintenance in isoiec   maintenance factors  see also  references  further reading  external links historyedit software maintenance and evolution of systems was first addressed by meir m lehman in  over a period of twenty years his research led to the formulation of lehmans laws lehman  key findings of his research include that maintenance is really evolutionary development and that maintenance decisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems and software over time lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time as they evolve they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is taken to reduce the complexity in the late s a famous and widely cited survey study by lientz and swanson exposed the very high fraction of lifecycle costs that were being expended on maintenance they categorized maintenance activities into four classes adaptive – modifying the system to cope with changes in the software environment dbms os  perfective – implementing new or changed user requirements which concern functional enhancements to the software corrective – diagnosing and fixing errors possibly ones found by users  preventive – increasing software maintainability or reliability to prevent problems in the future  the survey showed that around  of the maintenance effort was on the first two types and error correction consumed about  many subsequent studies suggest a similar magnitude of the problem studies show that contribution of end user is crucial during the new requirement data gathering and analysis and this is the main cause of any problem during software evolution and maintenance so software maintenance is important because it consumes a large part of the overall lifecycle costs and also the inability to change software quickly and reliably means that business opportunities are lost    importance of software maintenanceedit the key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical key management issues are alignment with customer priorities staffing which organization does maintenance estimating costs key technical issues are limited understanding impact analysis testing maintainability measurement software maintenance is a very broad activity that includes error correction enhancements of capabilities deletion of obsolete capabilities and optimization because change is inevitable mechanisms must be developed for evaluation controlling and making modifications so any work done to change the software after it is in operation is considered to be maintenance work the purpose is to preserve the value of software over the time the value can be enhanced by expanding the customer base meeting additional requirements becoming easier to use more efficient and employing newer technology maintenance may span for  years whereas development may be  yearscitation needed software maintenance planningedit an integral part of software is the maintenance one which requires an accurate maintenance plan to be prepared during the software development it should specify how users will request modifications or report problems the budget should include resource and cost estimates a new decision should be addressed for the developing of every new system feature and its quality objectives the software maintenance which can last for – years or even decades after the development process calls for an effective plan which can address the scope of software maintenance the tailoring of the post deliverydeployment process the designation of who will provide maintenance and an estimate of the lifecycle costs the selection of proper enforcement of standards is the challenging task right from early stage of software engineering which has not got definite importance by the concerned stakeholders software maintenance processesedit this section describes the six software maintenance processes as the implementation process contains software preparation and transition activities such as the conception and creation of the maintenance plan the preparation for handling problems identified during development and the followup on product configuration management the problem and modification analysis process which is executed once the application has become the responsibility of the maintenance group the maintenance programmer must analyze each request confirm it by reproducing the situation and check its validity investigate it and propose a solution document the request and the solution proposal and finally obtain all the required authorizations to apply the modifications the process considering the implementation of the modification itself the process acceptance of the modification by confirming the modified work with the individual who submitted the request in order to make sure the modification provided a solution the migration process platform migration for example is exceptional and is not part of daily maintenance tasks if the software must be ported to another platform without any change in functionality this process will be used and a maintenance project team is likely to be assigned to this task finally the last maintenance process also an event which does not occur on a daily basis is the retirement of a piece of software there are a number of processes activities and practices that are unique to maintainers for example transition a controlled and coordinated sequence of activities during which a system is transferred progressively from the developer to the maintainer service level agreements slas and specialized domainspecific maintenance contracts negotiated by maintainers modification request and problem report help desk a problemhandling process used by maintainers to prioritize documents and route the requests they receive categories of maintenance in isoiec edit eb swanson initially identified three categories of maintenance corrective adaptive and perfective these have since been updated and isoiec  presents corrective maintenance reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems adaptive maintenance modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment perfective maintenance modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability preventive maintenance modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults there is also a notion of predeliveryprerelease maintenance which is all the good things you do to lower the total cost of ownership of the software things like compliance with coding standards that includes software maintainability goals the management of coupling and cohesion of the software the attainment of software supportability goals sae ja ja and ja for example note also that some academic institutionswho are carrying out research to quantify the cost to ongoing software maintenance due to the lack of resources such as design documents and systemsoftware

simon evans facebook share twitter tweet email googleplus linkedin reddit more programmed maintenance managing director chris sutherland predicts a wave of outsourcing of labour by australian companies in a lowergrowth economy and as an enlarged company with annual revenues of  billion following a buyout of rival skilled group programmed is better positioned to snare a large chunk of that workmr sutherland will run the merged entity from his perth headquarters even though skilled shareholders will end up holding  per cent of the group after the skilled board agreed to a sweetened buyout offer which values skilled shares at  each five months after rejecting original overtures share share on facebook share share on twitter tweet link skilled group was swallowed by programmed in a  millionplus merger in october  photo louie douvis the merged entity will have a market capitalisation of more than  million and will likely make its way into the spasx  index which should provide an added boost to its share price programmed has  direct employees while skilled employs more than  people a year under labour hire agreements mr sutherland said the merger made sense at a time when australian companies are looking to trim costs and seeking partnerships with strong local labour hire entities with a robust balance sheetclearly there are businesses out there looking at their own cost structures he told fairfax media the merger was officially announced on wednesday morning after both companies went into a trading halt on mondaygeographical spread programmed derives  per cent of its revenues from its home state of western australia and the merger will help spread the geographic and industry risk as the mining and oil and gas sectors suffer a serious capital investment strike advertisement the combined entity will generate  per cent of total revenues from mining and oil and gas and  per cent from government and infrastructure contracts mr sutherland predicts there will be more mergers in the labour hire industry in part because of the rising costs of information technology spending to run labour hire firms efficientlybut he will focus on integrating the two firms and pulling out  million in synergies in the first  months and  million over three years programmed will stay out of the next wave of mergers i think ive got more than enough on my plate he says

rejecting the first offer was a good result for its shareholders and he is pragmatic about leaving after such a short time im the one that got the holiday the job here is not about job protection he told fairfax media mr mckay  is a former chief financial officer of beer maker fosters groupskilled which was known as skilled engineering when it first listed on the asx in  was set up by frank hargrave in  he was a selfemployed electrician and a pioneer in outsourcing the services of skilled tradesmen his mantra in those early days was to keep your head down and your arse up a comment he repeated in  in an interview with fairfax media when he stepped down to let his son greg become the chief executiveskilled shareholders will receive  programmed shares plus ¢ in cash the deal values the business skilled at around  million with programmeds market capitalisation at  million prior to a trading halt on monday the share prices of both companies increased on wednesday when they emerged from the halt the first offer from programmed was pitched at  programmed shares and ¢ for each skilled sharethe deal which is being done via a scheme of arrangement ends  years of skilled group being a separately listed company on the asx clearly there are businesses out there looking at their own cost structures chris sutherland programmed maintenance skilled has been able to demand a better deal after originally sending programmed packing in january this year after it first came knocking with merger overtures in december last year that original offer by programmed was pitched at  programmed shares and ¢ for each skilled shareregulars on the brw rich  list its been a wild ride for skilled its own ups and downs have many similarities with the broader australian economy as the demand for contract labour now shrinks in resources frank hargrave who handed over the reigns as chief executive to son greg in  always had a pragmatic approach befitting his early days as a sparkyin those first few years you just kept your head down and your arse up frank hargrave told the age in an interview in  when he retired from the businessi started out as a yearold kid with just  quid in the bank he said at the timethe hargrave family were regulars on the brw rich  list and depending on the skilled share price their fortune was as high as  million just a few years ago it had been trimmed to an
