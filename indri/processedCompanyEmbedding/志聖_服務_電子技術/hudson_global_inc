hudson yards area is bordered on the east by seventh and eighth avenues on the south by west th and th streets on the north by west rd street and on the west by hudson river park and the hudson river in  the new york city department of city planning issued a master plan that envisioned the creation of  million square feet of commercial and residential development two corridors of open space – one between eleventh avenue and tenth avenue and another network of open space between ninth avenue and tenth avenue to create a park system from west th street to west th street portions of which would be located along the dyer avenuelincoln tunnel expressway corridors the citys plan was similar to a neighborhood plan produced by architect meta brunzema and environmental planner daniel gutman for the hells kitchen neighborhood association hkna the main concept of the hkna plan was to allow major new development while protecting the existing residential core area between ninth and tenth avenues aerial view of location of the hudson yards area including the rail yard in the foreground the javits center on the upper left and the blocks between tenth and eleventh avenues up to rd street to help facilitate development the citys plan called for an extension of the    trains to a th street subway station under eleventh avenue adjacent to the jacob k javits convention center to fund the subway and a park and boulevard and other infrastructure the city proposed a novel taxincrement financing scheme within a hudson yards financing district to collect both residential property taxes and commercial paymentsinlieuoftaxes pilots and sell transferable development rights to prospective developers a hudson yards infrastructure corporation would issue bonds against expected revenues in january  the new york city council approved the block rezoning including the eastern portion of the west side yard the newly rezoned hudson yards area was to have  square feet  m of class a office space  housing units two million square feet  m of hotel space a seat public school one million square feet  m of retail and more than  acres  ha of public open space the rezoning and financing district did not include the western portion of the rail yard which was reserved for the proposed west side stadium to be built for the new york jets and new york city bid for the  summer olympics in june  the stadium proposal was defeated after the city rezoned the western rail yard and added it to the financing district the metropolitan transportation authority mta sought to develop the acre  ha yard in conjunction with the city the mta issued a request for proposal rfp for a  square feet  m mixeduse development to be built on platforms over the rail yard which would remain in use throughout rail yard developmentedit five developers responded to the rfp extell tishman speyer brookfield vornado and the related companies tishman speyer won the bid in march  tishman speyer entered into a year lease with the mta paying  billion for the air rights it would also spend another  billion for development over the rail yards including for the two platforms over the yards to support  acres  ha of public spaces four office buildings and ten highrise residential towers developers original conception of the rail yard development  current plan for eastern portion of rail yard  however just two months later the deal broke down due to the lates financial crisis not much later the mta chose the related companies and goldman sachs to develop hudson yards under the same conditions in december  the new york city council approved related companies revised plan for hudson yards and the western portion of the west side yard was rezoned following the rail yards successful rezoning the mta signed another year lease to the air rights over the rail yard in may  the air rights were signed over to a joint venture of related companies and oxford properties group which invested  million to build a platform above both the eastern and western portions of the yard on which to construct the buildings groundbreaking for  hudson yards the first building occurred on december   in april  the relatedoxford joint venture obtained a  million construction loan from parties including barry sternlichts starwood capital group and luxury retailer coach the financing deal was unique in several aspects including the fact that it included a construction mezzanine loan that coach was a lender on both the debt and equity sides and that the mta helped create the severable lease structure that allowed for the loans a portion of the project was also financed by the eb investment program which uses capital from immigrants who become eligible for a green card redevelopment progressedit financingedit the city had originally projected to receive  million from property sales by september  but only half the amount came in consequently the city has had to allocate  million since  to pay off debt but developers have paid the city  million since july  twice the debt service during that period the pace has quickened in recent years with  buildings built or under construction in the area from  to june  indicating an improving balance sheet subway extensionedit main article  subway extension the new subway station in sept  after the hudson yards project was approved in  the mta
