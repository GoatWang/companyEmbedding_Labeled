or technology for example software created in the united states is subject to these regulations even if duplicated and packaged abroad in some circumstances an oral presentation containing technical data made to foreign nationals in the united states or access by foreign nationals to certain technology may constitute a controlled export the legal department can provide you with guidance on which countries are prohibited destinations for servicesource products or whether a proposed technical presentation or the provision of controlled technology to foreign nationals may require a us government

payment violates any applicable law rule or regulation the laws and rules governing such offers payments and gifts are complex moreover the penalties for violations may be quite severe you must consult the legal department before offering giving or providing anything of value to any person who may be a government official an increasing number of countries not only prohibit improper offers gifts or payments to their own officials but also to officials of other countries in connection with commercial transactions for example as discussed further below the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa is a criminal statute that prohibits us companies and persons as well as nonus companies and persons under certain circumstances from corruptly offering promising paying or authorizing the offer or payment directly or indirectly of anything of value to a foreign official to influence that official to misuse his or her office or to gain an improper advantage to obtain or retain business or direct business to anyone in some instances servicesource could be held liable for offers or payments made by its third party agents or consultants the penalties for violating the fcpa are severe and potentially devastating to both the company and the individuals involved regardless of whether an offer or payment violates the fcpa or other similar law or rule you may not offer any payment or business amenity to a public official or government employee if doing so could be construed as having any connection with the servicesources business even if the item has only a nominal value or no value at all what may be permissible in dealing with commercial enterprises may be deemed illegal and possibly criminal in dealing with government entities contact the legal department for guidance the foreign corrupt practices act while we do not expect every person in servicesource to become an expert in the fcpa we do expect every employee to adhere to servicesources ethical standards to be cognizant of the fcpa and other applicable laws that prohibit improper offers or payments to government officials or others and to seek guidance from the legal department whenever any uncertainty regarding those laws or standards arises departures from our business standards will not be tolerated the information set forth below is intended to provide our directors officers and employees with
