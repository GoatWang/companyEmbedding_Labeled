follows a management function which tabulates public attitudes defines the policies procedures and interests of an organization followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance however when lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the united transit commission he said i have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what i do in  historian eric goldman noted that the definition of public relations in websters would be disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field according to bernays the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness furthermore he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support in august  the world assembly of

consider the establishment of the publicity bureau in  to be the founding of the public relations profession however academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations during the settling of the new world and during the movement to abolish slavery in england basil clark is considered the founder of public relations in the united kingdom for his establishment of editorial services in  propaganda was used by the united states the united kingdom germany and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the world wars which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector most historians believe public relations became established first in the us by ivy lee or edward bernays then spread internationally many american companies with pr departments spread the practice to europe when they created european subsidiaries as a result of the marshall plan the second half of the s is considered the professional development building era of public relations trade associations pr news magazines international pr agencies and academic principles for the

professionals is changing because of the shift from traditional to online media many pr professionals are finding it necessary to learn new skills and to understand how social media can affect a brands reputation tacticsedit public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance primarily to the media public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders according to dr jacquie l’etang from queen margaret university public relations professionals can be viewed as discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing rhetorical strategies to achieve managerial aims specific public relations disciplines include financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy consumerlifestyle public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service crisis communication – responding in a crisis internal communications – communicating within the company itself government relations – engaging government departments to influence public policy media relations – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business celebrity public relations− promotion of a celebrity to various media publications and outlets foodcentric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods beverages and wine building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations after a public relations practitioner has been working in the field they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset especially for those in media relations within each discipline typical activities include publicity events speaking opportunities press releases newsletters blogs social media press kits and outbound communication to members of the press video and audio news releases vnrs and anrs are often produced and distributed to tv outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content audience targetingedit a fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the target audience and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages these messages however should be relevant to each other thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems low visibility lack of public understanding opposition from critics and insufficient support from funding sources on the other hand stakeholder theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue all audiences are stakeholders or presumptive stakeholders but not all stakeholders are audiences for example if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease the charity and the people with the disease are stakeholders but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations market positioning and branding they are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them messagingedit messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around a product person company or service messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will in still doubt in their purchasing choices or other decisions that affect the company brands aim to have the same problem statement industry viewpoint or brand perception shared across sources and media social media marketingedit main article digital marketing digital marketing is the use of internet tools and technologies such as search engines web  social bookmarking new media relations blogging and social media marketing interactive pr allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public customers and prospects pr practitioners have always relied on the media such as tv radio and magazines to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades lister et al said that digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place pr professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before for instance cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another they are also used for online shopping dating learning and getting the most up to date news around the world as digital technology has evolved the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved the public relations society of america which has been developing pr strategies since  identified  steps to measure online public relations effectiveness engagement measure the number of people who engaged with an item social shares likes and comments impressions measure the number of people who may have viewed an item items measure any content blog posts articles etc that originally appeared as digital media mentions measure how many online items mention the brand organization or product reach measure how far the pr campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience other techniquesedit litigation public relations is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall reputation haggerty  ethicsedit public relations professionals both serve the publics interest and private interests of businesses associations nonprofit organizations and governments this dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values this conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations in  the public relations society of america prsa responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics advocacy – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline the field of public relations is generally highly unregulated but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations the chartered institute of public relations the public relations society of america and the institute of public relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code still edelmans  semiannual trust survey found that only  percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility they seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policymaking role on the other hand marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing according to scott cutlip the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate spinedit main article spin public relations spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public but since the s has shifted to describing a polishing of the truth today spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are within the field of public relations spin is seen as a derogatory term interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called spin doctors in stuart ewen’s pr a social history of spin he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force he claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages the techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions cherry picking the socalled nondenial denial phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths euphemisms for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful and ambiguity in public statements another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news negativeedit see also negative campaigning negative public relations also called dark public relations dpr and in some earlier writing black pr is a process of destroying the targets reputation andor corporate identity the objective in dpr is to discredit someone else who may pose a threat to the clients business or be a political rival dpr may rely on it security industrial espionage social engineering and competitive intelligence common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target producing misleading facts to fool a competitor in politics a decision to use negative pr is also known as negative campaigning public relations are frequently just recycled information used by a plethora of sources thus giving way to minimal perspectives regarding events politics and civil societyedit in propaganda  bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy in public relations lobby groups are created to influence government policy corporate policy or public opinion typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization in fact bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses’ which include our behavior political and economic spheres or our morals in theory each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues however in practice it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence this is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale when a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base it is known as a front group front groups are a form of astroturfing because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests they create a fake grassroots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public when they actually serve their sponsors politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views policies and even personalities to their best
