freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for

easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples

industry quick take business outsourcing company genpact limited g has acquired insurance claim processing firm onsource for an undisclosed sum onsource has developed a claims inspection system that

vehicle property scene and other the company provides three separate products on demand field service self service instant inspection acquisition terms and rationale neither company disclosed the transaction amount or terms genpact did not file an k for the deal and did not indicate any change in guidance as a result of the transaction so it appears that the amount paid was not material to genpact’s financial condition given genpact is a nearly  billion market cap company it likely paid less than  million for the deal as of genpact’s most recent results it had  million in cash and equivalents and  billion in total liabilities genpact is in the middle of a transformation from a bpo firm to a valueadded aidriven firm of which the recent launch of its cora platform is the latest evidence its acquisition of onsource’s inspectionasaservice iaas will be folded into the cora system will provide additional capabilities to genpact’s claims management system and ‘will allow carriers to seamlessly write accurate estimates and manage supplements in a much quicker and more collaborative manner resulting in significantly higher customer satisfaction’ as part of genpact onsource’s system will therefore be marketed to genpact’s existing customer bases as well as providing an added offering to sell to prospective customers as tim schneider ceo of onsource stated in the deal announcement with genpacts comprehensive claims management capabilities we are excited to join the team to deploy our products for many more insurance carriers we know that the industry is ready for these capabilities and the traction of our digital inspection product proves that it drives significant efficiencies for carriers and exceeds customer expectations in the claims and preinsurance inspection processes assuming genpact didn’t overpay for the deal the addition of onsource’s mobilefirst system will build on its endtoend claims processing value proposition for the insurance
