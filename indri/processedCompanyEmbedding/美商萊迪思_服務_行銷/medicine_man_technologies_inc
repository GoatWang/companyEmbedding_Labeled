technologies of   the medical futurist skip to content top  new medical technologies of  top  new medical technologies of  every year i publish my predictions for the coming year as the medical futurist i’m expected to come up with bright visions and i’m happy to rise to the challenge last year my predictions included a digital tattoo portable diagnostic devices thanks to the xprize challenge ibm watson’s rise to prominence in analyzing big health data and brain computer interfaces such as muse or thync becoming available to the general public these medical technologies have since become reality it’s time to list the  major breakthroughs and trends that will dominate healthcare and medicine in   virtual reality once the new york times gave out google cardboards with its newspapers it was clear virtual reality was going mainstream but now that facebook’s oculus rift just became available for preorder virtual reality is going to become a booming industry with really sophisticated devices on the market it might have its biggest year ever in  it will be used to let medical students gain realistic experience in examining patients or to let patients see what would happen to them the next day at the hospital for stress release    augmented reality a novartis chief announced that the digital contact lens patented by google would become available in  as it will measure blood glucose from tears it is supposed to change diabetes treatment and management moreover hololens from microsoft also comes out in  which will have a huge impact on fields from medical education to architecture and engineering it could help medical students do dissections for many hours a day from any angles without the formaldehyde smell  fibretronics  was not the year of smartclothes no matter how much we anticipated it even the ones with the biggest market potentials like hexoskin were only traditional shirts with builtin devices in their pockets but fibretronics are clothing materials with microchips implanted into them they can react to body temperature or the mood of the wearer among others google has started collaborating with levi’s to create true fibretronic materials which could be used to interact with technology through our clothes in novel ways imagine this in the or as the first promising collaborations in this area came out in  expect to see the first tangible results in   smart algorithms analyzing wearable data  was the year of wearable health trackers a swarm of devices became available amazon launched its wearable marketplace and millions of activity trackers were sold but gaining actionable insights from the constant stream of wearable data is not easy we need clever algorithms and apps that merge data from several devices and apps and help us draw meaningful conclusions it would help lay people put more emphasis on prevention and have a healthier lifestyle i had experience with existio one of the earliest attempts but it still needs to go a long way  nearartificial intelligence in radiology ibm’s watson supercomputer has been used in oncology to assist medical decisionmaking it proved the clear benefits of such a system by making diagnoses and treatment cheaper and more efficient ibm’s medical sieve project aims to diagnose most lesions with a smart software leaving room for radiologists to focus on the most important cases instead of checking hundreds of images every day      food scanners food scanners like scio and tellspec have been in the spotlight since  but as early developer prototypes have already been mailed to their first users in   could be the year they become generally available this would enable anyone to find out what’s really on their plates providing clear benefits not just to people looking to gain weight or eat healthier food but people with dangerous allergies as well    humanoid robots one of the most promising companies developing robots is boston dynamics acquired by google in  since then they only released teaser videos about animallike robots and petman the humanoid robot many technologies they are working on seem to be at a stage where they are ready to become actual products the first signs of which we’ll see in   d bioprinting organovo has been in the focus because of d printing biomaterials for years they announced successfully bioprinted liver tissues in  and they seemed to be  years away from printing liver parts for transplantation but first these bioprinted livers could be finally used in the pharmaceutical industry to replace animal models when analyzing the toxicity of new drugs if it goes through in  i feel printing actual liver tissue for transplantation could become a commercial service within the next decade  internet of health things at home last year i released a concept art of a bathroom of the future all the elements in that image from the smart toothbrush to the digital mirror were partially available in  but an array of sensors will reach the general public in  making iot a reality in our homes the longterm goal is to make these devices communicate and learn from each other this way we would not have to analyze the data of the devices ourselves but the device manufacturers could merge their findings and share a digestible report with us when there is something to take care of  theranos – thumbs up or down the end of  saw theranos embroiled in a scandal the company claims to perform blood tests from one drop of blood in a transparently priced way concerns were raised by the wall street journal about the validity of their claims and we are waiting for theranos to reveal the details of their medical technologies besides these the new verily life sciences branch of alphabet and the gene editing method crispr might have a big hit in  we will see these medical technologies and trends will create value and have an impact on our lives and the practice of medicine in    more news some say technology

best new medical technologies are designed to make more people better for less here are a five to watch this year share asme getmediafadbfbffdcatopmedicaltechnologyinnovationsthumbjpgaspxwidthheightextjpg against the backdrop of health care reform and a controversial medical device tax medical technology companies are focusing more than ever on products that deliver cheaper faster more efficient patient care they are also making inroads with us food  drug administration regulators to reengineer the complex review and approval process for new medical devices many in the industry have long felt overly burdened by what they consider to be an unnecessarily complex approval process critics claim it impedes innovation and delays the availability of better health care to change that perception the fda last year announced a new medical device innovation consortium mdic charged with simplifying the process of designing and testing new technologies with input from industry government and other nonprofit organizations publicprivate mdic will prioritize the regulatory science needs of the medical device community and fund projects to streamline the process by sharing and leveraging resources mdic may help industry to be better equipped to bring safe and effective medical devices to market more quickly and at a lower cost says jeffrey shuren md jd director of the fdas center for devices and radiological health as the regulators politicians and corporate executives hash out these details industry engineers and scientists continue to push through new ideas for improving and managing human health every year industry observers like the cleveland clinic and the medical device trade press single out their favorite technology trends these thought leaders agree that todays best technologies strike a balance between reducing the overall cost of medical care and increasing safety and survival rates—and isnt that what health care reform is all about here are five emerging technologies to watch in the year ahead—and please visit aabmeorg for uptotheminute developments on the field of bioengineering the melafind optical scanner from mela sciences image melafindcom  cutting back on melanoma biopsies with the most deadly form of skin cancer melanoma a huge number of dangerouslooking moles are actually harmless but has always been impossible to know for sure without an invasive surgical biopsy today dermatologists have new help in making the right call — a handheld tool approved by the fda for multispectral analysis of tissue morphology the melafind optical scanner is not for definitive diagnosis but rather to provide additional information a doctor can use in determining whether or not to order a biopsy the goal is to reduce the number of patients left with unnecessary biopsy scars with the added benefit of eliminating the cost of unnecessary procedures the melafind technology mela sciences irvington ny uses missile navigation technologies originally paid for the department of defense to optically scan the surface of a suspicious lesion at  electromagnetic wavelengths the collected signals are processed using heavyduty algorithms and matched against a registry of  digital images of melanoma and skin disease the ati neurostimulator from autonomic technologies image atispgcom  electronic aspirin for people who suffer from migraines cluster headaches and other causes of chronic excruciating head or facial pain the take two aspirins and call me in the morning method is useless doctors have long associated the most severe chronic forms of headache with the sphenopalatine ganglion spg a facial nerve bundle but havent yet found a treatment that works on the spg longterm a technology under clinical investigation at autonomic technologies inc redwood city ca is a patientpowered tool for blocking spg signals at the first sign of a headache the system involves the permanent implant of a small nerve stimulating device in the upper gum on the side of the head normally affected by headache the lead tip of the implant connects with the spg bundle and when a patient senses the onset of a headache he or she places a handheld remote controller on the cheek nearest the implant the resulting signals stimulate the spg nerves and block the paincausing neurotransmitters the symphony tcgm biosensor from echo therapeutics image echotxcom  needlefree diabetes care diabetes selfcare is a pain—literally it brings the constant need to draw blood for glucose testing the need for daily insulin shots and the heightened risk of infection from all that poking continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps are todays best options for automating most of the complicated daily process of blood sugar management – but they dont completely remove the need for skin pricks and shots but theres new skin in this game echo therapeutics philadelphia pa is developing technologies that would replace the poke with a patch the company is working on a transdermal biosensor that reads blood analytes through the skin without drawing blood the technology involves a handheld electrictoothbrushlike device that removes just enough toplayer skin cells to put the patients blood chemistry within signal range of a patchborne biosensor the sensor collects one reading per minute and sends the data wirelessly to a remote monitor triggering audible alarms when levels go out of the patients optimal range and tracking glucose levels over time the telemedicine system from intouch technologies image intouchhealthcom  robotic checkups a pillar of health reform is improving access to the best health care for more people technology is a costeffective and increasingly potent means to connect clinics in the vast and medically underserved rural regions of the united states with big city medical centers and their specialists telemedicine is well established as a tool for triage and assessment in emergencies but new medical robots go one step further—they can now patrol hospital hallways on more routine rounds checking on patients in different rooms and managing their individual charts and vital signs without direct human intervention the rpvita remote presence robot produced jointly by irobot corp and intouch health is the first such autonomous navigation remotepresence robot to receive fda clearance for hospital use the device is a mobile cart with a twoway video screen and medical monitoring equipment programmed to maneuver through the busy halls of a hospital the sapien transcatheter aortic valve from edwards lifesciences image edwardscom  a valve job with heart the sapien transcatheter aortic valve is a lifesaving alternative to openheart surgery for patients who need new a new valve but cant endure the rigors of the operation manufactured by edwards life sciences irvine ca the sapien has been available in europe for some time but is only now finding its first use in us heart centers—where it is limited only to the frailest patients thus far the sapien valve is guided through the femoral artery by catheter from a small incision near the grown or rib cage the valve material is made of bovine tissue attached to a stainlesssteel stent which is expanded by inflating a small balloon when correctly placed in the valve space a simpler procedure that promises dramatically shorter hospitalizations is bound to have a positive effect on the cost of care learn more about the latest innovations in
