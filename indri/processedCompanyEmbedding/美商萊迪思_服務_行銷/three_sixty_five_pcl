on this week and how in the world is it only wednesday  i feel like ive gotten so much information and so many things have happened since sunday night and im having a heck of a time processing it all let me try to break this down for you in  hours all of this happened   facetime calls  i had a meeting with the grundy county deputy while at work yesterday  i got my transcript evaluation and basically the next  years of my life mapped out more on this later  a doctors appointment  my chicago trip was canceled  i found out my grandma is having surgery this week  the first day of dance practice and parent meeting dates were set  i know im evading a lot of details in this list but i just truly cant believe how much has gone on in such a short time period life you guys its been a crazy one lately but most of it is good and it sure has kept things interesting im looking forward to getting some more blog posts here soon and filling you in more on both the big and little things happening around here until then ill be over here looking forward to friday posted by stephanie reed at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest our weekend   finally two weeks later i thought id get a quick weekend recap post up from the end of july  this was a really good weekend for no real particular reason we didnt have a lot planned but it was nice couple of days spent together and im glad we got to enjoy sleeping in and drinking coffee together alas let us get this post rolling friday night was a family wedding in which i had no pto and could not leave work early for so jeff met up with his family at the wedding and had a really great time celebrating his cousins marriage meanwhile i decided to get another run in that night which totally paid off because it resulted in a huge weight goal being reached the next morning love it feels so good to make and reach goals finley reed had a very relaxing weekend with her new best friend  saturday was a great day jeff went to the lake to a friends cabin in the morning and i went to target for my weekly errand running and starbucks treat we had a pretty low key night of baseball throwing and frisbee fetching and these two loves of my life were just plain worn out sunday was reserved for golf jeff got a pass for free golfing here in grundy center from our neighbor gloria it was jeffs first time golfing on that course and i had a blast riding along and enjoying some sunshine and nike advertising  sunday evening was a bunch of survivor watching and finley cuddling it was a great weekend full of recharging and i went into the next week feeling renewed and ready to take it on posted by stephanie reed at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest friday july   july   reading my calendar for the upcoming fall season and trying to stay calm  im excited for all the awesome things coming my way but also aware that it will be a little challenging to juggle it all here goes nothinwanting to keep up these healthy habits and keep moving forward i feel amazing right now and its nice to know that im able to feel this way and get my body here all on my own i just have to put forth the effort sometimes i get nervous about how my postnatal body will recover one day but knowing that i can get to here from where ive already been before puts my mind at ease and the healthiermore fit i am before a future pregnancy the easier it will all be to loselooking forward to an upcoming trip to chicagoplaying a million songs trying to put together our state mixes for dance team already how is it that time of yearwasting time on social media at night before bed but thats nothing new go to bed stephaniewishing that fall weather lasted like  months instead of  days enjoying life these days i really think that its all about your outlook and your attitude towards things can truly change your feelings and lift your spiritswaiting to get things rolling with a big life goal that ill talk more about soonliking sleeping with a fan on these days its more for sound than anything we started it during firework season as a distraction for fin but its become a comforting lull each nightloving that dance tryouts are next week and i finally get to see my girls and teach a routine again the juices are flowing and im getting the itch to coach again  right on schedulemarveling at the fact that i just signed up for a half marathon the other day my goodness im at it again  only half crazy this time thoughneeding to plan my weeks workouts ahead of time sometimes im already walking down the block to start my run before ive even decided how far im going to go lol i need to set a plan and work off of it also needing some kind of intervention for my adult acne ugh hormones watching  questions on youtube its a vogue thing where they go to celebrities houses and rapid fire questions at them its a little bit cheesy at times but i still love seeing their houses and learning about them as real people i think i like most of them better in their roles as actors though haha smelling apples ive whipped out the fall candles and im not ashamed wearing shorts and tanks everyday and wishing it was jeans and cardigans lol its too hottt noticing how much drinking water really does aid in my health i feel so much better when im getting lots of ho during the day and its been nice to stray from consuming so much coffee dont get me wrong  coffee will forever be my favorite hug in the morning but it should be more of a treat than an ongoing hydration sourceknowing more about how my younger brother viewed our childhood after having a great talk with him last weekend its funny how different our perceptions were of the same events and it was a blast to pick his brain and see things through his eyes a little bit i loved reminiscing with him and it blows my mind how mature hes become also it was nice to hear that i wasnt as bad of a big sister as i thought i was thinking how crazy it is that my brotherinlaw is now engaged it happened this week on their camping trip and im so thrilled for them hes truly a brother to me and im just super excited that he found his happinessbookmarking crop tops if i dare say so lol i finally feel more comfortable in my body and i love the look of them for working out and dancing holding maverick a little tighter the next time i see him poor baby is in the hospital after having a seizure the other night and i just want him to be all better and get back to his sweet happy little self feeling  posted by stephanie reed at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest tuesday july   a selfie weekend   since my phones camera was broken all weekend and selfies were the only option this weekend recap is chuck full of good ole front facing camera goodies friday night when we got back to eagle grove we headed straight to a family friends house for a bit of a dinner party it was really nice outside and we had a blast sitting around and chatting in the summer air with some toddies we had a delicious smoked meat dinner and enjoyed the company and drinks for a while before jeff got invited to play some darts up at the bar we left to check on our puppy before heading up there and this is her just chilling at her grandparents lol this is the only photo thats not a selfie because jeff snapped it to me haha we had such a great time up town playing and watching darts it was a typical summer night at our hometown bar and it was refreshing to get to spend it with my husband after a long week of night shifts  the next morning was a really slow one i had planned to run but friday night had kind of gotten the best of me and so we slept in and took our time getting ready for the day we went to a memorial at my grandmas house for my uncle mo who lived in germany which was the real reason we made the trip home for the weekend since his funeral was overseas we all got together at my grandmas house to celebrate his life and reunite the siblings it was a great turn out and i got to see lots of family that i havent seen in years it was really nice and im super glad that we were able to come home for it i really really really wish that i had a working camera for the memorial though it was such a special occasion to have us all in the same place at the same time and i know i didnt take nearly enough advantage of it as i should have im just really glad that my grandma and my mom got to spend so much time with their loved ones and make the most out of this terrible situation mo would have really loved that afternoon after our family time was finished we headed out to the golf course for jeff to get some swings in we ended up hooking up with a friend out there and im sure jeff was thrilled to actually have someone to play with rather than just his wife who sits in the cart and drinks the whole time  they ended up playing something like  holes and it was like heaven on earth for jpr so it was also the fair in good ole wright county and our plan was to have supper out there and get the famous chicken and noodles it was starting to get late and the guys decided to play another round until the sun went down so i made my way into town and got the fair goodies togo and brought it back out to the course it was hotttttt out there but that comfort food was still worth it it was delicious and well worth the trip into town we made it a pretty early night and went to bed at a decent time we woke up on sunday and had another slow and easy morning there was coffee and some crossword puzzles and delicious homemade salads to get us going for the day before we knew it we were on our way home and it was already sunday night survivor laundry meal prep and monday preparations were in full swing and the weekend was wrapped up wayyy before i wanted it to be but thus here we are in a new week with new goals and todo lists and im rockin and rollin just waiting for the next weekend ahead  hope youre having a great week and i also hope my camera decides to work so i can provide you with more than selfies next weekend posted by stephanie reed at  am no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest saturday july   a sappy saturday night i shared this post on my instagram but it was very much like a blog post i would write so i thought id share it on this space too four things on this saturday night  i broke my phone and now im stuck with my old one until september and so this is the kind of camera quality i get until then  we literally golfed until the sun went down tonight and i cant help but think about how much we will miss these days one day when our family grows and our freedom diminishes while i cant wait for that chapter of our story i still really love the one we are in  its really cool to me to think that i used to watch jeff run this same golf course during his high school cross country day a whole  years ago if that  year old girl with a crush only knew  i got some fair food to go and brought it out to the golf course for our dinner tonight and theres nothing as delicious as fair chicken and noodles even if it is  degrees  summer weekends man theres nothing better posted by stephanie reed at  am no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest friday july   four things friday    egg yolk masks you need to do them i need to do them every single day i seriously have found nothing that helps my hormonal acne more than an egg yolk mask does it blows my mind i wake up with so much less redness and my face is instantly better after i start doing this its a bit of a mess so i dont always do it but i need to keep it up nightly because the benefits are totally worth the hassle  softball is over around here which means its time to get the dance season up and going again im getting excited and i think im ready for the craziness to ensue once again im feeling inspired lately so hopefully ill get lots of choreographing done while im still hot this fall is gonna be nuts  the other day jeff was dancing around the house and being a goof and i was kind of in a blah mood so i didnt join in he kept urging me to be crazy with him and i just wasnt feeling it i watched him for a bit and then went on to get chores done and now  days later im still thinking about how i shouldve just dropped what i was doing and joined him one of my forever favorite things about this guy is how freaking fun he is he makes me more goofy usually and im just a better person when im around him if i just let myself let go and join in ive regretted turning him down all week long and just want to use this as a lesson to myself to let go and always always join my husband in his shenanigans so jeff if youre reading this  im sorry for being a debbie downer and i owe you a dance  my phone is officially kaput and im reallyyyy struggling about it i had a case of the touch disease which is where the phone literally will do nothing when you touch the screen  so frustrating i was constantly having to bend the phone certain ways just to try to trigger the screen again and it was ridiculous it would take me like ten minutes to be able to respond to a text message lol so anyways ive switched back to my iphone  for the time being  until the new one comes out in late september it was so nice to be able to use the screen at first and i thought it was actually kind of refreshing to switch back but now a couple weeks in im finding myself hating this old clunker the screen is tiny its basically completely out of storage the camera take terribllllle photos like the one of jeff and fin from last nights post blurry city and now just as of last night only the front facing camera will work the flashlight and the regular camera wont even turn on and it feels like my life is ruined  haha but really how am i supposed to blog if i cant take photos how am i supposed to live if i cant take photos drama drama drama  posted by stephanie reed at  am no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest thursday july   around here lately  july so far heres a few pretty uneventful photos from my camera roll none of them really go together but its the easiest way for me to show you what us reeds have been up to around here lately so here we have it   i have to admit up front here  the fourth of july really cut into my healthy habits it was only a couple of days without running or dieting but my goodness it didnt take long at all to start feeling yucky again its crazy what processed food does to you and kind of disgusting it makes it easier to say no to it again when i think about how bad it must be for me if it makes me feel that way and it truly never is worth it   all that to say  im back at it full force and ready to make some progress again     when jeff has his days off during the week which happens a lot he sometimes likes to go back home and golf even just for the day hes also so sweet and takes finny along for the ride so she can see her cousin and i always get such cute little selfies from their trip    last weekend was pretty nonproductive on my part but it was super nice to hang at home with my hubby before he went in to work we got to have our morning coffee together and watch our favorite show any guesses on which show ha i love any time we get to spend together especially now that hes been on nights and i havent seen him in  days ﻿   finley reed has the best dad ever duh whos been giving her daily spa treatments lately shes the softest fluffiest and best smelling puppy girl youll ever meet i love this length of fur on her and its all thanks to jeff that its stayed so healthy and clean just a little princess lol   just your averageeverydayrunofthemilltargetruncar selfie you know   and as ive been spending so much time alone this week while jeff works ive been getting two work outs in every day to get things rolling again ive felt great and im thankful for the sanity it brings me during these evenings alone   finley reed misses her dad too and she looooves when he comes home to visit his girls  ﻿   sometimes when i go downstairs and see this uniform hanging there i still find myself in disbelief that my husband is a trooper like how am i this old first of all and how did i get so lucky more importantly im still so proud of him and what he does every day i love the community weve found in this state patrol family and i just really feel blessed that our journey in des moines brought us here﻿     lastly heres another car selfie to take us out because im just really happy and enjoying life these days its nice to be in this ebb and flow and im feeling really content where im at currently sometimes its nice to have a lack of crazy excitement and get to just be it forces me to look around a bit and find happiness and fulfillment right where i am and thats exactly where i want to be posted by stephanie reed at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to
