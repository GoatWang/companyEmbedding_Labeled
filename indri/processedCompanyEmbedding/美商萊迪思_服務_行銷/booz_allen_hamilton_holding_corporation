from northwestern university in evanston illinois in  edwin g booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert impartial advice this theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name according to the company in  the firm was hired to help the united states secretary of the navy with world war ii preparations since then booz allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years such as advising on the breakup of ma bell and helping organize the national football league in the s the firm has gone through several name changes in its  years of existence these include edwin g booz business engineering service edwin g booz surveys edwin g booz and fry surveys booz fry allen  hamilton booz allen  hamilton and finally booz allen hamilton organizationedit in  booz allen first went public with an initial offering of  shares at  per share however in  public trading ceased in the largestever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where booz allens partners bought back the stock through one of the first management buyouts mbo and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure in  managing director marc gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider longrange investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make new south wales australiaedit in  the newly elected greiner state government commissioned a report into the state rail authority by booz allen hamilton the resulting report recommended up to  job losses including the withdrawal of staff from  country railway stations withdrawing services on the nyngan bourke line queanbeyan – cooma line and glen innes wallangarra line the discontinuation of several country passenger services the canberra xpt the silver city comet to broken hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services and the removal of sleeper trains from services to brisbane and melbourne the report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible the sra was divided into business units – cityrail responsible for urban railways countrylink responsible for country passenger services freightrail responsible for freight services and rail estate responsible for rail property internal revenue serviceedit in  booz allen was chosen to help the internal revenue service irs modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service the firm developed a strategy for the irs to reshuffle its  employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories individuals charities businesses and so on we made some very dramatic changes in the way the irs is organized said ceo ralph shrader reports from the government accountability office gao have pointed to mixed results including poor management of the irss it portfolio and contractors swiftedit in  at the request of the article  working party an advisory group to the european commission the american civil liberties union aclu and privacy international pi investigated the us governments swift surveillance program and booz allens role therein the aclu and pi filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor in this case booz allen acting as auditors of a government program when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts the basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist beyond that the implication was also made that booz allen may be complicit in a program electronic surveillance of swift that may be deemed illegal by the european commission homeland securityedit a june   article in the washington post related how a united states department of homeland security contract with booz allen increased from  million to more than  million through two nobid contracts one occurring after the dhss legal office had advised dhs not to continue the contract until after a review a government accountability office gao report on the contract characterized it as not wellplanned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed according to the article a review of memos email and other contracting documents obtained by the washington post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money as the project progressed the department became so dependent on booz allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less elaine c duke the departments chief procurement officer acknowledged the problems with the booz allen contract but duke said those matters have been resolved she defended a decision to issue a second nobid contract in  as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held national institutes of healthedit in march  the national institutes of health reported that booz allen hamilton spent at least m of public funds to develop the cabig cancer biomedical informatics grid not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds the nih report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures the original goals of the program were to share cancer data between nih funded study centers cabig quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives which the nih cited as a key cause of failure funding levels for cabig were the largest ever spent for a us biomedical research network as of may  the cabig program was retired  anonymous hackedit on july   the group anonymous as part of its operation antisec hacked into booz allen servers extracting emails and nonsalted passwords from the us military this information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on the pirate bay despite anonymous claims that  emails were released the associated press counted only  unique emails of which only  were military addresses the remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of booz allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes according to a statement by the group we infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place anonymous accused booz allen of working with hbgary federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media anonymous also accused booz allen of participating in intelligencegathering and surveillance programs of the us federal government and as stated by kukil bora of the international business times possible illegal activities booz allen confirmed the intrusion on  july but contradicted anonymous claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems meaning that information from the military should be secure in august of that year during a conference call with analysts ralph shrader the chairman and ceo stated that the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack were not expected to have a material effect on our financial results prism media leakedit main articles prism surveillance program and edward snowden in june  edward snowden — at the time a booz allen employee contracted to projects of the national security agency nsa — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs including prism the alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the nsa and led to considerable concern worldwide booz allen condemned snowdens leak of the existence of prism as shocking and a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm the company fired snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time market analysts considered the incident embarrassing but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage booz allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak charles riley of cnnmoney said that booz allen was scrambling to distance itself from snowden according to reuters a source with detailed knowledge on the matter stated that booz allens hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in snowdens résumé regarding his education since some details did not check out precisely but decided to hire him anyway reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns or the manner in which snowden satisfied the concerns were not known on wednesday july   the united states air force stated that it cleared booz allen of wrongdoing regarding the snowden case political contributionsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june  in  david sirota of salon said that booz allen and parent company the carlyle group make significant political contributions to the democratic party and the republican party as well as individual politicians including barack obama and john mccain according to maplight a company that tracked campaign donations booz allen gave a total of just over  to us lawmakers from  to june  sirota concluded that many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms referring to booz allen and carlyle and that the political parties are bankrolled by these firms activities in foreign countriesedit in june  booz allen expanded its operations in north africa and the middle east with initial plans to add operations in kuwait oman qatar united arab emirates it planned to later add operations to bahrain saudi arabia and turkey during a time when those countries as stated by jill r aitoro of the washington business journal were recovering from the turmoil associated with the arab spring the booz allen employee base when it was a part of booz  company had longterm relationships with many north african and middle eastern countries booz allen had split from booz  company david sirota of salon said that politicians in the united states who received financing from booz allen and other firms with a similar multinational business model have vested interests in denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money too booz allen helped the government of the united arab emirates create an equivalent of the national security agency for that country according to david e sanger and nicole perlroth of the new york times one arab official familiar with the effort said that they are teaching everything data
