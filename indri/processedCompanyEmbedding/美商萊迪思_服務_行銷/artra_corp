artras corporate entity has no material commitments for capital expenditures investment in comforce corporation artra along with its wholly owned fillmor subsidiary owns a significant minority interest in comforce corporation comforce consisting of  shares or approximately  of the outstanding common stock of comforce as of december   with an aggregate value as of that date of  the comforce shares constitute unregistered securities under the securities act of  the act as a result of artras former involvement in the operations and management of comforce artra was considered an affiliate of comforce under the act and because of this the number of shares that artra could sell without registration under the act within any threemonth period was limited for the reasons set forth below the company believes that an exemption from registration under rule k promulgated under the act is now available to it and therefore the limitations under rule  on the number of restricted shares that artra could sell within any threemonth period without registrations are no longer applicable to it  there can be no assurance that the securities and exchange commission would concur with our position notwithstanding this we do not believe that our ability to sell comforce shares or eventually to realize on the value of our comforce shares will be affected in a material adverse way although we may not be able to sell our comforce shares as quickly as we could if we were to use rule k and in any event an attempt to sell a large number of our comforce shares over a limited period could be expected to result in a reduction in the value of such shares in january  our board of directors approved the sale of  of artras comforce common shares to certain officers directors and key employees of artra for noninterest bearing notes totaling  the notes are collateralized by the related comforce common shares additionally the noteholders have the right to put their comforce shares back to artra in full payment of the balance of their notes based upon the preceding factors we have concluded that for reporting purposes we have effectively sold options to certain officers directors and key employees to acquire  of our comforce common shares accordingly in january  these  comforce common shares were removed from the our portfolio of availableforsale securities and were classified in the our condensed consolidated balance sheet as other receivables with an aggregate value of  based upon the value of proceeds to be received upon future exercise of the options the disposition of these  comforce common shares resulted in a gain that was deferred and will not be recognized in the our financial statements until the options to purchase these  comforce common shares are exercised during the first quarter of  options to acquire  of these comforce common shares were exercised resulting in a realized gain of  at march   options to acquire  comforce common shares remained

defendants in various businessrelated litigation and environmental matters see note  to our condensed consolidated financial statements at march   and december   we had accrued current liabilities of  for potential businessrelated litigation and environmental liabilities while these litigation and environmental matters involve wide ranges of potential liability we do not believe the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the our financial statements net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had federal income tax loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring

corporations utilization of its federal income tax loss carryforwards when certain changes in the ownership of a corporations common stock occurs in our opinion we not currently subject to such limitations regarding the utilization of its federal income tax loss carryforwards should we continue to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock it could trigger a limitation on our ability to utilize our federal income tax loss carryforwards  impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has become a less significant factor in our economy however to the extent permitted by competition we have generally passed increased costs to our customers by increasing sales prices over time recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   we have not determined what impact this standard when adopted will have on the our financial statements year  compliance the year  yk issue refers to the inability of many computer programs and systems to process accurately dates later than december   unless these programs are modified to handle the century change they will likely interpret the year  as the year  we anticipate that the year  issue will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations we have not incurred any significant costs for yk compliance to date and do not expect to incur any significant additional costs to complete such compliance additionally we believe the technology and internal computer systems of entradecom are yk compliant quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there have been no material changes in

letters to artra nl industries and others alleging that they were potentially responsible parties with respect to releases at the dutch boy facility in chicago and demanding that they remediate the

and similar expressions actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements factors that could contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus supplement as discussed in note  the companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended march   on february   artra entered into an agreement with entrade inc entrade formerly na acquisition corp and worldwide web networx corporation wwwx providing for the merger of a subsidiary of entrade with artra entrade a  owned subsidiary of wwwx owns all of the outstanding capital stock of entradecom inc entradecom and  of the class a common stock of assetradecom inc assetradecom risk factors relating to entrade and its entradecom operations the following risk factors relate to the business and operations of entrade and its entradecom operations we have no operating history upon which you may evaluate us we formed entrade in february  at which time it acquired the intellectual property of entradecom and  of the voting common stock of assetradecom these entities had virtually no operating history prior to that time accordingly we have no operating history upon which you may evaluate us in addition our revenue model is evolving initially our revenues will be primarily generated from technology license fees transaction fees from our asset disposi tion business community sites transaction fees associated with online auctions and other listing maintenance and service fees our principal initial targeted markets will be the utilities industry and large industrial manufacturing sectors in the future we expect to generate revenue from multiple sources including ecommerce transaction fees and business services we may not be able to successfully create industryspecific online business communities that will generate significant license and transaction fees if we do not generate such revenue our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected we anticipate we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future our lack of any operating history makes predicting our future operating results including operating expenses difficult our revenues may not grow to date we have not generated revenues and have not been profitable we may never be profitable or if we become profitable we may be unable to sustain profitability we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future some of our expenses are or will be fixed including noncancelable agreements equip ment leases and real estate leases if our revenues do not increase we may not be able to compensate by reducing expenses in a timely manner in addition we plan to increase our operating expenses to o launch industryspecific online business communities o increase our sales and marketing operations o broaden our customer support and operating software capabilities and o pursue strategic marketing and distribution alliances expenses may also increase due to the potential impact of goodwill and other charges resulting from any future acquisitions we may need to seek future funding sources we believe that the license fee revenues and other funding by artra of entrades operations after the merger will enable entrade to maintain its planned operations through  no assurance exists that we will attain profitability if revenues from entradecoms operations are less than anticipated in  and  funds may have to be raised from additional financings we have no commitments for any financing other than from artra and any financing commit ments may result in dilution to our existing shareholders after the merger the terms of any future financings may impose restrictions on our right to declare dividends or on the manner in which we conduct our business fluctuations in our quarterly results may adversely affect our stock price  it is probable that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate significantly due to many factors including o the uncertain adoption of the internet as a commercial medium o potential dependence on the general development of the ecommerce market o reluctance of corporate information technology groups to transition from existing internal corporate computer networks to internetbased ecommerce systems o the pace of deregulation in the utility industry o uncertainties relating to the pace of consolidation within the electric utility industry o the effect of deregulation and industry consolidation on the decisionmaking processes of management within the utility industry relating to capital expenditures and client acquisition o market competition o management of our growth and o risks associated with potential acquisitions many of these factors are beyond our control if our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet the securities analysts or your expectations the price of entrade common stock could be materially adversely affected we intend to rely heavily on revenues from the utilities and large industrial manufac turing sectors and if these revenues decline our business would be adversely affected we intend to rely on revenues generated from technology licenses fees transaction fees from our asset disposition business community sites transaction fees associated with online auctions and other listing maintenance and service fees our principal initial targeted markets will be the utility industry and large industrial manufacturing sectors our ability to increase our revenues may depend among other things on many factors including o the development of a large base of global buyers and sellers of assets through our industryspecific online business communities o the acceptance by utilities and large industrial manufacturing sectors of the internet as a legitimate medium for asset transfers and distribution o uncertain acceptance of our ecommerce related methodologies and service applications by internal corporate information technology groups o the transition of traditional methodologies based on internal corporate computer networks to internetbased ecommerce systems o the acceptance of our fee structures within the utility industry and o current and future competitors offering similar services we may not develop additional revenue sources if we do not generate increased revenue from online business communities our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected we plan to generate revenues through revenue sharing relationships with strategic marketing partners with whom we form industryspecific business communities to generate significant revenues from internet businesstobusiness ecommerce we will have to continue to build these relationships  marketing and distribution alliances may not generate the expected number of new customers or may be terminated we intend to use marketing distribution and strategic tradegroup alliances with other internet companies to create traffic on our online business communities and consequently to generate revenues these marketing and distribution alliances will allow us to link our online business communities to internet search engines and web sites the success of these relationships depends on the amount of increased traffic we receive from the alliance partners web sites these arrangements may not generate the expected number of new customers we also cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these marketing and distribution alliance agreements if any of these agreements are terminated the traffic on online business communities could decrease we plan to enter into partnerships with strategic industryrelated partners to build industryspecific business communities in addition to our primary initial focus on the utility and large manufacturing sectors but we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any new partnerships we may not be able to compete effectively with other providers of ecommerce services we believe that the strongest potential competition does not come from traditional service groups but rather the evolution of the internet and the types of businesstobusiness service providers that evolution will create as applications for businesstobusiness ecommerce begin to proliferate and mature entradecom will compete with other technology companies and traditional service providers that seek to integrate online business technologies with their tradi tional service mix competition for internet products and services and electronic business commerce is intense we expect that competition will continue to intensify barriers to entry are minimal and competitors can launch new web sites at a relatively low cost we expect that additional compa nies will offer competing online business communities on a standalone or portfolio basis currently a number of software developers specialize in transaction software these software developers however do not specifically focus on either asset recovery applications or our target industrial and utility markets other companies offer asset recovery services andor asset evaluation and auction systems most of these groups however either specialize in certain industries that we currently do not target or focus on our target markets but have neither internet based ecommerce transaction technologies nor online auction capabilities other competitors operate ecommerce transaction and auction technologies through the internet but do not for the most part concentrate on asset recovery services andor large industrial groups the current focus of these groups is principally the businesstoconsumer retail market a few groups provide asset recovery for the utility industry most notably the national materials logistic group a membership of nuclear generation facilities contracts to provide parts and equipment listing available assets for sale by and on behalf of member utilities through a  listing service called rapid that group specializes in nuclear generation equipment rather than the broad spectrum of energy generation assets similarly a few auction groups offer a strong offline presence and fulfillment capabilities with large industrial companies ecommerce applications are in the early stages of development currently the principal focus of ecommerce businesstobusiness groups is to provide information and generate revenues from advertisement as ecommerce evolves however we expect that other entrepreneurs and large industry leaders in specific industry sectors will create other niche businesstobusiness services that may compete with our services other competitors may develop internet products or services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than our solutions if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors our business financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected some of our competitors have greater financial marketing and other resources than ours also other established ecommerce companies with greater financial marketing and other resources that currently do not provide online businessto business may decide to add this type of service and compete with us in the future this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors pricing strategies technological advances strategic partnerships and other initiatives we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights and we may infringe the propri

also applied for federal registration of utilipartscom and entradecom as service marks for use in connection with our electronic commerce services although we seek to protect our proprietary rights our actions may be inadequate to protect any trademarks and other proprietary rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and other proprietary rights generally our domain

rights in trademarks service marks trade dress and other indications of origin competitors will be able to use names and marks that are identical to ours or sufficiently similar to ours to cause

these competitors have problems with the quality of their services our reputation for quality may be injured litigation against infringers of our service marks trademarks and similar rights may be

personnel our technology rights constitute ownership of copyrights and trade secrets embodied in certain unique portions of the software now known as the orbit system software and a license substantially exclusive to certain other components of that software we are now developing a new version of the orbit system software we have entered into a contract with a software developer pursuant to which we are to obtain all rights in the software created by the developer while we attempt to determine that the developer is taking appropriate steps to remain in compli ance with this agreement there can be no assurance that the developer will do so we may not be able to acquire or maintain effective web addresses we currently hold various internet web addresses relating to our services and products these web addresses include entradecom and utilipartscom as well as assetradecom through our interest in assetradecom we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring web addresses that are similar to our addresses which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the acquisition and maintenance of web addresses generally is regulated by governmental agencies and their designees for example in the united  states the national science foundation has appointed network solutions inc as the exclusive registrar for the com net and org generic toplevel addresses the regulation of web addresses in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change as a result we may not be able to acquire or maintain relevant web addresses in all countries where we conduct business that are consistent with our brand names and marketing strategy furthermore the relationship between regulations governing such addresses and laws protecting trademarks is unclear our business depends on the effective development of the internet as an effective e commerce business and marketing forum the internet poses risks that are applicable to many online businesses including ours the following present a description of such risks our success depends on our ability to use an effective internet marketing strategy which depends on internet governance and regulation which is uncertain the future success of our business is dependent on our ability to use an effective internet marketing strategy because the original role of the internet was to link the governments comput ers with academic institutions computers the internet was historically administered by organiza tions that were involved in sponsoring research private parties have assumed larger roles in the enhancement and maintenance of the internet infrastructure therefore it is unclear what organization if any will govern the administration of the internet in the future including the authorization of domain names the lack of an appropriate organization to govern the administra tion of the internet infrastructure and the legal uncertainties that may follow pose risks to the commercial internet industry and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition the effective operation of the internet and our business is also dependent on the continued mutual cooperation among several organizations that have widely divergent interests these organizations may find that achieving a consensus may become difficult impossible timeconsuming and costly as a result the following risks would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results o uncertainty as to the legality of any action we may take making business planning and operations difficult o the taking of harmful or disruptive actions with respect to the internet by other organi zations and individuals o a disruption of internet administration effective operations and maintenance including the inability of users to communicate with other users or otherwise use the internet and o a delay in infrastructure improvements necessary to the maintenance and expansion of the internet  although we are not subject to direct regulation in the united states other than federal and state business regulations generally changes in the regulatory environment could result in our business being subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or other united states regulatory agencies additionally as internet use becomes more internationally widespread there is an increased likelihood of international regulation we cannot predict whether or to what extent any such new regulation will occur however such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results for example costs incurred and decisions rendered as a result of the enactment of new laws or adoption of new regulations or investigations and lawsuits based upon new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results our business depends on the growth of the internet which is uncertain our market is new and rapidly evolving our business would be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow internet usage may be inhibited by a number of reasons such as o infrastructure o security concerns o inconsistent quality of service and o lack of availability of costeffective highspeed service if internet usage grows the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth or its performance or reliability may decline in addition web sites may from time to time experience interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future internet usage as well as usage of our online business communi ties could be adversely affected adoption of the internet as a medium for utilities and large manufacturing industry asset trading and distribution is uncertain the growth of the internet as a service and solutions provider for trading and distribution of assets in the utilities and large manufacturing sectors requires validation of the internet as an effective medium for this purpose this validation has yet to fully occur acceptance of the internet among utilities and large manufacturing industry managers will also depend on growth in the virtual business use of the internet if widespread virtual business use of the internet for those sectors does not develop or if the internet does not develop as an effective and measurable medium for such services our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected for example critical issues concerning use of the internet including  security reliability cost ease of use and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of and the degree to which business is conducted over the internet no standards have been widely accepted to measure the effectiveness of internet business solutions if such standards do not develop managers may not use the internet and or may be reluctant to do so our business financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected if the market for internet asset trading and distribution for these sectors fails to develop or develops slower than expected our longterm success depends on the development of the online business market which is uncertain if internet businesstobusiness electronic business commerce does not grow or grows slower than expected our business will suffer our longterm success depends on widespread market acceptance of electronic business commerce within the utilities and large manufacturing sectors a number of factors could prevent such acceptance including the following o internet businesstobusiness ecommerce is at an early stage and managers may be unwilling to shift their purchasing from traditional vendors to online vendors o the necessary network infrastructure for substantial growth in usage of internet may not be adequately developed o increased government regulation or taxation may adversely affect the viability of electronic business commerce o insufficient availability of telecommunication services or changes in telecommunication services could result in slower response times and o adverse publicity and industry concern about the security of electronic commerce transactions could discourage its acceptance and growth additionally leading web site browser providers and other internet distribution channels may begin to charge us to provide access to our products and services if any of these expenses are not accompanied by increased revenues our business financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may negatively impact our ecommerce business we believe that concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet such as business and supply requirements credit card numbers and other forms of  payment methods prevents many potential customers from engaging in online transactions if we do not add sufficient security features to future product releases our services may not gain market acceptance or there may be additional legal exposure to us we intend to include basic security features in some of our products and services to protect the privacy and integrity of customer data such as password requirements for access to portions of our online business communities we currently use authentication technology which requires passwords and other information to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing a customers information or encryption which transforms information into a code designed to be unreadable by third parties to protect confidential information despite the measures we have taken our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses hackers or similar problems caused by employees customers or other internet users if a person circumvents our security measures that person could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability we may be required to make significant investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches additionally as electronic commerce becomes more prevalent our customers will become more concerned about security if we do not ade quately address these concerns this could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our computers and telecommunications equipment are maintained by a third party server hosting company any system interruptions that cause our online business communities to be unavailable to web browsers may reduce their attractiveness to customers and potential customers and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results if the server hosting company does not reasonably maintain these computers and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and reasonably protect these systems against the following interruptions our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected o fire o natural disaster o sabotage o power loss o telecommunication failure and o human error or other disruptive events we may be subject to legal liability for publishing or distributing content over the internet  we may be subject to legal claims relating to the content in industryspecific online business communities or the downloading and distribution of such content claims could also involve matters such as defamation invasion of privacy disclosure of confidential information and copyright infringement providers of internet products and services have been sued in the past sometimes successfully based on the content of material in addition some of the content provided in our online business communities is drawn from data compiled by other parties including governmental and commercial sources and we rekey the data this data may have errors if our content is improperly used or if we supply incorrect information it could result in unexpected liability our insurance may not cover claims of this type or may not provide sufficient coverage our business financial condition and operating results could suffer a material adverse effect if costs resulting from these claims are not covered by our insurance or exceed our coverage capacity constraints on our technology transaction processing system and network hardware and software may be difficult to project as traffic in our industryspecific online business communities increases we must expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing systems and network hardware and software we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in our online business communities in addition we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased use of our online business communities if we do not appropriately upgrade our systems network hardware and software our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected our market is characterized by rapid technological change our market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product announcements to be successful we must adapt to the changing market by continually improv ing the responsiveness services and features of our online industryspecific business communi ties and by developing new features to meet customer needs our existing technology transaction processing systems and network software are currently being upgraded for proprietary reasons and to address the evolving needs of our clients while we believe these upgrades will be effective there can be no assurance that significant technological changes will not render our technology obsolete if we are unable to successfully respond to these developments or do not respond in a costeffective way our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected effectively managing our growth may be difficult we expect to grow rapidly both by adding new products and hiring new employees this growth is likely to place a significant strain on our resources and systems to manage our growth we must implement systems and train and manage our employees many of our senior management have only recently joined us we cannot assure you that our management will be able to effectively or successfully manage our growth  acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business we plan to make investments in complementary companies technologies and assets future acquisitions are subject to the following risks o acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business distract our management and other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards controls and procedures o we may acquire companies in markets in which we have little experience o we may not be able to successfully integrate the services products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations o we may be required to incur debt or issue equity securities which may be dilutive to existing shareholders to pay for acquisitions and o our acquisitions may not result in any return on our investment and we may lose our entire investment we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions regardless of whether we can identify acceptable acquisition candidates we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions for other reasons such as the availability of capital if we are unable to consummate future acquisitions our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected our success is dependent on our key personnel we believe that our success will depend on continued employment of our senior manage ment team and key technical personnel if one or more members of our senior management team were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions our business financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected most of our senior management have employment agreements with artra which will be assumed by entrade upon consummation of the merger and there can be no assurance of continued employment of such persons after the terms of these agreements expire our success also depends on having a highly trained sales force and telesales group our telesales group is being formed we will need to continue to hire additional personnel as our business grows a shortage in the number of trained salespeople could limit our ability to increase sales in our online business communities and to sell services as we launch these online business communities  we plan to expand our employee base to manage our anticipated growth competition for personnel particularly for employees with technical expertise is intense our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected if we cannot hire and retain suitable personnel our systems may not be year  compliant we believe that our orbit system technology and our internal computer systems are year  compliant we may realize exposure and risk however if the systems on which we are dependent to conduct our operations are not year  compliant we are in the process of confirming year  compliance by our third party service providers our potential areas of exposure include products purchased from third parties computers software telephone systems and other equipment used internally also if clients distributors suppliers and other third parties with which we conduct business do not successfully address such issues our business operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected in the event that our webhosting facilities provided by a third party are not year  compliant our production web sites would be unavailable and we would not be able to deliver services to our users in the event that the production and operational facilities that support our web sites are not year  compliant some portions of our web sites may become unavailable the interests of our controlling shareholders after the merger may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders as a result of its stock ownership wwwx may be in a position to affect significantly our corporate actions such as mergers or takeover attempts in a manner that could conflict with the interests of our public shareholders wwwx will own  shares or approximately  of the outstanding shares of entrade common stock after the merger principals of wwwx also hold stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of artra common stock our minority interest in assetradecom and the potential for deadlock in stockholder and board actions may impede the growth and development of assetradecoms operations we currently hold  of the voting common stock of assetradecom positive asset remarketing inc holds a  voting interest and the remaining  is held by butcher fox llc our minority interest could reduce our ability to direct the management and operations of assetradecom furthermore voting interests by the stockholders and board members could become deadlocked any deadlock would impede or prevent the growth and development of assetradecoms operations which would adversely affect our financial position and operations  shares eligible for future sales by our current shareholders may adversely affect our stock price if our shareholders sell substantial amounts of entrade common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market following the merger then the market price of our common stock could fall we also may file one or more registration statements to register all shares of entrade common stock under our stock option plans and warrants that we will be assuming from artra in the merger after such registration state ments are effective shares issued upon exercise of stock options and the warrants will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction except that affiliates of entrade will be required to comply with the registration requirements under the securities act or an exemption from the registration requirements such as rule  antitakeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock could make a third party acquisition of us difficult entrade is a pennsylvania corporation antitakeover provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if such change in control would be beneficial to shareholders our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us the entrade common stock price is likely to be highly volatile the market price of entrade common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general and the market for internetrelated and technology companies in particular has been highly volatile our shareholders may not be able to resell their shares of entrade common stock following periods of volatility because of the markets adverse reaction to such volatility the trading prices of many technology and internetrelated companies stocks have reached historical highs within the last  weeks and have reflected relative valuations substantially above historical levels during the same period such companies stocks have also been highly volatile and have recorded lows well below such historical highs we cannot assure you that our stock will trade at the same levels of other internet stocks or that internet stocks in general will sustain their current market prices factors that could cause such volatility may include among other things o actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results o announcements of technological innovations o new sales formats or new products or services o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  o conditions or trends in the utilities and large manufacturing industry sectors o conditions or trends in the internet industry o changes in the market valuations of other internet companies o announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partner ships or joint ventures o changes in capital commitments o additions or departures of key personnel and o sales of entrade common stock many of these factors are beyond our control these factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance risk factors relating to artra lack of compliance with new york stock exchange listing criteria may result in delisting of artra common stock or after the merger entrade common stock artra has fallen below certain of the new york stock exchanges quantitative and other continued listing criteria pursuant to the new york stock exchanges request artra has provided a definitive action plan demonstrating artras ability to achieve compliance with the new york stock exchanges listing standards including the succession of entrade common stock to such listing after the merger based upon a review of that plan the new york stock exchange is continuing the listing of artra common stock artra and after the merger entrade will be subject to ongoing quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan failure to meet any of the quarterly plan projections could result in the suspension from trading and subsequent delisting of artra common stock and after the merger entrade common stock artras plan is dependent upon consummation of the merger during the third quarter of  if the merger is not consummated artra may not be able to satisfy the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and artra common stock may be delisted from the new york stock exchange artras potential environmental liabilities and other potential liabilities from other claims may result in future costs to artra that are difficult to estimate certain of the former operations of artra and its subsidiaries have been subject to require ments imposed under certain federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including the clean water act the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the occupational safety and health act and comparable state laws relating to  waste water discharges air emissions solid waste management and disposal practices work place safety and real property use and ownership liability under cercla is in most instances strict joint and several meaning that artra could be liable for all response costs incurred as a result of these environmental matters artra and its subsidiaries have from time to time been and currently are involved in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries the currently pending proceedings relate primarily to claims for damages with respect to sites and facilities of baltimore paint and chemical company harvel industries inc dutch boy paints and bagcraft corporation of america artra has provided accruals for certain of these claims various uncertainties however with respect to these and other sites and facilities make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken see information about artra  legal proceedings on page  in recent years artra has been a party to certain product liability claims relating to the former the synkoloid company subsidiary artras product liability insurance has covered all such claims settled or adjudicated to date artra currently anticipates that its product liability insurance is adequate to cover any additional pending claims if claims exceed the insurance coverage however artras financial position could be materially and adversely affected artra preferred stock may impact artras ability to obtain additional financing in the future artra has significant indebtedness liabilities and obligations arising from certain outstand ing issues of redeemable artra preferred stock of artra and its subsidiaries the artra preferred stock however will be converted into entrade common stock upon consummation of the merger the degree to which artra is encumbered could have important consequences if the merger is not consummated including artras ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures product development acquisitions and general corporate purposes mergerrelated risk factors difficulties of integrating the new holding company structure after the merger could direct managements attention from operating the new business the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger will depend in part on the integration of the new operating business of entrade into the new holding company structure in which entrade will be the holding company for artra entradecom and  of the outstanding voting common stock of assetradecom if serious difficulties are encountered during this integration manage ment will have to divert its attention to address these issues which could have an adverse effect on entrades consolidated operations and financial condition also because entrade currently has a minority interest in assetradecom entrade will not have the power to direct the management of assetradecom which could adversely impact the ability of entrade to integrate the new operating business into the holding company structure substantial expenses resulting from the merger may affect quarterly results for the quarter in which the merger is consummated artra and entrade estimate that they will incur aggregate pretax costs of approximately  associated with the merger and related transactions these costs and expenses will affect results of operations in the quarter in which the merger is consummated  exhibit  consent of independent accountants we hereby consent to the use in this supplement to form s of artra group incorporated of our report dated may   relating to the consolidated

wristband asbestos exposure asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems including asbestosis lung cancer and mesothelioma a rare aggressive and incurable cancer asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present at home a public building such as a school or government office a war fought on foreign soil or on the job click to expand in fact occupational exposure is the no  cause of asbestos disease that means roofers carpenters electricians plumbers firefighters auto mechanics insulators factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure those who worked in construction shipyards power plants oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job us military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products especially on navy ships for much of the th century until its longterm toxicity became well known thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance versatility and tensile strength get a free mesothelioma guide free information books wristbands and more for patients and caregivers get your free guide get your free mesothelioma guide how exposure happens asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers while no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe most problems arise after repeated and longterm exposures to the carcinogen environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer but it still happens regularly most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems asbestosrelated disease is  percent preventable that fact motivates me it should motivate all of us if we stopped using asbestos by definition we could stop asbestos disease — dr ken takahashi director of the asbestos diseases research institute harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos when asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut sanded drilled or disturbed in any way microscopic fibers enter the air for example the alaska department of environmental conservation adec took issue with the sandblasting practices of alaskabased shipbuilding and repair facility seward ships drydock the adec issued seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled fugitive particulate emissions at its sandblasting operations if workers sandblasted asbestoscontaining materials such as paint insulation or joint compounds off of a vessel the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them fibers can remain airborne for hours placing anyone nearby in danger once inhaled they can become trapped in the respiratory tract where they may stay for life health risks of exposure once inhaled asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation making breathing increasingly difficult they eventually will cause scarring which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer in the early stages symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until  to  years after the initial exposure each year approximately  to  americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure an estimated  americans die annually from an asbestosrelated disease currently an estimated  people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestosrelated illness pleural plaques these are the most common indication of asbestos exposure they are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs asbestosis asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is not directly caused by asbestos but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease mesothelioma this is a rare aggressive and incurable asbestoscaused cancer lung cancer asbestosrelated lung cancer accounts for approximately  percent of all lung cancer cases asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer where exposure occurs exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments using asbestoscontaining products or working in certain occupations including the us military exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters military every branch of the us armed forces incorporated asbestos people on us navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early s to the s were most at risk since that time thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service battleships aircraft carriers cruisers auxiliary vessels submarines destroyers frigates learn more about veterans and mesothelioma products thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers asbestos may be found in insulation drywall ceiling and floor tiles cements paint and more most homes and commercial buildings built before  contain asbestos products search our asbestos products index occupations workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job drywall tapers electricians firefighters auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk while asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other jobrelated health risks see if your occupation was at risk for exposure job sites asbestos exposure may occur while on the job many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities placing millions of workers at risk for exposure shipyards power plants metal works schools chemical plants oil refineries environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and earthquakes in  the journal of toxicology and environmental health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas the study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising researchers at the university of hawaii cancer center conducted a similar study in  that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in nevada northern california is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos  attack on the world trade center the terrorist attack at the world trade center in new york city on sept   released more than  tons of asbestos into the air causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months according to a  study published in the new england journal of medicine about  percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems it found that  percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble along with nearby residents for

environmental exposures that increase the risk for serious health complications asbestos coverup find out who concealed asbestos risks from their employees learn more read about the asbestos cover up a  study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant the study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma mpm and other asbestosrelated conditions in shubra elkheima egypt an industrial city containing the sigwart company asbestos plant it compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure in total the study had more than  participants the rate of mpm was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure with  percent of this group having the cancer the group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only  percent as expected the control group had the fewest incidences with a rate of  percent these rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening overall the study found a slightly higher but still comparable rate of asbestosrelated illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents improper abatement if asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed it is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks secondhand exposure people can get an asbestosrelated disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral secondhand exposure or indirect exposure can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure while any kind of exposure is much less common today than even  years ago women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the midth century at that time men comprised the majority of the industrial working class the occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestoscontaining products workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them occurrences of secondhand exposure secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children if children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age they may develop an asbestosrelated disease in their adult years there are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure laundry the clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure because of the jagged structure of the fibers the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure furniture if a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home fibers could have become embedded in the couch chairs carpet bed and other pieces of furniture hugs if a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work while family members didnt have any direct contact with asbestoscontaining products the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life between  and  researchers at mount sinai medical center in new york city studied the health of  family members from the  workers employed at a factory in patterson new jersey researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers family members sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former patterson factory workers  years after the factory shut down compensation for asbestos exposure let us help you gain access to trust funds and other forms of compensation for mesothelioma victims get help now get financial assistance legal claims for secondhand exposure like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation in order to bring a successful legal claim they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers this usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job

asbestos exposure  asbestos manufacturers help us raise awareness get a free wristband asbestos products manufacturers even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world the industry continues to thrive concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than  nations — including the entire european union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use strict us regulations took hold in the s yet countries like russia china brazil and kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale compensation for mesothelioma victims gain access to trust funds grants and other forms of compensation for you or your loved ones get help now at the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life since the late s american companies like the johns manville corporation amassed great wealth by mining manufacturing and selling asbestoscontaining products centuries later medical evidence revealed johns manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers in decades past asbestos use was far more pervasive in the united states contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding construction power generation and heavy manufacturing since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the s asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy in many cases companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits compensation for mesothelioma victims companies that

evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause lifethreatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer asbestosis and mesothelioma the consumption of contaminated products in the united states and many other countries continues according to a  inventory of more than  asbestosladen products approximately  companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year fast fact in  crown cork  seal acquired mundet cork inheriting more than  million current and future asbestos liabilities history of manufacturing although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years it was only during the industrial revolution of the late s that the industry flourished a natural resistance to heat chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications soon enough manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines piping and locomotives thousands of other uses later emerged and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers gaskets cement roofing materials and automotive brake pads by the early th century some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers but rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation internal documents indicate that johns manville executives were aware of the risks as early as  the company conducted private medical studies around this time and the negative results remained confidential for decades asbestos use increased throughout world war ii largely because of military shipbuilding contracts the us government required asbestos insulation be used in us navy and us coast guard vessels for several decades after the war hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products in addition to johns manville other leading asbestos manufacturers include owens corningfibreboard corp raybestosmanhattan co national gypsum corporation wr grace  co celotex corp by the s scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestoss harmful effects one landmark occupational study conducted by dr irving selikoff in  showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers results indicated that between  and  an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer including lung cancer mesothelioma stomach cancer and colorectal cancer selikoffs findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use the result was a significant downturn for americas asbestos industry the us environmental protection agency epa dealt another blow to the industry with the clean air act of  it established the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants several new regulations directly affected the industry specifically companies that milled sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials by the late s many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products although the us geological survey asserts that us asbestos use has fallen  percent since  it is not yet banned in the united states limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials building materials like cement and in various textiles fast fact a c  s stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in  but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade products during the peak era of asbestos consumption it was incorporated into approximately  types of products one of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products a use that spanned industries including construction shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos including ceiling tiles joint compounds cement drywall and roofing materials these products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air the toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope cloth and garments shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction such as gaskets and brake pads contained some percentage of asbestos industries  occupations according to the world health organization about  million people experience workplace exposure worldwide by far the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral these activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction while drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project shipyard workers especially during the world war ii era experienced heavy exposure as well tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous also at risk were pipefitters boiler workers and electricians who serviced us navy and us coast guard ships litigation  specific lawsuits a staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos according to one litigation report from  an estimated  people filed related claims against at least  corporations some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimilliondollar verdicts or outofcourt settlements when courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering medical expenses lost income and loss of consortium many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings in one standout  case us steel was ordered to pay  million to roby whittington the wife of a former us steel employee who died of mesothelioma several other manufacturers defended the case but us steel was found  percent liable for whittington’s death georgiapacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and the jury awarded mrs whittington  million in damages and  million in punitive damages a san francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to alfred todak holding more than  firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis a former electrician todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard navy vessels from  to  eighteen firms settled with todak out of court for a total of  million and foster wheeler ltd contributed  percent of the jury’s  million verdict todak’s wife also received  million for related losses more recently a  lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of  million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets the gasket manufacturers goodyear tire and rubber and goodyear canada were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of walter koczur and eugene mccarthy despite both being longtime smokers fast fact pittsburgh corning announced in  that it would pay out  million in cash over the next  years to cover asbestosrelated claims trust funds with multibilliondollar liabilities looming many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain yet steadily rising costs of legal compensation the us government estimates that more than  companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation including industry giants like national gypsum dana corporation and eaglepicher industries as part of their reorganization plans companies often create personal injury trusts forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities since johns manville created the first trust in  nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust by  these trusts had awarded a total of  billion some of the largest trusts include company funding for claims usg corp  billion pittsburgh corning  billion owens
