james executive assistant view profile pramod dhavan assistant manager compensation and benefits view profile anna knight brand director marketing technology i joined ubm as head of marketing for conferences and within two years was leading marketing teams for many events across europe and the middle east i’ve had the opportunity to manage lots of different teams and work across loads of different brands often collaborating with colleagues in the us and asia i don’t think i’ll ever get bored of the rush you get from opening the doors to an event and seeing swarms of happy visitors coming through the doors it’s so satisfying knowing you helped two people connect and change the way they think and build their business recently i took on a brand director role for our customer tech and licensing portfolio – a brand new role for me and a brand new role for ubm we never stand still here and i love the variety of what i do vicki chan international marketing manager  customer insights joining ubm has given me a different perspective about working in businesstobusiness i thought it wouldn’t be as exciting as consumer work  however in my plus years working in ubm i experience something new every day   as part of the international marketing team in ubm asia i get to succeed in every aspect of marketing while working with different exhibitions and creating a one and only event for our marketers – the ubm asia marketing meeting   now i have taken up a new position in the customer insights team combining knowledge about our customers to create better marketing  working in ubm is like an adventure with new encounters just around the corner every day chiara giorgi event manager i’ve always loved running events being able to follow a process and see those steps come to fruition makes me feel fulfilled that moment when you can take a step back and see everyone together at your event enjoying themselves – that’s what makes all the work worthwhile almost six years ago i joined ubm conferences as a conference coordinator because it allowed me to touch events across many different industries in many different areas of the world the third conference i ever worked on was cruise shipping asia pacific it was then that i realized i would like to eventually focus on the cruise and maritime portfolio four roles three offices and two continents later i am now the event manager for seatrade cruise global where i manage the team and strategy for the annual event that brings the global cruise industry together throughout my time at ubm i have had the pleasure to work with some of the most intelligent passionate and hardworking people and look forward to continuing to do so in the future raquell james executive assistant after joining ubm as an executive assistant in the technology department i began to realize that my potential opportunities were limitless i am a strong believer that anyone can create the career they want but must be willing to do the work it takes to get there – what better place than ubm in search of a true “events first” understanding i connected with several show directors for the chance to attend some of our events held at the nearby javits center doing so allowed me to attend and work at each of the events that have taken place in new york since i started at ubm my role in the technology team allows me to see many areas across the ubm business i am able to learn all sides of the company and i believe it allows me to become well rounded as an employee and individual the culture at ubm is amazing everyone is friendly and always willing to provide a helping hand i am happy with my decision to join the ubm family pramod dhavan assistant manager compensation and benefits the essence of mathematics is to make complicated things simple thats why i took a degree in mathematics i also want to bring change to our world at ubm i do both budgeting and forecasting for human resources i make sure we pay people fairly and in ways that align with our strategy i also support ubm in its goal to build a more sustainable business  for its people and the larger world i am doing great work because i am at the right place i feel there is always a scope for further improvement be it a business our society or the environment true leaders rise to the situations in front of them so i was excited when ubm sponsored my  trip to the one young world event organised by a ukbased charity one young world gathers together young leaders from around the world empowering them to make lasting connections to create positive change i still remember that special pat by professor muhammad yunus a nobel peace prize laureate working with ubm gives me an opportunity to work on my passion while
