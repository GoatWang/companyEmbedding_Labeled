last year cn‘s change in revenue was close to the amount of its change in earnings it remains to be seen how the rest of its peer group’s results will turn out and if cn‘s performance is a sign of any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector also for comparison purposes revenues changed by  and earnings by  compared to the previous period earnings growth analysis the company’s earnings rose yearonyear but this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations gross margins went from  to  for the same period last year while operating margins ebitda margins went from  to  over the same time frame gross margin trend companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors capital cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital if the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting propup using the balance sheet cn‘s decline in gross margins were offset by some improvements on the balance sheet the management of working capital for example shows progress the company’s working capital days have fallen to  days from  days for the same period last year this leads capital cube to conclude that the gross margin decline is not altogether bad cash versus earnings – sustainable performance it is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable cn‘s yearonyear change in operating cash flow of  is around its change in earnings this suggests that there are likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves for managing earnings this period margins despite a decline in operating ebit margins as well as a decline in pretax margins the company’s earnings rose
