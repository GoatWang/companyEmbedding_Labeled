in marketing also known as customerperceived value is the difference between a prospective customers evaluation of the benefits and costs of one product when compared with others value may also be expressed as a straightforward relationship between perceived benefits and perceived costs value  benefits  cost the basic underlying concept of value in marketing is human needs the basic human needs may include food shelter belonging love and self expression both culture and individual personality shape human needs in what is known as wants when wants are backed by buying power they become demands with a consumers wants and resources financial ability they demand products and services with benefits that add up to the most value and satisfaction the four types of value include functional value monetary value social value and psychological value the sources of value are not equally important to all consumers how important a value is depends on the consumer and the purchase values should always be defined through the eyes of the consumer functional value this type of value is what an offer does its the solution an offer provides to the customer monetary value this is where the function of the price paid is relative to an offerings perceived worth this value invites a tradeoff between other values and monetary costs social value the extent to which owning a product or engaging in a service allows the consumer to connect with others psychological value the extent to which a product allows consumers to express themselves or feel better for a firm to deliver value to its customers they must consider what is known as the total market offering this includes the reputation of the organization staff representation product benefits and technological characteristics as compared to competitors market offerings and prices value can thus be defined as the relationship of a firms market offerings to those of its competitors value in marketing can be defined by both qualitative and quantitative measures on the qualitative side value is the perceived gain composed of individuals emotional mental and physical condition plus various social economic cultural and environmental factors on the quantitative side value is the actual gain measured in terms of financial numbers percentages and dollars for an organization to deliver value it has to improve its value  cost ratio when an organization delivers high value at high price the perceived value may be low when it delivers high value at low price the perceived value may be high the key to deliver high perceived value is attaching value to each of the individuals or organizations—making them believe that what you are offering is beyond expectation—helping them to solve a problem offering a solution giving results and making them happy value changes based on time place and people in relation to changing environmental factors it is a creative energy exchange between people and organizations in our marketplace very often managers conduct customer value analysis to reveal the companys strengths and weaknesses compared to other competitors the steps of which are as followed to identify the major attributes and benefits that customers value for choosing a product and vendor assessment of the quantitative importance of the different attributes and benefits assessment of the companys and

maintains that both approaches have the same objectivec to create superior customer value because regardless of which of these routes is emphasized the effort will fail unless significant customer value is created day  p  day  addresses the issues in analyzing customer value and proposes that it can be expressed in a value equation customers perceived benefitscustomers perceived costsperceived customer value p  although days approach to customer value is basically sound some details regarding consumer customers remain unclear for example the process by which consumers perceive product benefits is nebulous day particularly addresses product valuation by industrial customers in detail but this is only in principle a part of a much more complex process of product valuation by consumers hence a theoretical framework which underlies the consumers overall product valuation is still missing in the literature such a framework should address the issues of how consumers perceive the benefits and costs of products as well as what possible benefits and costs consumers may perceive from products in the market the current paper tries to fill these gaps in addition the word value has discrepant meanings in the marketing literature especially between its two areas marketing strategy and consumer behavior what marketing strategists mean by customer value is quite different from the meanings of the consumer values discussed in consumer behavior research clawson and vinson  kahle  peter and olson  sheth newman and gross  vinson scott and lamont  wilkie  generally speaking customer value focuses on the buyers evaluation of product purchase at the time of buying while consumer values stress peoples valuation on the consumption or possession of products actually days approach to customer value day  by emphasizing the customers perceptions indicates a direction in which the two different but related concepts of values in marketing discipline might be integrated the current paper helps accomplish this integration by suggesting a model of customer value for consumer markets this paper first reviews the literature on consumption behavior analysis relevant to marketing strategy next a framework of product valuation for consumers and its typology of product benefit are proposed based on the consumption behavior analysis after the process of product valuation for consumers has been made clear the paper presents a comprehensive model of customer value for the consumer market integrating consumer values product benefits logistic benefits and various costs of consumption in the proposed model product benefits logistic benefits and costs are defined in terms of consumers perception in the activities of acquisition consumption or using and maintenance as well as consumers expectation of personal values satisfaction before buying finally the implications of consumption behavior analysis for marketing strategy are discussed consumption behavior analysis and marketing strategy many marketing researchers have maintained that detailed analyses of consumption behavior are the fundamental basis for creating superior customer value for consumers day  boyd and levy  treacy and wiersema  normann and ramirez  the importance of a comprehensive analysis of customers consumption activities in planning effective marketing strategies was first pointed out by boyd and levy  they maintain that marketing strategies should be planned and implemented in terms of the customers needs and behavior patterns also the core element of an effective marketing plan is to think in terms of the consumption system in which the product plays a part boyd and levy defined a consumption system as the way a purchaser of a product performs the total task  that he or she is trying to accomplish when using the product c not baking a cake but preparing a meal boyd and levy  pp  underlying this systematic view of consumption are at least two concepts critical to customer value analysis first this systematic view looks beyond the purchase behavior of buyers to the use behavior of consumers whatever reasons people have for buying a particular product are rooted in how they use that product and how well it serves the use to which they put it boyd and levy  p  second the systematic view emphasizes the dynamic interrelations between the products that comprise a consumption system the use behavior for a particular product is bound to be affected not only by  the task to be performed with the use of that product but also by the related products and their use behaviors that make up the total consumption system boyd and levy  p  based on their observation of the holistic nature of customer judgment day et al  advocated the application of customeroriented approaches to defining a productmarket and then identifying its competitive structure in particular day and his colleagues endorsed a usagesituation approach to defining a productmarket or competitive structure the usagesituation approach emphasizes that the anticipated use the functions to be served and the consumption context of a product ultimately influence consumers choices among productsbrands srivastava  although it takes a systematic view of consumption the usagesituation approach stresses that the substitutability among productsbrands in the usagesituation determines market structures ie the competitive providers of the producttype in question srivastava alpert and shocker  while the usagesituation approach is based on the holistic view of consumption behavior and is dubbed customeroriented it deals only with companies need to define their productmarket structures it has nothing to do with the analysis of customer value and how this value can be expanded as solomon  points out conventional marketing research has paid much more attention to the substitutability of products than to their complementarity and the usagesituation approach is no exception in summary the literature on consumption behavior analysis can proceed further to conceptualize the aspects of complementarityinuse of products through which consumer may derive product benefits holistically in the product complement figure  a framework of product valuation for consumers consumers product valuation and typology of product benefits the questions of how and what consumers perceive from products in the market request the process and structure by which consumers value the products based on consumption behavior analysis the current paper proposes a framework of product valuation for consumers and its typology of product benefits see figure  this model stresses that to investigate the consumers product valuation it is necessary to integrate cultural values personal values consumption values and product benefits clawson and vinson  cultural values cultural social and familial environments affect the formation and development of individual beliefs in a sociocultural environment a set of values usually represents widely shared beliefs about what is desirable these sociocultural beliefs are called cultural values or society core values engel blackwell and miniard  and are implanted into individuals naturally through socialization and education perhaps with some modification as personality and attitude moderate the learning process for example kahle  proposes a list of values lov generic to american culture in the s such as selfrespect security selffulfillment fun and enjoyment in life and warm relationships with others these cultural values are seen by some social thinkers as objective frondizi  this notion of being objective implies that they are commonly known to the members of a society however not all of the cultural values in a society will be adopted unanimously by its members some cultural values might be followed by only a small portion of the people while other values might be accepted widely in sum cultural values are generic beliefs about what a society argues to be desirable and beneficial these values are then freely adopted on an individual basis personal values personal values are the individuals beliefs about what are desirable to themselves they are selfcentered that is personal values are closely linked to needs moreover they are derived from and modified through personal social and cultural learning clawson and vinson  from a cognitive perspective personal values are the mental representations of underlying needs after the modification taking into account the realities of the world and reflecting the individuals personality wilkie  for example the cultural value of selffulfillment might be manifested quite differently in the minds of two individuals with different familial and personal backgrounds according to rokeach  human values have two main types terminal and instrumental terminal or endstate values are beliefs people have about the goals for which they strive eg selffulfillment or enjoyment in life instrumental or means values are beliefs about desirable ways to attain these terminal values eg owning an elegant house or taking a vacation therefore personal values generally correspond to terminal values while values of desirable activities to be discussed next are comparable to instrumental values personal values are enduring beliefs which guide various actions and judgments across specific situations hence personal values are more abstract and may be generalizable easier than values of actions in other words the concept of personal values is similar to the idea of global values in the realm of a persons perception proposed by vinson et al  these are small in number dozens and considered to be at high levels of conceptualization consumption values consumption values refer to subjective beliefs about desirable ways to attain personal values people achieve personal values or goals through actions or activities such as social interaction economic exchange possession and consumption sheth et al  according to meansend chain models of consumer product knowledge peter and olson  people may have ideas and preferences about various actions that can help them achieve personal values therefore relative to personal values consumption values are instrumental in nature for example owning an elegant house and acquiring a prestigious car are for some people desirable ways of achieving selffulfillment attending football games especially those of favorite teams and taking a vacation trip are favorable activities which lead to personal fun and enjoyment furthermore individuals may hold several personal values by which they direct or evaluate consumption activities therefore the consumption values of these types of activities or possessions are sophisticated and do not simply satisfy one single personal value shet et al  as we can observe in ourselves or others consumption activities usually include an assortment of goods and services boyd and levy  for example owning an elegant house requires house owners to acquire many goods and services in addition to the house itself just as taking a vacation trip involves many other related acquisitions moreover in a product constellation for a consumption activity there may be some properties in common mccracken  observes that the consumer goods in any complement are linked by some commonality or unity p  from a social interaction perspective solomon  maintains that consumers employ product constellations in setting the stage for the social roles they play product constellations occur because individuals use entire complements of products to achieve personal values the products unified in a constellation all carry the same information about individual values furthermore lai  maintained that consumers may obtain satisfaction holistically from the related consumption activities and the constellation of products in use consumption schemata cognitive psychologists maintain that people may acquire knowledge structures to represent various consumption activities and product constellations abelson  crocker  lai  uses the term consumption schema to refer to the cognitive structure which organizes and represents personal ideas and beliefs about the substance of a consumption activity such as interrelationships among complementary products the cultural value and social meanings of the commodities and personal preferences and affective associations hence a consumption schema represents a consumers basic thoughts about a consumption activity though peripheral adjustments may be needed to accommodate the specific situation in which the consumption takes place in short in consumption or possession of products people may acquire personal consumption schemata or a particular planned pattern including their anticipation of and requirements for a product or a complement of products reflecting their consumption values of that consumption or possession typology of product benefits from the customers perspective products are viewed as a bundle of benefits not attributes day  peter and olson  in other words customers are less interested in the technical features of a product or service than in what benefits they get from buying using or consuming the product hooley and saunders  p  in a competitive market in addition to their basic benefits products usually have many other attributes such as features styles symbolism durability quality and related services by designing products with combinations of these attributes marketers try to attract consumers with particular consumption values a comprehensive understanding of possible benefits that customers may seek in products is a fundamental basis for marketers to formulate sound marketing strategies especially product differentiation or positioning peter  boyd and levy  sheth et al  categorize five product benefits which influence the consumers choice behavior functional social emotional epistemic and conditional however these benefits are only generic that is they are general potential and not yet applied to a specific consumption activity moreover because sheth et als analysis is not grounded in a holistic approach to consumption behavior analysis sheth and his colleagues conflate product benefits with consumption values that is they do not distinguish generic product benefits from consumption values as the current paper does furthermore their categorization ignores other important generic product benefits eg hedonic benefits aesthetic benefits and holistic benefits going beyond sheth et als original categorization of product benefits sheth et al dubbed them as consumption values the current paper proposes a typology of product benefits that a consumer may derive from possession or consumption the typology includes eight generic product benefits functional social affective epistemic aesthetic hedonic situational and holistic the definitions of these terms are discussed briefly in what follows  functional benefit refers to a products capacity for functional utilitarian or physical performance functional benefits are derived from the tangible and concrete attributes that a consumer may directly experience when using or consuming the product  social benefits are the perceptual benefits acquired from a products association with social class social status or a specific social group highly visible products eg clothing jewelry and automobiles often carry social benefits  affective benefit refers to the perceptual benefit acquired from a products capacity to arouse feelings or affective states affective benefits are often associated with culturalethnic meanings eg christmas trees thanksgiving turkeys or personal idiosyncratic meanings tastes and memories eg foods that arouse feelings of comfort through their association with childhood experiences or cars with which consumers are said to have love affairs  epistemic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a products capacity to satisfy curiosity provide novelty andor meet a desire for knowledge exploratory noveltyseeking and varietyseeking consumption behaviors are examples of epistemic value pursuit also a consumers propensity to adopt new products is consistent with epistemic benefit sheth et al   aesthetic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a products capacity to present a sense of beauty or to enhance personal expression aesthetic benefit usually is subjective and idiosyncratic style demands productappearance demands art purchases and fashionfollowing are examples of consumers pursuing aesthetic benefits  hedonic benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a products capacity to meet a need of enjoyment fun pleasure or distraction from work or anxiety olshavsky and granbois  claim that hedonic benefit is an important dimension of many products people are not always looking for rational or serious benefits they may want to relax or be distracted taking a vacation trip going to bars watching sports comic movies or tv programs or even buying funny trinkets to make fun of friends are examples of hedonic benefit pursuit  situational benefit refers to the benefit acquired from a products capacity to meet situational needs in specific circumstances a product acquires situational value in the presence of antecedent physical or social contingencies that enhance its functional social or other benefits situational benefit is measured on the profile of a particular consumption situation  holistic benefit refers to the perceptual benefit acquired from the complementarity coherence compatibility and consistency in a product constellation as a whole holistic benefits are frequently required and perceived in clothes furniture and food consumption holistic product benefit is a result of synergy derived from a product combination its implications for marketing strategy will be discussed later in detail different types of product benefits may be correlated and combined in particular consumption activities or there may be trading off between them in addition a product may offer multiple generic benefits for example to a firsttime home buyer the purchase of a home might provide functional benefit the home contains more space than the present apartment social benefit friends are also buying homes emotional benefit the consumer feels secure in owning a home epistemic benefit the novelty of purchasing a home is enjoyable and situational benefit starting a family the braces are the authors to substitute the word benefit for the original word value and avoid confusion the parentheses however are in the original passage sheth et al  p  perceived product benefits generic product benefits are intended benefits that manufacturers design into a product however these intended benefits may or may not be perceived or appreciated by particular consumers a product has benefit to customers to the degree that they can perceive appreciate and then use that product as anticipated consumption activities to achieve personal values normann and ramirez  recapitulate this concept well a companys offerings have values to the degree that customers can use them as inputs to leverage their own value creation in this respect then companies dont profit from customers they profit from customers valuecreating activities p  in sum consumers perceive and appreciate product benefits via their personal consumption values and consumption schemata these product benefits are termed perceived product benefits day  in summary the framework of consumers product valuation delineates the relationship between personal values generic product benefits and perceived product benefits via consumption values and consumption schemata see figure  that is it illuminates the structure of consumers product valuation and how and what benefits consumers may perceive from products with this framework of product valuation for consumers and its typology of product benefits in place the current paper proceeds to investigate the concept of customer value a model of customer value for consumer markets customer value and consumer values many marketing strategists and industrialorganization io economists emphasize that creating superior customer value is a key element for companies success day  porter  however what they mean by customer value is quite different from the meanings of the consumer values we have discussed above value to marketing strategists means a return for something in an exchange eg the value of the dollar is variable therefore the meaning of customer value is a level of return in the product benefits for certain amount of customers money ie the price in a purchase exchange eg to give the buyer good value at the right price in addition the concept of customer value has by nature a normative perspective since it is a fundamental concept underlying the competitive analysis in the field of io based on economic principles and the customers choice in the market consumer behavior researchers on the other hand generally use the word values to mean something desirable useful or important peter and olson  our previous discussion also adopted this meaning consumer research usually is based on a descriptivestudy perspective such as in the fields of anthropology sociology and psychology therefore consumer values refers to the important personal goals that consumers are seeking wilkie  furthermore consumer behavior researchers emphasize that people can achieve some of their personal values through possession or consumption of products peter and olson  sheth et al  in summary customer value normatively focuses on a buyers evaluation at the time of a product purchase while consumer values descriptively stresses peoples valuation of product consumption or possession consumer researchers will argue that consumers buy products not for the sake of its transactional value a simple term for customer value but for the products benefits that will satisfy their needs or personal values our earlier discussions of the process of consumer valuation explored the domain of consumer benefits in product consumption or possession however in an exchange environment product benefits alone do not completely explain consumers product choice often consumers may find products very desirable yet in assuming that the consumer has adequate financial capacity one must not equally assume that a purchase must follow these cases imply that normative points of view are also necessary in consumer choice research from an economics perspective consumers may apply costandbenefit evaluation to a purchase decision at least when the costs are significant to them olshavsky and granbois  therefore with respect to a sound customer value analysis for a consumer market both the descriptive and normative aspects are essential boyd and levy  day  the current paper proposes a comprehensive model of customer value for consumer markets see figure  based on days original idea of value equation and emphasizing customers perception day  this model integrates descriptive and normative points of view about consumer behavior including the consumer values expectation before purchase customer value evaluation at the time of buying and value actualization in consumption or possession figure  a model of customer value for consumer market the model according to social psychologists peoples perception of objects and events is influenced by their cognitive traits eg personality and attitude personal values and consumption schemata and demographics eg age education income and wealth and time resources as indicated in figure  these factors of customer characteristics are the background of the customers perception the buyers evaluation of a product purchase begins from their perceived product benefits the earlier discussions of consumers product valuation have proposed a framework about how the customers perceive product benefits based on their terminal personal values and instrumental consumption values or consumption schemata in addition the discussion has suggested and illustrated a typology of generic product benefits with eight categories as indicated in figure  the model suggests that perceived product benefits could be a single type or a combination of the eight categories of product benefits nowadays product benefits based on consumption or use of the product are not the sole benefits consumers can perceive day  they may also derive benefits of a purchase from the buying activities per se and other consumption supporting features treacy and wiersema  claim that todays customers have an expanded concept of value purchase benefits that includes convenience of purchase and aftersale service p  in addition to the traditional product benefits such as quality and price we conceptualize these new dimensions of purchase benefit and denote them as logistic benefits logistic benefits of a product purchase are those benefits consumers can derive from the buying per se and other afterpurchase consumption supporting features about the product these include the purchase convenience buying pleasure variety of choice short ordering time availability of parts and supplies warranty and aftersale service for the purpose of this discussion the current paper does not probe the typology of logistic benefits these logistic features if designed by marketers in the product deal are also subject to subjective consumers perceptions to become desirable benefits for customers moreover the perceptions of the customers are moderated by their personal values consumption values and other individual characteristics see figure  as mentioned above the costs of obtaining the perceived product and logistic benefits are usually the major concerns of buyers since consumers may apply principles of costsandbenefits to evaluate a purchase the model proposes that the relevant costs of a purchase considered by consumer include monetary cost time cost risks and human energy cost furthermore every category of the costs may play a part in purchase possession consumption and maintenance the monetary cost refers simply to monetary payment the time cost refers to the amount of time required for the relevant activities of acquisition or consumption consumers encounter risks when they face the uncertainty or potential negative consequences of consumer activities being cheated overcharged or misled into buying an unnecessary product while possessing or using certain products such as unconventional clothes may incur social costs which include being teased by colleagues maintenance risks include being overcharged for supplies and or suffering the possibility that they will be discontinued finally the human energy cost refers to physical effort difficulty of operation and cognitive energy these might be of great concern to elderly customers nevertheless all of these costs like the benefits are also subject to consumers perception since perceptions of time money risk and human energy vary among people these costs may be evaluated differently among customers according to the costandbenefit principle customers evaluate the benefits against the costs and perceive the buying value of products as indicated in figure  the inputs of evaluation are the perceived product benefits perceived logistic benefits and perceived costs however as suggested by many paradigms in consumer research such as expectancyvalue research fishbein and ajzen  and eliminationbyaspects analysis tversky  not all benefits and costs are equally evaluated some benefits and costs are considered central factors and are therefore weighted heavily while others are perceived as peripheral factors and weighted less this phenomenon concerning consumers idiosyncratic patterns of weighting for the evaluating factors is also reflected in the model finally the model suggests that customer value is a consequence of subjective evaluation which in turn results from the summing up of the various perceived benefits and perceived costs taking into account the differently weighted factors in other words the perceived customer value in the model is defined as the surplus or the difference between perceived benefits and perceived costs day  that is it refers to a level of subjective return for the customer perceived costs discussion implications for marketing strategy in the current model of consumer customer value product benefits logistic benefits and costs are defined in terms of consumers perception in the activities of acquisition consumption or using and maintenance as well as consumers expectation of personal values satisfaction before buying in other words our consumption behavior approach is holistic analysisoriented going beyond traditional customeroriented methods which usually focus on the buyers economic evaluation at purchase as emphasized in the model the importance of product benefits logistic benefits and costs vary among people due to their individual characteristics these phenomena have led in marketing practice to benefit or cost segmentationc the process of dividing consumers into homogenous subgroups or segments based on their interest in particular product benefits the benefits most important central to target customers is a fundamental issue in marketing strategies such as product differentiation and positioning for example to succeed with a value strategy also a high price strategy a company needs to offer products with premium quality in the central benefits such that their customers correctly perceive those benefits and are willing to pay the price premium treacy and wiersema  on the other hand to make a cost strategy or a low price strategy profitable a company must offer products with an acceptable level of quality in the central benefits and minimal quality in the peripheral factors such that their customers will enjoy the product and perceive the purchase as a value normann and ramfrez  the current papers implications for market positioning are clear its categorization of generic product and logistic benefits may help marketers identify their target consumers central and peripheral benefits then the typology could help companies design their products and related marketing programs such as advertising and distribution holistic product benefits and marketing strategy one new category of product benefit introduced in the current paper is the holistic product benefits customers may perceive and appreciate in a product constellation this type of product benefit has been largely ignored in the literature their implications for marketing practice will be discussed next in consumption settings where multiple products are needed the product constellation forms a consumption system boyd and levy  a consumer may obtain utility holistically from the product constellation based on a personal consumption schema when a consumer tries to combine a product constellation and to construct from it a meaningful combination certain dimensions of compatibility and complementarity between products may be critical to perception of the products benefits these dimensions briefly described here for a detail discussion and examples please see lai   functional exhaustivity suggests that products are combined in a way that the required functions are completely fulfilled  operational connectivity suggests that the operations or the physical shapes and positions of the products are smoothly connected  aesthetic coherence relates to the sense of beauty or to personal expression in the product constellation and  meaningrole consistency refers to the perceived coherence between the cultural meanings of products and the social roles which the consumers assume solomon  the holistic product benefits may be a good basis for product positioning as defined previously in the current paper holistic product benefit refers to the perceptual benefits acquired from the complementarity coherence compatibility and consistency in a product constellation as a whole a company could set itself apart from the competition by identifying and promoting itself as the best provider of certain holistic benefits of a product constellation to satisfy consumers needs in pursuing a competitive positioning through holistic product benefits the company may need to reshape its business scope or redefine its product lines and consequently obtain its sustainable competitive advantage organizations can design competitive marketing strategies based on meaningful and desirable combinations of product benefits for their customers how to select a competitive strategy and the desirable benefits of the product will largely depend on the companys knowledge about the customers consumption behavior in addition the relative defensibility of the strategy in the market is another problem in selecting a competitive strategy the consumption behavior approach to the customer value would provide more strengths in strategy defensibility for example the positioning through holistic product benefits can enjoy the synergetic effects derived from a meaningful product combination that is developed from a comprehensive knowledge of customer consumption behavior furthermore sometimes a company has to coordinate a complementary business group also a synergy generating activity to provide meaningful product combinations to customers normann and ramirez  in these situations the defensibility of the competitive strategy would be even stronger because of the synergetic effects normann and ramirez  recapitulate this implication for marketing strategy well one of the chief strategic challenges of the new economy is to integrate the consumption behavior knowledge and the interfirm relationshipsc devise a good fit between companies competencies and customers customers needs or individual values p  conclusion the consumption behavior approach to customer value can be an effective way of achieving more innovation enhancing customer value and obtaining greater marketing penetration and strategy sustainability consumption like production involves a constellation of goods and consumption values or desirable benefits if marketers think of consumers as engaged in a constructive process by which they achieve their consumption values it may be easy to see that a variety of holistic benefits are involved as customers use the products boyd and levy  although the marketers may already plan and act in terms of consumer needs and behavior patterns they can gain even more insight if they study consumers consumption behaviors in which their products play a part for knowledge of the customers consumption behavior to be truly meaningful much more would have to be known about the customers personal values feelings and thoughts and consumption values in other words understanding the consumers consumption behavior means that their activities should be analyzed thoroughly and holistically from the expectation about consumption values at the prepurchase stage to the purchase evaluation at the stage of selection and acquisition to consumption values actualization in the stage of use possession and maintenance one caveat about customer value greater customer value does not necessarily equal greater customer satisfaction customer value is defined as the difference or surplus between benefits and costs it is a level of return for customer costs from a cognitive perspective according to expectation theory satisfaction is the result of a comparison between what actually occurs and what is expected hence the customers buying satisfaction depends on both their perceived value of the purchase and their knowledge of what a fair level of buying value should be in short customers will feel satisfied to the extent that the perceived value of their buying exceeds the standard they hold from this point of view exceeding value is the key for customer satisfaction not customer value per se a surplus value this issue can be viewed as an avenue for further study references abelson robert p  script processing in attitude formation and decision making in cognition

comment credit related terms exporting an international exchange rate also known as a foreign exchange fx rate is the price of one countrys currency in terms of another countrys currency foreign exchange rates are relative and are expressed as the value of one currency compared to another when selling products internationally the exchange rate for the two trading countries currencies is an important factor foreign exchange rates in fact are one of the most important determinants of a countries relative level of economic health ranking just after interest rates and inflation exchange rates play a vital role in a countrys level of trade which is critical to most every free market economy in the world consequently exchange rates are among the most watched analyzed and manipulated economic measures recent history prior to  foreign exchange rates were fixed by an agreement among the worlds central banks called the bretton woods accord this agreement was entered into after world war ii the world was in a shambles and the bretton woods accord was established to help stabilize the volatile situation by pegging the us dollar to gold and all other currencies of the world to the us dollar in  a new agreement was formulated to replace the bretton woods accord but it was short lived in  the worlds currencies began to be valued and exchanged based on a freefloat system a system still in place in  the freefloat system is a default system of currency trading it works strictly on supply and demand of currencies there are no limits on how much currencies can appreciate or depreciate in value measured against other currencies because this can cause volatility central banks and governments have tried to regulate the values of their currencies but it has become an increasingly costly proposition although no longer an official standard the us dollar remains the benchmark currency with the japanese yen ¥ and european euro ‚¬ close behind currency value factors a number of factors influence exchange rates these include all of the following relative rates of inflation comparative interest rates growth of domestic money supply size and trend of a countrys balance of payments economic growth as measured by the gross national product dependency on outside energy sources central bank intervention in addition to these measures of economic activity the consensus perception of a majority of countries about the overall strength of one countrys currency can have a strong impact on how that one countrys currency is valued the foreign exchange market as nations and their economies have become increasingly interdependent the fx market has emerged as a global focal point with an estimated daily fx turnover exceeding  trillion this is by far the worlds largest market in order to remain competitive in the world economy it is vital to manage the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in recent times the worldwide trend has been toward the consolidation of markets and currencies as in the case of the european economic union the largest users of the fx market are commercial banks which serve as intermediaries between currency buyers and sellers corporations and financial institutions also trade currencies primarily to safeguard their foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities against adverse fx rate movement banks and fund managers trade currencies to profit from fx rate movements individuals also are subject to fluctuating fx rates most commonly when a traveler exchanges hisher native currency for a foreign one before embarking on a business trip or vacation when the chicago mercantile exchange introduced trading in foreign currency futures in  it enabled all currency market participants including individual investors to capitalize on fx rate fluctuations without having to make or take delivery of the actual currencies foreign currency futures offer risk management and profit opportunities to individual investors as well as to small firms and large companies there are two types of potential users of foreign currency futures the hedger and the speculator the hedger seeks to reduce and manage the risk of financial losses that can arise from transacting business in currencies other than ones native currency speculators provide risk capital and assume the risk the hedger is seeking to transfer in the hope of making a profit by correctly forecasting future price movement the effect of exchange rate changes on business the results of companies that operate in more than one nation often must be translated from foreign currencies into us dollars exchange rate fluctuations make financial forecasting more difficult for these companies and also have a marked effect on unit sales prices and costs for example assume that current market conditions dictate that one us dollar can be exchanged for  japanese yen in this business environment an american auto dealer plans to import a japanese car with a price of  million yen which translates to a price in dollars of  if that dealer also incurred  in transportation costs and decided to mark up the price of the car by another  then the vehicle would sell for  and provide the dealer with a profit margin of  percent but if the exchange rate changed before the deal was made so that one dollar was worth  yen—in other words if the dollar weakened or depreciated compared to the yen—it would have a dramatic effect on the business transaction the dealer would then have to pay the japanese manufacturer  for the car adding in the same costs and mark up the dealer would have to sell the car for  yet would only receive a  percent profit margin the dealer would either have to negotiate a lower price from the japanese manufacturer or cut his profit margin further to be able to sell the vehicle under this fx scenario the price of american goods would compare favorably to that of japanese goods in both domestic and foreign markets the opposite would be true if the dollar strengthened or appreciated against the yen so that it would take more yen to buy one dollar this type of exchange rate change would lower the price of foreign goods in the us market and hurt the sales of us goods both domestically and overseas bibliography factors affecting exchange rates consensus economics available from httpconsensuseconomicscomspecialdatahtm

industrial design her research interests include strategic applications of design social and cultural human factors and product localization issues she also works as an innovation consultant to international companies in emerging markets introduction the concept of usercentered design has arguably given rise to one of the most fundamental changes in the field of design over the past few decades fulton suri  melican  design has since shifted focus from giving form to objects and information to enabling user experiences and from physical and cognitive human factors to the emotional social and cultural contexts in which products and communications take place heskett a margolin  redstrom  this shift has been supported by business strategies aiming for sustainable competitive advantage today there is a growing recognition that providing superior value for users is instrumental for business success cagan  vogel  kim  mauborgne  vandermerwe  kim and mauborgne  for example argue that focusing on creating advances in customer value can make competition irrelevant by opening up entirely new markets in their investigation of what it takes to create breakthrough products cagan and vogel  conclude that one of the key attributes that distinguishes breakthrough products from their closest followers is the significant value they provide for users after all as drucker  has pointed out customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value p in current research however the notion of user value still remains largely unexplored for one thing there is no established theory of value that can guide design this paper is thus an attempt to provide a critical overview of the competing theories and models most prevalent in the study of user value the paper first reviews definitional issues regarding user value in economics sociology anthropology and business research next similarities and differences among definitions of value as exchange value as sign and value as experience are discussed comparison among different theories is also made in terms of their perspective on what the source of user value is the paper then reviews types and properties of user value identified by empirical studies designs role in creation of value is also discussed methodological approaches to user value research and their possible applications in design are then examined finally directions for future research on user value are discussed giving particular emphasis to the need of tools and methods to support design practice definitional issues as with many aspects of design the field is plagued by terminological confusion regarding the use of the term value part of the confusion comes from the fact that value is a highly polysemous word its meaning oscillates between concepts as distant as economic return and moral standards for example there is a general belief among designers that design can add value by the fact that it can be used to devise products with increased value and which embody moral values heskett c lack of consensus on the use of the term value nevertheless is not unique to the field of design it spans a number of disciplines including economics sociology anthropology psychology and marketing within this spectrum graeber  identifies the main approaches to the definition of value  the notion of values as conceptions of what is ultimately good in human life  in an economic and business sense value as a persons willingness to pay the price of a good in terms of cash in return for certain product benefits  value as meaning and meaningful difference and  value as action leaving aside the use of the term in its plural form which stands for enduring beliefs or for what is ultimately good and desirable in life rokeach  the focus here will primarily be on terms such as consumer value or customer value where value refers to the evaluation of some objectproduct by some subjectuser this focus seems to offer a relevant ground for discussion of value in design as it promises to examine the concept of value within the userproduct relationship value as exchange and use reviewing some of the definitions of consumer value reveals that they are firmly placed within the economic paradigm where value is defined in terms of the monetary sacrifice people are willing to make for a product eg butz  goodstein  gale  zeithaml  the emphasis is on the point of exchange and money is seen as a fundamental index of value the assumption is that at the moment of purchase people make a rational evaluation and calculation of what is given versus what is taken in terms of money for product quality such a view may be problematic for design as it overlooks the situation of use in a study on the assignment of value to fruit beverages zeithaml  points out that userelated nonmonetary issues such as time and effort spent on the preparation of the beverage were important in users assessments of product value and concludes that these issues should be acknowledged as well also for communication products such as websites there is no purchase stage or evaluation of choices on the spot as there is with physical products in other words themoneyspentforproductquality view of value seems to exclude a range of communication products marxist theory provides a useful distinction here it conceives of value as having a dual nature—made up of use value and exchange value marx  independent of labor use value relates to the utility of the physical properties of a product which is realized only upon its use although marx does not further develop his theory of use value he puts forward the idea that value is conditioned by the physical properties of products the question of what is the source of value however constitutes one of the major disagreements among different theories is it something subjectively assigned by the user and independent of the products physical qualities or is it something embedded in the object and recognized by the user these questions have been among the central issues of the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of value known as axiology frondizi  in axiological theory a bipolar distinction exists between objectivists and subjectivists positioning value as inherent in the object as marx claims and existing before a subject interacts with or evaluates it is a firmly objectivist view it resonates well with levitts  definition of product as a promise a cluster of value expectations p  according to porters  value chain value is gradually added through the different stages of product development manufacturing and distribution in other words value is something that the producer puts into the product giving no account for the capability of users to imbue objects with meaning and value such objectivist approaches are viewed as nothing but easily refutable frondizi  holbrook  it is easy to refute this approach for example by recognizing that there is a range of goods such as gifts memorabilia photos and spiritual objects which are not necessarily utilitarian nor do they circulate in the market these goods do not have a monetary price attached to them but they are considered to be of high value by the people who possess them belk  csikszentmihalyi  rochberghalton  the theory of value as exchange or value as use thus seems to fall short in explaining the high value of this group of objects for their owners value as sign anthropological and sociological theories on the other hand emphasize the social and cultural aspects of value this includes taking into account the symbolic meanings that can be attributed to goods csikszentmihalyi and rochberghaltons  study for example illustrates that the most valued domestic objects are valued primarily because of the symbolic meanings attached to them people have an enormous capacity and tendency to invest objects with meanings that sometimes have nothing to do with their utility or with the meanings intended by their producers they often value objects not for what they do or what they are made of but for what they signify in veblens  conceptualization of conspicuous consumption for example goods are valued because they serve as an index of social status and baudrillard   treats consumption as a way in which people converse with each other this conversation involves a code shared by the members of a society and the products act as signs communicating certain messages and images which are independent of their use their value is therefore a sign value which displaces use value and exchange value for example it is quite common for people in the socalled developing countries to acquire western goods not only for their utility but because of their imposed association with modernity and the lifestyles of their originators ger  belk  an example of such consumption may be found among the muria gonds where the richer fishermen were spending their excess earnings to purchase unusable television sets having no access to electricity to build garages onto houses to which no automobiles had access and to install rooftop cisterns into which water never flows gell  p  bourdieu  views such interaction with goods as a means of accumulating capital mainly of a symbolic ie in relation to the honor and prestige accumulated through ones practices and social eg in relation to ones own network of interpersonal relations nature this notion of value then calls for consideration not only of the use of products and communications but also of how they are made sense of and what the range of social ends they provide to users are including ends involving issues of status prestige and identity from the standpoint of the source of value a valueassign approach posits that value emerges through the subjective experience of the user and thus objects cannot contain value value does not necessarily reside in an objects tangible materiality but rather in the message it communicates as in semiotics physical form enables communication but does not construct meaning and therefore cannot be a source of value it is the symbol systems which are known and shared in a society that construct value disregarding a products capacity to shape meaning and users experiences this view is as easily refutable as the objectivist one after all designers create and alter forms with the purpose of modifying meaning and creating value value as experience it is clear that in relating value to design it is difficult to adopt any of the definitions reviewed so far as graeber  has pointed out each definition poses problems due to its lack of sufficient consideration of the other definitions heskett b also has noted that it is often difficult to talk about the utilityuse or significancemeaning of an object or communication separately because in practice they are closely interwoven it is equally difficult to argue that value resides in an objects materiality or in a symbol system alone frondizi  advocates an intermediate position where value is created at the interface of the product and the user as holbrook  puts it value resides not in the product purchased not in the brand chosen not in the object possessed but rather in the consumption experiences derived therefrom p  such a perspective of value as experience where a products value pertains to the experiences associated with that product offers the potential for reconciling the different approaches offered so far this perspective does not nevertheless provide an exclusive alternative to other definitions but rather it encompasses many aspects of them table  at its core is the premise that what people actually desire is not products but the experiences products provide pine  gilmore  as cagan and vogel  point out since products enable an experience for the user the better the experience the greater the value of the product to the consumer p  amazoncom for instance is valued for the superior shopping and browsing experience it provides and oxo good grips products for the easy and comfortable food preparation experience that they provide experiences emerge from interaction between the product and the user any user activity involving a product is an engagement in experience with that product however it should be noted that although activities are central to the concept of experience they are not equal to it dewey  writes the nature of experience can be understood only by noting that it includes an active and passive element peculiarly combined on the active hand experience is tryinga meaning which is made explicit in the connected term experiment on the passive side it is undergoing when we experience something we act upon it we do something with it then we suffer or undergo the consequences we do something to the thing and it does something to us in return mere activity does not constitute experience it is dispersive centrifugal dissipating p  activity usually consists of a series of actions oriented towards a specific goal leontev  experience on the other hand involves the additional dimension of reflecting upon the consequences of ones activities as margolin  puts it experience has both operative and reflective dimensions the operative dimension refers to the way we make use of products for our activities the reflective dimension addresses the way we think about a product and give it meaning p  in other words experiences with products relate not only to the activities but also to the meanings they add to peoples lives such as the symbolic meanings described in csikszentmihalyi and rochberghaltons  study therefore the notion of value as experience encompasses aspects of both utility and social significance consequences created through interaction with products user experience involves the juxtaposition of  user context and characteristics and  whatever features the product brings to the interaction including both formal and functional characteristics users interact with products within the context of their goals needs cultural expectations physical context and emotions and products with their tangible and intangible qualities can influence the way users interact with them what we call user value is thus created as a result of the interaction between what the product provides and what the users bring in terms of their goals needs limitations etc yet the definition of value as experience is not without problems for one thing it attempts to define such an elusive term as value with another similarly elusive one despite its centrality to design theory and practice the knowledge of what constitutes user experience and how to understand and enhance it is yet in its babbling stage it is necessary that the discussion of value in design be developed in sync with a discussion on user experience table  an overview of the definitional approaches to user value properties of user value relative and contextual if value is closely tied with experience then it carries some of the properties of experience according to dewey  experience is not something that is totally internal to the individual but instead an experience is always what it is because of a transaction taking place between an individual and what at the time constitutes his environment p  experiences are context and situationspecific that is they change from one set of immediate circumstances time and location to another in a similar way value changes as cultural values and norms and external contextual factors change overby woodruff  gardial  consider the example of owning an automobile having a car in a small us town increases accessibility to different places such as shopping malls sites of interest etc however the same car in a metropolitan city like new york where parking space is virtually unavailable and traffic is dense is a burden and restricts ones ability to move around thus compatibility with the context which includes a range of tangible and intangible systems is necessary the local context influences userproduct interaction by imposing certain conditions which may enhance or hinder peoples experiences with products and their assignment of value specifically a set of common behaviors or ways of doing things systems with which products interface such as infrastructure organization of space and institutional and geographical factors and socially and culturally shared meanings such as common symbols rituals and traditions can be significant in shaping user value therefore the same product may be assigned a different value by users in different contexts for holbrook  the value of a product is not only relative to the context but also to the alternative products users are acquainted with valuation involves concepts such as evaluation and judgment which imply a comparative process and choicemaking and preference for one option over another dependence on the stages of experience in marketing research a distinction exists between prepurchase and postpurchase value gardial clemons woodruff schumann  burns  jensen  parasuraman  woodruff  the former refers to expectations regarding the value a product is going to deliver that are formed prior to purchase of the product an individuals anticipation of the experience a product may provide can be a strong factor motivating that persons decision to acquire and use that product postpurchase value on the other hand involves value realized through the use of a product therefore one can rightfully argue that postpurchase value or valueasuse is more closely tied to the realities of the users context however this should not go beyond speculation since research on value as use is still limited value may emerge not only in purchase and use situations but also in the disuse or dispossession of a product sometimes the conscious act of not owning or not using a product has a value for its user too for example the choice not to own a mobile phone can be of value to people as it can make them inaccessible and can give them control over their time owning but not using certain products can be of value as well for example many women are proud of the fact that they always cook at home and that they do so without using many gadgets for them the convenience some small appliances might provide would take away from the sense of fulfilling the role of being a good mother and caregiver parasuraman  hypothesizes that value can also vary over time as the level of experience users have with a product alters as users move from being what he calls firsttime to shortterm and longterm users their value assessment criteria may change obviously their experience with a product will change as every experience both takes up something from those which have gone before and modifies in some way the quality of those which come after dewey  p  the prior experience and knowledge that users have in relation to a product might be especially relevant factors in their value assessment of products with a high learning curve such as information products multidimensional based on the definition of value as experience holbrook  identifies three dimensions on a continuum characterizing user value which are  intrinsicextrinsic  selforiented versus otheroriented and  activereactive the intrinsicextrinsic dimension relates to whether a product is valued as an end per se because of its qualities or for the means or functions it offers that help users accomplish certain ends for example a product such as starks juicy salif is usually assigned intrinsic value because it is appreciated as an end in itself rather than as a means for squeezing lemons a selforiented versus otheroriented distinction corresponds to whether a product is valued because of its benefit to the user or because of the reactions it draws from others a car for example has a selforiented value because its functional qualities bring certain benefits such as convenient transportation or safety to its user but it also has otheroriented value because it signifies social status and evokes reactions from others finally the activereactive dimension represents a distinction regarding whether there is a manipulation of a product by the user or vice versa art objects for example have a reactive value because their benefit results from passive admiration a drill on the other hand has an active value because its benefit arises from the user actively interacting with the product types of user value to make things more complicated it should be noted that different types of value might emerge from users experiences with products for example within the framework of holbrooks  axiological taxonomy based on the three dimensions presented above we can recognize a variety of different value types these are efficiency excellence play aesthetics status esteem ethics and spirituality values table  in my own study of kitchens with participants from turkey and the united states boztepe in press i identified four major categories of user value  utility  social significance  emotional and  spiritual values figure  table  types of user value adapted from holbrook  figure  categories of user value utility value utility value refers to the utilitarian consequences of a product for example the fact that it might enable the accomplishment of a physical or cognitive task it encompasses the values of convenience economy and quality as subcategories in practice convenience is defined in various ways that include concepts such as accessibility appropriateness avoidance of unpleasantness or compatibility to the local context rather than just as a matter of saving time and effort for example rather than as a means for economizing time turkish women use a refrigerator as a tool for reordering and managing time they use it for storing elaborate homemade dishes in semiprepared form or extra homemade pastries for later use this is not saving time per se but rather shifting cooking activity to a different time slot note that the notion of managing time involves relocating time as desired instead of reducing the time it takes to accomplish an activity economy value is concerned with the economic benefits provided by products these benefits include but are not limited to purchase economy such as can be provided by low prices or flexible installment plans while these are important the longterm effects of a product on the family budget or the economyinuse are an even more important value for users for instance american participants in the kitchen study primarily viewed their refrigerators as a means to beat high prices and save money through bulk buying and by taking advantage of special offers such as buyonegetonefree or family value packs value as quality can be broadly defined as an appreciation of a product for its inherent superiority such as might be found in the durability of materials used to make the product social significance value social significance value refers to the socially oriented benefits attained through ownership of and experience with a product these include attainment of social prestige and construction and maintenance of ones identity people use goods as markers of their relative position in the social nexus bourdieu  veblen  even the most ordinary goods may develop into symbols and people may interact with them in several ways to achieve social prestige and to maintain face goffman   goffman views the self as a social construction and the notion of face the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact p  is one way of viewing it as such mere possession of a trendy object is often seen as sufficient to communicate a certain image of self the value of products as a means of achieving distinction from others through projection of an image one wishes to create or through what goffman  calls impression management however is not related to the static ownership of products only and their use as labels but also to how they are being utilized and what ends are achieved through their use as goffman notes members to use his term employ a series of wellchoreographed techniques in an attempt to control the impressions they form on others just as an actor presents a character to an audience note that earlier the value of a refrigerator in the turkish context was seen specifically in terms of its ability to enable time shifting through advance preparation and storage of homemade foods from the perspective of social significance value then the same phenomenon here generates a reality of a kind in the eyes of the participants visitors such that the hosts are always wellprepared for unexpected guests emotional value emotional value refers to the affective benefits of a product for people who interact with it benefits such as pleasure or fun such benefits arise from affective experiences which according to desmet and hekkert  occur on three levels  aesthetic referring to delight experienced in a sensory capacity  meaning referring to experiences that relate to ones personality or character and  emotion referring to the provocation of strong feelings such as love anger etc while norman  describes the ascription of emotional value primarily as a psychological phenomenon desmet and hekkert  emphasize the contextdependent nature of affective experiences for example local perceptions of aesthetics might affect what users define as beautiful or pleasurable these perceptions are sometimes driven by trends and fashions which may also differ from one location to another for example small toylike appliances in pastel colors prevail in turkish households where they are considered beautiful and pleasing whereas american countertop appliances communicate an image of power through an industrial look and capacity many of the american participants in the kitchen study mentioned that it is not just an issue of looks but that they derive great pleasure from using powerful appliances an experience that makes them feel like professionals emotional value is not only derived from the sensorial delight provided by the visual or kinesthetic qualities of products but also from the meanings ascribed to them for example american participants in the study invested effort in increasing the emotional value of their refrigerators and making them more pleasurable by adding magnets childrens drawings and family photographs to the outside each time i see my kids my family…how much they have grown it makes me happy said one participant here the happiness is derived not from the visual quality of the drawings and photos but from their associations and meanings for the user spiritual value finally spiritual value refers to spiritual benefits such as good luck and sacredness that are enabled by a product for example a spiritual element was discernible in the decoration of refrigerators in turkish households many had nazar boncuğu evil eye magnets or stickers on the refrigerator doors a symbol that is believed to guard against evil associated with envious or covetous eyes in turkish culture it is believed that the envy of others can cause harm whether intentionally or not also many kitchens had bereket jars a turkish symbol for fertility and abundance which contain samples of food that one wishes to be always abundant in the house other examples show that communication technologies are increasingly becoming enablers of spiritual experiences too for instance several websites have been set up that serve muslims who live away from their home countries allowing them to pay online and have sacrifices made on their behalf during eid uladha of course these value categories are not mutually exclusive and the same experience with a product can impart different categories of value simultaneously and to varying degrees for example the emotional value most turkish users aspire to create through decorating their refrigerators also generates convenience value by protecting the refrigerators from dust on the other hand there also seems to be the potential for tradeoffs between different value types for example the social rewards and pleasure of preparing coffee manually might be preferred to the convenience provided by an electric coffee maker so the question becomes what are the mechanisms of compromise between different value categories and how do some value categories become foregrounded on a daily basis design and user value for cagan and vogel  design creates what they call value opportunity classes that is properties such as emotional appeal aesthetics identity ergonomics impact core technology and quality which contribute to the overall experience of a product and relate to its value they argue that the higher a product scores on each class the greater its value to users but what cagan and vogel are putting forward as designs contribution toward creating these properties is still somehow vague in userproduct interactivity according to jensen  users form a relationship between certain product properties and the benefits they desire from a product it is essential then that products have sufficient visible cues to signal their potential value to users these cues are different from the semiotic or baudrillardian codes as they are not totally independent of a products formal or functional characteristics they do reside in the object but are interpreted by the subject product properties are treated as cues or indicators of value through their visible and intrinsic characteristics they convey certain uses and meanings which are constantly matched and compared against the requirements of the users context my findings support the view that user value is created as a result of the harmonious combination of product properties and what users and their local contexts bring to the interaction with the product in responding to the question of what constituted the source of value for them participants often indicated specific product properties in other words on the face of it they equated the source of value with the product properties themselves in responding to the question of how a specific product property constituted the source of value however they often assumed the context of product use and explained how that property fit into their behaviors daily habits etc zeithaml  distinguishes between intrinsic or extrinsic cues or signals intrinsic cues are related to the physical configuration of a product extrinsic cues on the other hand are productrelated but not part of the product such as brand name price and level of advertising contrary to the colloquial belief that brand and price are the key factors in the assignment of value zeithaml suggests that users rely more on the intrinsic cues except when these are not available or when their evaluation requires too much effort or time however the cues that motivate a customers initial purchase of a product may differ from the criteria that connote value during use design uses all available means including form color texture materials affordances symbols and metaphors as such cues to communicate value however claiming that design creates value perhaps would be an overstatement and would be falling into the trap of the objectivist views discussed earlier design starts with the intention to generate value and it has the characteristic of persuasiveness as buchanan  puts it heskett b talks about the interplay between designers intentions and users needs perceptions and goals p  so developing the capacity of objects for value is perhaps a better definition of designs role in value creation in developing that capacity designers heightened understanding of users contexts and their reasons for and methods of imbuing objects with different types of value is essential tools for user value research in the early s several inventories such as values and lifestyles vals were developed to measure consumer value woodrudff  gardial  the claim of such methods is to segment people according to their enduring beliefs vals for example consists of categories such as innovators achievers thinkers etc while these categories have their basis in reality they are highly stereotypical and concerned only with generalities such groupings can help designers establish the general positioning of a product but they fall short in helping designers identify details that make the difference in peoples experiences with the product other tools which have also been developed in the marketing field build on the meansend model such as gutmans  laddering method they suggest that product attributes which take place on the bottom of a meansend chain are linked to psychological or social payoffs at the highest level these methods are based on the assumption that values ie the deeply held and enduring beliefs regarding what is right or wrong drive the selection and use of products the meansend approach could be a significant means to track how basic product characteristics such as color form texture etc can lead to practical or social benefits of a highly abstract nature yet this approach treats value assignment as a cognitive process and psychographic phenomenon and does not sufficiently account for contextual factors it has already been mentioned that value can change from one context to another therefore research on value cannot afford to ignore situational and cultural contexts swidler  suggests a shift of focus from values as the ultimate determinant of the ends to what she calls the toolkit of habits skills styles and beliefs from which people construct strategies of action people in different parts of the world may share common values while they continue to exhibit different behaviors and experiences with products understanding users goals is essential but the same goals can be achieved in many different ways so if we build on the notion of value as experience we should also look at these various ways of doing things since experiences are attained through activities among other things by examining the activities surrounding the use of a product it is possible to learn much more about the specific ways through which the product leads to desirable consequences as parasuraman  states perhaps the construct of value is so complex and involves so many variables that no single measurement scale would be sufficient for capturing it therefore a range of tools from more openended ethnographic investigations to specific cognitive scales are needed to deal with the slippery concept of value conclusion this paper has barely touched upon the surface of a vast topic and has raised more questions than it has answered having a subject as complex and as multidimensional as this and a research discipline as young as design the questions that deserve research attention are so many one of the key areas research should focus on is the dynamics of value assignment for that there is a need for more empirical studies since much of the development on the issue of user value has been conceptual ethnographic research focusing in depth on value assignment for each value category and for different product groups is particularly needed for building a fuller understanding of the complexities of the contextual nature of user value assignment for example further research involving different products could shed more light on the role of product properties in the assignment of value does the value assignment change for different product categories how do certain product properties become salient what are the structural and cognitive characteristics of value assignment similarly further research could unveil some patterns regarding the context dependency of different product categories the effect of user context on value may call for special attention especially with respect to the internationalization of products and the design of ubiquitous social and collaborative computing solutions in a similar vein although this study has provided an overview of what different value types are and how different local elements play a role in users value assignment we need to trace the issue further and to look at the different value categories in more depth also we need a better understanding of how value changes at different stages of interaction with a product are there predictable triggers that lead to value change to what extent can context be predictable yet we must not forget that building an understanding of the complexities and mechanisms of user value would not be sufficient alone design is actionoriented as simon  defines it design aims to change the existing situation into a preferred one therefore particular design research effort is needed for developing tools and methods applicable in design practice that would enable designers to be active in enhancing value creation in other words theories of middle range merton  are needed to link theories and the daily practical issues of designers the next step in usercentered design then becomes how designers deliver user value even this brief review of some models of user value shows that achieving such ambitious goals is not an easy task and may be only possible from a multi–disciplinary perspective and by putting under scrutiny design
