Ratios valuation of China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. ( 3669 | CYM)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. is lower than the median of its peer group: around 9.00. According to these financial ratios China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd.'s valuation is below the market valuation of its peer group.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. is lower than the average of its sector (Specialty Retailers): 8.49. According to these financial ratios China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd.'s valuation is below the market valuation of its sector.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. is significantly higher than its historical 5-year average: 6.0. The (current) company valuation of China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Ltd. is therefore way above its valuation average over the last five years.Valuation

More...Did you know ?Banks, insurance and financial investment firms have specific ratios, which are different from those traditionally used to analyze industrial companies.In particular, EV is not a suitable metric for financial institutions because interest is a critical component of both revenue and expenses. Likewise, EBIT or EBITDA are not calculated because separating operating and financing activities is impossible as interest, investment and debt are related to the company's core operations.About Financials RatiosFinancial ratios are generally ratios of selected values on an enterprise's financial statements. There are many standard financial ratios used in order to evaluate a business or a company. Financial ratios can also be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Security analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various companies. In Infinancials, financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business that the ratio measures:- Growth ratios measure the company's rate of growth and assess the potential for future growth. E.g. Net Sales Growth, EBITDA Growth, EBIT Growth.- Profitability ratios measure the returns generated on sales and investment, hence the ability of the company to generate profits.Profitability ratios include margin ratios (such as profit margin or operating margin) and return ratios (such as return on equity or return on assets).- Capital structure and liquidity ratios measure the extent to which the company is relying upon debt to fund its operations, and its ability to pay back the debt. Capital structure ratios include debt to equity and debt to asset ratios, and liquidity ratios include coverage ratios and solvency ratios.- Asset utilization ratios, also called activity or efficiency ratios, measure how efficiently the company's day to day operations are managing inventory, selling and producing products, or using assets to generate revenue.Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies, between industries and also between a single company and its industry average or peer group average.

            Shares
          


      Notes to Section I:
    


          Where shares have been issued at more than one issue price per share, a weighted average issue price per share should be given.
        



          Please insert the closing balance date of the last Next Day Disclosure Return published pursuant to rule 13.25A or Monthly Return pursuant to rule 13.25B, whichever is the later.
        



          Please set out all changes in issued share capital requiring disclosure pursuant to rule 13.25A together with the relevant dates of issue. Each category will need to be disclosed individually with sufficient information to enable the user to identify the relevant category in the listed issuer's Monthly Return. For example, multiple issues of shares as a result of multiple exercises of share options under the same share option scheme or of multiple conversions under the same convertible note must be aggregated and disclosed as one category. However, if the issues resulted from exercises of share options under 2 share option schemes or conversions of 2 convertible notes, these must be disclosed as 2 separate categories.
        



          The percentage change in the number of issued shares of listed issuer is to be calculated by reference to the listed issuer's total number of shares in issue (excluding for such purpose any shares repurchased or redeemed but not yet cancelled) as it was immediately before the earliest relevant event which has not been disclosed in a Monthly Return or Next Day Disclosure Return.
        



          Where trading in the shares of the listed issuer has been suspended, "closing market price per share of the immediately preceding business day" should be construed as "closing market price per share of the business day on which the shares were last traded".
        



          In the context of a repurchase of shares:
        


              "issues of shares" should be construed as "repurchases of shares"; and
            



              "issued shares as a % of existing number of shares before relevant share issue" should be construed as "repurchased shares as a % of existing number of shares before relevant share repurchase".
            




          In the context of a redemption of shares:
        


              "issues of shares" should be construed as "redemptions of shares";
