              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

	Nissan Tokyo Sales Holdings Co Ltd operates within the New and used car dealers sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Nissan Tokyo Sales Holdings Co Ltd with three other
	automotive dealers and parts suppliers in Asia:
		
	Sparkle Roll Group Limited
	
		of Hong Kong
		(2017
	sales of 2.78 billion Hong Kong Dollars [US$356.11  million]
		of which 91%
		was Trading of automobiles and related parts),
	
	VT Holdings Company Limited
	
		(169.56 billion Japanese Yen [US$1.54  billion]
		of which 96%
