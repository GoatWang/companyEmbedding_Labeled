I left my Tucson at 0815hrs for some small repairs and when I called round at 1600hrs (8 hrs later) my car was still not ready.  I was also asked if the replacement parts were actually needed.  I told them definitely yes that's why it was booked in. That meant they had not started on my vehicle.  They told me to call at 1700hrs which I did.  I did not get my car back until 1810hrs. Also one of the repairs was not done due to some problem.  I then found that my back glass door lifter had been broken by the garage which they said they would replace.  Next morning I also found that one of my roof rails had been damaged.  When I went back on 19/2/16 to report this I was told that they would have to check with the CCTV as they did not admit to this damage.  My verdict:- Very poor service, the service advisors therer seem overworked and not able to cope with the amount of vehicles for repairs. In addition, I  now have to take time off work to take the car back for more repairs through no fault of my own.  A time & motion study needs to be done at this establishment's service desk to vastly improve customer service in the future.
