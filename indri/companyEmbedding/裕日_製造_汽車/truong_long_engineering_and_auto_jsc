Our clients know us by name because we insist on a MEP coordination meeting immediately after we complete our design
We provide construction support to our clients during the construction phase
We visit the construction site for our clients to help resolve unforeseen issues during construction
We stand behind our work (our clients will back us up on this)





    Experience 



Our team members come from Design/Build so our designs are installed without any complication
Between the team members, we have over 50 years of combined Design/Build experience
We have done many building types (retail, industrial, commercial, and restaurants)





    Efficiency



We help define the MEP scope of work during preliminary phase so there are no MEP surprises during the design phase
On accelerated schedule projects, we closely coordinate with our clients to deliver our work ON TIME
In the last 20 projects we completed, there was only one (1) change order charged
For our Design/Build clients, our approach has resulted in construction cost savings by:
Providing efficient constructible designs based on past design/build experience
Surveying the site to reuse existing MEP systems as much as possible
Providing cost estimates that reflect real world cost through our network of MEP contractors

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
