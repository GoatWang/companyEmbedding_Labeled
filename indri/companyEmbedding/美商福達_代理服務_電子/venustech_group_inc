Official government websites play an increasingly important role in government affairs, like press release, propaganda, and E-Government services. If a government's offcial website has been attacked or its web page has been tampered, it will affect the government image. Government's official websites face security challenges in the following areas:● Compliance● Network architecture security● Transmission security● Network boundary security● Detection and auditing● Access control and identity authentication security● System vulnerability

                                        As the wave of mobile network and cloud computing become prevalent and information technology keeps developing, the global telecommunications industry has undergone tremendous changes. The rapid development and adoption of the Internet technically makes intruders much easier to hack into target systems, resulting in increasingly serious network and information security problems. Nowadays, network attacks have gradually switch to large-scale, automated and collaborative attacks. Due to the crucial role and great importance of the telecommunications industry, these incidents adversely affect national security, business operations, and customer interests. Therefore, telecom carriers have to face the challenges of establishing a reliable information security environment and substantially increasing their threat defense capabilities.

                                            Financial Service

                                        The financial industry has faced a great opportunity during recent years. Taking advantage of information technology, financial institutions effectively reduce costs of resources, promote work efficiency, improve service quality, and enhance competitive strength. Information technology plays an increasingly important role in financial services. In turn, more and more business processes rely on information technology. However, information technology also brings new risks and challenges to the financial industry.With the rapid growth of financial industry and increasing diversity of financial products and services, the financial industry becomes more dependent on information systems. The business development requires increased network nodes and business systems, leading to much more complicated interconnection between application systems and network systems. There are also  more and more external interconnections and internal users. In this context, information systems are facing both external and internal risks.In particular, information systems are built based on data centralization. Information security risks may cause immeasurable impacts on financial services and even the entire financial system. Moreover, an exponential growth in the information system scale leads to complicated dependency between internal objects, and problems in the fundamental processes are likely to cause systematic breakdown.

                                        With the inevitable convergence of Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT). The industrial control systems increasingly use Ethernet and TCP/IP networks as the network infrastructure, migrate from industrial control protocols to the application layer, use wireless networks such as WLAN and GPRS, and adopt standard commercial operating systems such as Windows OS, devices, middleware, and general technologies. The security of an industry automation control system determines the secure production of critical industrial sectors. Industry automation manufacturers are hard-pressed to ensure the security of increasingly open production control networks. Industrial control systems mainly face the following internal and external threats:●Deterioration of external security environment●Increasing internal threats●Software Threats●External Staff’s Threats●Virus floodingIndustrial control digitalization and automation is an emerging area, but it does not receive enough attention, as management staffs lack security knowledge and awareness. To ensure the security and reliability of an industrial control system, the following requirements must be met:●The vulnerability scanning system and the audit system must be available to prevent vulnerabilities of industrial control systems that exist in devices, software, or protocols.●Specific protection measures designed for various attacks must be available at the network boundary.●Stability and ease to use for security products of internal staffs in industrial environments must be met.

                                        With the evolution of technologies and the increasing demands from end users, small and medium-sized enterprises' networks become increasingly complex. Employees expect a working environment where they can get online faster for work whenever and wherever they want. At the same time, more than 60% network threats are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. As the attacks targeting at small and medium-sized enterprises keep increasing, their network environments are getting more difficult to manage. These threats include malicious software, virus, worm, Trojan, phishing, ransomware, intrusion, DDoS attack, illegal wireless access, and spam. A security system that is easy to use and integrates multiple functions becomes increasingly important for small and medium-sized enterprises.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
