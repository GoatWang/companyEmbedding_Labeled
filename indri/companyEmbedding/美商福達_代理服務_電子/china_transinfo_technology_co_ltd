(collectively, the "Rollover Holders"), which were cancelled without receiving any consideration.  In addition, at the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding, vested and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive, a cash amount equal to the number of shares underlying such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the amount by which US$5.80 exceeds the exercise price per share of such option, net of any applicable withholding taxes; (ii) each outstanding and unvested option to purchase shares of Company common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a restricted cash award in an amount equal to the number of shares underlying such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied the amount by which US$5.80 exceeds the exercise price per share of such option; and (iii) each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Company common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the total number of shares underlying such warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the amount by which US$5.80 exceeds the exercise price per share of such warrant.
