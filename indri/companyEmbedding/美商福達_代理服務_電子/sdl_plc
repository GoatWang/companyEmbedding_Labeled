History[edit]
The Company was founded by Mark Lancaster with nine employees in 1992. It opened its first overseas office in France in 1996[4] and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.[4] The company has grown organically via acquisitions. SDL acquired International Translation & Publishing (ITP) in 2000, Alpnet in 2001, and the machine translation (MT) assets of Transparent Language in 2001. It bought Trados, a rival translation memory (TM) developer, in 2005.[5] In 2007, the company acquired Tridion, a content management system vendor,[6] and PASS Engineering, developers of PASSOLO software.[7] In 2008, it bought Idiom Technologies, a global information system management business.[8] In December 2009, SDL acquired Fredhopper, a Dutch eCommerce onsite search and navigation, onsite targeting and targeted advertising software vendor.[9] Later that same year, it bought Xopus, another Dutch company and the leader in online XML editing.[10] In May 2011 SDL acquired Dutch-based Media Asset Management company, Calamares,[11] in 2012 the campaign management and social media analytics company, Alterian,[12] and in 2013, bemoko, a supplier of mobile web solutions.[13]
In January 2016 SDL announced the divestment of Fredhopper and Alterian as non-complementary to its new strategy having undertaken a strategic review.[14]
Operations[edit]
SDL provides software and service solutions for language translation purposes. It has operations in 38 countries including Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Greece, Russia, United States of America, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Australia, Thailand, China, Japan, and India.[15]

History[edit]
The Company was founded by Mark Lancaster with nine employees in 1992. It opened its first overseas office in France in 1996[4] and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.[4] The company has grown organically via acquisitions. SDL acquired International Translation & Publishing (ITP) in 2000, Alpnet in 2001, and the machine translation (MT) assets of Transparent Language in 2001. It bought Trados, a rival translation memory (TM) developer, in 2005.[5] In 2007, the company acquired Tridion, a content management system vendor,[6] and PASS Engineering, developers of PASSOLO software.[7] In 2008, it bought Idiom Technologies, a global information system management business.[8] In December 2009, SDL acquired Fredhopper, a Dutch eCommerce onsite search and navigation, onsite targeting and targeted advertising software vendor.[9] Later that same year, it bought Xopus, another Dutch company and the leader in online XML editing.[10] In May 2011 SDL acquired Dutch-based Media Asset Management company, Calamares,[11] in 2012 the campaign management and social media analytics company, Alterian,[12] and in 2013, bemoko, a supplier of mobile web solutions.[13]
In January 2016 SDL announced the divestment of Fredhopper and Alterian as non-complementary to its new strategy having undertaken a strategic review.[14]
