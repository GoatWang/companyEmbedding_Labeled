Facilitating Broad Integration of Digital Currency in the Digital Payments Markets LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 14, 2017 / NXChain Inc. (OTCQB: NXCN), a fully reporting Shell Company traded on OTCMarkets ("NXCN"), today announced its entry into a binding contract to acquire 49.9 percent of ExPay Asia, a privately-held payments company operating in the Asian market. The companies will work together to implement future payment solutions based on the digital assets platform developed by NXCN. NXCN has previously completed the purchase of digital currency backbone technologies from LXCCoin Ltd. UK, and this is an important step for the upcoming launch of services for the company. NXCN has been operating in stealth and will continue to do so for some time yet.






Foreign ownership is restricted in Thailand, and NXCN has requested regulatory clearances from BOI in regards to its foreign ownership. Once permission is granted NXCN may execute an option it is currently holding for a 51 percent majority ownership. About ExPay Asia The ExPay Group was formed in 2012 by finance industry executives to develop an open platform for online merchants incorporating intelligent back office solutions. The company has grown steadily and is currently turning over an approximate $40 million annually with a net result of $1.25 million. The company focuses on combining a range of innovative services to existing payment solutions and has through the partnership with NXCN already secured new business, aiming at doubling both turnover and result next year. More information can be found at http://expay.asia. About NxChain, Inc. NxChain, Inc. is a fully reporting and trading Company on OTCMarkets under the trading symbol NXCN.QB. The Company is growing its business through acquisitions and mergers of cryptocurrency companies and technologies to provide a fixed-price cryptocurrency platform to multiple levels of the financial industry in various markets worldwide. More information can be found at http://www.nxchain.com. NXCN and ExPay are working jointly on constructing a digital currency gateway combining several technologies, including amongst others the NXCN-owned LXCCoin Digital Currency backbone. Mr. Sean Tabatabai, CEO of NXChain comments: "We firmly believe that our platform of blockchain technology will induce a paradigm shift in the way we do transactions. Our team has worked on our platform extensively for years, and at present we are including certain other technologies to work in concert with our services. We have great faith in ExPay being a key component in our future business." Mr. Chakrit Ahmad, CEO of ExPay comments: "We expect blockchain to become a core of future money transactions, but until we started testing with NXCN and their stable currencies we did not see how volatile and/or slowly transacting digital currencies could be integrated into what we are doing. While still focusing on current business; we anticipate that being part of the NXCN technology platform presents some unique advantages and we look forward with excitement to releasing services together."

BLOCKCHAIN BASEDPAYMENT PLATFORM



NXChain: Applied Blockchain Technology
What is blockchain?
A blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a distributed network of computers. It uses cryptography to allow each participant on the network to manipulate the ledger in a secure way without the need for a central authority.
Why use blockchain?
More and more companies are facing challenges in data management and security. Blockchain revolutionizes the way companies can make and verify transactions on a network instantaneously without a central authority. It saves time and money and can be implemented in a wide range of services.
Who is using blockchain?
Most major financial institutions and tech-based companies are working on implementing distributed ledger technology as a secure and transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets. Several different private/closed-loop versions are therefore already in existence as well as original distributed ones such as ours.

Who are we? What do we do?

NXChain is a US public company, quoted on the OTCMarkets in New York with the ticker code OTCQB:NXCN. We’re a digital payments platform, connecting digital currencies and fiat money, currently moving into adjacent sectors within payments, POS transactions and remittance. Our long-term target is to create a fully liquid digital payments system for global use. NXChain is operated by a team of payment industry professionals who have been working on blockchain projects since 2013.
We have created a broad digital payments platform, including:

free smartphone banking/payments apps (pilots released Q3 2016; public release Q2 2017)
free SMS-based banking/payments apps (in testing)
payment gateway accepting credit cards (released Q3 2016)
online micropayment tools (pilots released Q4 2016; public release Q2 2017)
online merchant platforms (in pilot testing, going into production Q2 2017)
microlending platform (incomplete, pilots planned for Q3 2017)
open API for integrating any related service (released in pilot testing)
platform-specific payment backbones (pending release with third parties)
Land registry blockchain/token systems


The NXChain platform is a payment transaction services suite, combining a wide range of services from free secure mobile accounts to advanced industrial payment services. We aim for re-creating the financial environment presently covered by fiat currency in several markets and niches, by offering a single stable transaction backbone, tailored for quick instant-settlement payments, with no minimum limits. Our initial product range was released on October 1st 2016, including a digital+fiat currency payment gateway and a hybrid banking service. The product suite will be added to and improved on a regular basis, including proprietary platforms and M&A incorporated services.

NXCN has been operating in stealth and will continue to do so for some time yet.Foreign ownership is restricted in Thailand, and NXCN has requested regulatory clearances from BOI in regards to its foreign ownership. Once permission is granted NXCN may execute an option it is currently holding for a 51 percent majority ownership.About ExPay AsiaThe ExPay Group was formed in 2012 by finance industry executives to develop an open platform for online merchants incorporating intelligent back office solutions. The company has grown steadily and is currently turning over an approximate $40 million annually with a net result of $1.25 million.
