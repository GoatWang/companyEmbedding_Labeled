台積電IP Quality Program宣布採用明導國際Calibre PERC可信度檢驗解決方案


2013-10-29


WILSONVILLE, Ore., October 29, 2013—Mentor Graphics Corp. (NASDAQ: MENT)

	today announced that the Calibre® PERC™reliability verification product has been added to the TSMC9000 IP quality program. TSMC and Mentor Graphics jointly developed electrical checks to help improve IP dependability as part of the TSMC9000 qualification process. The companies are also collaborating on an offering that will allow IP partners to access TSMC9000-compliant checking on a per-use basis. This extends the capabilities customers enjoy today with the Calibre PERC product to TSMC’s IP partners, enabling further pre-verification of third-party IP and increasing the coherence between customer and third-party IP reliability verification.

	“The goal of TSMC9000 is not only to make IP easy to exchange and re-use within the TSMC Open Innovation Platform® (OIP) environment, but also to ensure dependability, quality and robustness for our customers,” said Suk Lee, TSMC senior director, Design Infrastructure Marketing Division. “We have done extensive work with Mentor to define the initial reliability checks for TSMC9000, which will help identify design issues that could increase the risk of failures when circuits are operating in the field.”

	This IP quality initiative is built on top of EDA enablement collaboration between TSMC and Mentor Graphics in the past 12 months, automating reliability checks on previously non-checkable rules. With the offering of a new ESD/LUP checking deck from TSMC, early adopters of TSMC 28nm, 20nm, and 16nm technologies have enjoyed this unique reliability solution as the benefits of TSMC9000 are proliferated through the IP space.

	Under the program, TSMC will provide IP Alliance partners with Calibre PERC rule decks that perform reliability checks designed to address customers’ advanced circuit verification needs for electrostatic discharge (ESD), electrical overstress (EOS), signals crossing multiple power domains, advanced ERC, and other reliability concerns. The Calibre PERC product was the platform selected for these checks because it provides advanced functionality by enabling checks that combine knowledge of both the physical layout and the netlist, which defines device types and connectivity.

	In addition, Mentor will offer additional Calibre PERC service options to IP companies participating in TSMC9000. IP submitted to TSMC can also be provided to Mentor Graphics, where designated customer application engineers run the TSMC9000 checks using in-house datacenter facilities and provide the IP companies with reports indicating pass/fail results, along with pointers to any errors and hotspots.    

	“Working closely with TSMC, we’ve defined a program that makes advanced reliability checking available to all TSMC OIP IP Alliance partners,” said Joseph Sawicki, vice president and general manager of the Design-to-Silicon division at Mentor Graphics. “This means that our mutual customers will be able to incorporate TSMC9000-qualified IP into their designs with a high confidence that those IP blocks will pass full-chip reliability checks at signoff.”

	TSMC will implement these initial checks in their TSMC9000 quality program starting with multi-project shuttles in early 2014. TSMC and Mentor will also be working to expand the number of checks offered to third-party IP providers in future releases tied to various process node updates.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

Mentor Graphics Extends the PADS PCB Product Creation Platform with Advanced Analog/Mixed-Signal and High Speed Analysis for Mainstream Engineers 










WILSONVILLE, Ore., July 11, 2016 — Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) today announced the latest additions to the PADS® PCB Product Creation Platform. New analog/mixed-signal (AMS) and high-speed analysis products address engineering challenges associated with mixed-signal design, DDR implementation, and electrically-correct design signoff. Tightly integrated and highly affordable, the new PADS AMS Design Suite, PADS AMS Cloud, PADS HyperLynx® DRC, and PADS HyperLynx DDR products streamline the design process and ensure circuit performance goals are met, reducing the need for prototypes and design re-spins.  Combined with the recently announced PADS HyperLynx® DC Drop and PADS FloTHERM® XT products for power integrity and thermal analysis, the extended PADS Product Creation Platform gives engineers access to technologies that were formerly out of reach for the mainstream PCB market.

“Our products are becoming more challenging to develop due to higher-end requirements,” said Joel Libove, Ph.D. and president of Furaxa, Inc.  “The new PADS products give us access to essential simulation technologies that enable us to produce products at higher complexity, ensuring we can deliver on our commitments to the market in terms of function, price, and delivery.”

Analog/Mixed Signal Design
The vast majority of today’s electronic products contain analog content which must be designed and validated in the context of the overall system, making analog/mixed signal simulation critical for product creation. To address this need, the new PADS AMS Cloud – which is a cloud-based circuit exploration/simulation environment and user community – is available FREE for all PADS users.  Users from all levels of expertise can create and share analog, mixed-signal, and mixed-technology designs in an online, collaborative environment where designs and models can be published or downloaded. A unique benefit for PADS customers: circuit designs created in PADS AMS Cloud can be transferred to the PADS AMS Design Suite desktop environment, eliminating the need to manually recreate circuits to perform advanced analysis and drive the PCB design flow. PADS AMS Cloud may be found at www.pads.com/amscloud
An industry-unique offering, the PADS AMS Design Suite is truly a complete design creation solution that empowers engineers to design and simulate analog/mixed-signal (AMS) and digital in one environment.  Within one schematic session, both analog circuit simulation leveraging the power and flexibility of VHDL-AMS, (an IEEE standard, along with a powerful SPICE-based simulation engine), and topology exploration with the HyperLynx tool can be performed. Beyond common core AMS simulation analysis (DC Bias, time-domain, and frequency-domain simulations) additional extended analysis capabilities are included as standard, such as multi-run parametric sweeps, sensitivity, Monte Carlo, and Worst Case analysis to address specific engineering needs.
Key benefits of PADS Analog/Mixed Signal Design:

Schematic design (including component data management, constraint definition, and variant capability), analog circuit simulation, and PADS HyperLynx pre-layout analysis all in a single environment.
Seamless and accurate representation of both electronic and electromechanical elements of a circuit.
Core capabilities for circuit verification and optimization against real-world variability.

DDR Simulation
DDR memory has become commonplace across the spectrum of electronics designs and is now found in the mainstream markets. By extending the PADS Product Creation Platform to include integrated DDR simulation, the new PADS HyperLynx DDR option allows engineers to quickly identify and solve signal integrity (SI) and timing issues specific to DDRx designs in an easy-to-use and affordable environment.
Key capabilities:

Identifying and resolving SI impairments (overshooting/undershooting, ringing) and timing issues (set-up/hold, de-rating, skew, data bus margins).
Easy setup, automated whole-bus simulation, and consolidated results reporting with DDR Wizard.
Streamlined summary pass/fail judgment on entire interfaces.
HTML-based reporting which provides design documentation and Web-based publication of results.

Electrical DRC, Validation, and Sign-off
Now available for the mainstream PCB design market, the PADS HyperLynx DRC tool accelerates the electrical sign-off process by allowing engineers to perform electrical rules checks and identify violations that will affect the design integrity and performance of the board. With pre-defined rules, issues such as traces crossing voids and traces changing reference planes can be quickly identified even on the largest designs. Integrated electrical DRC technology enables engineers to be confident that their PCB designs are electrically correct before hand-off to manufacturing.
Key capabilities:

Fast and easy time to results with a rules-based approach to identify non-CAD constraints.
Out-of-the-box checks for EMI, signal integrity, and power integrity.
Visual results, easy identification of violations integrated with the PADS PCB product.


“PCB engineering challenges are as profound at the mainstream level as they are at the enterprise level, and Mentor’s mission is to provide competitive advantage to our customers in tacking the most complex designs,” stated AJ Incorvaia, vice president and general manager of Mentor Graphics Board Systems Division. “By bolstering our PADS product creation platform with analog/mixed signal, DDRx, and DRC analysis, plus our recent electronics cooling and DC voltage drop tools, electrical engineers can now access technologies that were out-of-reach for the mainstream PCB market. PADS empowers customers to design complex products, from concept through manufacturing, with great confidence.”

Design to Silicon Traditional EDA tools for physical design and verification have reached limits due to greater manufacturing process variability and the growing size and complexity of designs that take advantage of the latest nanometer scaling. With the advent of new process technologies, the handoff between integrated circuit (IC) layout and manufacturing has changed from a simple check to a multi-step process where the layout design must be enhanced to ensure efficient manufacturing. This presents a host of challenges related to manufacturing process effects, photolithography, data volumes, and achieving a cost-effective yield of finished chips from each wafer.
To meet these challenges with confidence, design teams turn to Mentor's  Olympus-SoC™ place and route system with Multi-Corner-Multi-Mode timing analysis and DFM-aware layout optimization for rapid closure of physical designs. The Olympus-SoC system works with the industry-leading integrated Calibre® design-to-silicon platform, which includes physical verification, full-chip, transistor-level parasitic extraction, model-based design for manufacturability (DFM) solutions, mask data preparation (MDP) and resolution enhancement technologies (RET), such as optical proximity correction and other computational lithography techniques. The Calibre product family efficiently and accurately manages every facet of the design-to-silicon transition.
The Mentor Tessent™ product suite is a comprehensive silicon test and yield analysis platform that addresses the challenges of manufacturing test, debug, and yield ramp for today’s SoCs. Built on the foundation of the best-in-class solutions for each test discipline, Tessent brings them together in a powerful test flow that ensures total chip coverage.
Tanner EDA by Mentor is an integrated, affordable and intuitive product suite for the design, layout and verification of analog/mixed signal (AMS) and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) ICs. Used by more than 25,000 designers around the world, Tanner tools support an end-to-end flow: top-down, mixed-signal design capture and simulation; synthesis with DFT support; physical design; place-and-route; and “sign-off ready” timing analysis to tape-out.


Functional Verification Mentor provides its customers with critical tools for solving the increasingly complicated problems of verifying that today’s complex chip designs actually function as intended. Functional errors at the system level are the leading cause of design revisions affecting time to market and profitability. Design teams must improve existing methodologies with tools that scale across design complexity and multiple levels of abstraction.
Mentor is transforming verification with new use models and a collection of best-in-class technologies and methodologies. From block-level simulation to full system-level design emulation, the Mentor Enterprise Verification Platform™ (EVP) boosts productivity in ASIC and SoC functional verification by combining advanced verification technologies in a comprehensive platform.
The Mentor EVP combines Questa® Verification Platform, the Veloce® Emulation Platform, and the Visualizer™ debug environment into a high-performance, datacenter resource. Mentor EVP features global resource management that supports project teams around the world, maximizing both user productivity and total verification return on investment.
The Veloce Emulation Platform uses innovative software, running on powerful, qualified hardware and an extensible operating system, to target design risks faster than hardware-centric strategies. Now considered among the most versatile and powerful of verification tools, project teams use emulation for hardware debugging, hardware/software co-verification or integration, system-level prototyping, low-power verification and power estimation and performance characterization.
The Questa Verification Platform is the most comprehensive EDA solution for functional verification, merging standards support, tools and a “design for verification” methodology to minimize verification cycles and design revisions. This solution provides the most complete path to verification closure, including integrated technologies and methodologies such as advanced TLM and UVM testbenches, assertions, formal, and verification IP.


Integrated PCB-FPGA Systems Design As ICs, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) become more complex and printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technology advances to include embedded components and high-density interconnect layers, the design of PCBs is reaching new levels of complexity. These are frequently a source of design bottlenecks.
Mentor is the market and technology leader in PCB design, providing many of the world’s largest system design companies today with a range of scalable design solutions to reduce the time, cost and risk of electronic system design: Xpedition™ Enterprise, for the creation of today’s most complex PCB designs; Board Station® XE, the market standard solution for the PCB design challenges of the global enterprise; and the PADS® flow, the leading Windows-based solution for complex PCB design.
Mentor also offers solutions for specific design challenges such as radio frequency (RF) design management, and verification advanced packaging, concurrent team design, FPGA-on-board integration and design data management.


Electronic System Level (ESL) Design Design complexity of next-generation digital applications is outgrowing the capabilities of current design methods. Increasingly, designs are large systems that include embedded cores, IP, and complex signal processing hardware that implements computationally intensive algorithms.
To deal with this complexity, Mentor offers the EDA industry’s most comprehensive suite of electronic system level (ESL) design tools for hardware creation. Vista™, a SystemC debug environment, helps designers model their designs at a higher level of abstraction where they can identify and resolve problems with minimal effort.
For system integration, Visual Elite™ helps designers deal with IP from different sources, modeled in different languages, and written at different levels of abstraction. Together these tools deliver dramatic productivity and design quality improvements, and provide a methodology that will satisfy designers’ requirements for the next 10-15 years.
 


RTL Synthesis Traditional hardware design methods that require manual RTL development and debugging are too time-consuming and error-prone for today’s complex designs. Mentor Catapult® and PowerPro® products automate creation of fully-verified, power-optimized RTL for downstream synthesis and physical design. With the Catapult High-Level Synthesis Platform, designers use industry-standard ANSI C++ and SystemC to describe functional intent at a high level of abstraction and then generate production-quality RTL. The PowerPro RTL Low-Power Platform provides a complete solution to accurately measure RTL power consumption and then interactively explore and thoroughly optimize power expenditure during the RTL development cycle.

Xpedition - PCB Systems Vibration and Acceleration Simulation Solution
Company: Mentor Graphics
As the industry’s market share leader in PCB design software, the Mentor Graphics® Xpedition product augments mechanical analysis and physical testing by introducing virtual accelerated lifecycle testing much earlier in the design process. This is the industry’s first PCB-design-specific vibration and acceleration simulation solution targeting products where harsh environments can compromise product performance and reliability, including the military, aerospace, automotive and industrial markets. Traditional, physical HALT (highly accelerated lifecycle testing) is conducted just before volume manufacturing, and requires expert technicians, which can result in costly schedule delays. Bridging mechanical and electronic design disciplines, the Xpedition product provides vibration simulation significantly faster than any existing method. This results in increased test coverage and shortened design cycles to ensure product reliability and faster time to market. The Xpedition component modeling library is the most extensive in the industry, comprised of over 4,000 unique 3D solid models which are used to create highly defined parts for simulation. The 3D library allows users to easily match geometries to their 2D cell database. Designers can assemble the parts models on board and automatically mesh them for performance analysis, including stiffeners and mechanical parts. The system modeling tool is ultra-fast since it can model over 1,000 components per minute.

Tessent IJTAG - IJTAG IP Integration Environment
Company: Mentor Graphics
To manage the complex requirements of testing a heterogeneous set of embedded IP, the industry developed IEEE P1687 (IJTAG). It standardizes a language for describing the IP interface and how IPs are connected to each other. It also introduces a language that defines how patterns that operate or test the IP are to be described. IEEE P1687 draws a clear line between what must be covered by the standard and what is better left to the ingenuity of the tool developers.

WILSONVILLE, Ore., Jan. 19, 2017 — (PRNewswire) —   Mentor Graphics Corporation (Nasdaq: 
MENT) today announced its Tessent® DefectSim™ product was awarded 
2016 Product of the Year by Electronic Products magazine. This award is presented for a product launched in 2016 that represents innovative design and advancement in technology, as determined by the editors of the publication.


    


The Tessent DefectSim product measures the defect coverage of any test applied to an analog or mixed-signal circuit. This tool enables a designer to improve the quality of analog and mixed-signal circuits during integrated circuit (IC) design by guiding design-for-test (DFT) and the selection of more effective manufacturing tests. It also enables test engineers to reduce test costs by showing which tests do not increase coverage and whether simpler or faster tests could achieve higher coverage. The tool satisfies the growing defect-coverage measurement requirement for automotive ICs set by Tier1 automotive suppliers in accordance with the ISO 26262 automotive functional safety standard.
The Tessent DefectSim tool works with Mentor's Eldo® and Questa® ADMS™ simulators to measure the likelihood-weighted percentage of opens, shorts, extreme variations, and user-defined defect or fault models that can be detected within a layout-extracted or schematic netlist. The Tessent DefectSim product combines many techniques, described in our peer-reviewed papers, to reduce total simulation time by many orders of magnitude compared to simulation of every potential defect in a flat layout-extracted netlist, without reducing simulation accuracy or the choice of tests.
"We are gratified to receive this industry recognition for an analysis tool that has taken many years to develop, and is the only general-purpose, analog fault simulator available commercially," said Stephen Sunter, engineering director for mixed-signal DFT at Mentor Graphics. "We thank the many customers who evaluated the Tessent DefectSim tool and provided so much constructive feedback to help ensure that their AMS designers will have the fault simulation capability that digital designers have had for 30 years and which has facilitated tremendous advances in automation for digital DFT and test generation."

Mentor Graphics Extends the PADS PCB Product Creation PlatformWith Advanced Analog/Mixed-Signal and High Speed Analysis for Mainstream EngineersMentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) announced the latest additions to the PADS® PCB Product Creation Platform. New analog/mixed-signal (AMS) and high-speed analysis products address engineering challenges associated with mixed-signal design, DDR implementation, and electrically-correct design signoff. Tightly integrated and highly affordable, the new PADS AMS Design Suite, PADS AMS Cloud, PADS HyperLynx® DRC, and PADS HyperLynx DDR products streamline the design process and ensure circuit performance goals are met, reducing the need for prototypes and design re-spins. Combined with the recently announced PADS HyperLynx® DC Drop and PADS FloTHERM® XT products for power integrity and thermal analysis, the extended PADS Product Creation Platform gives engineers access to technologies that were formerly out of reach for the mainstream PCB market. “Our products are becoming more challenging to develop due to higher-end requirements,” said Joel Libove, Ph.D. and president of Furaxa, Inc. “The new PADS products give us access to essential simulation technologies that enable us to produce products at higher complexity, ensuring we can deliver on our commitments to the market in terms of function, price, and delivery.” Analog/Mixed Signal DesignThe vast majority of today’s electronic products contain analog content which must be designed and validated in the context of the overall system, making analog/mixed signal simulation critical for product creation. To address this need, the new PADS AMS Cloud – which is a cloud-based circuit exploration/simulation environment and user community – is available FREE for all PADS users. Users from all levels of expertise can create and share analog, mixed-signal, and mixed-technology designs in an online, collaborative environment where designs and models can be published or downloaded. A unique benefit for PADS customers: circuit designs created in PADS AMS Cloud can be transferred to the PADS AMS Design Suite desktop environment, eliminating the need to manually recreate circuits to perform advanced analysis and drive the PCB design flow. PADS AMS Cloud may be found at www.pads.com/amscloud An industry-unique offering, the PADS AMS Design Suite is truly a complete design creation solution that empowers engineers to design and simulate analog/mixed-signal (AMS) and digital in one environment. Within one schematic session, both analog circuit simulation leveraging the power and flexibility of VHDL-AMS, (an IEEE standard, along with a powerful SPICE-based simulation engine), and topology exploration with the HyperLynx tool can be performed. Beyond common core AMS simulation analysis (DC Bias, time-domain, and frequency-domain simulations) additional extended analysis capabilities are included as standard, such as multi-run parametric sweeps, sensitivity, Monte Carlo, and Worst Case analysis to address specific engineering needs. Key benefits of PADS Analog/Mixed Signal Design: Schematic design (including component data management, constraint definition, and variant capability), analog circuit simulation, and PADS HyperLynx pre-layout analysis all in a single environment.Seamless and accurate representation of both electronic and electromechanical elements of a circuit.Core capabilities for circuit verification and optimization against real-world variability. DDR SimulationDDR memory has become commonplace across the spectrum of electronics designs and is now found in the mainstream markets. By extending the PADS Product Creation Platform to include integrated DDR simulation, the new PADS HyperLynx DDR option allows engineers to quickly identify and solve signal integrity (SI) and timing issues specific to DDRx designs in an easy-to-use and affordable environment. Key capabilities: Identifying and resolving SI impairments (overshooting/undershooting, ringing) and timing issues (set-up/hold, de-rating, skew, data bus margins).Easy setup, automated whole-bus simulation, and consolidated results reporting with DDR Wizard.Streamlined summary pass/fail judgment on entire interfaces.HTML-based reporting which provides design documentation and Web-based publication of results. Electrical DRC, Validation, and Sign-offNow available for the mainstream PCB design market, the PADS HyperLynx DRC tool accelerates the electrical sign-off process by allowing engineers to perform electrical rules checks and identify violations that will affect the design integrity and performance of the board. With pre-defined rules, issues such as traces crossing voids and traces changing reference planes can be quickly identified even on the largest designs. Integrated electrical DRC technology enables engineers to be confident that their PCB designs are electrically correct before hand-off to manufacturing. Key capabilities: Fast and easy time to results with a rules-based approach to identify non-CAD constraints.Out-of-the-box checks for EMI, signal integrity, and power integrity.Visual results, easy identification of violations integrated with the PADS PCB product. “PCB engineering challenges are as profound at the mainstream level as they are at the enterprise level, and Mentor’s mission is to provide competitive advantage to our customers in tacking the most complex designs,” stated AJ Incorvaia, vice president and general manager of Mentor Graphics Board Systems Division. “By bolstering our PADS product creation platform with analog/mixed signal, DDRx, and DRC analysis, plus our recent electronics cooling and DC voltage drop tools, electrical engineers can now access technologies that were out-of-reach for the mainstream PCB market. PADS empowers customers to design complex products, from concept through manufacturing, with great confidence.” Product AvailabilityThe new PADS release with PADS AMS, PADS DRC and PADS DDR analysis options range.
