Original Press Release

Lime Energy Co. Acquires Texas Energy Products and Completes Private Placement

Press release date: Jul 06, 2007


						 Acquisition Brings New Customers, Expands Geographic Presence with Service Capabilities in One of the Nation's Most Populated and Significant Energy Using States

ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill., June 6 / -- Lime Energy Co.  (BULLETIN BOARD: LMEC)  announced today that it has acquired Texas Energy Products, an energy efficiency firm based in Austin, Texas. The transaction valued at $500,000 consisted of a combination cash and Lime Energy common stock.

Texas Energy Products is widely respected throughout Texas, designing and installing energy efficient lighting systems for leading corporate customers including Lockheed Martin, Rolex USA and Sprint, as well as institutions like U.T. Systems, Harding University, and M.D. Anderson Hospital. Having installed more than 300 energy efficient lighting systems and other products in different facility types, the company has enabled its clients to lower operating costs, reduce maintenance expenses, increase property value, improve tenant satisfaction, eliminate PCB ballast liability and reduce emissions while at the same time ensuring full client compliance with the National Energy Policy Act. In addition to lighting Texas Energy Products also offers other energy saving solutions, such as solar window films, reflective roof systems, energy procurement and energy management systems.

"I am happy to announce to our shareholders the acquisition of one of the leading energy services firms in the State of Texas," stated Dan Parke, President and Chief Operating Officer of Lime Energy. "It was important for us as a national leader in the industry to have a physical presence in one of the country's largest energy consuming states. With Texas regulators passing rules to reduce harmful emissions and utilities increasingly offering incentive programs designed to promote electrical efficiency, it was only natural for Lime Energy to become an active participant in Texas, one of the fastest growing markets in the country for electrical efficiency and conservation. The timing of this acquisition could not be any better since Lime recently signed some significant projects in Texas. Texas Energy Products immediately gives us a physical presence and ability to leverage our collective resources creating more value for customers. We expect a smooth integration as management of both companies has a long history of working together on various prior efficiency projects," concluded Mr. Parke.

"We are extremely excited to join one of the country's fastest growing energy services companies," commented Brad Boyett, president and founder of Texas Energy Products. "The market and opportunity for service providers in the energy efficiency industry in Texas as well as the rest of the country is quickly growing.  Clear national leaders in the space will emerge and local companies like ours need to be part of that growth.  By joining Lime, our employees and customers greatly stand to benefit from an enhanced product offering through additional lighting solutions, engineering expertise and a leading HVAC technology."

The company also announced the closing of an additional $2 million completing a total private placement of $5 million in convertible debt.  Last week, the company reported its Chairman, Mr. Dick Kiphart, invested $3 million in the convertible debt private placement and invested an additional $100,000 in this final tranche. As previously reported, proceeds will be utilized in part to set up a finance subsidiary to provide customer financing as well as to fund other potential acquisitions.

For addition information regarding this transaction please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 29, 2007.

March 30, 2016 04:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWARK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lime Energy Co. (NASDAQ:LIME), a leader in designing and implementing 
      demand-side energy efficiency programs for utilities, today announced 
      its results for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015. “Lime 
      Energy is well positioned to provide much needed services to small 
      business customers which meet the changing needs of the electric utility 
      industry,” said Adam Procell, Lime Energy President & CEO. “As this 
      industry takes shape, we will continue to make the investments which 
      position us to be a leader in the space, with a differentiated offering. 
      We will remain at the forefront of serving utility clients and their 
      small business customers.”
    


Results for the Twelve-Month Period ended December 31, 2015



        Consolidated revenue from continuing operations, including from our 
        acquisition of EnerPath, increased $53.8 million, or 91.5%, to $112.6 
        million from $58.8 million earned in 2014.
      

        Gross profit increased $20.1 million, or 113.9%, to $37.8 million. 
        Gross profit margin improved from 30.0% to 33.5%.
      

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $14.9 million, 
        or 73.7%, to $35.1 million. With the acquisition of EnerPath, our 
        combined SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 31.1% 
        for 2015, as compared to 34.3% for 2014. SG&A expenses for 2015 
        included $477 thousand of legal expenses related to our July 2013 
        restatement and related stockholder lawsuits and SEC investigation, 
        compared to $813 thousand in 2014. For 2015, SG&A expenses also 
        included $1.9 million related to the acquisition of EnerPath.
      

        Net loss from continuing operations totaled $2.5 million, compared to 
        a net loss from continuing operations of $2.6 million in 2014.
      

        Net loss from discontinued operations was $632 thousand, compared to 
        income of $7 thousand in 2014.
      

        Net loss was $3.2 million, compared to net loss of $2.6 million in 
        2014.
      

        The basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations 
        improved from $1.44 to $0.40 for 2015. The basic and diluted loss per 
        share from discontinued operations was $0.07 for 2015, compared to 
        $0.00 for 2014. The total basic and diluted loss per share improved 
        from $1.44 to $0.47 for 2015. The expenses related to Lime Energy’s 
        2013 restatement, stockholder lawsuits, and SEC investigation 
        contributed $0.05 and $0.21 to the basic and diluted loss per share 
        from continuing operations and the total net loss per share for 2015 
        and 2014.
      

        Adjusted EBITDA improved to positive $2.6 million from negative $1.5 
        million in 2014. As defined by the Company, Adjusted EBITDA includes 
        acquisition costs, legal expenses related to the 2013 restatement, 
        stockholder lawsuits, and SEC investigation, and a one-time non-cash 
        charge resulting from the Company’s determination, effective during 
        2015, to recognize revenue on the completed contract basis, rather 
        than the percentage of completion method. Our Adjusted EBITDA 
        excluding such expenses was positive $5.6 million in 2015, as compared 
        to negative $701 thousand in 2014.*

Business Highlights



        During 2015, we were awarded several contracts under re-competes with 
        existing clients and expansions of several key utility programs.
      

        On March 24, 2015, we acquired EnerPath International Holding Company, 
        creating a national platform for delivering energy efficiency to mass 
        market customers (small businesses and residential). During 2015, we 
        integrated the technology and product development teams of Lime Energy 
        and EnerPath and are poised to lead the way for innovative technology 
        solutions serving commercial buildings.
      

        We deployed new technology solutions and energy efficiency measures 
        across all of our programs, bringing state-of-the-art solutions 
        including LED lighting to small business customers.
      

        We participated in key regulatory proceedings at the federal and state 
        levels, advocating for energy efficiency as a key solution to 
        environmental and power grid challenges.
      

        We put in place uniform procurement processes across all utility 
        programs.
      

        We moved our headquarters from North Carolina to New Jersey, improving 
        alignment of our executive management team and corporate resources.
      

        We added seven new utility programs, and we now serve 13 of the 
        nation’s 25 largest utilities.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Regulation G 
      Disclosure


      We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted 
      accounting principles (“GAAP”). However, from time to time, we use 
      certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating and discussing the 
      Company’s results and performance. We believe that these non-GAAP 
      measures supplement the readers’ understanding of our financial 
      performance by providing our stockholders and investors with additional 
      information to evaluate our operating performance using criteria used by 
      our management in evaluating our performance in comparison to prior 
      results.
    

      As presented in the tables above, Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain 
      financial information compared with net income (loss), the most directly 
      comparable GAAP financial measure.
    

      Below is reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most 
      directly comparable GAAP financial measure:
