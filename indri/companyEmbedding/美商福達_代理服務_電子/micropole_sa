				Our vision 

Predictive analytics takes your BI-initiatives to the next level, where beyond what happened and why it did.
Your BI-solutions help you to understand what will (or is the most likely to) happen: predictive analytic techniques are linked to business objectives and help people understand based on evidence, what influences, will lead to which business outcome, regardless the area of application.
Customer analytics are at the heart of the Chief Marketing Officer’s business, as well as people analytics in the area of Human Capital Management-initiatives. These are perfect examples of business departments which by nature will highly benefit from predictive analytics by combining transactional and non-structured data by various techniques.

AG Sharpston’s Opinion: Prohibiting Employees From Wearing Religious Signs Or Apparel Is Discrimination
Bougnaoui and anor v Micropole SA; 13 July 2016
At the end of May, Advocate General Kokott in the Belgium case of Achbita and anor v G4S Secure Solutions NV, expressed the view that an employer was not directly discriminating in banning an employee from wearing an Islamic headscarf in the workplace, and that while the measure could be indirectly discriminatory, it could potentially be justified in pursuance of their policy of religious and ideological neutrality. This might be thought to be consistent with the judgment of the ECHR in SAS v France [2014] EqLR 590 in which any interference with rights to private life under Art 8 ECHR, to religion under Art 9 or to non-discrimination under Art 14 by banning the veil in public was found to be justified.
 
A different analysis is proffered by Advocate General Sharpston who has delivered her Opinion on a referral to the ECJ from the Cour d’Appel de Paris in the case of Bougnaoui and anor v Micropole SA. The first question is whether  dismissing an Islamic employee for wearing her headscarf at work, contrary to specific instructions, is directly discriminatory, and if so whether it can be  defended under Article 4(1) of the EU Equal Treatment Framework Directive (No.2000/78), as being a  ‘genuine and determining occupational requirement’?
The basis for Microple’s decision to dismiss Ms  Bougnaoui was that a client had found her wearing of a headscarf to be embarrassing to a number of their employees. It was argued that there was a genuine and determining occupational requirement that Ms Bougnaoui not wear the religious apparel, and in light of her refusal to comply, they were justified in dismissing her.
Having considered the Strasbourg case law and the European legislation, AG Sharpston has taken the view that Ms Bougnaoui’s dismissal amounted to direct discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. Could Micropole then turn to Article 4(1) to defend this dismissal?
AG Sharpston noted that recital 23 of the Directive states that the derogation should apply only ‘in very limited circumstances’. The EU case law provides that this must be interpreted strictly, i.e. only where it is absolutely necessary in order to undertake the professional activity in question. AG Sharpston cites two examples to demonstrate. First, a male Sikh employee, in a post requiring protective headgear, may not be able to insist on wearing his turban. Secondly, a female Muslim working with dangerous factory machinery cannot insist on wearing attire that would give rise to safety concerns. Beyond that, AG Sharpston found it hard to envisage any other scenarios where the requirement is absolutely necessary.
It follows, in AG Sharpston’s view, that the mere commercial interests of a business, its profit margins or customer satisfaction will not suffice. Micropole should not succeed in justifying their actions under Article 4(1). To interpret the Article as Micropole have sought to do would risk ‘normalising’ the derogation which is to be applied in only the most limited of circumstances.
AG Sharpston then went on to consider, in case she was wrong on direct discrimination, whether Micropole’s actions amounted to indirect discrimination. If so, could they be objectively justified as a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary (under Article 2(2)(b))?
Here, AG Sharpston considered, it could be argued that the interest of the employer’s business could constitute a legitimate aim. The freedom to carry on business is not, however, an absolute right. It is subject to limitations imposed by the right to equal treatment. These two protected rights – the right to carry on a business and the right to manifest one’s religion - are potentially in conflict, as was the case here. It is then a question of proportionality.
There are many factors which will affect whether a requirement is proportionate. AG Sharpston takes the view that, in the vast majority of cases, a proportionate accommodation can be found. As a last resort, however, the business interest in generating maximum profit should give way to the employee’s right to manifest her religious belief. Micropole’s discrimination in this case could, therefore, not be justified as a proportionate aim
AG Sharpston ended her Opinion by drawing attention to the ‘insidiousness of the argument, “but we need to do X because otherwise our customers won’t like it.” Where the customer’s attitude may itself be indicative of prejudice based on one of the “prohibited factors”, such as religion, it seems to me particularly dangerous to excuse the employer from compliance with an equal treatment requirement in order to pander to that prejudice.’
 
The ECJ is due to hear this matter along with Achbita and anor v G4S Secure Solutions NV towards the end of the year.

We recently posted a blog on the case of Achbita v G4S (which can be found here), in which the Advocate General gave the opinion that a ban on all religious, political and philosophical symbols did not amount to direct discrimination against a Muslim woman who wished to wear a headscarf. She noted that it could be indirectly discriminatory but was objectively justified. 
A different Advocate General has now given a contrasting opinion in the similar case of Bougnaoui v Micropole SA, concluding that dismissing an employee for wearing an Islamic headscarf at work, in breach of an instruction not to, was directly discriminatory. This opens up further debate on the wearing of religious clothing and symbols in the workplace. 
In Bougnaoui, the employee had been told when recruited that she would not be able to wear her headscarf at all times due to the customer facing nature of her role. Following a site visit to a customer, the customer complained about her wearing of the headscarf and requested she not do so in future. When this was raised with her, she refused to comply with the customer’s wishes and was dismissed. She was unsuccessful in her claim of religious discrimination in the French courts and her case was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The question for the ECJ was whether, presuming this treatment was discriminatory, whether it could be justified as a ‘genuine and determining occupational requirement.’ 
It was not clear what the terms were applied to Ms Bougnaoui in terms of prohbiting the wearing of her headscarf. She argued that it applied to the wearing of her headscarf when in contact with customers, whereas Micropole alleged that there was a general ban which applied to all religious signs when visiting a customer. The AG found that, regardless of what the policy was, it was clear that Ms. Bougnaoui’s dismissal was linked to the provision prohibiting wearing religious signs.  Although Ms Bougnaoui was not dismissed because she was Muslim, the AG was of the view that the relevant Directive extends to manifestations of religion or belief in providing protection from direct discrimination. It was clear that Ms Bougnaoui’s dismissal was linked to the manifestation of her religious belief. On this basis, she had been treated less favourably than other employees in a comparable situation as another employee not wearing anything in manifestation of his or her religion would not have been dismissed. Micropole had therefore directly discriminated against her. 
In order for the dismissal to be lawful, the policy would have to amount to a “genuine and determining occupational requirement”. The AG concluded that it did not. She noted that this exception should only be available in very limited circumstances and not used to justify a blanket exception for all the activities carried out by an employee. The AG gave examples of health and safety cases where particular religious attire may present a danger, where prohibiting the wearing of the attire would be justified. The AG found that Micropole were relying on commercial interests and the wishes of a client to justify discrimination, but direct discrimination cannot be justified on the grounds of financial loss. Further, while Micropole has the freedom to conduct a business, that might be subject to protecting the rights of others, in this case the right of Ms Bougnaoui not to be discriminated against on the grounds of her religion. The AG therefore found that the requirement for Ms Bougnaoui to remove her headscarf was not a genuine and determining occupational requirement which was justified, noting that to allow the legislation to be interpreted so that businesses could justify discrimination on the basis of commercial grounds or interaction with clients would not be right. 
The AG also goes on to consider indirect discrimination, in the event that the ECJ disagrees with her that there was direct discrimination. In this regard, she concluded that the policy could be indirectly discriminatory, which can be justified if the policy is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. She noted that the interests of the employer’s business constitutes a legitimate aim, and the key issue in a given case will be proportionality. She notes that in a customer facing role, a ban may be proportionate if it prohibits the wearing of religious apparel which covers the entire face and eyes, whereas this same ban may not be appropriate in a non-customer facing role. 
This decision poses interesting questions, given its divergence from the opinion given by the Advocate General in the Achbita v G4S case. In that case, the AG found that a blanket ban on all religious and philosophical symbols could be objectively justified with reference to the business’s interests and the customer facing nature of the business. That would appear to directly conflict with the decision reached in this case. Indeed, the Achbita opinion has been the subject of criticism, as it was not clear what in particular about a customer facing role made it necessary that the employee was not identified with any particular religion. There was also some criticism of the suggestion by the AG that the employee’s religion could be ‘left at the door’ while in the workplace. The AG in the Bougnaoui case appears to disagree with this, noting ‘it would be entirely wrong to suppose that, whereas one’s sex and skin colour accompany one everywhere, somehow one’s religion does not.’ 
The ECJ is still to give its judgment in both cases later this year, and it remains to be seen whether it will follow the respective opinions of the Advocates General. Given the divergences of opinion, agreement with the AG in both cases could result in conflicting precedent and uncertainty. It is to be hoped that the decisions of the court provide some clarity on the issue.
