Again, I've submitted a COI form for approval to you guys per Home Depot's instructions that⋯⋯ once received by your team via email that it would be processed. I submitted my COI on the 10th. I called on the 20th and once again my submission had not been touched and had to be expedited through your process only to have your team send my authorization off to the wrong email address rather than the one on the form that is required to be submitted along with the COI, and now I'm waiting again and your team has delayed our product line launch. If a Home Depot VP were in your office watching, you'd lose the contract, I'm telling you right now. 更多Rick Bessom · 2017年4月29日I was never there yet was listed as checked in - you guys need to fix whatever it is that is falsely announcing stuffLee Primeau · 2015年3月5日Grrr,  So last Friday I spoke with a sales worker by the name of Deshaun Queset, from Adam Education about an issue with logging into to my Anatomy Interactive ⋯⋯account. The issue was initially my fault, I inadvertently signed up for the six month account when I needed the 12 month account. After explaining this situation to Mr. Queset over the telephone he assured me that I will be waved the full price for the 12 month subscription and in deed would only have to pay the difference between the two subscriptions which would end up breaking even with payment. In addition to this he agreed to send me a link for a temporary login so I could complete the coursework over the weekend.   It is not Thursday and Mr. Queset has yet to fulfill any of his promises made to me over the telephone. So as a result I will go ahead and tag this post to EBIX (this programs parent company) everyday until my issue can be handled by a competent individual. Congratulations Mr. Queset, I will hold you accountable for the pseudo promises you made.   End of Rant,  Lee Primeau 更多Shiva Krishna · 2016年4月5日I have been trying to contact the company regarding my employment issue and the HRs don't like to respond...
