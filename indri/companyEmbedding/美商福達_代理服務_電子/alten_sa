Alten SA Key Developments

Alten SA Reports Revenue Results for the First Half Ended June 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
Jul 26 17
Alten SA reported revenue results for the first half ended June 2017. Consolidated turnover at end of June 2017 shows sustained growth: turnover in France grew by 8.6% while international business increased by 17.1%. On a like-for-a-like basis and constant exchange rate, business increased by 7.1% (up 5.8% in France and 8.3% outside France). Organic growth for this first half was penalized by a negative calendar effect on the second quarter; on constant working days, organic growth would have reached 8%. As compared to second quarter 2016, business grows by 8.3% on second quarter 2017. On a constant exchange rate, business increased by 3.7% (up 2.6% in France and 4.8% outside France). Without a negative calendar effect, organic growth would have reached 8.0%. The company reported turnover of €983.7 million against €870.5 million a year ago. 

Following on first half 2017 and assuming similar economic conditions, ALTEN should achieve positive organic growth in 2017. It is also expected to strengthen a targeted strategy of external growth to further accelerate its expansion.
