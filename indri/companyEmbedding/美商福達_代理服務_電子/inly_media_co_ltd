Market Share Versus Profits


Compared to the same period last year, 603598-CN‘s change in revenue was close to the amount of its change in earnings.  It remains to be seen how the rest of its peer group’s results will turn out and if 603598-CN‘s performance is a sign of any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector.  Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 23.50% and earnings by 176.57% compared to the previous period.

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s earnings rose year-on-year.  But this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations.  Gross margins went from 6.83% to 7.99% for the same period last year, while operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 2.51% to 4.10% over the same time frame.

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.


603598-CN‘s decline in gross margins were offset by some improvements on the balance sheet.  The management of working capital, for example, shows progress.  The company’s working capital days have fallen to 77.93 days from 114.66 days for the same period last year.  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the gross margin decline is not altogether bad.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
603598-CN‘s year-on-year change in operating cash flow of -72.50% is around its change in earnings.  This suggests that there are likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves for managing earnings this period.

Margins
Despite a decline in operating (EBIT) margins as well as a decline in pretax margins, the company’s earnings rose.

Company Overview

603598-CN has traded publicly for less than a year.


Inly Media Co., Ltd. Class A currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (10.36) than its peer median (1.50).


603598-CN‘s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P/E or Price/EBITDA are not meaningful to make this analysis between operating advantage (ROE) and growth expectations (as suggested by P/E or P/EBITDA).


603598-CN‘s median net profit margins and relatively high asset efficiency give it some operating leverage.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


Over the last five years, 603598-CN‘s return on assets has declined from above median to about median among its peers, indicating declining relative operating performance.


The company’s relatively low gross margin and median pre-tax margin suggest operations may be constrained on pricing versus peers.
