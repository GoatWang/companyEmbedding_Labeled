		United States Products Co. was founded in 1917 as a manufacturer of lapping, grinding and polishing compounds.What is lapping and polishing? "Lapping is a low speed, low-pressure abrading operation that accomplishes one or more of the following results:*
	








Extreme accuracy of lapped surfaces (flat or spherical)
Close parallelism of double lapped faces
Extremely close fit between mating surfaces
Removal of damaged surface and sub-surface layers that may degrade electrical and/or optical properties of the lapped workpiece.
	    Polishing is just lapping using finer abrasive products.
			
			As we move into the 21st Century, we continue to provide the ultimate in precision finishing compounds for the final polishing of metal, ceramic, plastic and glass workpieces.

						Welcome to United Yarn…



						United Yarn was started by Saul Rosen in 1930 and 
						incorporated in the State of NJ. Saul began the company 
						by selling silk yarn waste. In 1960 Saul Rosen built his 
						own successful yarn processing operation in Staunton, 
						Virginia. Fiberspun was a state-of-the-art facility, 
						with texturing, beaming, rewinding, and twisting 
						operations, and prospered for 28 years, when in 1988 was 
						sold to Unifi, Inc.

						United Yarn continues to sell and distribute nylon and 
						polyester filament yarns, both first grade and off-grade 
						to various markets, such as raschel lace, tricot, warp 
						knits, narrow fabrics, apparel, home furnishings, 
						industrial, circular knit, hosiery, broadwoven, etc. The 
						range of deniers is from 10 denier up to heavy deniers 
						such as 10000 denier and higher. We also sell 
						nylon tow up to 40000 denier. 
						
						United Yarn has warehouses 
						in VA , NC, SC, and RI.

						United Yarn today is a global company, sourcing various 
						yarns and 
						selling all over the world. It has maintained exclusive 
						agreements with major fiber manufacturers worldwide.

						United Yarn has been successful because of the services 
						it provides to its customers. Saul's sons own and 
						operate United Yarn. Martin Rosen has been President and 
						Arthur Rosen, Vice President since 1976.

						Martin Rosen is also President of Kennetex, specializing 
						in space-dyed polyester, nylon and polypropylene, and 
						American Drawtech, which manufactures fully drawn 
						polyester filament fiber.

Who We Are


United Health Products develops, produces, and markets innovative wound care products based on our proprietary hemostatic gauze core technology.
Our products are distributed under the brand name HemoStypÂ®, and other private label names, to the trauma, dental, dialysis, and veterinary markets.
We are customer driven. We distribute our products worldwide and support our partners with ideas and solutions that will  help them manage the health and safety of the people they serve. United Health Products is based in Henderson, Nevada and our common stock trades under the symbol â€œUEEC".
More about our company...



What We Do


We make HemoStyp, a bio-compatible sterile gauze that produces hemostasis in seconds when applied to
      a cut or open wound. It is a patented hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding.
HemoStyp contains no harmful chemicals, additives, or animal by-products and can be easily removed with saline, or left in the wound to be absorbed, without compromising coagulation.
 HemoStyp is available in multiple configurations and sizes to help control most types of bleeding including: cuts, abrasions, and lacerations; nose bleeds; dental surgeries; post dialysis treatment; and punctures.
More about our products... 


A Force of Nature


HemoStyp is an all-natural hemostatic product that is formulated  from oxidized regenerated cellulose. Cellulose molecules are found in the cellular structure of virtually all plant matter, which makes cellulose one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth. 
       HemoStyp is cellulose from cotton fiber. Cellulose from cotton  fiber is the purist form of cellulose  found in nature. Because of its purity and the fact that it degrades rapidly into biocompatible end products (glucose, water), it can be fully absorbed into the body and promotes wound healing.
Our oxidizing process makes HemoStyp a safe, effective, all-natural solution for rapid bleeding control.
