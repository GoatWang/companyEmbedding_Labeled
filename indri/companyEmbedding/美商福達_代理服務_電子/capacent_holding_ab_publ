Capacent Holding AB (publ) considers listing on Nasdaq First North Stockholm.
Aug 24, 2015

Capacent Holding AB (publ) (“Capacent” or “the Company”) aims for continued growth, both organically and through acquisitions. The Company is currently investigating the possibility of listing its ordinary shares on the Nasdaq First North Stockholm market in the fall of 2015.
The objective behind the potential stock listing is to build on the company’s already strong market profile and facilitate future acquisitions. The listing also enables a long-term incentive program, whereby key persons within the Company buy Capacent shares on the market for an allocated cash bonus payment.
Capacent is a Nordic management consulting firm focusing on improving its customers’ profitability and cash flow. Demand for the Company’s services is increasing and the market outlook remains favourable in terms of continued growth. Capacent recorded a growth of 14.6 per cent in 2014, significantly higher than the Nordic management consulting market, whose growth for the same period amounted to 4.7 per cent. With its extensive service offering and some 100 employees located at four offices in Sweden and Finland, Capacent holds a strong position in the Nordic market.
Edvard Björkenheim, CEO of Capacent: “Most industries and companies nowadays find themselves amidst continuous change, as globalization and digital development set new demands on business operations. Capacent helps companies make the right choices, set action plans and ensure an efficient implementation. The core of our business is driving change in a result-oriented manner – a task that tends to be the most difficult one for companies. We are ready to take the next step in Capacent’s development: become more visible in the market, get a currency for acquisitions and attract and maintain top consultants – all of which are necessary for our continued profitable growth.”
