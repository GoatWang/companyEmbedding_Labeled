A solution architect, in information technology, is a practitioner of solution architecture. Typically part of the solution development team, the solution architect translates requirements created by functional analysts into the architecture for that solution and describing it through architecture and design artifacts. The rest of the development team then uses those artifacts to implement the solution. The solution architect's process typically involves selecting the most appropriate technology for the problem.[1][2]
Overview of the role[edit]
An individual performing the role of a solution architect focuses on converting requirements into the architecture and design that ultimately constitute the blueprint for the solution. In that process, the solution architect usually relies on design patterns from their previous engagements, published reference architectures, and on guidance from enterprise architecture. In their efforts, solution architects balance architectural concerns of the projects with the concerns of the enterprise.[1][2][3]
The solution architect is often the development team leader. As such, they are often expected to provide motivation and guidance to the entire development team during the systems development life cycle. The solution architect must ensure buy-in from the development team, so that the team is motivated to match the detailed design of the solution to the higher-level architecture.[1][2]
Solution architects play an important role in ensuring that the solution architecture aligns with the roadmaps established by the enterprise architecture, and that it adheres to the enterprise architecture principles. Solution architects are both a consumer and contributor to enterprise architecture collateral. Often, the patterns and guidance solution architects develop becomes reusable in a broader enterprise architecture context.[3]
Solution architects vs. enterprise architects[edit]
Solution architects in large organizations often act as the bridge between [architecture] and applications architecture.
An enterprise architect's deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architect's, but not always. The main distinction between the two lies in their different goals. The enterprise architect is primarily employed to design, plan, and govern strategic and cross-organisational rationalization or optimization of an enterprise's services, processes, or components. The solution architect primarily helps programmers and project managers in the design, planning, and governance of projects of any kind.
A solution architect may have a reporting line to an enterprise architect, but the influence the enterprise architect team has on solution architects depends on an organisation's policies and management structure. So, the extent to which a solution architect's work derives from an enterprise architect's road maps vary from 0 to 100 percent.
Where the solution architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. For example, an enterprise may employ a solution architect on a feasibility study, or to prepare a solution vision or solution outline for an invitation to tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at bid time, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a solution architect to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it.

Decentralize decision-making
—SAFe Lean-Agile Principle #9



 
Product and Solution Management
The Product Management role has content authority for the Program Backlog. They are responsible for identifying customer needs, prioritizing features and developing the program Vision and Roadmap. In a similar manner, Solution Management has the content authority for the Solution Backlog. They work with Customers to understand their needs, create the Solution vision and Roadmap, define requirements, and guide work through the Solution Kanban.
Lean-Agile enterprises focus on delivering the right Solutions to customers with the highest quality in the shortest lead times. This requires people with clear content authority to take responsibility for continuously defining, prioritizing, and validating requirements. Working closely with development in short, integrated learning cycles, they bring the voice of the customer to the developers, and the voice of development to the customer.
In accordance with Principle 9 – Decentralized Decision-Making, SAFe prescribes a content authority chain that extends through three levels. Solution Management is responsible for guiding the solutions that constitute the Solution. Product Management is responsible for Program Vision and Backlog. And, finally, Product Owners make fast, local content decisions on behalf of the Agile Team.
This article describes the important roles that Product Managers and Solutions Managers play in SAFe. While the roles are similar in most respects, they operate at different levels of the solution and manage different concerns.
Details
Product Management and Solution Management are the main content authority for the Program and Solution Backlogs, respectively. They create the Vision and  work with Customers to understand their needs, define requirements, and guide work through the Solution and Program Kanbans. They prioritize work using WSJF, schedule Feature and Capabilities for Release using the Roadmap, validate customer response, and provide fast feedback.
A Lean-Agile Approach to Content Management
What SAFe describes as content has traditionally been represented by a Marketing Requirements Document (MRD), Product Requirements Document, and System and Software Requirements Specifications (SRS).
In waterfall development, these specifications were typically done up front, with an expectation that all the requirements could be established in advance of Solution development. However, it didn’t work out all that well that way, and the move to a Lean-Agile approach is driven in large part by that result.
We now understand that assumptions about requirements, design, and architecture all need to be validated through actual development, testing, and experimentation [1], and that teams must be open to emerging knowledge that can be quickly fed back into the solution. In SAFe, Continuous Exploration is the process used to continually explore market and user needs, and defining a Vision, Roadmap, and set of features and capabilities that address those needs.
As we see in Solution Intent, some of the requirements of the solution are likely to be well understood and fixed from the beginning, while others are variable and can only be understood during the development process. Managing this new approach is the primary responsibility of Product and Solution Management. In the Lean Enterprise, these responsibilities must be fulfilled in a far more Agile manner, as is illustrated in Table 1.

Responsibilities of Product Management
The following section describes the primary responsibilities of the Product Manager in the context of a single Agile Release Train. For larger (multiple-ART) Solution Trains, additional responsibilities are necessary. Those are described in later sections.

Understand Customer needs and validate solutions. Product Management is the internal voice of the Customer for the ART and works with Customers (as well as Product Owners) to constantly understand and communicate their needs and participate in validation of the proposed solutions.
Understand and support portfolio work. Every ART lives in the context of a portfolio, so Product Management has a responsibility to understand the Budget parameters for the upcoming fiscal period, understand how Strategic Themes influence the strategic direction, and work with Epic Owners to develop the business case for Epics that affect their ART.
Develop and communicate the program vision and roadmap. Product Management continuously develops and communicates the vision to the development teams and defines the Features of the system. In collaboration with System and Solution Architect/Engineering, they also define and maintain the Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs), to help ensure that the solution meets relevant standards and other system quality requirements. They are responsible for the roadmap, which illustrates, at a high level, how features are intended to be implemented over time.
Manage and prioritize the flow of work. Product Management manages the flow of work though the program Kanban and into the program backlog. Product Management is responsible for making sure that there are enough ready features in the backlog at all times. To be ready, they develop feature acceptance criteria that can be used to establish that the feature meets its Definition of Done (DoD). And since judicious selection and sequencing of features is the key economic driver for each ART, the backlog is reprioritized with WSJF prior to each PI Planning session.
Participate in PI planning. During each PI planning session, Product Management presents the vision, which highlights the proposed features of the solution, along with any relevant upcoming Milestones. They also typically participate as Business Owners for the train, with the responsibility of approving PI Objectives and establishing business value.
Define releases and Program Increments. Owning the ‘what’ means that Product Management is largely responsible for release definition as well, including new features, architecture, and allocations for technical debt. This is accomplished through a series of Program Increments and releases, whose definition and business objectives are also determined by Product Management. Product Management works with Release Management, where applicable, to decide when enough value has been accrued to warrant a release to the Customer.
Work with System Architect/Engineering to understand Enabler work. While Product Management is not expected to drive technological decisions, they are expected to understand the scope of the upcoming Enabler work and to work with System and Solution Architect/Engineering to assist with decision-making and sequencing of the key technological infrastructures that will host the new business functionality. This can often best be accomplished by establishing a capacity allocation, as described in Program Backlog.
Participate in demos and Inspect and Adapt. Product Management is an active participant in biweekly System Demos, including the aggregate one at the end of the PI. They are also involved in assessment of Metrics, including evaluation of business value achieved versus plan, and are active participants in the Inspect and Adapt workshop.
Build an effective Product Manager/Product Owner team. Though the Product Owner and Product Management roles may report to different organizations, forming an effective extended Product Management/Product Owner team is the key to efficient and effective development. Such a team also contributes materially to the job satisfaction that comes with being part of a high-performing team, one that routinely delivers on its quality and vision commitments.

Product Management’s Participation in Large Value Streams
The above section highlights the role of Product Management in the context of the ART. For teams building large solutions that require multiple ARTs, Product Management has additional responsibilities:

Collaborate with Solution Management. At the large solution level, Solution Management plays a similar role, but with a focus on the capabilities of the larger solution. But building an effective solution is no more effective than the collaboration between the two roles. This collaboration involves participation in solution backlog refinement and prioritization, as well as splitting Capabilities into features, and NFRs, as the case may be.
Participate in Pre- and Post-PI Planning. Product Management also participates in the Pre-PI Planning meeting, working with the value stream stakeholders to define the inputs, milestones, and high-level objectives for the upcoming PI planning session. In the Post-PI Planning session, Product Management helps synthesize findings into an agreed-to set of solution PI objectives.
Participate in the Solution Demo. Product Management participates in the Solution Demo, often demonstrating the capabilities that their ART has contributed and reviewing the contributions of the other ARTs, always with a systems view, and always with an eye toward fitness of purpose.
Collaborate with Release Management. In larger-scale systems, Release Management also plays a significant role. Product Management works with the key stakeholders on progress, budget, release strategy, and releasability of their elements of the solution.

Responsibilities of Solution Management
Solution Management plays much the same role that Product Management plays, but at the large solution level. There, Solution Management is part of a critical trio—Solution Management, Solution Train Engineer, and Solution Architect/Engineering—that shares much of the responsibility for solution success. Solution Management is responsible for the solution intent, which captures and documents fixed and variable solution level behaviors. They also work with Release Management where applicable.
Responsibilities include working with portfolio stakeholders, Customers, ARTs  and Solution Trains to understand needs and build and prioritize the solution backlog. They have similar vision, roadmap, solution Kanban, and solution demo activities as well.
Solution Management plays a crucial role in pre- and post-PI planning, as well as Large Solution-level inspect and adapt workshops. They also work with Suppliers, making sure the requirements for supplier-delivered capabilities are understood and assisting with the conceptual integration of these concerns.

                什麼是客戶關係管理 (CRM)？ 
            




	客戶關係管理 (CRM) 旨在管理企業最重要的一個目標：滿足客戶需求。一個成效卓著的客戶關係管理系統應涵蓋並提升客戶介面的所有層面，從銷售、行銷
到客戶服務

不一而足，使現有的客戶關係變得更加緊密，新建立的客戶關係也能快速發展，而這些正是企業獲致成功的所有核心要件。Salesforce 是專精於客戶關係管理的全球領導者，同業難以望其項背。我們開發的技術與客戶管理軟體都是專為個別企業量身打造，能提升企業工作的簡潔性、整合性、效率與能見度。作為雲端運算服務的供應商，我們提出 Salesforce CRM 軟體即服務的作法，並搭配 Force.com PaaS (平台即服務)，讓您能多工作業，同時追蹤客戶與預算，達成當今經濟環境中不可或缺的一環。馬上體驗 30 日 CRM 免費試用版

                Salesforce 致力提供更好的 CRM 系統 
            




	更快速。更實惠。更簡單。更優異。Salesforce 協助您的企業更上一層樓。Salesforce 的客戶關係管理軟體能立即簡化並自動化您的業務流程。透過建立基礎架構即服務模式，能讓銷售、行銷和支援團隊協同合作，獲得全面的銷售與客戶重要資料，使員工有餘裕可開發新的客戶，同時提供現有客戶更好的服務。









            
                為何 Salesforce 能為企業銷售與行銷帶來革命性的改變？ 
            




我們的客戶關係管理解決方案之所以有效，在於能協助銷售代表和行銷團隊專注於完成銷售管線，創造收益，而不是花時間在手動追蹤潛在客戶。Salesforce Australia 的客戶管理軟體讓行銷團隊能透過多種管道行銷，並檢視與客戶相關的所有資訊與活動，指出行銷活動的成敗關鍵，更頻繁也更快速地將商機轉換為客戶。

                為何選擇網路 CRM 而非傳統的 CRM 軟體？ 
            




當代企業文化浪潮正逐漸拋棄傳統的客戶關係管理軟體，因為安裝與維護軟體的成本過高，使得客戶紛紛轉向網路或代管的關係管理平台。有了 Salesforce 提供的隨收隨付模式為您節省花費，何必再付出更多成本管理潛在客戶，完整記錄成功的客戶互動過程？
Sales Force Australia 提供的銷售即服務 (SaaS) 擅長銷售追蹤與測量和組織企業，銷售價格卻非常經濟實惠。
網路 CRM 能更快回收成本。我們的客戶管理軟體讓您不必再大手筆投入 IT 基礎架構和技術維護人員，透過 PaaS 即可簡化現有的 IT 成本，因此能更快回收投資成本。網路型 CRM 能協助企業快速轉型。安裝代管型 CRM 僅須花費數週或數月的時間，相對於平均耗時 12 個月的用戶端/伺服器型 CRM 工具，可說是大獲全勝。代管型 CRM 的操作更為簡便。Salesforce 的基本 CRM 能夠輕易自訂，並且具備操作便捷的介面，即使非技術人員的使用者也能輕易上手。隨選型 CRM 提供無限的擴充能力。Salesforce 軟體採用多租用戶架構，軟體中沒有任何執行個體，因此運作上更快速，安裝也更便宜。網路型 CRM 主打無痛升級。為客戶管理系統部署新的功能只需片刻即可完成，讓您隨時都能升級使用最新版本。









            
                什麼是雲端運算？ 
            




雲端運算是新世紀最具革命性的企業軟體供應方式，一切都在網路上完成。目前最引人注目的雲端運算模式正將客戶關係管理市場轉型為永久租用模式，因此不必再費力採購、安裝、維護或升級軟體或硬體。
