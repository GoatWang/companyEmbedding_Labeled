SQL語法






﻿




﻿SQL 是用來做什麼的呢？一個最常用的方式是將資料從資料庫中的表格內選出。從這一句回答中，我們馬上可以看到兩個關鍵字： 從 (FROM)資料庫中的表格內選出 (SELECT)。(表格是一個資料庫內的結構，它的目的是儲存資料。在表格處理這一部分中，我們會提到如何使用 SQL 來設定表格。) 我們由這裡可以看到最基本的 SQL 架構：

SELECT "欄位名" FROM "表格名";
我們用以下的例子來看看實際上是怎麼用的。假設我們有以下這個表格：

Store_Information 表格

Store_NameSalesTxn_Date
Los Angeles150005-Jan-1999
San Diego25007-Jan-1999
Los Angeles30008-Jan-1999
Boston70008-Jan-1999

若要選出所有的店名 (Store_Name)，我們就鍵入：


SELECT Store_Name FROM Store_Information;
結果:

Store_Name
Los Angeles
San Diego
Los Angeles
Boston

我們一次可以讀取好幾個欄位，也可以同時由好幾個表格中選資料。

Digitalization means buildings talk.

All around the world, buildings are doing something they’ve never done before. They are talking! Digitalization gives them a voice. Buildings tell us how they feel, if they are under stress, what they are missing. We understand what they are saying! And with the information they give us, we create perfect places. 






























Building information modeling (BIM)

Building information modeling (BIM) is the equivalent of digitalization in the construction industry: It is a digitally supported process for planning, constructing and operating buildings that enables a significant productivity increase in the construction industry.
