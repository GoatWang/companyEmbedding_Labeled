Company History
NEC Corporation found it essential to have a company that
would be dedicated to the construction of telecommunication networks
and systems that brought about the creation of NEC Network and System
Integration Corp. (NESIC JAPAN) in 1953. 
With technological advancement and market growth in the field
of computers and communications, the scope of its business has expanded
to cover system integration and support for information network systems
and computer and communication products. 
As the overseas businesses have naturally grown throughout the
years, NESIC, Ltd. (Japan) established several branches and
subsidiaries to serve the requirements of the different projects
worldwide and in 1991, NEC System Integration and Construction
(NESIC) Philippines, Inc. was created. 
Since its formation in 1991, NESIC Philippines has
consistently followed the path of positive developments and innovative
approaches to telecommunications and information technology as
supported by NESIC Japan. Its historical era is characterized by...

INTENSIVE TECHNICAL TRAINING

BEYOND PURE TELECOM PROJECTS
towards convergent voice, audio, video and data
communication solutions




 
FORMATIVE YEARS - Honing Technical Expertise
The birth of NESIC Philippines Inc. (NPI) was the result of
NESIC Japan's overseas strategic business direction. Its initial years
were strongly focused on acquiring world-class technical expertise in
telecommunication engineering from its Mother Company, NEC SYSTEM
INTEGRATION and CONSTRUCTION, LTD.(NESIC Japan). Japan's leading system
integrator for over 45 years.
During these formative years, NPI engineers underwent rigid
training in Japan and "on-the-job" exposure to various on-going
projects worldwide contracted by NESIC Japan. This era saw the
fulfillment of NESIC JAPAN'S commitment to transfer technology to the
Philippines

STABLE GROWTH - Increased Telecommunications Projects
Over the succeeding years, NPI was engaged in various domestic
and overseas telecommunication projects contracted by NESIC JAPAN.
By mid-90's, NPI received commendation from NESIC JAPAN for
the technical skills and outstanding performance of its engineers in
its various participated projects. NPI was likewise included in
Philippine Presidential Citation to NEC Group of local
subsidiaries-affiliates for "significant contribution to the Philippine
economy and industrial development through technology transfer,
nurturing new support industries, creating job opportunities and
generating foreign earnings."

NPI was among NESIC JAPAN's affiliates engineering service provider for
its telecommunication infrastructure projects from various telephone
carrier in the Philippines covering diverse scope of engineering
design, implementation, project management, testing and commissioning
up to operations and maintenance

CONVERGENCE - Telecom and IT Technologies
In response to the growing trend towards convergence of voice
telephony with on-line data computer services, video and the internet
infrastructure, NPI with direction from NESIC Japan is positioning
itself as a company that goes beyond its basic telecommunication
engineering services.
By the turn of the century, NPI started to offer convergent
communication solutions to its growing number of clientele, partnering
itself with trusted and reliable hardware and software vendors such as
Computer Associates, 3M Philippines and NEC Philippines to offer
cost-effective turnkey solutions.
