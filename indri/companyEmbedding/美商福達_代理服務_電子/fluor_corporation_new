MOL Group Selects Fluor as Project Management Consultant
Jul 20 17
MOL Group plans to spend USD 1.9 billion in the chemical and petrochemical industry in 2017-2021. The USD 1 billion industrial complex to be built in Hungary will be the biggest organic investment project of the next five years. MOL is in the final stages of selecting the licensor for polyether polyol technology as well as the contractor for the engineering of the utilities and other facilities. MOL has selected Fluor as Project Management Consultant (PMC) for the front-end engineering design and engineering, procurement and construction phases of the project. The new product line will not only provide access to attractive markets in the CEE region, but will also form a logical continuation of MOL's strategy to move further along the downstream value chain towards semi-commodity and specialty chemicals products. Propylene oxide-based polyols are used as raw materials for polyurethane foams, which are widely applied in the automotive, construction, packaging and furniture industries. The planned new industrial complex consists of HPPO plants with capacity to produce 200 kt/year of propylene oxide as well several production lines for polyether polyols, utilities and other infrastructural investments.

The cost of a refinery facility usually runs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but can go as high as $1.5 billion. Whatever the total costs, the budgeting for these enormous projects involves many complex engineering and materials considerations. To deal with the megabuck uncertainties in its estimates for clients, Fluor Corporation—the multinational engineering, construction and project management firm—has recently standardized on @RISK.  
Waymon Lofton, who is in charge of global estimating for Fluor's oil and gas business, says this change has brought three big improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of the global estimating process. The first is standardization itself. “Our estimators travel. They go from office to office, and the tools they would use in one place were inconsistent with the tools in the next. But their time is always valuable, and they're always in short supply. Our goal was to have the estimators spend less time chasing around and more time estimating.”  
Next is the improved ease and speed of the model building. Before Waymon and his colleagues settled on a standard tool, they compared all the software packages on the market and found @RISK to be “the easiest with the most capabilities.” These qualities have now proved themselves over and over. The team has even used the software to develop a generic model by including what Waymon refers to as a “checklist” of costs and their variability. This has further streamlined the estimating process. 
Finally, Waymon reports an unexpected benefit from standardizing on @RISK: “risk analysis within Fluor has moved up to a different level because of Palisade training on the software.” Fluor learned ways they could deal more accurately with the statistical aspects of their models. This of course made the models more accurate and reliable. Fluor can now feel confident that their second-round models leave room for only +10%, -5% error.
 “We worked closely with Fluor to tailor their @RISK license to meet their needs,” says Randy Heffernan, Palisade Vice President. “Fluor is a great example of how Palisade corporate licenses can benefit many organizations – improved efficiency, greater analytical insight, and increased usage across the board.” What all these changes add up to is, according to Waymon, “a significant improvement over the way we used to do things.”

 Fluor corporate headquarters				



Engineering and construction firm Fluor Limited will provide project management contractor services for a new oil and gas complex in Azerbaijan.
The company said that it was appointed as project management contractor by Azerbaijan’s state-owned national oil corporation, the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), following a bidding process.
The oil-gas processing and petrochemical complex (OGPC) will be constructed on a greenfield site located 60 kilometers southwest of Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital city.



Fluor described it as a “megaproject” and said that the facility will have multiple interfaces between process units, utilities and offsite facilities, as well as between the new gas processing and petrochemical facilities.
Serving as project management contractor, Fluor will oversee the construction work, supporting SOCAR’s selection and management of future contractors that will perform detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and start-up of the gas processing plant, in addition to front-end engineering design, detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and start-up of the petrochemical plants and associated offsite facilities.
“Fluor is proud to be selected by SOCAR as the project management contractor on this unique, world-scale project,” commented Taco de Haan, president of Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals business for Europe, Africa and Middle East. “Fluor has demonstrated expertise in managing downstream megaprojects that will allow us to deliver the project on schedule while meeting safety, quality and cost objectives.”
