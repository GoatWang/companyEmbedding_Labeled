Clipper Logistics plc
Clipper Logistics plc is a leader in retail logistics. The business has been at the forefront of retail and high-value logistics for more than two decades, and operates across over 40 sites in the UK and mainland Europe, with a workforce of over 3,500. Founded by Yorkshire businessman Steve Parkin in 1992, the business has gone from strength to strength. Clipper has become known for its consultative approach to retail logistics solutions, consistently innovating in response to a sector that is undergoing rapid change. Our Contract Packing division helps you to cut costs, saving you time and enhancing your productivity. Supported by a highly skilled workforce and up-to-date machinery capable of handling a wide range of requirements, Clipper has the experience and infrastructure you need for seamless contract packing. Clipper Contract Packing is a continually evolving service, with new technology investment being made regularly. With a wide range of equipment, Clipper offers a variety of industry-leading packing solutions designed to save time and money. In addition to this we offer a wide range of hand-packing services to deal with most requests, however unusual. Our current services include product over-wrapping, bundling, flow-wrapping, shrink-wrapping, labelling, sleeve-wrapping, de-branding, barcoding, tagging, ratio-packing, SRP packing, RF security tagging, QC checking etc. Our premises are both Customs & Excise bonded so we can work with your product in a duty-suspended environment, despatching back to you still at a duty-free status, saving your cash-flow. Combine this with our warehousing and transport capabilities, Clipper can offer a full end to end service for you and your product. We are members of the Bonded Warehousekeepers Association and the Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport. To find out more visit www.clippergroup.co.uk
