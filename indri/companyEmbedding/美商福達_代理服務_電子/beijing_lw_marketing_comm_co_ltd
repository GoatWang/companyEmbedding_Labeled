China Gene Synthesis Market by Manufacturers, Regions (Province), Type and Application, Forecast to 2022

Published:  03-Aug-2017        Price: US 4480 Onwards        Pages: 118 
Gene synthesis refers to chemically synthesizing a strand of DNA base-by-base. Unlike DNA replication that occurs in cells or by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), gene synthesis does not require a template strand. Rather, gene synthesis involves the step-wise addition of nucleotides to a single-stranded molecule, which then serves as a template for creation of a complementary strand. Gene synthesis is the fundamental technology upon which the field of synthetic biology has been built.
