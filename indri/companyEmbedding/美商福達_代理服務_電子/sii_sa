The follow-up to the extremely successful GALAXY S, Samsung's GALAXY S II is a powerhouse of a smartphone in a fantastically sleek and lightweight design. Considerably thinner than the original GALAXY S and rivals such as the iPhone 4 (8.49mm v 9.3mm) the GALAXY S II is stunningly light (only 117g) and packs the latest version of Android (Gingerbread). The one feature most people will notice immediately is Samsung's best ever screen; the monster 4.27-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen runs at 480 x 800 resolution, has colours visibly brighter and more vivid than other phones, better contrast and lower power consumption, and performs superbly for gaming and watching video. Plus there's an 8.1 megapixel camera with full 1080p HD video recording, video playback at 30 frames per second and a dual-core processor, with each core running at a blistering 1Ghz for an incredibly responsive experience. The GALAXY S II comes with four hubs to help you make the most of your Galaxy S II; Social, your chatting life in one place, Readers, Samsung's new ebook reader area, Game, the easiest way to download and play the best games, and Music, with access to over 12 million tracks.

Here you just get the bright, popping colors. Oh, and at 4.3", it's a pleasure to look at from any distance. The resolution is still 800x480, though. Wish they'd up it to match iPhone.- Very light. I mean, VERY light. Samsung wasn't kidding when they stressed that point. Considering the size of this thing, it's very hard to believe. When you put the phone into someone else's hand for the first time, they usually are confused because they expect it to feel more "solid", and not so featherweight.- Fairly thin. Good if you wear your phone in the pocket of your pants.- The UI is buttery smooth, with no hiccups that are common on all other Android phones I've seen. Not sure if it's Samsung's new powerful GPU (Exynos), software optimizations that they did, or a combination of both, but overall this thing is just as slick as iPhone 4.- It can be rooted, and custom ROMs already exist. No signed bootloaders or other similar malarkey.- It comes with Android 2.3. That means better perf, WiFi tethering/hotspot out of the box, and the ability to tilt and rotate the map in Google Maps - among other things.- It comes with Polaris Office. It is a very nice Android office suite - from what I've seen so far, more full-featured than Docs to Go, QuickOffice etc - especially when it comes to supporting advanced MS Office features such as charts. It cannot be purchased from the market, and only comes bundled with select devices, such as this one or Asus Transformer.- MicroSD card slot, for all those gigabytes of music.- It has CyanogenMod. They've finally got Bluetooth working, so you can use it for everything.Bad things:- Battery life doesn't seem to be so good. It gets through the day, but if you forget to charge it in the evening it won't last you a second day (except if only on standby). It seems to be purely a software issue as people with (unofficial) Android 2.3.5 report much better numbers. Likely going to be fixed when 2.3.5 officially rolls out for XEU models.- It heats up quite a bit when in active use. More so than any other phone I've used. It's not exactly a surprise considering 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and a powerful GPU, and I suspect that ultra-thin form factor makes cooling less efficient than it could have been otherwise. Overall it's tolerable, but very noticeable.- Some applications seem to be showing images in 16-bit color rather than 32-bit (particularly the browser). This leads to nasty dithering artifacts, especially on bands of clear colors and gradients. Head to XDA-developers forum for Galaxy S II for more details on this. It seems to be a software issue, so future updates may solve it.Things to be aware of:- Front is full glass, back is textured plastic. I love the back for the texture, which looks pretty nice and gives a good grip when held, but it's not as "oh, shiny" as iPhone 4. Lack of metal seems to be what makes it so light, among other things. On the other hand, I didn't notice any creaking, so assembly is high-quality.- It runs Android 2.3.4 (as of this writing). However, there is no voice/video chat in Google Talk. Google Voice can be installed (in US) and works fine. There's no clear schedule on official updates so far, but 2.3.5 has been released in some countries and is likely coming soon for XEU version.- Android is not stock, but Samsung's TouchWiz. This is much less invasive than what you typically see on HTC Android phones, and some changes are fairly nice. But many people prefer stock.Read more5150+ comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsPossible Knock OffByBoston, MAon August 26, 2013Verified PurchaseMy brother bought a SII in summer of 2012 for $450 which works great; I bought Samsung i9100 Galaxy SII in July 2013 for $265 which was a complete dissappointment.  It came in an ill-fitting non-Samsung box with a non-Samsung battery.  Though I bought it a year later, mine had an "older" operating system than my brother's which he bought a year earlier.  It would not hold a charge, it dropped calls, it didnot have same wireless Wi-Fi range as my brother's bought a year earlier.  It perfomed so poorly that my brother and I concluded Samsung had sold rights to their SII (S2) to an after-market company who is "dumping" knock-off inferior versions into market at roughly half price.  At half price, this phone is NOT worth it.  I bought it from Deal Grabber who refunded my money in full (a good thing).  I HIGHLY recommend NOT buying this and instead, invest your money in a SIII (S3) or SIV (S4).Read more0Comment|

Samsung's GALAXY S II is a powerhouse of a smartphone in a fantastically sleek and lightweight design. Considerably thinner than the original GALAXY S and rivals such as the iPhone 4 (8.49mm v 9.3mm) the GALAXY S II is stunningly light (only 117g) and packs the latest version of Android (Gingerbread). The one feature most people will notice immediately is Samsung's best ever screen; the monster 4.27-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen runs at 480 x 800 resolution, has colours visibly brighter and more vivid than other phones, better contrast and lower power consumption, and performs superbly for gaming and watching video. Plus there's an 8.1 megapixel camera with full 1080p HD video recording, video playback at 30 frames per second and a dual-core processor, with each core running at a blistering 1Ghz for an incredibly responsive experience. The GALAXY S II comes with four hubs to help you make the most of your Galaxy S II; Social, your chatting life in one place, Readers, Samsung's new ebook reader area, Game, the easiest way to download and play the best games, and Music, with access to over 12 million tracks.

The problem with this seller is that they are advertising model GT-i9100,  but they will ship you  *** GT-i9100G ***  instead.  The difference btwn these two is that GT-9100G uses a different GPU and chipset and is slightly under-powered compared to i9100.However, what this really means is that you can not ROOT your phone or install CM9 ROMs on it!!!  All of the available cutom ROM's out there, including CM7 & CM9, only support the GT-i9100 chipset, and not the G model.  So you will be stuck with whatever bloatwear Samsung puts on it.I returned mine unopend within an hour after receiving it.  I will buy a i9100 model just as soon as I find it somewhere.Read more33 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing, reallyByO. Cantoon December 5, 2011Verified PurchaseI'm not sure where to start or what should be the focus of the review. So if someone has an specific question, ask, and I'll do my best to answer it.First of all, I had an N8 Nokia phone which I loved (mainly for the camera and GPS navigation), but had enough draw backs with the OS (Symbian) that I started looking else where for my next phone.I evaluated carefully this phone for a month and decided to keep it, at the end.The phone is crazy fast (changing between screen, menus, apps, etc.), the OS (Android Gingerbread) is really smooth and friendly.The resolution is amazing.The 5.1 sound is really nice (saw a movie with this option ON, and it sounded great).Internet browsing is as fluid as with a PC.There are TOO many apps, so you'll have a lot of fun with that.One issue that a heard before was the battery life, so my test and results are these:* 3G ON, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 8 - 10 hours* 3G OFF, Wifi ON, Sync ON, Notification ON: 20-24 hours* 3G OFF, Wifi OFF, Sync OFF, Notification OFF (only turning data ON when needed): 36 - 40 hours.So in my case, it really depends on how much time 3G is ON and how my personal configuration (data sync) was set. In my opinion, this is not a problem at all.Camera is great (even compared to the N8).Video is great.GPS is good, but not great (I miss the Ovi Maps ... which, at this point, would like them to sell their software). Google Maps won't do without data (or at least won't work efficiently). Bought CoPilot and the result is average, but at least it was cheap (around 10 dollars).Tested (successfully 3G) with the following carriers:* AT&T (U.S.)* Telcel (Mexico)Of course, if I compare any of these features with the N8, the difference is enormous, but the real rival is the iPhone. So I tried my wife iPhone4 for a while, so I could get a better perspective. And I'm sorry to say (to Android fans ... or Apple fans, for that matter) that between these two, it totally depends on taste or the one that you actually own.I wouldn't trade this phone for an iPhone, and my wife wouldn't trade her iPhone for my GS2 (but we both thought that the other ones phone seemed really great), so you see, I guess what I can resume from this is that both phones are really good ... the details, well it depends on the user, I guess.Anyways, really fast, fun and time consuming.So overall, really happy with the phone.Oh yeah, before I forget, one important fact (for some, I'm guessing), although I'm a tekkie and might ROOT and put some special ROM on the phone at some point (just for kicks), the review and my final opinion is on the phone as sold, so I wouldn't go and say that these android phones are only for geeks/tekkies.Cheers.Read more77 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsAmazon sent me the I9100G, not original I9100!Byjbwamon March 1, 2012Verified PurchaseIf it matters to you about the model number...I bought this phone from Amazon itself, a couple of weeks ago.  What they sent me was the GT-I9100G (note G) model.  I reported it, but the item description has not been changed.  I don't know what the other sellers are sending out, but I think only the G model is now being made.  Samsung changed the processors, and put a lesser video chipset in the G model, but it is supposed to get better battery life, and not overheat under heavy load, because the cpu max is limited.There is a huge outcry internationally, because Samsung put the G model in the non-G box originally, without telling anybody, but the box I got had the G on the end.I spent many hours on this because of the SA-I9100 listed in the item model section, and it was not what Amazon shipped at all!Also, this phone works on ATT if you can get a signal. Does not work well in my house, even though I am in Birmingham, AL, where Bellsouth was big, and merged into ATT.  Duh!  I ordered a T-Mobile sim card, also, but only get Edge because this phone does not have the 1700 MHZ frequency that T-Mobile uses for 4G in the US.  I think ATT uses the 1900, but has made post failed merger deal for T-Mobile to deploy it at some time, whch is a rumor only. It might already be available out west in the US.You have to know or search how to set the APN to even get this phone to show the data availability.At least T-Mobile works every time slowly, but during the day, ATT is unusable at my house in the city limits.  Good luck!  If you are in US, you need a strong ATT signal to make this one work right, but when it does, it's a babe.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsgood hardware, good softwareByPierceon November 18, 2011Verified PurchaseOne of the thinnest smartphones on the market. Very nice screen, decent camera for a phone. I get over two days of usage out of a charge, which is pretty good for a smartphone, but I don't use cellular data, only wifi data and cellular voice / texts, and I also rooted it and slimmed down the software running on it.Which brings me to the second part of this review, the software: The firmware it comes with is actually rather good, and this version of TouchWiz isn't as bad as I've heard previous versions were. There are many quite customized roms available, including a stable release of cyanogenmod, but I went back to the stock firmware but rooted and with various samsung components uninstalled, and I like it quite well. I'm not fond of the default lock screen options, and it is silly that one has to root the phone to uninstall junk and customize the lock screen, but most phones are even worse in this regard.Rooting and installing mods is not very hard and doesn't depend upon security holes which samsung would periodically fix in updated firmware requiring new rooting tools: instead you restart the device and hold a combination of physical buttons to put it into "download mode" and use a tool available for windows or an open source one available for linux or mac to flash new software onto it. There's no cat-and-mouse game with Samsung. It's worked quite well for me.One final note, this is the European original GT-I9100 I'm talking about, the galaxy S2 variations available from US carriers are going to have worse prospects with rooting and rom compatibility (in addition to being thicker and generally being worse designs).Read more0Comment|

Product Stewardship

Our commitment to operational excellence extends beyond our manufacturing operations to our environmental policy. We continually seek to reduce our environmental footprint while striving to achieve a "balanced plant" - one where we completely convert all incoming raw materials to saleable products with the minimization of waste and by-product formation.



Chemical products provide many benefits to society, but they must be managed responsibly throughout their lifecycles to minimize any adverse effects. At SI Group, we work hard to ensure that our products are manufactured, stored, transported, used, disposed and recycled to safeguard the health and safety of the environment.
Consistent with our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care®, we support the development of responsible, science-based laws, regulations, standards, practices and procedures that safeguard the community, workplace and environment. SI Group welcomes appropriate review by governments to maintain and enhance public acceptance of its operations and products. We actively participate in industry associations, research, and programs to enhance environment safety policies. In addition, our product safety assessments are publicly available and cover topics such as basic hazards, risk and risk management.
Our Technical Data Sheets (TDS) describe safe handling procedures for our products while our Technical Service Group can provide reference materials for safe product storage. Our detailed health and safety information is available on the applicable SI Group Safety Data Sheets (SDS).
