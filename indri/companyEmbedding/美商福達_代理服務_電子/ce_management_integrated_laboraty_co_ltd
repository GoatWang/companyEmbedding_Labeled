歐盟CE認證申請CE認證的必要性

CE認證為各國產品在歐洲市場進行貿易提供了統一的技術規範，簡化了貿易程式。任何國家的產品要進入歐盟、歐洲自由貿易區必須進行CE認證，在產品上加貼CE標誌。因此CE認證是產品進入歐盟及歐洲貿易自由區國家市場的通行證。
CE認證表示產品已經達到了歐盟指令規定的安全要求;是企業對消費者的一種承諾，增加了消費者對產品的信任程度;
貼有CE標誌的產品將降低在歐洲市場上銷售的風險。這些風險包括：
被海關扣留和查處的風險;
被市場監督機構查處的風險;
被同行出於競爭目的的指控風險。
 
申請CE認證的好處
1.歐盟的法律、法規和協調標準不僅數量多，而且內容十分複雜，因此取得歐盟指定機構幫助是一個既省時、省力，又可減少風險的明智之舉;
　　
2.可以最大程度地獲取消費者和市場監督機構的信任; 　　
3.能有效地預防那些不負責任的指控情況的出現;

CNAS Introduction




China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (hereinafter referred to as CNAS) is the national accreditation body of China unitarily responsible for the accreditation of certification bodies, laboratories  and  inspection  bodies, which is established under the approval of the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People’s Republic of China and authorized by CNCA in accordance with the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Certification and Accreditation.  
History
CNAS was founded on March 31, 2006 by merging the former China National Accreditation Board for Certifiers (CNAB) and China National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (CNAL).
CNAB was the national accreditation body responsible for the accreditation of management system certification bodies and product certification bodies, which was founded in July 2002 by the authorization of CNCA according to relevant laws and regulations. CNAB had merged the former China National Accreditation Council for Registrars (CNACR), China National Accreditation Council for Products (CNACP), China National Accreditation Board for Import & Export Enterprises (CNAB) and former China Accreditation Committee for Environmental Management System Certification Bodies (CACEB). In April 2004, the accreditation functions related to occupational health and safety management system certification bodies and organic product certification bodies of former China National Accreditation Board for OSHMS Certification Bodies (CNASC) and organic food accreditation committee were transferred to CNAB according to the co-decisions of CNCA and relevant competent authorities, which had further advanced the intensive fusion of unified accreditation systems for certification bodies.
CNAL was the national accreditation body responsible for the accreditation of laboratories and inspection bodies and related activities, which was established by the approval of CNCA and authorized by CNCA. CNAL was established on July 2002 by merging the former China National Accreditation Committee for Laboratories (CNACL) established by the former State Bureau of Technical Supervision, and the former China Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Laboratory Accreditation Committee (CCIBLAC) established by the former Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau.
International   Mutual   Recognition
CNAS has been a part of international accreditation multilateral recognition system, and is playing an important role in it. The former CNAB was the accreditation body member of IAF and PAC, and also signed by IAF MLA and PAC MLA. The former CNAL was the accreditation body member of ILAC and APLAC and signed by ILAC MRA and APLAC MRA. To this day, 59 accreditation bodies have signed IAF MLA. Meanwhile, 85 laboratory accreditation bodies from other economies have signed ILAC MRA. CNAS has completely replaced the former CNAB and the CNAL in IAF, ILAC, APLAC.
