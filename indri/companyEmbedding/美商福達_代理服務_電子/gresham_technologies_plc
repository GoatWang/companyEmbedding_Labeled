  AGM statement 

  Gresham Technologies plc (LSE: "GHT", or "Company" or "Group"), the leading software and services company that specialises in providing real-time transaction control and enterprise data integrity solutions, will be holding its Annual General Meeting at 11.00 a.m. today. 

  At the meeting, the Chairman will make the following statement: 

  "The Group has made a strong start to the new financial year signing five new CTC customers in Europe and the United States, and consulting utilisation has been high across all regions. All new customers signed during 2016 are using CTC in production, including the first US Tier 1 bank win announced in December 2016. In addition, one existing customer in the asset management industry has upgraded its CTC on-premise subscription to our fully managed Clareti-as-a-Service cloud platform. 

  Investment in product development and innovation has progressed in line with plans: Clareti Loan Control 1.0 is in production use with the first customer; Clareti Analytics is now available as an upgrade to the CTC user base; and the acquired C24 technology has been fully integrated into the Clareti platform. 

  The Board is pleased with the C24 contribution since completion with recurring revenues performing as expected. In addition, there have been four new C24 customer wins year to date, including one cross-sale into a global bank customer in Asia Pacific."

Gresham Technologies Wins Clareti Contract With Canadian Bank
				[ 03 Jul 2017 10:05 ]

LONDON (Alliance News) - Gresham Technologies PLC said Monday it has won a "significant" contract for its Clareti Transaction Control product with an unnamed Canadian banking group.Gresham said the contract is worth GBP1.4 million over its initial five-year term, with the software providing ongoing data integrity assurance for regulatory reporting. Additional licence and services revenue is expected as the customer makes further use of the technology. "This is the third new CTC customer win in North America this year, and follows on from our first US Tier 1 bank win in late 2016," said Chief Executive Ian Manocha. "The pace of change in the US & Canadian financial markets is accelerating and participants are finding themselves constrained by their data processing infrastructure. This leaves them with a myriad of potential control gaps, and an inability to keep up with complex regulatory reporting demands. We continue to invest in the North American market to capitalise on this opportunity," added Manocha. Shares in Gresham Technologies were up 0.6% at 161.50 pence Monday.
