New electronic catalog content management company "REALIZE CORPORATION" established  - "REALIZE CORPORATION" launched out of TOP PAGE, an NTT DATA CORPORATION internal business venture - 
NTT DATA CORPORATION

				 DAI NIPPON PRINTING CO., LTD.

				 NTT COMWARE CORPORATION

				 i2 TECHNOLOGIES JAPAN, INC.

				 SAP JAPAN

				 CSK CORPORATION


				 On October 19th, NTT DATA CORPORATION (President: Toshiharu Aoki), DAI NIPPON PRINTING CO., LTD. (President: Yoshitoshi Kitajima), NTT COMWARE CORPORATION (President: Yuji Matsuo), i2 TECHNOLOGIES JAPAN, INC. (President: Shigeru Nakane), SAP JAPAN (President: Kiyotaka Fujii), and CSK CORPORATION (President: Masahiro Aozono) will jointly establish a new company, the "REALIZE CORPORATION", to conduct management, operation, collection, and dissemination of electronic catalog contents for B-to-B electronic commerce.

				 TOP PAGE, an NTT DATA internal business venture, that provides electronic catalog information services, will serve as the nucleus of the new company. With its electronic catalog database serving as the core, the new venture company will provide electronic catalog contents that can be utilized on a variety of B-to-B platforms.

				 * The order in which the companies are listed is based on the percentage of investment or in alphabetical order where the percentages are the same. 







[Background of the New Company Establishment]

				 As companies are restructuring their operations through the utilization of information technologies (IT), they are increasingly providing product information in electronic forms, instead of in the traditional paper-based media of catalogs or written estimates. The electronic information relates to all business processes from the time that a product is marketed to its utilization by the corporate customer. Product suppliers incur a tremendous amount of work in the management and updating of information on tens of thousands of products in their electronic catalogs.

				 By the same token, buyers face great complexity in their search for and identification of products, and in making comparisons among suppliers. Major issues for purchasing departments are increased catalog content maintenance requirements and rising management costs, which are attributable to such problems as inconsistencies among formats or the use of differing product codes at various stages of the distribution chain.

				 To dramatically improve on this situation, easy-to-use electronic catalog contents are in demand by all of those involved in B-to-B electronic transactions.


				 NTT DATA's TOP PAGE (http://www.toppage.ne.jp) is one of Japan's largest providers of electronic catalog information services in the field of IT products, off-the-shelf software, and office MRO. To date, it has amassed electronic contents consisting of 300,000 products from over 1,300 manufacturers. Its services are being used by key members of the NTT Group, major product distribution companies, portal sites, and electronic commerce sites.

				 One company using TOP PAGE services estimates that approximately 20% to 40% cost savings have been achieved by reducing the amount of operations required for catalog content maintenance and management in their purchasing division.


				 The new company has been formed jointly by six corporations: NTT DATA, which has a strong track record in the provision of electronic catalog information services, as well as DNP, NTT COMWARE, i2 TECHNOLOGIES JAPAN, SAP JAPAN, and CSK, which possess know-how in the building of corporate purchasing platforms. It is thus in an excellent position to develop a business on a model of providing "content infrastructure for electronic commerce" based on the acquisition, development, management, and dissemination of electronic catalog content.

NTT DATA’s history goes back to 1967, when the DATA Communications Bureau was established within the Japan Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (now NTT). Its mainframe ultra-large-scale computer DIPS-11 Model 45 was developed in 1981. Japan Telegraph and Telephone Corporation was incorporated as a private company in 1985. In 1988 NTT DATA Communications Systems Corporation was spun off into a separate company from NTT. Authorized as a Systems Integrator in 1990, in 1992 the company had its headquarters relocated to Toyosu, Koto-ku, Tokyo. The company received the Deming Application Prize for 1993, and was listed on the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1995. In 1996, the company changed its English name to NTT DATA Corporation, and it was also listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company obtained ISO 9001 certification in 1998, and ISO 14001 certification in 1999.[citation needed]

NTT DATA Corporation to Begin Providing “RDP Solutions,” the Second Product of the “airpalette™” Brand of Air Traffic Control Products | airpalette



















































NTT DATA Corporation to Begin Providing “RDP Solutions,” the Second Product of the “airpalette™” Brand of Air Traffic Control Products
27 April 2015

NTT DATA Corporation (Head Office: Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan; President and Chief Executive Officer: Toshio Iwamoto; hereinafter referred to as “NTT DATA”) will begin providing “RDP (Radar Data Processing system) Solutions” as the second product of the “airpalette” brand on May 11.
RDP Solutions is a system that compares information obtained via radar, such as the locations and altitudes of aircraft, with flight plan information; generates information that is necessary for air traffic controllers to carry out control tasks; and displays this information on the screens of control consoles. For this service, NTT DATA will use its track record and knowhow, gained through its involvement with RDP system construction over many years at Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau, to provide the predicted future growth areas of Asia, the Middle and Near East, Africa, and Central and South America with highly reliable systems that are adapted to local needs and easy to introduce.


Background


Currently, according to the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), it is predicted that the volume of air traffic transportation in areas around the world will continually increase until 2025. In particular, large increases are predicted in the Asia-Pacific region and Middle East region, with an average annual increase of 5.8%; the Africa region, with an average annual increase of 5.1%; and Central and South America, with an average annual increase of 4.8%. Safer and more efficient aircraft operations are required for the countries in these regions, and aspects including the outfitting of air traffic control systems have become one of the challenges.
NTT DATA is making efforts toward overseas business in the air traffic control field. For instance, the company is contributing to the realization of safe, efficient aircraft operations around the world through the provision of the flight procedure design system “PANADES®”*1 in the air traffic control field since 2010. In January, 2015, in conjunction with the establishment of “airpalette”*2, a brand that consolidates NTT DATA’s product lineup in the air traffic control field, NTT DATA began providing eTOD (electric Terrain & Obstacle Data) Solutions, the world’s only terrain/obstacle data provision service, which uses the world’s highest resolution level, as the brand’s first product. In addition, within Japan, NTT DATA has been involved with RDP system construction at Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau over many years, and has contributed to the expansion of processing capacity accompanying increases in air traffic volume.
Accordingly, making use of its knowhow cultivated within Japan, NTT DATA has decided to provide the predicted future growth areas of Asia, the Middle and Near East, Africa, and Central and South America with reasonably priced, highly reliable systems that are adapted to local needs.


Overview and Advantages of RDP Solutions


“RDP Solutions,” which will be the second product of the “airpalette” brand, is a system that supports safe aviation in overcrowded airspaces. It compares information obtained via radar, such as the locations and altitudes of aircraft, with flight plan information; generates information that is necessary for air traffic controllers to conduct control; and displays this information on the screens of control consoles. In terms of its functionality, this system possesses functions necessary for control (the indication of location information from radar, input functions for controllers, warning functions), and in addition, tailored to the needs of the target countries in Asia, the Middle and Near East, Africa, and Central and South America, places emphasis on ease of introduction while also securing high reliability.


Screen Image of RDP


This screen is a screen image of a controller console in which aircraft information is displayed on a map that indicates flight paths and airspace information. The points and three lines of text information indicate aircraft that are currently in flight. The color green indicates aircraft progressing in the western direction, and the color yellow indicates aircraft progressing in the eastern direction.

Regarding the Future


In the future, while aiming to provide RDP Solutions to Asia, the Middle and Near East, Africa, and Central and South America, NTT DATA plans to sequentially expand the product lineup of the airpalette brand.

WHAT'S intra-mart
The intra-mart framework is an application framework which is targeted at web system integration. The intra-mart framework delivers low-cost system integration over short timeframes. The intra-mart framework also increases the effectiveness of IT investment by promoting standardization and improving quality. Because the intra-mart framework uses OSS (open source software), it is not dependent on any particular vendor. The intra-mart framework makes it possible to realize highly maintainable systems that can flexibly handle changing business needs. Companies need to succeed against fierce competition. This requires a corporate strategy of effectively utilizing this new information foundation (= frameworks) as a shared company-wide platform.
