Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 08/03/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Form Holdings: Fli Charge On Track To Break Records After Successful Product Launch - FORM Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:FH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Form Holdings: Fli Charge On Track To Break Records After Successful Product LaunchJun.16.16 | About: FORM Holdings (FH) Justin Giles Tech, Growth, portfolio strategy, momentumStocktwitsSummaryFLI Charge launches on Indiegogo.The company raised more than 70% of its goal ($100k) in just the first 12 hours.What this means for the investors going forward.It's finally here! After months of speculation, FLI Charge, a subsidiary of Form Holdings (NASDAQ:FH), unveiled its new wireless charging products to the world. In less than 12 hours, the company raised over $71K, which was funded by 550 backers with the average order coming out to be $129. The image below is a screenshot of the campaign Wednesday night. Here is a direct link to the launch and how you can back the campaign. 

 To put this into perspective, FLI Charge raised 71% of its initial Indiegogo goal of $100K. At the current rate, the company is on track to raise more than $2 million or 2,000% of its original goal. Now stop and think about that for a moment. If demand gets up to that point (which I believe it can), I can't wait to see the impact it will have once users start enjoying the power of wireless charging technology and telling their friends and family about it. I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical at first, but that quickly changed once I started using it. The advantages clearly outweigh any disadvantages (I still haven't found any disadvantages) and have been extremely pleased with how fast it charges. Since I've been using the charging pads, my phone is never on its death bed anymore and is easy and efficient to use as I'll explain in my articles next week. I'll personally never go back to charging my phone with cables and this is why I wasn't surprised to see the positive reaction from the market as I tweeted out leading up to Wednesday's launch. 


 *Twitter Link Conclusion With FLI Charge getting off to a fast start on Indiegogo, shares also started taking off Wednesday as you can see in the image below. Shares of FH climbed as high as $2.40 (a three month high) before settling at $2.18 for a gain of 9.55%. Volume was 1.4 million compared to a three-month average of 158K, and a 10-day average of 237K. 

 If shares can climb and hold over the $2.30 level, expect to see a nice run which will should test the $2.70-$2.80 levels. The great thing about FLI Charge is that it will give the company another growing revenue stream as it continues to grow and monetize its patents and intellectual portfolios. The company reached a settlement agreement with another infringer for $8.9M last month and looks well on its way to getting other patent infringers to come to the table. The company has already reached agreements with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY), among many others. Management has also been using FLI Charge for a long time now and knew there would demand after testing it out. That demand is certainly out there and today proved it. FLI Charge even started trending in Indiegogo and has gained a lot of positive feedback from backers as you can see in the image below. 

 So with over $2.00 in cash per share, FH is still highly undervalued. And as the funding increases over the next month, don't be surprised to see FH's share price continue trending upwards as the market has no choice but to factor that value into the company.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
