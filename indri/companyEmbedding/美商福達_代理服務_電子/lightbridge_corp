Lightbridge Fuel Technology






Lightbridge is developing new fuel that works in existing and new reactors: improving their economics through power uprates, longer fuel cycles, and carbon credits while adding additional non-emitting baseload electricity with dramatically improved reactor safety.
Lightbridge is focusing its development efforts primarily on demonstrating its metallic fuel rod technology and a fuel assembly design for power uprates in existing pressurized water reactors.
There are significant technology synergies among Lightbridge's primary fuel products due to utilization of the proprietary metallic fuel rod technology that is at the core of each of them. As a result, full-scale demonstration and qualification of the metallic fuel rod technology will simultaneously advance all of the fuel product families currently under development by Lightbridge.

NASDAQ Approves Continued Listing
Closes Previously Announced $2.8 Million Preferred Stock Financing Appoints Xingping Hou as Co-Chairman Meets Alongside Representatives from AREVA and Nuclear Utilities with U. S. Department of Energy Officials  Jonathan Baggett Takes On Additional Role as Deputy Quality Assurance Manager RESTON, Va., Aug.  03, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lightbridge Corporation (NASDAQ:LTBR), a U.S. nuclear fuel technology company, today provided a general business update and announced that it has received formal notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") notifying Lightbridge that it has approved the Company’s continued listing on the NASDAQ following the one-for-five reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock completed on July 20, 2016, and closing of the previously announced $2.8 million convertible preferred financing with General International Holdings Inc. (GIH), an entity controlled by Mr. Xingping Hou.  In connection with the $2.8 million financing, the Company has appointed Mr. Hou as co-Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors. Ambassador Thomas Graham, Jr. will remain Executive Chairman of the Board. Seth Grae, President & Chief Executive Officer of Lightbridge Corporation, commented, “We are pleased that Lightbridge stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ. We are also happy to have closed the previously announced $2.8 million financing with GIH at a significant premium to the market price at the time of the agreement. This investment, combined with a $1 million investment and additional funding commitment of $4 million from Aspire Capital announced in June, strengthens our balance sheet while allowing us to continue executing on our business plan.  We believe the terms of the $2.8 million financing were favorable for shareholders and we appreciate the support Mr. Hou has shown following his due diligence. We are pleased to welcome him to Lightbridge’s board of directors and look forward to leveraging his relationships throughout Asia.” “On July 12, 2016, Lightbridge, along with representatives from AREVA and nuclear utilities, met with officials from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE).  The meeting focused on the status of the Lightbridge all-metal nuclear fuel development program and potential opportunities associated with the DOE loan guarantee program that may be helpful to the project. The parties also discussed the potential value of certain DOE assets, such as the Transient Reactor Test Facility and other test facilities, as well as analytical support that can be provided by U.S. national laboratories. Specifically, the national laboratories could analyze changes in the nuclear industry infrastructure in support of obtaining the requisite U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for deploying the all-metal fuel. Additional follow-up meetings are expected to discuss specific steps for collaboration with the DOE and its national laboratories in areas of mutual interest.” “We are also pleased to announce that Lightbridge Vice President Jonathan Baggett has returned to our U.S. corporate offices after two years based in Seoul, South Korea advising the company’s customers and partners. Given his exemplary performance and valuable skill set, Jonathan has been awarded the additional role of Deputy Quality Assurance Manager. In that capacity, he will work closely with Rene’ Delaney, Quality Assurance Manager of Lightbridge, overseeing quality assurance aspects of our nuclear fuel program to ensure compliance with NQA-1 and 10 CFR 50, Appendix B requirements. In preparation for irradiation testing of our nuclear fuel samples at the Halden research reactor, he will participate in a quality assurance visit by the Lightbridge team to Norway in the fall of 2016.” About Lightbridge CorporationLightbridge is a nuclear fuel development company based in Reston, Virginia, USA.

 NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Lightbridge (LTBR) were spiking 79.1% to $2.49 on heavy trading volume Monday after the company announced that four U.S. electric utility companies asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review its patented metallic fuel design. The electric utilities cited the fuel product's opportunity to "significantly improve safety and fuel cycle economics" of nuclear power plants in the requests, according to Lightbridge. The company expects to submit an application to the NRC in 2017 for use of Lightbridge fuel lead test assemblies in an "operating U.S. pressurized water reactor as early as 2020." "Lightbridge is developing the first truly next generation commercial fuel design that can provide significant fuel performance and economic benefits to nuclear utilities," President and CEO Seth Grae said. "This expression of interest by major U.S. utilities is the strongest endorsement to date of Lightbridge fuel by potential customers." About 3 million shares of Lightbridge were traded by about 9:50 a.m. Monday, well above the company's average trading volume of about 47,000 shares a day. TheStreet Ratings team rates LIGHTBRIDGE CORP as a Sell with a ratings score of D-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: "We rate LIGHTBRIDGE CORP (LTBR) a SELL. This is driven by some concerns, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its weak operating cash flow and generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself."

(Operator Instructions)At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to David Waldman, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Julie, and good morning, and welcome to Lightbridge's First Quarter 2017 Business Update Conference Call. The company's first quarter business update press release was distributed after the market closed yesterday and can be viewed on the Investor Relations page of the Lightbridge website at www.ltbridge.com. If anyone has questions after the call, you may contact Crescendo Communications, the Investor Relations firm for the company, at (855) 379-9900. Seth Grae, our Chief Executive Officer, will lead today's call. In addition, the following executives are available to answer your questions. Linda Zwobota, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Malone, Chief Nuclear Fuel Development Officer; Andrey Mushakov, Lightbridge's Executive Vice President for International Nuclear Operations; Jon Johnson, Senior Vice President and Nuclear Regulatory Expert; and Jonathan Baguette, Vice President and Deputy Nuclear Quality Assurance Manager.Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's competitive position and product and service offerings. During the course of today's call, words such as expect, anticipate, believe and intend will be used in our discussion of goals or events in the future. This presentation is based on our current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from such estimates. These and other risks are set forth in more detail in Lightbridge's filings with the Securities and Change Commission. Lightbridge does not assume any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. You can participate in today's call in 2 ways: First, you may submit questions for management in writing to ir@ltbridge.com. If you've already submitted a question, we thank you. You can submit them at any time during the prepared remarks or during the Q&A period. Second, after the prepared remarks, telephone lines will be opened for live questions.Now, here is Lightbridge's CEO, Seth Grae. Please go ahead, sir.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. This quarter, we continued to make progress toward commercial development of our proprietary next-generation nuclear fuel. It's only been a bit over a month since our last conference call. We'll keep the opening remarks brief to get your questions. We appreciate the continued support from AREVA in moving the process forward toward establishment of a formal joint venture between our 2 companies. AREVA is an ideal partner, with extensive industry knowledge and expertise in nuclear fuel assembly design, licensing and fabrication. AREVA also brings an established global customer base, including many of the leading nuclear operators in the United States, Europe and Asia.Read MoreThe term sheet signed with AREVA covers fuel assemblies for most types of light water reactors, including pressurized water reactors, boiling water reactors, small modular reactors and research reactors. We expect to formalize the joint venture with AREVA to develop, manufacture and commercialize fuel assemblies based on our fuel technology in the coming months. Although it may seem from the outside that this process is moving slowly, we have actually made tremendous progress and have expanded beyond the initial scope of the project. In fact, we believe the current scenario will be more profitable for Lightbridge than the straight licensing arrangement we had originally envisioned.We're also moving forward in finalizing plans for irradiation testing of our nuclear fuel samples at the Halden reactor in Norway. At the same time, we are working closely with a leading U.S. nuclear utility to establish an end user agreement for the first use of Lightbridge-designed nuclear fuel in a commercial reactor in the United States. This utility is an addition to the one with which we signed a letter of intent in November of last year. To date, we have received numerous patents covering our metallic nuclear fuel rod design, and we have very broad intellectual property protection in all key markets, including the United States, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, European Union member countries and elsewhere around the world. Securing our intellectual property rights is an important step in advancing our global strategy.Our nuclear technology has gained significant attention within the industry. We presented the Lightbridge fuel at a number of important industry events, including our recent presentation at Idaho National Laboratory's GAIN Fuel Safety Research Workshop.I'll now turn the call over to Linda Zwobota, who is Lightbridge's Chief Financial Officer, to summarize the company's financial results for the quarter. Linda?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Linda Joan Zwobota, Lightbridge Corporation - CFO and Treasurer [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Seth. As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $5.3 million in cash and restricted cash compared to approximately $3.7 million in cash and restricted cash as of December 31, 2016. The $1.6 million increase in cash and equivalents resulted from the sale of approximately $2.8 million of our common stock during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, offset by net cash used in operating activities of approximately $1.2 million.We had approximately $4.9 million in working capital as of March 31, 2017, as compared to working capital of approximately $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2017, was approximately $7 million compared to stockholders' equity of approximately $5.6 million as of December 31, 2016. We have no debt or debt credit lines, and we have financed our operations to date through the sale of our common stock and our consulting revenue.For the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, our net loss attributable to common shareholders was approximately $1.8 million or a loss of $0.20 per share on revenue of $0.1 million. In the same quarter of 2016, the net loss available to common shareholders was $0.2 million or loss per share of $0.09 per share on revenue of $0.2 million.The net loss available to common shareholders for the 3 months ended March 31, 2016, of $0.3 million, included warrant revaluation income of approximately $1.3 million, which is a noncash item. All warrants are now classified as equity on our balance sheet. All revenue was generated from consulting services. Our main business is developing our nuclear fuel, and we may continue to provide some consulting services in the future but we have shifted the focus and resources of the company to the fuel division and away from consulting.Stock-based compensation expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $0.2 million. This concludes my summary. I will be available for your questions during the next segment of today's presentation. Seth, back to you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Linda. Let's open the call to your questions. In addition to asking live questions by telephone, you can also submit questions in writing to ir@ltbridge.com. We will pause while the operator, Jen, reviews the procedure for asking live questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------While we're polling for questions, let me start with some questions that were submitted in advance or during the call. Our first question is Lightbridge concerned with the timeline of negotiations with AREVA. And can you explain why the deal is taking as long as it has to finalize?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, what I think, first of all, is that the deal has been changing in some ways from the initial concept that we think are better for Lightbridge and Lightbridge's investors than a straight licensing deal; to have a 50-50 JV with AREVA. What we're trying to do is more expansive. We'll also fold again now direct work with 2 utilities, leading toward end user agreements. We're not just trying to have qualifying fuel in a reactor in Norway. We're actually bringing toward contracting fuel in commercial reactors in the United States. What we're putting together is a contractual package to bring our fuel to the global market. Now there is a lot of steps within that. And we and AREVA and utilities need to be confident in the NRC licensing and the data that will be generated. Jonathan Baguette is here with us and on this call, who is the Deputy Quality Assurance Manager, who also makes sure that all of the data generated everywhere will be usable for licensing. We're dealing with the largest nuclear supplier company in the world with AREVA. We have a tremendous commitment from their company in level of what they're doing with us, both here at the United States and at headquarters in France, in Paris, as well as their fuel division headquarters in Lyon, France. And with that, I'll just ask Jim Malone, who has been leading the work with AREVA, to comment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James P. Malone, Lightbridge Corporation - Chief Nuclear Fuel Development Officer [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth, I agree that the mission, if you will, has changed substantially in our favor because of the approach of using a joint venture company to approach the market versus simply licensing the product to AREVA as a fuel fabricator. We now have them as a partner, and their skills and our intellectual property match very well together. If it is indicated to take a little bit more time than we would like. That is because of the change in the relationship, which is going to benefit the shareholders in the long run.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. Can I also -- while we talk about our announcements coming within month, I think, it's probably fair to say we expect the next major announcement to come within about 1 month. So I mean this is not something that I think you'll have to wait all that much longer for some major developments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. Thank you. Our next question and then we'll open it up for some live calls -- the latest proxy includes request to authorize the sale of shares in excess of 20%. What was the rationale for this authorization and is the company planning to raise capital?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, no, no immediate plans. First of all, we are required to obtain shareholder approval prior to any issuance of our common stock equal to 20% or above 20% of the shares outstanding. However, this does not mean that we actually will raise any capital. We're interested in financing flexibility. In fact, we have no immediate plans to raise capital. The rationale for this request, in trying to maximize financial flexibility, is that we want to do this in advance of what we believe will be the most major milestones in the history of this company and potential very significant strategic transactions with major entities in our industry this year. And we want to utilize this authorization if and only if following one or more significant events, we believe that there are terms that we could use to bring value to the investors in the company. And we want to have the ability to pounce and not wait months for an authorization after that point. So that's why we're doing it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. We'll now take a moment and open up the lines. Operator?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Our first live question comes from James Anderson, a private investor.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Participant, [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On the Lightbridge website, you document preliminary agreements with various parties since inception, anticipating fabrication and commercializing your fuel. Forward-looking statements over the years have fore-tolled of fabrication, demonstration and commercialization planned to occurred by dates that have already passed. The proposed JV with AREVA is a promising one, but investors have already waited a long time for similar agreements to move beyond letters of interest, memorandums of understanding and term sheets in the coming months into something binding and rewarding. These vague and often repeated phrases make us wonder if the finish line is perpetually out of reach. Therefore, can you provide more specific dates regarding Norway, AREVA and the U.S. Utility? And one other related question is, there's also some legislation H.R. 590 and other things coming through the pipeline, do you anticipate those would help you accelerate your timelines?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for the question, James. First of all, I'll say that one of the things we've dealt with is a remarkably changing nuclear power industry. And there are a lot of companies in this industry that aren't here anymore or there are about not to be here anymore. Or if they survive, including some of the biggest ones in the industry in this country and some other places will be in very reduced and different forms. And I think 2 of the biggest causes of changes in the industry that I've talked about on previous calls are the collapse of natural gas prices, which has just put tremendous pressure on nuclear power, making the economics of reactors just crucial to the existence of individual reactors, to utilities and to the industry in some countries. And the second is Fukushima. Making safety and the focus on safety, the issue. And what a lot of other companies that are no longer here focused on were other points -- other than economics of the existing fleet and safety. And we had technology that focused in other areas on reducing amounts of waste, on long-term toxicity of waste. We still bring those benefits, but we changed. And we invented a metallic fuel that provides what the industry now and as we see it going forward will need. And we did fabrication, testing in the past that leads to what we have today. We did fabrication in Russia. We did testing. We finished that sort of just in time before political relations fell apart to the point where we probably couldn't do that today. And it all helped get us to where we are today. So had we sort of felt we were in a straitjacket to meet a thorium-based fuel time frame or other things we were looking at. We might have congratulated ourselves on meeting a time frame for a product the industry doesn't want to use. And instead, we, in-house, were able to invent this technology, working very closely with utilities, telling us exactly what they need for the future. And those utilities are Duke, Exelon, Dominion and Southern Company. And with the pull of interest of those utilities in this product, we attracted multiple fuel fabricators, and we chose AREVA as one we wanted to go with first, and fortunately, have been able to bring that very much along. And even within this process, there have been delays. We thought by the end of last year, we would have the joint venture with AREVA. And here we are in May of this year and haven't finalized yet. But as we said before, the work has actually been ongoing. There is a lot happening under the agreements we've already signed. And we are very close to making some major announcements that relate directly to this fuel to bring unique economic and safety advantages to this industry that we think nobody else can or will be able to do. As for H.R. 590 and other legislation here in the Washington, D.C. area, we're very close to keeping tabs on these issues, including through the Nuclear Energy Institute, of which Lightbridge is a member and is a very active one. Nuclear Energy institute is very actively involved. We follow what they do, we sometimes attend meetings on Capitol Hill. What I would say is that I don't think H.R. 590 would accelerate our time frames. What I will say is that, I think, it makes -- and other legislation being proposed -- I think it makes it more interesting for AREVA and for the utilities on funding that they might be able to ascertain for their work in the project going forward from the government and, perhaps, we with our joint venture with AREVA could obtain. I'll also say that we're very confident in our time frame now more than ever because of buy-in from AREVA, from utilities that we're working on. And not just in the near term dates, but the long-term dates of actually bringing the fuel to market and everything needed to bring commercial fuel to the market. So I know that's a little bit of a meandering response, but I think we're in the best place we've ever been right now and are very close to some major announcements.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Our next -- we're going to read another question that was submitted in advance. Will the fuel be tested for a worst-case scenario in the near term? Do you need to complete this testing prior to a commercial contract? And would this testing prove the ability of the fuel design to preclude an explosion scenario in such an event?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I mean, what I say, first of all, is, particularly, since Fukushima Regulatory Agencies like the NRC here in the U.S. and others around the world have been looking at what they call beyond-design-basis testing or severe accident testing -- the kind you referenced in the question. And we are planning to do this type of testing and analysis. And I'll ask Jim, then Jon to comment. Jim, again, is leading this particular work. And Jon, who ran these areas in many respects for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before he was with Lightbridge. But Jim, why don't you start?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James P. Malone, Lightbridge Corporation - Chief Nuclear Fuel Development Officer [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------With respect to the fuel at -- being tested in severe conditions or what I prefer to call the torture test for the fuel, we will be testing the fuel for its ability to withstand severe accidents. There is a facility in Idaho, at the Idaho National Laboratory, that I was at earlier just last week called a TREAT facility and that's for transient examination of fuel. And it actually takes fuel and the reactor system at TREAT is capable of basically melting the fuel no matter what kind it is and determining what happens. And the real key is how long it takes for fuel to get into trouble -- to lose what we call coolable geometry. And we believe our fuel is among the best, and there is some industry concurrence to that fact building at the moment, due to the fact that some of the competing fuels have not shown their ability to extend coolable geometry for a very long period of time. So the torture test that I mentioned is also tied back to the reference to the fuel explosion at Fukushima. I need to clarify that for you. The event at Fukushima was a zirconium-steam reaction where the cladding on that fuel reacted with the steam to release hydrogen -- the H2O in the steam -- the hydrogen was released and the hydrogen is what was detonated by a spark in the system. So it's a -- we don't want to say it's a fuel explosion, it's rather a hydrogen event -- rapid burn of hydrogen resulting in the explosions that were related to Fukushima, not the fuel. But we will be testing for that also.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And Jon was the Deputy Director of Reactor Regulation at the NRC. Every nuclear regulator in the country reported to John. So Jon?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jon Johnson, Lightbridge Corporation - SVP of Nuclear Regulatory Expert [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. One of the processes the NRC will use for using test -- tests of the new fuel is really a phased testing. There is a provision in the -- each utility's tech specs for allowing lead test assemblies to be inserted in nonlimiting locations in the core. And so our test program will be a comprehensive test program that will go over a number of years. But the initial parameters of this fuel are fairly well known. We're using uranium and zirconium, and these materials are well known to the NRC as well as the industry and AREVA. Certainly, our composition is a little different, but we are sure that the reactivity, addition accidents, the loss of coolant accidents -- we have some information that gives us confidence that the NRC will approve the insertion of individual rods or lead test assemblies. And then while we're doing the testing in Halden, we will also be getting some information from the testing in the operating reactor. And the combination of all these tests will give confidence that the fuel design will meet all the NRC requirements.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Jon. Thanks, Jim.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. A related question. If the fuel runs much cooler, will that result in lower fuel burn up and thus more resulted waste product?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jim?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James P. Malone, Lightbridge Corporation - Chief Nuclear Fuel Development Officer [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The short answer is no to that question. The fuel does run cooler. It runs cooler because it's got so much more heat transfer area. So the, if you will, the heat flux, excuse the technical term, but it looks very similar to the existing fuel and -- but it's reduced per unit of area. So we have an advantage there that allows the fuel to run cooler, while still delivering the same amount of energy or greater coolant in the reactor, which is the source of the steam. So it's a pretty straightforward process. I don't think there is anything more to say about it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. Thank you. Our next question. There are other competing advanced fuels such as the DOE's accident tolerant fuels research and development project conducted by the Advanced Fuels Campaign that seeks to develop nuclear fuels that can resist the generation of hydrogen and fuel melting that characterized the Fukushima accident. Why is Lightbridge not participating in this program? Did Lightbridge attempt to participate and is Lightbridge monitoring the technologies proposed by this program? What advantages do Lightbridge's fuel have relative to these fuel concepts?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I'll first say that we're working increasingly closely with the Department of Energy. And we've been at DOE headquarters recently. Jim was just last week at Idaho National Laboratories at the GAIN Conference, dealing specifically with these issues. I will say that, again, that we believe that our fuel is the most superior technology for bringing new safety benefits to reactors and probably the only one that could bring these types of benefits. And certainly, the only one that could bring these types of benefits not only without an economic penalty, but, in fact, with a significant economic advantage to the utilities. Jim, do you want describe last week at Idaho?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James P. Malone, Lightbridge Corporation - Chief Nuclear Fuel Development Officer [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, last week at Idaho, the GAIN project, that DOE sponsored: A fuel safety workshop, and Lightbridge was invited to participate in that workshop along with the existing advanced technology or accident tolerant fuels. Over the last several months, we've seen a change in the approach. First, addressing the question as to whether or not we participate in the accident tolerant fuels program, the answer is no, we do not. We considered it early on, and we're not looked upon favorably by the advisers to DOE at the utilities because there's zirconium in the fuel, and they are overreacting to the fact that we have zirconium and zirconium was part of the problem at Fukushima. However, the community recently has invited Lightbridge to participate along with the Nuclear Energy Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute in all of the events and meetings related to accident-tolerant fuel. I spoke at the meeting in Idaho and referred to the Lightbridge fuel as what was an ugly duckling is now suddenly turning into a swan in the eyes of the community. We are included now in all of the meetings and have actually been asked by (inaudible) and NEI jointly what can they do to help us move the fuel forward? So I think that's significant and it's a big change from where we were.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. Thank you. At this point, I'll turn the call back. Operator, if you can re-prompt again the instructions, then we'll return to any remaining questions submitted electronically.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So in the meantime, our next question is can our fuel rods be used in the China National Nuclear Corporation's third-generation ACP100 reactor? This is their first small reactor to be built for commercial purposes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Our fuel could be used in all water-cooled reactors, which includes all light water reactors, which includes all pressurized water reactors. The ACP100 is a pressurized water reactor design, a small PWR. So our fuel could be used in that reactor.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Waldman, [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. Thank you. That concludes our questions. I will turn the call back over to you, Seth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seth Grae, Lightbridge Corporation - CEO, President and Executive Director [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, David. I just want to mention one last point. At Lightbridge, we've been very privileged to be involved with the United Arab Emirates Nuclear Power Program. And a couple of days ago, construction was completed on the first of the 4 reactors being built there. Barakah 1 construction was completed. And we think that's a very significant milestone for the UAE, and we congratulate our friends and colleagues in the UAE. And I want to thank everybody for joining the call. I'd like to thank all our investors. We look forward to providing future updates. We expect you'll be hearing from us in the coming weeks. And in the meantime, our lines are always open at ir@ltbridge.com and a telephone #1 (855) 379-9900. Thank you, everybody, and goodbye.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. With thank you for your participation.

Not content with causing geopolitical chaos, the Russians are wreaking havoc in the energy sector, too.
In a positive way, that is.
On Monday, I noted how Russian scientists have created floating nuclear power plants, which offer a radical solution to expanding nuclear power as an energy source.
Well, the Russians aren’t the only ones innovating in this area.
One company much closer to home has taken a giant step further…
It’s actually trying to reinvent the way nuclear fuel is produced. To do so, it’s going right to the source of nuclear energy.
The technology even boosts power output, and is safer than conventional uranium-based nuclear fuel.
There’s no question that it represents a major advancement in nuclear science.
But the question is: How does its stock match up?
This Company Wants a Nuclear Revolution
Based on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., in McLean, VA, Lightbridge Corp. (LTBR) is a little-known nuclear fuel technology firm.
Its business is essentially divided between its technology R&D and nuclear energy consultancy services.
Lightbridge wants to shift the focus of nuclear fuel from conventional uranium to an element called thorium.
It’s a sound idea. As you’ll see, thorium boasts several benefits over uranium.
But there’s often a huge gap between innovation and execution. And as you’ll also see, getting this innovation off the ground and widely accepted as a nuclear fuel is a monumental challenge.
~Cash
Take a glance inside Lightbridge’s books, and things quickly turn dark.
And that’s putting it mildly.
The firm sports some of the worst numbers I’ve seen in a long time.
For example, revenue and gross profit have steadily declined for over five years now. In fact, Lightbridge’s revenue has plummeted by 1,068% since 2008, dropping from $22.2 million to only $1.9 million last year.
Gross profit? Same story.
It nosedived by 1,288% – from $11.1 million in 2008 to a woeful $800,000 in 2013. Other major metrics are similarly awful.
Lightbridge CEO, Seth Grae, claims the company is in a “developmental stage.”
That’s partly true…
While the name “Lightbridge” has only been around since 2009, the company isn’t a startup. The company was actually founded in 1992 and was previously known as Thorium Power, Inc. – and Novastar Resources, Ltd. before that.
Not only does this company appear to have an identity crisis, it seems to have been in a “developmental stage” since 1992. That’s 22 years, with a steady drop in financial performance.
C.H.A.O.S. Meter: 1/20
~High Impact
As the global population rises, so does the strain on the energy infrastructure and existing resources.
When it comes to the nuclear industry, the world needs safer and more economically competitive nuclear power.
Well, Lightbridge has invented and patented high-impact fuel technology that it believes will achieve both goals. How?
By offering customers all-metal and thorium-based fuels to replace today’s uranium-enriched power.
You see, after uranium is mined, it gets converted to a gaseous form. It’s then transferred to an enrichment plant, where it’s “enhanced.” That enriched, gaseous uranium is then transported to a fuel fabrication plant, where it’s converted into uranium dioxide powder.
The powder is pressed into small fuel pellets that are then inserted into fuel rods. When bundled together, these rods form fuel assemblies. That’s what powers nuclear reactors.
But Lightbridge’s fuel rod technology offers new reactors and two alternative fuel types.
First, there’s thorium.
Thorium is a radioactive metal. Traces of it can be found in most rocks and soils, and it’s about three times more plentiful than uranium. That helps ease concerns over the uranium constraints.
Lightbridge claims its array of thorium-based rods are better than conventional uranium ones because they reduce the weight and volume of used fuel by 40% and uranium requirements by 10%.
All-in-all, Lightbridge says its thorium-based fuel will increase nuclear reactor power output by 30%, and eliminate nuclear waste material that’s used for nuclear weapon development.
Lightbridge also offers an interchangeable all-metal fuel rod.
These entirely metallic fuel rods boast three key benefits…

They provide a power output boost of up to 17%.


They result in a 30% rise in reactor uprate (time spent running).


The required operating temperature of the fuel created from its all-metallic rods is 716 degrees Fahrenheit. Compare that to the molten-hot 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit required for oxide fuel. This lower operating temperature keeps the fuel from approaching dangerous temperatures during accidents.

C.H.A.O.S. Meter: 17/20
~Acceleration
When it comes to short-term stock accelerants, there’s a common theme with Lightbridge…
Given the company’s $44-million market cap and thin volume, any whiff of good news or bad news in the nuclear industry has the potential to move the stock big time…

In addition, Lightbridge announced two weeks ago that it will be the first U.S. company to work with the Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear Safety (VARANS) to help develop the country’s nuclear energy program.
This is a lucrative opportunity. Vietnam’s $10-billion nuclear industry is second only to China’s in Southeast Asia. And the U.S. Commerce Department says the market will grow to $50 billion by 2030.
As governments focus more on nuclear safety and finding innovative ways to generate power, while avoiding disasters, Lightbridge is well-placed to offer traders quick opportunities to profit.
Be warned, though: This is a dangerous game to play. Given the stock’s low volume, you’d be hard-pressed to get out unscathed if shares fall hard.
C.H.A.O.S. Meter: 13/20
~Orders
The demand for nuclear power solutions today is stronger than ever.
Given that Lightbridge’s fuel offers both new and existing nuclear power plants better safety and power output, the company believes it can generate revenue from new plants, plus the maintenance and upgrade of existing ones.
That’s great in theory. But up to now, it has yet to generate any orders or revenue.
The other segment of Lightbridge’s business model is its nuclear strategy and consultation work to global governments and commercial operations.
It has a large and well-respected team here, including the former head of Advanced Nuclear Fuel Design at General Electric (GE), the former head of Nuclear Technology at Westinghouse, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a slew of former nuclear regulators from several different countries.
Since Lightbridge isn’t generating revenue from its technology, the company’s consultation work is the crux of its business.
Needless to say, relying on just one segment for revenue is pretty risky, given that business will rise and fall.
Unfortunately, Lightbridge has experienced more downs than ups recently. In 2013, revenue from its consulting segment sank by 100%, pulling in $1.8 million, compared to the $3.6 million it generated in 2012.
Hopefully, the VARANS deal will produce an upturn here.
C.H.A.O.S. Meter: 7/20
~Scalability 
It’s fair to say that Lightbridge is “all in” on its technology. If it gains widespread traction, it will finally transform the company’s fortunes.
If not… well, it would spell disaster.
Lightbridge does boast strong, established relationships through its consulting segment. And in order to grow, it intends to license its nuclear fuel design to existing nuclear fuel fabricators. It’s also looking for fuel fabricators that have long-term fuel supply contracts with nuclear power plants.
The structure of these licensing agreements will likely require major fuel suppliers to share fuel development costs. Also, fuel suppliers will need to pay an upfront technology access fee to Lightbridge, plus royalties from future fuel sales.
The company believes that continued heavy R&D spending, coupled with product demonstrations, will ensure commercial licensing contracts in roughly one to two years.
I’m skeptical…
Successful commercialization is multi-pronged. And one of those prongs requires expensive marketing costs to potential fuel fabricator customers, while the other requires raising government awareness.
Despite Lightbridge’s solid team of former government agency heads, it doesn’t help speed the exorbitant time that government processes tend to take. This is evidenced by the company’s prolonged efforts since 1992.
Given its financial situation, time is a luxury that Lightbridge does not have.
C.H.A.O.S. Meter: 5/20
OVERALL C.H.A.O.S. RANKING: 43/100
Final Verdict: An investment in Lightbridge is an investment in thorium and metallic fuels. Or, more accurately, an investment in the belief that thorium will become a major source of nuclear energy.
Given its abundance and environmental benefits over uranium, it’s likely that thorium will have a growing role in the nuclear industry. But it’s not a certainty – and not anytime soon, either.
Even Lightbridge’s own timeline doesn’t project ample commercialization until beyond 2020. In the meantime, it’ll be spending much more on researching and developing its metallic fuel than its consulting business can keep up with.
And that’s the problem… Lightbridge’s near-term life expectancy seems rather fragile.
If anything, the best I can say is that this is a “pre-chaos” company, whose main catalysts at the moment come from news-driven events, rather than its own disruptive breakthroughs.

thanks for the article, seems over priced to me. they have established a pretty good marketing plan, and they have convinced me if the technology is there that it will be the future of electrical and all sorts of power. that being said, economic structure does not change quickly. at my age trying to reap the benifits through investment is probably remote. 
the real problem is now a days no one wants to comprise when it comes to the enviroment and nothing is black and white. dirty coal lets not use it, that will work for a while , but when it comes to turning off the electricity because there is not enough to go around, then we will see just how uncomprising they can be.

thorium…gimme a break. it has been in the works for like 100 years and they never got it to work. doubt these guys can make it viable. also it is a lie that thorium is safer in terms of waste. it is actually worse.
[Reply]Alan Reply:August 29th, 2014 at 12:14 pmThorium has indeed been successfully used in nuclear reactors, but the best way to do it is in a molten salt reactor, which is not what these guys are pushing of course.  Eventually, most reactors are likely to be powered by thorium, but given the lack of crisis in uranium availability, that will take longer than it should.
The MSR-based thorium reactor (Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor, or LFTR is the most common term) does reduce the waste stream significantly, due to much more complete fuel burn-up, and the end waste products are relatively short-lived (hundreds of years vs 10,000’s), in addition to there just being less of them.

In 2016, the S&P 500 rose 12% on a total return basis. But the average investor’s portfolio earned just 5%. In other words, the market beat the average Joe by more than double. Thanks to an innovative new company, though, investors’ luck could change overnight.
