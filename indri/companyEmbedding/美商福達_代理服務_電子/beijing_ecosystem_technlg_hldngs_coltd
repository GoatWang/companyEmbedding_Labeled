A stiff triple for Irish whiskey as
distilleries are poised to multiply
By Jamie Smyth in Dublin

It was a favourite tipple of
Queen Elizabeth I of England,
who had casks of it delivered to
her court in the 16th century.
Dr Samuel Johnson, the writer,
was also a fan of its “pleasant
and mild flavour”. Now, after
100 years of near terminal
decline, Irish whiskey is making
a comeback.
Exports of the spirit are surg-

ing in key markets, multination-
als are investing in the main
brands – Jameson, Bushmills
and Tullamore Dew – and the
number of distilleries is set to
triple over five years. The resur-
gence of whiskey, known as
uisce beatha, or water of life, in
Irish, is part of a wider growth
in food and drink exports that is
helping Dublin emerge from its
financial crisis.
“Interest in Irish whiskey is

huge, particularly in the US,

Russia and eastern Europe.
Forty of the 130 markets where
we sell Jameson are seeing dou-
ble or triple-digit sales growth,”
said Peter Morehead, production
director at Irish Distillers,
which is owned by Pernod
Ricard and makes the top-
selling Jameson brand.
Last week, Irish Distillers cut

the ribbon on a €200m expan-
sion of its distillery in County
Cork, to double production to
16m nine-litre cases a year. Per-
nod Ricard said Jameson sales
grew in value by 17 per cent in
the year to the end of June,
making it the second largest
brand contributor to its growth.
Scottish spirits group William

Grant & Sons, which bought
Tullamore Dew for €171m in
2010, is investing €35m in a new
distillery. More than a dozen
other distilleries are either in
construction or in planning.
Overall Irish whiskey sales grew

10.5 per cent last year to 6.2m
nine-litre cases, faster than all
other types of brandy, Scotch,
US whiskey, tequila and cognac.
The surge in whiskey sales is

being driven by changing US
consumer tastes, where brown
spirits have become more popu-
lar among younger drinkers. A
similar trend is occurring in
eastern Europe and Russia, says
Mr Morehead.
Irish whiskey is attracting

young women drinkers. Pop
singer Lady Gaga declared her
love for Jameson at a recent
Dublin show, while Rihanna
named the brand in her party
track “Cheers (Drink to That)”.
The main difference between

Irish whiskey and Scotch is in
the distillation. Scotch is dis-
tilled twice while Irish is dis-
tilled three times, giving it a
more mellow flavour. Last year,
96m nine-litre cases of Scotch
were sold.

US investors have pumped more
money into European equities
than at any time since 1977, in a
big vote of confidence for the
region and its ability to recover
from the sovereign debt crisis.
Pension funds and other big

US groups invested $65bn in
European stocks in the first six
months of this year, the highest
in 36 years over that period,
according to research compiled
by Goldman Sachs’ European
strategy team from US Treasury
data.
Early signs of recovery and

rising confidence have restored
the faith of US investors in
Europe as hopes grow that mar-
kets can rally further on a wave
of stronger earnings in the sec-
ond half of the year.
Eddie Perkins, chief invest-

ment officer of international
equity at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said: “The eco-
nomic story makes Europe a
good bet. We expect European
equities to keep rising as the
continent recovers.”
Robert Parkes, equity strate-

gist at HSBC, added: “We see
earnings surprising on the
upside, which will act like a tail-
wind for European equities.”
HSBC says that European

stocks are still 15 per cent
undervalued compared with the
long-term average.
This is the case despite the

big rise in European equities
since July 2012 when Mario
Draghi, European Central Bank
president, pledged to do “what-
ever it takes” to save the euro.
European stocks have risen
27 per cent since June 4 2012.

However, equity markets still
face big risks. A possible US
military strike against Syria,
worries about emerging markets
instability and a renewed
flare-up of the eurozone crisis
could prevent further gains.
The poor performance of

emerging markets is a particu-
lar worry as European groups
derive about a third of their rev-
enues from that region. A fur-
ther setback in emerging mar-
kets would hit their profits.
Despite the risks, the fact that

European stocks remain cheap
is encouraging more US funds
to put money into the market,
say strategists and investment
managers. HSBC’s cyclically
adjusted price earnings multi-
ples are running at 11.4 times
compared with a historical aver-
age of 14.8 times.
Sectors favoured by Goldman

Sachs and HSBC are financials,
telecoms and utilities as these
have underperformed because of
the eurozone debt crisis in the
past few years.
European banking stocks, in

particular, are back in vogue as
the success of financials tends
to depend on an improving
economy. Expectations of more
mergers and acquisitions activ-
ity in areas such as telecoms is
also seen as positive for stocks.
Mr Parkes said: “There are

still a lot of pessimists out
there, but the cheapness of
stocks makes them attractive.
The risks are outweighed by the
positives and I think European
stocks can definitely move
higher.”

Assad warns of retaliation as Kerry
steps up lobbying for Syria strikes

By Hugh Carnegy in Paris,
Robin Harding in Washington
and Abigail Fielding­Smith
in Beirut

John Kerry, US secretary of
state, stepped up frantic admin-
istration efforts to win congres-
sional backing for military
action against Syria yesterday
as Bashar al-Assad, the coun-
try’s president, reportedly
warned of unspecified retalia-
tion for any attack.
According to CBS News, Mr

Assad, in an interview to be
broadcast today, denied using
chemical weapons against his
own people, thrusting him into
a head-to-head battle for US
hearts and minds with Presi-
dent Barack Obama.
The remarks come ahead of a

crucial week in which Mr
Obama will embark on a series
of TV interviews and address

the nation tomorrow, amid
signs in Congress of growing
opposition to action. A Senate
vote is likely on Wednesday.
Mr Assad’s remarks seemed

calculated to play on US
doubts. As well as suggesting
retaliation by forces aligned
with Syria, he expressed con-
cern that US strikes would tip
the military balance against his
regime, according to a preview
of the remarks by CBS inter-
viewer Charlie Rose.
Mr Assad said in the inter-

view in Damascus: “There has

been no evidence that I used
chemical weapons against my
own people.”
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry said

most members of the Senate
and House of Representatives
had yet to make up their minds
on the issue. Speaking in Paris,
Mr Kerry said predictions of
entrenched opposition in Con-
gress were “early and not par-
ticularly accurate”.
He said a compilation of vid-

eos released by the administra-
tion showing evidence of the
chemical weapons attack in
Damascus on August 21 that
Washington insists was carried
out by the Syrian regime was
designed to help swing opinion.
“The vast majority of mem-

bers of Congress, House and
Senate, are undecided. That’s
why the videos are being
shown and why the briefings
[of congressional members] are

taking place,” he told reporters.
He said he would be joining

the lobbying effort when he
returned to Washington tomor-
row. “I don’t think this case
has yet been made enough, to
enough people,” he said.
Mr Kerry arrived in London

last night.
US opponents of military

action argue that it could help
extremists come to power in
Syria. “[If] the strike is really
significant, it weakens Assad
and the result is the rebels are
able to succeed, and if what
happened there is al-Qaeda tak-
ing over . . . and extremist ter-
rorists getting access to those
chemical weapons, that hurts
US national security,” Ted
Cruz, a Republican senator
from Texas, told ABC News.

rowing and construction
are really being driven by
the weakening economy.
Since 2008, Australians

have preferred saving over
spending even though
incomes have grown and
unemployment remains rel-
atively low. A savings rate
of more than 10 per cent is
double that seen in the US.
“The Australian con-

sumer is deleveraging, but
the Australian consumer
has income whereas the US
or UK consumer doesn’t,”

omist at National Australia
Bank. “Their balance sheet

domestic economy not hav-
ing any mojo,” said Martin
Whetton, a strategist at
Nomura.
The Reserve Bank of Aus-

tralia has cut official inter-
est rates to a record low of
2.5 per cent over the past
two years. It says the min-
ing boom of recent years
crowded out other forms of
business investment.
The manufacturing sector

has been slowing for almost
two years, hurt by a strong
Australian dollar that made
exports uncompetitive
abroad as imports became
cheaper at home.
The RBA hopes house-

building will pick up the
slack as the mining boom
fades, but that could be
wide of the mark when the
interest rate cuts that are

Liberal governments’ plans,
equivalent to about 0.5 per
cent of gross domestic prod-
uct.
In his victory speech on

Saturday night, Mr Abbott
said: “From today, I declare
that Australia is under new
management and that Aus-
tralia is once more open for
business.”
The question is how the

new government will spur
the economy, given the lack
of big policy differences
between the two main par-
ties and external drags,
such as the end of the surge
in mining investment.
“Whichever government

came in, I do not think it is
the easiest of elections to
win because you have still
got a lot of headwinds from
China slowing and from the

ore and nickel assets who
plans to build a working
replica of the Titanic.
Only half of the Senate is

re-elected during a normal
election and the new sena-
tors will not take their seats
until July 2014. Until then,
the Greens hold the balance
of power in the upper
house, making it unlikely
the carbon tax can be
repealed before then.
The new government will

soon have to raise the
$300bn debt ceiling –
expected to be breached
before the end of the year –
in order to avoid deep
spending cuts.
According to the parties’

pre-election estimates, the
budget deficit will be about
A$8.8bn smaller by the year
ending June 2017 under the

Tallying Senate votes is a
complex process that typi-

early figures from the Aus-

Tony Abbott, Australia’s
prime minister-elect, hit the
ground cycling yesterday,
donning his Lycra gear for
an early morning bike ride
in Sydney before meeting
senior public servants
including the heads of the
Treasury, finance and
prime minister and cabinet
departments.
“This is essentially a

working day,” Mr Abbott
said a day after his centre-
right coalition was swept to
power by an electorate that
punished the six-year Labor
government for its bitter
infighting.
The Liberal-National coa-

lition secured a strong
swing away from Labor, led
by Kevin Rudd, after high-
lighting its divisions and
promising to repeal mining
and carbon taxes.
Labor had governed for

two terms, the shortest
party reign since the mid-
1970s in a country where
governments usually get at
least three terms.
With three-quarters of the

votes counted, the coalition
is expected to win 88 or 89
of the 150 seats in the lower
house, which determines
the government. Labor is
expected to win just 57
seats, its worst performance
in almost two decades. The
new administration would
be sworn in by the gover-
nor-general in a “week or
so”, Mr Abbott said.
The new prime minister

will take over the running
of an economy that is wit-
nessing the end of a mining
boom as he looks to meet
his campaign promises. The
coalition’s big proposals
include a repeal of taxes on
carbon and mining profits,
the cutting of 12,000 public
sector jobs and a paid
maternity leave scheme
that will be funded by a
levy on businesses with
more than A$5m in pre-tax
profits. Smaller businesses
will enjoy a 1.5 per cent tax
cut.
Mr Abbott said scrapping

the carbon tax, introduced
last year, was “obviously a
very early item of busi-
ness”. But this may be the
most difficult policy change
to effect as it would require
approval from the parlia-
ment’s upper house.

Mad monk, no more.
Tony Abbott, the
opposition Rottweiler who
has torn Kevin Rudd’s
dysfunctional Labor party
to shreds, is now prime
minister-elect of
Australia.
The former student

boxer has visibly toned
down his pugilistic image
and sought to tune in to
his inner statesman. Gone
are the budgie smugglers,
the skimpy swimming
trunks in which he once
flaunted his machismo. In
their stead, he has
donned conservative suits
and a conservative
persona – with the
primary emphasis that
the economy of Australia
is safer in his hands.
Not that he has dropped

his fighting talk. As he
celebrated victory on
Saturday night, he
returned to two of his
favourite causes. “In
three years’ time, the
carbon tax will be gone.
The boats will be
stopped,” he said, the
latter a reference to his
uncompromising policy
towards refugees
attempting to reach
Australia by sea.
There are three main

areas in which Mr Abbott
the prime minister –
rather than Mr Abbott
the opposition attack dog
– will be judged.
The most important is

the one that dominated
the election, the economy.
For a country that has
avoided recession for 22
years, the mood has been
astonishingly negative.
That is partly because
Australians believe years
of sturdy growth have
made the lifestyle they
take for granted now
harder to afford. It is also
partly because of fears
that the China-led
resources wave on which
the economy has surfed is
losing its force.
Mr Abbott is probably

right to deny Mr Rudd’s
claim that the resources
boom is over. Barring
severe economic crises in
China and the rest of
Asia, there should be
continued robust demand
for Australia’s iron ore,
coal and liquefied natural
gas. Still, the best years
may be gone. Prices are
unlikely to return to the
levels of a few years ago.
Mining investment, now 8
per cent of gross domestic
product, will dip back
towards its historic norm
of 2 per cent.
Non-resource industries,

crowded out by mining
and rendered
uncompetitive by a strong

currency, will need to be
nursed back to life. The
new government has also
pledged to be more
business-friendly. Not
only does it intend to
scrap the carbon tax, it
also wants to axe Labor’s
mining tax and other
corporate burdens. Mr
Abbott has promised to
be the “infrastructure
prime minister”, building
the projects needed to
raise productivity.
Contrary to Mr Rudd’s

assertion that a coalition
government would “cut,
cut, cut”, Mr Abbott’s
team has presented a
rather modest four-year
budget, providing savings
of just A$6bn ($5.5bn).
That hints at a
pragmatism that has
grown the closer Mr
Abbott has got to office.
It is also sensible. If the
economy really does slow,
then sharp and quick
fiscal contraction is not
what it will need.
Still, the coalition

budget is not exactly

transparent. As well as
corporate tax giveaways,
Mr Abbott will have to
find the money for his
expensive parental leave
scheme. That progressive
piece of legislation raises
the question of whether
Mr Abbott as prime
minister will mellow
socially. His values,
inspired by his Catholic
faith, represent what one
commentator described as
a “throwback choice” for
Australians. By no means
are all comfortable with
Mr Abbott’s views on
same-sex marriage or
abortion. As prime
minister, he may well
have to soften his stance.
The final test comes on

foreign policy. Mr Abbott
has so far adopted a shrill
patriotic tone. Again, in
office, this may need to
be modified if Australia is
to negotiate its chief
challenge – balancing its
security alliance with the
US and its economic
dependence on Asia.
There are hints of

pragmatism here too. The
new government will re-
examine a decision to ban
Huawei, the Chinese
telecoms company, from
tendering for the
broadband project. And
he intends his first
foreign visit to be to
Indonesia, an emerging
regional power.
Mr Abbott marked his

victory by donning
cycling shorts and going
for a Sunday morning
bike ride. His future
success might depend on
putting his budgie
smugglers away for good.

‘Mad monk’
may have to
mellow to win
over doubters

The budget hints
at a pragmatism
that has grown the
closer Abbott has
got to office

In a mood of sobriety and
preferring the safe option,
Olympic leaders abandoned
their risk-taking instincts
and plumped for the sensi-
ble choice of Tokyo over the
more hazardous alterna-
tives of Istanbul and Madrid
as the 2020 games host.
The outcome at the Inter-

national Olympic Commit-
tee’s congress in Buenos
Aires was decisive. Tokyo
overcame Istanbul in the
second and final round of
voting after Madrid was
eliminated in the first – and
prevailed by a comfortable
60 votes to 36.
Renewed worries about

radiation leaks at the Fuku-
shima nuclear plant threat-
ened to destabilise Tokyo’s
bid. But thanks to a slick
presentation, a relentlessly
drilled message of financial
stability and a not overly
ambitious venue construc-
tion programme, Tokyo saw
off its rivals with ease.
For the vanquished cities,

the only comfort was the
realisation that no amount
of presentational skills or
powers of persuasion would
shake the IOC from its tight
embrace of caution.
“You described yourself

as a safe pair of hands and
as a surgeon . . . this appeals
to me,” Jacques Rogge, IOC
president, told Shinzo Abe,
the Japanese prime minis-
ter, after the decision.
IOC members like the

grandiose statement when
choosing host cities. Beijing
would build bridges
between China and the

west. Athens would link the
modern games with its
ancient tradition. Rio would
be the first games in Latin
America. Sochi would be
Russia’s first winter games.
But none of these choices

have left the IOC feeling
good about itself. Each had
problems, some of these are
continuing – and for the
time being, the IOC has had
enough of uncertainty.
For Istanbul, staging the

Olympics would have been
“the sign of a country enter-
ing the world stage”, said
Soner Cagaptay at the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, as it had
been perceived for Seoul
1988, Barcelona 1992 and
Beijing 2008.
Its defeat was a blow for

Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
prime minister, who had
put the Olympics at the
heart of a huge infrastruc-
ture plan for his home city.
“It is a symbolic setback

for Turkey’s ambitions to
become a global power,”
said Mr Cagaptay.

Mr Erdogan’s government
had already seen its inter-
national image damaged by
the government crackdown
on mass protests over the
summer. Riot police fanned
out again in Istanbul on
Saturday even as the votes
were cast in Buenos Aires.
Other reasons for the

IOC to vote against Istanbul
included fears about insta-
bility spreading from
Syria – which shares a
900km border with Turkey.
There were also pointed

questions from IOC mem-
bers to both Turkey and
Spain about their question-
able doping record. Claims
from Spanish newspaper El
Mundo that 50 IOC mem-
bers had promised to vote
for Madrid, even publishing
their names, helped to raise
expectations in the Spanish
camp. But some observers
suggested the stunt may
have been detrimental to
the bid. “IOC members
don’t like it when people
try to influence them,” one
member told Argentine
daily La Nación.
Spain’s persuasive Crown

Prince Felipe, a former
Olympic sailor who is popu-
lar in IOC circles and who
many hoped would help to
seal the deal for Madrid,
declared: “I am an Olym-
pian and proud father of
two daughters who want a
bright future.”
It was not enough. For

the IOC, its priorities are
real issues such as the
plight of the Spanish econ-
omy rather than emotive
calls to Olympic values.
The safe, sound, solid
Tokyo offering will do.

By John Reed in Jerusalem

The EU is facing growing
pressure from Israel and
the US to water down tough
new guidelines restricting
EU funding for institutions
in Jewish settlements on
Palestinian lands.
John Kerry, US secretary

of state, told a press confer-
ence in Paris he had asked
the EU to suspend the
guidelines at a meeting of
European foreign ministers
at the weekend. He also
warned against possible fur-
ther measures to label
goods made in Israeli settle-
ments in the West Bank.
Reports of his interven-

tion brought an angry
response from the Palestini-
ans, who reported US lobby-
ing on the issue as “discour-
aging” and urged Brussels
to stick to its guidelines.
Mr Kerry, who is sponsor-

ing a new round of Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, said
he told European ministers
that it was important to
repay Mr Netanyahu for the
“political price” he had paid
to engage in the peace
talks. He said he was not
asking the EU to change its
rules, but to hold back from
applying them while the
talks were taking place.
The issue is expected to

be discussed during a visit
to Israel tomorrow led by
Pierre Vimont, secretary-
general of the EU’s Exter-
nal Action Service. Israeli
and European officials are
then due to meet in Brus-
sels on Thursday to discuss
Israel’s participation in the
bloc’s Horizon 2020 research
funding programme, Israel’s
foreign ministry said.
The new EU rules, drawn

up in July, would restrict
European loans, grants and
scholarships for Israeli enti-
ties based in the West
Bank, East Jerusalem and
the Golan Heights, which
Israel occupied after the six-

day war in 1967. Following
Mr Kerry’s request, Cathy
Ashton, the EU foreign pol-
icy chief, said Brussels
would implement the fund-
ing measures “sensitively”.
She added: “We of course
want to continue to have a
strong relationship with
Israel.”
Israel began lobbying in

several European capitals
in July, claiming the meas-
ures would make a peace
deal less attainable by hard-
ening the Palestinians’
negotiating stance on the
borders of any future state.

Israel says the funding
restrictions would force it
to formally accept the Euro-
pean position, which holds
that settlements beyond the
“Green Line” are illegal. It
says that even institutions
applying for funding from
within the pre-1967 borders
will be ineligible if they
have projects beyond the
Green Line.
The Palestinians, by con-

trast, say the EU’s new
guidelines will help foster a
two-state solution by rein-
forcing the 1967 borders.
“Reports of [the] US lobby-
ing the EU on behalf of
Israel are extremely dis-
couraging and cast serious
doubts on the US mediation
role,” Hanan Ashrawi, a
member of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation’s
executive committee, said
on Saturday. “Once again
the US is using the negotia-
tion process to grant Israel
immunity and to buy it
more time to create facts on
the ground.”

The late morning sun is
burning brightly, Málaga’s
many beaches are a short
bus ride away and school
has yet to resume. But when
Maribel Galacho opens the
gate of the Colegio Severo
Ochoa, the junior school
she heads in the southern
Spanish city, she finds doz-
ens of pupils waiting.
The youngsters from the

impoverished areas nearby
have made the daily trip for
a simple reason: to get a
decent meal.
After they kiss their

mothers goodbye, the pupils
head straight to the school
canteen for a late breakfast
of chocolate milk, fruit and
sandwiches stuffed with
spicy chorizo sausage. For
most, says Ms Galacho, this
is their first food of the day.
“We have pupils who

don’t have their basic needs
covered – even things like
clothing and hygiene,” said
the principal.
Her school is part of a

programme launched by the
regional government of
Andalucia this year to com-
bat the rising hardship
caused by Spain’s prolonged
economic crisis. It allows
children from poor families
to spend summer holidays
back at school, where they
are entertained with games
and special projects.
More importantly, they

receive breakfast, lunch
and an afternoon snack – a
balanced diet that includes
fresh fruit and vegetables,
meat and fish. This is often
hard to come by in their
homes.
Even in an age of abun-

dant food supplies and dis-
count supermarkets, food
has become a worry for
Spain’s poorest. Over the

past year, says Ms Galacho,
she and her colleagues
noticed that a growing
number of students were
falling asleep in class,
apparently from fatigue and
lack of a proper diet.
“They arrive in the morn-

ing, and by mid-morning
they fall asleep,” she said.
“They just don’t have the
energy to follow the school
programme.”
The Colegio Severo Ochoa

is one of 12 state schools in
Málaga that have stayed
open over the summer.
Across Andalucia, about
11,000 children have taken
part in the programme.

Regional governments in
Extremadura and the
Canary Islands have offered
similar but smaller-scale
schemes. Taken together,
the programmes offer a
powerful reminder that
Spain’s economic crisis and
high unemployment have
led to severe social hard-
ship. And while the eco-
nomic news has been
brightening in recent
months, few believe that
there will be a speedy turn-
round for the country’s
poorest and their children.
According to recent data

from Unicef, child poverty
in Spain has been rising

since the start of the crisis
more than five years ago.
The UN children’s fund
found that almost a fifth of
Spanish youngsters live
below the poverty line – one
of the worst performers
among the 29 advanced
countries included in the
ranking, and below other
crisis-ridden southern Euro-
pean states such as Italy,
Portugal and Greece.
“Due to the crisis, fami-

lies with real economic
problems often have prob-
lems to supply their chil-
dren with proper food, to
buy fish and meat and vege-
tables. Families are cutting

spending on everything,
including on food,” said
Marta Arias, a director at
Unicef in Spain. She cites
recent survey findings indi-
cating that 40 per cent of
Spaniards say they are
changing their eating hab-
its as a result of the crisis.
Her assessment is con-

firmed by some of the moth-
ers who have sent their
children to the summer
school in Málaga.
Before the crisis, they

were able to earn a little on
the side to top up their wel-
fare benefits by cleaning
houses or helping out at
markets. Now, says Tam-
ara, a mother-of-three who
says her family lives on
€900 a month, “we have to
get the food that fits the
[economic] situation . . . We
have enough to eat but it is
often difficult to get to the
end of the month.”
The summer school pro-

grammes have been accom-
panied by alarmist warn-
ings of a growing malnutri-
tion problem, but Spain’s
association of paediatri-
cians does not agree.
José Manuel Moreno Vil-

lares, of the association’s
nutrition programme. said:
“It is clear there are more
families that have to ask for
help from private or public
institutions. But, thanks to
that support, we have not
seen any repercussions on
infant malnutrition.”
Some politicians from the

centre-right ruling Popular
party have spoken out
openly against the need for
special food programmes,
arguing it is the family’s
responsibility to feed their
children – not the state’s.
The government of Mariano
Rajoy has promised to step
up the fight against child
poverty, but has otherwise
voiced scepticism about the
need for wider Andalucian-
style school programmes.
For Ms Galacho, however,

the political debate that has
simmered for much of the
summer is of little signifi-
cance: “There is a real need,
and we try to cover that
need,” she said.

4 ★ FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013

The select black T-shirts
said it all: “Stay cool, and
choose the chancellor”. The
ubiquitous orange ones sim-
ply proclaimed: “Team
Deutschland”.
Seven thousand support-

ers from the Christian Dem-
ocrat Union came to Düs-
seldorf to cheer Angela Mer-
kel, the German chancellor,
yesterday and launch the
final spurt of an election
campaign that she has dom-
inated from the start.
Huge posters of the chan-

cellor’s face plastered the
pillars and walls of the ice
hockey stadium in a blatant
demonstration of how her
ruling party is seeking to
exploit the popularity of Ms
Merkel to sweep it back to
office in the general elec-
tion on September 22.
She faced a sea of orange

T-shirts, cardboard orange
hats and posters with one
word – “Angie!” – as if to
orchestrate the chanting
that greeted her arrival at
the rally.
They used a Beatles band

to warm up the audience,
hammering out old favour-
ites to encourage a feel-
good mood in the crowd. It
was good old-fashioned nos-
talgia with old favourites
such as “A Hard Day’s
Night” and “Twist and
Shout” belted out to an
adoring audience.
Perhaps the most appro-

priate song for the occasion
was “She Loves You”,
although perhaps the real
message was that they love
her. Personalities do not
normally dominate politics
in Germany, where elec-
tions are a matter of choos-
ing a coalition government
to rule the land. But if any-
one can hope to swing an
election, it is Ms Merkel in
Germany today.
The principal, abiding

image of the CDU campaign
is an advertisement featur-
ing the chancellor’s hands
in her most popular pose –
her fingers held together in
the shape of a diamond. It
has been plastered across
the biggest election bill-
board in the land, outside
the main railway station in
Berlin. In Düsseldorf it was
more discreet: supporters in
black T-shirts bore the sim-
ple slogan of diamond
hands: “stay cool”.
And that was the message

of the chancellor, as she
deliberately delivered a
downbeat speech, hammer-
ing away at her main cam-
paign themes: free choice
for families on schools and
jobs, decent pensions for
the low paid and mothers
who have stayed at home to
look after their children,
minimum wages for the
lowest paid, but no tax rises
for the better off, as the
opposition wants.
She has stolen the middle

ground of German politics

from the centre-left opposi-
tion, insisting that the
country should be one
“where the stronger help
the weaker”, and where
there are opportunities for
all. But she also attacked
the opposition for wanting
to tell people how they
should behave, and raise
their taxes.
“We don’t try to tell peo-

ple what food they should
eat,” she said, mocking the
Green party for suggesting
that everyone should have
one meat-free day every
week.
She defended her euro-

zone crisis management,
too, insisting that holding
the eurozone together was a
fundamental national inter-
est for Germany. “Europe
for Germany is like a sec-
ond side of our homeland,”
she declared. Europe stood
for freedom of opinion, free-
dom of speech, freedom of
the press and freedom of
religion. Thanks to Euro-
pean integration, there
were no conflicts any more
over such fundamental val-
ues.

Yet the real message from
Ms Merkel is very simple:
Trust Me. I am a safe pair
of hands. I think before I
act. You know me by now,
so don’t vote for change.
Behind the razzmatazz of

the reception, however, was
a more urgent message for
the faithful. “The election
isn’t over yet. It will be a
very tight race,” as Her-
mann Gröhe, general-secre-
tary of the CDU, spelt it out
before the chancellor
arrived.
He quoted the latest poll

figures from Bild am Son-
ntag, the mass circulation
Sunday newspaper, show-
ing that the CDU, with its
Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union, and
its coalition partners, the
liberal Free Democrats, are
on a combined 45 per cent.
The opposition combina-

tion of Social Democrats
and Greens may be “far
behind”, he admitted, but if
you include the far-left
Linke party, their combined
support is exactly the same
as Ms Merkel’s – 45
per cent.

By Sarah Gordon
in Cernobbio, Italy

What a difference a year
makes. Last September’s
Ambrosetti Forum, which
gathers together policy
makers, business people
and academics at the Villa
d’Este on the banks of Lake
Como in northern Italy, was
a gloomy affair despite the
glorious surroundings.
Proceedings were domi-

nated by discussion of the
crisis in the eurozone. “It
would have been better if
we had never created the
eurozone,” said one partici-
pant. “But now that we
have, it would be disastrous
to let it collapse.”
Now, the atmosphere has

lightened considerably.
Talk of the “green shoots”
of economic recovery, in
Europe and the US, was
much on speakers’ lips,
accompanied, in the case of
senior bureaucrats from the
European institutions, by a
certain degree of self-con-
gratulation for having
“saved” the currency union.
“Unit labour costs are

converging, fiscal balances
are improving,” said a sen-
ior German academic.
“Growth is not exactly stel-
lar, but it is coming back.”
Several panellists, includ-

ing Christine Lagarde, man-
aging director of the IMF,
had come straight to Lake
Como from last week’s G20
meeting in St Petersburg.
“For the first time in

three years at the G20 and
the G8 the eurozone was
not the main target of dis-
cussion,” said one senior

European bureaucrat. “Our
patience and tenacity are
starting to bring concrete
results. Markets now know
that we stand by the euro.”
Yet, despite the change in

mood, economists at the
forum pointed out the data
from Europe and the US
were mixed, an observation
reinforced by the release of
weaker-than-expected US
jobs numbers on Friday.
And speaker after speaker

warned of the risks of com-
placency now the danger of
a eurozone collapse
appeared to have passed. As
one pointed out, “Confi-
dence leaves on horseback,
but returns on foot.”
There were repeated calls

to speed up the process of
banking union in the euro-
zone, particularly the imple-
mentation of a bank resolu-
tion mechanism. Even more
frequent were calls for
measures to create a fully
single market. “Our best
bet to improve productivity
remains our European sin-
gle market,” said one
speaker from Brussels.
Calls for reform focused

on energy and telecommu-
nications. “We need a Euro-
pean broadband system and
a European electricity net-
work,” said the leader of
one industry body.
The high cost of energy,

and consequent loss of com-
petitiveness vis a vis the US
as it benefits from cheap
shale gas, was high on the
list of concerns of chief
executives at the forum.
Several speakers argued

that some pooling of euro-
zone countries’ debt

remained a crucial step
towards recovery.
“Some degree of debt

mutualisation is neces-
sary,” argued one much-
published academic. “You
can’t be half-pregnant, and
you can’t be half-federal.”
Political uncertainty –

with elections in Germany
and Italy’s tottering coali-
tion – added to the sense

the eurozone was not out of
the woods, as did concern
over the state of one of its
most important members.
“The most vital country

today is France,” said a
former multilateral institu-
tion head. “On competitive
statistics, France is going
the wrong way.” Although
recent indicators showed its
economy out of recession,
growth remains weak,
unemployment rising and
competitive performance
continues to lag.
One source of optimism

was the prospect of a free-
trade deal with the US. But

expected higher global
interest rates were seen as
potentially damaging to
economic prospects, partic-
ularly in emerging markets.
“Emerging markets have

been lucky over the past
few years,” said economist
Nouriel Roubini. “Global
interest rates have been
low, there has been very
high demand for commodi-
ties from China, and inves-
tors have been searching
for yield. Now the tide is
turning. The risk is of a
financial crisis there [in
emerging markets] leading
to a new slowdown in the
advanced economies.”
Mr Roubini also

bemoaned the lack of lead-
ership globally, a theme to
which many speakers
returned. “There is no inter-
national community,”
asserted one panellist.
“Instead of a G20 or a G8 we
live in a G-zero world.”
Indeed, it was difficult to

avoid the sense at Ambro-
setti that debate within the
eurozone remains inward-
looking, a feeling reinforced
by the ornate surroundings
in which the forum is held.
Professor David Daokui

Li, an academic from Bei-
jing’s Tsinghua University,
was not just the only Chi-
nese participant at Ambro-
setti but the only Asian rep-
resentative. “We are very
far from where we want to
be,” said one Brussels
bureaucrat. “There is much
work to be done.”

New York mayoral race

Ombudsman makes surge
A backlash against Michael
Bloomberg has thrown the
race to replace New York’s
billionaire mayor into
turmoil, propelling one of
his biggest critics to the top
of the Democratic field,
writes Shannon Bond in
New York.
Bill de Blasio, the city’s

ombudsman, has made an
unlikely late surge fuelled
by his criticism of Mr
Bloomberg and an
emphasis on the city’s
growing economic
inequality. He has left his
Democrat rivals scrambling
to distance themselves from
the mayor and ramp up
attacks on Mr de Blasio in
the days before their
party’s primary tomorrow.
Christine Quinn, the city

council speaker once seen
as Mr Bloomberg’s heir
apparent, has found herself
in third place in the polls
after leading the field for
most of the year.
She released the first

negative advert of the
primary race last week,
attacking Mr de Blasio for
taking campaign
contributions from landlords
he had once placed on a
watch list, and accusing him
of supporting the police
department’s controversial
“stop and frisk” policy,
which the ombudsman has
criticised.
Mr Bloomberg himself

lashed out at the
frontrunner, calling the
campaign “racist” because
of Mr de Blasio’s use of his
mixed­race family in
advertisements and on the
campaign trail. “I do not
think he himself is racist
[but] it’s comparable to me
pointing out I’m Jewish in
attracting the Jewish vote,”
the mayor said.
Mr de Blasio described

Mr Bloomberg’s remarks as
“inappropriate”.

German election
The CDU aims to
exploit chancellor’s
popularity to sweep
the party back into
office, writes
Quentin Peel

By Charles Clover and
Courtney Weaver in Moscow

Alexei Navalny, the Rus-
sian opposition leader,
appeared to have exceeded
expectations in an election
for mayor of Moscow yester-
day, raising the possibility
of a recount or even a run-
off against Sergei Sobyanin,
the Kremlin-backed incum-
bent.
As polling stations closed,

exit polls conflicted with
each other over whether Mr
Navalny had done enough
to take the contest into a
second round. His own
camp’s poll put him at 35
per cent versus Mr Soby-
anin at 46 per cent. How-
ever, another poll from the
Public Opinion Foundation
– a private agency that car-
ries out sociological studies
for the Kremlin – had Mr
Sobyanin at 52 per cent and
Mr Navalny at 29 per cent.
The state-owned VTsyum

polling group gave Mr Soby-
anin 53 per cent and his
challenger 32 per cent.
If no candidate wins more

than 50 per cent in the first
round, a run-off between
the two top finishers is sup-
posed to be held within two

weeks. Preliminary results
of the voting were sched-
uled to be released at 10pm
Moscow time.
Mr Navalny was helped

by historically low turnout
in the election, at 26 per
cent as of 6pm local time,
two hours before voting
ended. The anti-corruption
blogger – who was con-
victed of fraud in July on
controversial charges – is a
populist and nationalist
opposition leader with
lower name recognition
than Mr Sobyanin, but he
made up ground with a
committed group of sup-
porters.
But even if the incumbent

is eventually declared a
first-round winner, Mr Nav-
alny’s showing is likely to
energise the opposition to
Vladimir Putin, Russia’s
president. Last week, some
projections gave the chal-
lenger only 15-16 per cent.
Furthermore, while the

exit polls could be mislead-
ing, they could provide fuel
for protests if evidence of
vote fraud emerges, as Mr
Navalny’s supporters have
claimed.
Mr Navalny’s supporters

complain that they have
not had “administrative
resources” on their side – a
euphemism for government
interference in elections.
Some measures have been
taken to address fears of
fraud. Web cameras have

been installed at all polling
stations, making the stuff-
ing of ballot boxes more dif-
ficult.
Throughout the day, sup-

porters of Mr Navalny
tweeted about instances of
alleged fraud.
In one election district,

700 soldiers were illegally
registered to vote, accord-
ing to Leonid Volkov, Mr
Navalny’s campaign man-
ager. In another, monitors
were not allowed to accom-
pany a ballot box that was
removed from the station
and which was allegedly
returned with 300 extra
ballots.
However, in Russia most

electoral fraud claims in the
past have centred on the
counting stage rather than
during voting, after proto-

cols containing vote tallies
are transferred from voting
precincts to regional cen-
tres.
Mr Navalny told his sup-

porters after the close of
voting: “We will do every-
thing so [falsification] does
not occur. We ask the
observers to work hard
these next few hours so

votes will not be stolen.”
Mr Sobyanin has

defended the voting as fair
and says the opposition has
long had a strategy of
accusing the government of
falsifying votes in order to
cover up their lack of real
domestic support.
“People are already get-

ting ready to go out on to
the street and protest
against the unfair election,”
Mr Sobyanin told the news-
paper Arguments and Facts
last week, four days before
the vote actually took place.
“We already have a huge

number of people who were
dissatisfied with the way
the elections of September 8
were held – you didn’t
know?” he joked.
“The results will be

counted both automatically
and by hand, every candi-
date will have observers.
What else should we be
doing? It seems to me that
cries of a possible fraudu-
lent mayoral election in the
capital is a provocation in
its purest form.”
At a voting station near

Polyanka metro in central
Moscow, several voters said
they planned or had already
voted for Mr Navalny.
Roman Ivanov, an audi-

tor, said although he
believed there was some
truth to the fraud charges
against Mr Navalny, the
opposition candidate had
shown “he would fight eve-

ryone who was doing all the
real stealing”.
“The battle Navalny has

chosen to fight comes at
great emotional expense
and requires huge risks,”
Mr Ivanov said. Mr Soby-
anin, by contrast, “was an
artificially created politi-
cian”.
Elena Saed, an editor,

said she had been galva-
nised by Mr Navalny’s
appearance in the race. “I
believe this is the first real
election,” she said.
Accusations of fraud in

the December 2011 parlia-
mentary elections triggered
mass street protests that
winter, which the Kremlin
only managed to contain
after suppressing opposition
activities.
The fact that Mr Navalny

was allowed to run at all
seemed to be a sign the
Kremlin was confident of
victory but also that Mr
Putin’s government might
be rethinking its authoritar-
ian strategy. There were
several other elections yes-
terday, notably in Yekater-
inburg, Russia’s fourth-
largest city, where opposi-
tion politicians were
allowed to take part.
Mr Sobyanin appeared

confident he would win a
fair election against Mr
Navalny and some observ-
ers said he welcomed the
challenge as a way of mak-
ing his win more credible.

By Simeon Kerr in Dubai

A group of businessmen
have gone on hunger strike
in Dubai’s main jail to pro-
test against their continued
incarceration for writing
cheques that bounced.
Twelve inmates from

India, Pakistan and the
Gulf, who have spent years
behind bars for failing to
honour debts during the
global financial crisis, are
likely to be joined by other
men of different nationali-
ties over the next few days,
one of the hunger strikers
said.
The 12 have written to

public prosecutors to com-
plain their sentences were
handed out in “bad faith”
and as a result of improper
application of the law.
Their protest follows a

similar hunger strike in
Dubai last year, which
ended in the release of two
prisoners after the authori-
ties reviewed their cases.
Failing to honour debts is a
criminal offence in the
United Arab Emirates.
Inmates estimate that

about 500 expatriate prison-
ers remain in jail on debt-
related crimes. Judges do
not take into consideration
the circumstances sur-
rounding a default.
But as Dubai’s economy

recovers from its tumultu-
ous real estate crash,
imprisoned debtors hope
that the authorities can be
persuaded to release them
and allow them to work off
their remaining debts.
A UAE presidential

decree last year stopped the

jailing of Emiratis for fail-
ing to honour their debts.
About 1,000 local prisoners
were subsequently released
from prisons across the fed-
eration of seven emirates.
“The Emiratis have gone

home, but we are still stuck
here,” said one of the
foreign inmates, who has
been in jail for two years,
speaking on condition of
anonymity from a prison
pay phone. “We just ask
that we can get out and
start to recover the receiva-
bles we have so we can pay
back our debts.”
Dubai’s public prosecu-

tion declined to comment.
The criminalisation of

debt has prompted interna-
tional criticism and acts as
an impediment to the crea-
tion of an entrepreneurial
culture, given the risk of
imprisonment for failing
start-ups.
The UAE government has

launched a credit bureau to
present banks with better
intelligence on prospective
borrowers’ credit profile, a
prerequisite for any attempt
to make debt a civil, rather
than criminal, offence.
But there is resistance

to decriminalisation as
personal guarantees on
cheques underpin the finan-
cial architecture of the
country, providing creditors
with leverage against
borrowers.
Many banks argue that

tough measures are needed
to prevent debtors fleeing
the country. Expatriates
form a large majority of
about 75 per cent of the
country.

Carmakers Many of the world’s most powerful motor industry chief executives are expected
to step down soon but questions remain about potential successors. By Henry Foy

New hands on the wheel

O
n August 29, Renault’s chief
operating officer Carlos
Tavares quit the company
after an emergency meeting

of the astonished board.
Only two weeks earlier, the Portu-

guese executive had given an inter-
view that convulsed the motor indus-
try: he had taken a shot at his widely-
respected boss and had suggested that
he would be more successful as chief
executive at a rival carmaker.

His remarks, made to the Bloomberg
news agency on August 14, have so far
failed to land him a plum job at
another company. Still, the unex-
pected comments from a man consid-
ered heir-apparent at France’s second-
largest carmaker has lifted the bonnet
on the hottest and most intriguing
story in the car industry: succession.

Many of the world’s biggest car com-
panies, all run by men, are expected to
change their chief executives soon.

“You are going to see a generational
transition start to emerge over the
next 12 to 18 months,” says a senior
executive at one global carmaker.
“There’s a cycle approaching in the

industry.” In an industry that requires
long product development and
demands long-term investment deci-
sions, automotive chief executives typ-
ically stay for the best part of a dec-
ade. They define companies and their
vehicles for years.

Such is the sense of anticipation
about the leaders-in-waiting that when
General Motors merely tweaked the
composition of the pension of 64-year-
old chief executive Dan Akerson in
April, it sparked a flurry of specula-
tion that he was looking to leave.

Boardroom pressure on Daimler
chief Dieter Zetsche and the move-
ments of those tipped as frontrunners
to replace him have generated more
headlines this year than the com-
pany’s financial performance.

The world’s most powerful car chief
executives come from mixed back-
grounds. Gone are the days when an
engineering degree and a decade on
the production line were the route to
the top. The seven largest car groups
by sales are now headed by a former
aviation executive (Ford), an account-
ant (Fiat-Chrysler), a tyre expert

(Renault-Nissan), a naval officer
turned private equity executive (GM),
one metallurgist (Volkswagen) and
two sons from distinguished families
(Toyota and Hyundai).

Ford and Fiat have all turned to
successful businessmen from outside
the industry to rescue them in the
past 10 years. Both rebounded spectac-
ularly, thanks mainly to financial rig-
our and restructuring.

“There are very few people today
that you can really call auto guys
[at the top],” says Stefano Aversa,
managing director at AlixPartners, a
consultancy. “The concept that a
top executive should be an auto
guy . . . that knows the product inside
out, clearly is not true any more.”

But at Volkswagen, run almost
exclusively by engineers and techni-
cally-minded managers such as chief
executive Martin Winterkorn, success
has been built on an unrelenting focus
on improving the engineering of the
vehicles. “In the premium segment
you need to be more of a product guy,
long-term oriented,” adds Mr Aversa.
“But in the mainstream volume, you
need more general management skills,
financial discipline.”

Mr Tavares named Ford and GM as
the two companies that he thought he
was good enough to run. Both have
denied plans to hire him, but the two
are considered the most likely to begin
the expected flurry of successions.

At Ford, the future looks clear. The
company announced in November that
chief executive Alan Mulally, 68,
would remain at the helm through
2014, while all but anointing Mark
Fields as his replacement by promot-
ing him to chief operating officer.

Mr Akerson at GM has yet to set a
departure date but is considered
unlikely to continue past 2016. The
field of potential successors is wide.

Vice-chairman Steve Girsky and North
America head Mark Reuss are seen
internally as the frontrunners, say two
people close to the company. Mary
Barra, head of product development,
and Grace Lieblein, who is in charge
of purchasing, are also in contention
to become the industry’s first female
chief executive.

Mr Winterkorn, 66, is keeping his
cards close to his chest. Volkswagen
has a wide range of internal candi-
dates across the group’s vast array of
brands. Audi’s chief executive Rupert
Stadler is considered the frontrunner.

Many big names in the industry
sport a number of different company
marques on their CVs. Companies typ-
ically choose to hire talent from out-
side when launching new initiatives or
product lines. Nissan poached Audi’s
former US head Johan de Nysschen to
run its new push towards premium
vehicles and VW’s former China chief
Karl-Thomas Neumann left to head up
GM in Europe.

That is good news for carmakers
without an obvious successor.

Fiat’s Sergio Marchionne shows no

sign of stepping down but lacks an
obvious protégé at the Italian car-
maker and has struggled to cultivate a
shortlist of potential heirs, say two
people who know the company.

The same is true at Renault in the
wake of Mr Tavares’ departure, offi-
cials admit. At sister company Nissan,
which has the most international
blend of executives in the industry,
the bench is deeper.

“One of our main concerns in the
industry broadly is a lack of leader-
ship candidates across the board,”
says Anil Valsan, lead automotive
analyst at EY, the professional serv-
ices firm. “There’s a worry that [car-
makers] are not doing enough to men-
tor and nurture future leaders.”

The matchmaker Carlos Ghosn The engineer Dieter Zetsche

The changemaker Alan Mulally The businessman Dan Akerson

The dealmaker Sergio Marchionne

In an industry enamoured of
alliances but awful at making
them work, Mr Ghosn is the
exception.
He was an executive at

Renault in 1999 when it
bought a stake in Nissan. He
made the Japanese company
profitable within a year and
was leading both carmakers
by 2005.
The Brazilian­Lebanese­

Frenchman’s gruelling air miles
between Paris and Yokohama
play to the alliance’s
strengths, blending Renault’s

diesel technology and
European reach with Nissan’s
manufacturing prowess. It is
the world’s fourth­largest
carmaker by combined sales.
He shows no sign of

loosening his grip. When
his protégé agitated for a
promotion, the successor­in­
waiting had to quit.
Mr Ghosn’s legacy hinges

on his bet on emerging
markets through revival of the
Datsun marque and Russia’s
Lada, and his faith in electric
and self­driving vehicles.

The car that

Ghosn promised to
make a mass­
market electric car.

Possible
successors

Joe Peter,
Nissan CFO
Jérôme Stoll,

A one­company man, the
60­year­old Mr Zetsche has
led Daimler since 2006 and is
respected for reviving its
flagship Mercedes­Benz brand
after the disastrous merger
with Chrysler was abandoned.
As head of Mercedes, in

addition to his chairmanship of
the group, his attention to
detail and focus on
engineering excellence led the
marque to stem years of
declining quality.
But despite a pledge to

make Mercedes the world’s
top luxury brand by sales, it
has slipped behind Audi and
BMW because of a lack of
key products and mistakes
made in China. Daimler’s
stock price has trailed that of
its German rivals.
Famous for his immaculately

coiffured white moustache,
Zetsche has been under
pressure from disgruntled
investors in recent quarters
and in February was given a

contract extension only to
2016, two years less

than expected.

brilliance but sales

successors

manufacturing

Admired for his straight­talking
and dry humour, Mr
Marchionne is an executive
who defied the odds to rescue
Fiat and the Agnelli family’s
fortune in the company.
Feted by many as the most

wily dealmaker in the car
industry, he honed his
negotiating skills by dealing
with Italian politicians and
unions over restructuring Fiat.
He snapped up Chrysler
cheaply after its bankruptcy in

what could come to be seen
as one of the best car deals
of all time.
However, the job is only

half­done. In the short term,
Mr Marchionne has to
convince a union trust that
holds the rest of Chrysler to
sell its stake at a price
acceptable to Fiat. He then
has to make the merged
company work efficiently.
Revitalising Alfa Romeo will be
a big challenge.

Global sales have increased by
half during Martin Winterkorn’s
six­and­a­half year tenure at
Volkswagen Group. Its
premium brand Audi has
almost overtaken BMW as the
biggest luxury marque. The
mainstream VW brand remains
profitable while other leading
brands in Europe are making
losses.
Crucially, he is backed by

Ferdinand Piëch, chairman of
the supervisory board.
One of the only true nuts­

and­bolts enthusiasts at the
top of the industry, Mr
Winterkorn oversees 12
automotive brands and
Volkswagen is on track to
overtake GM and Toyota at
the top of the global sales
tree by 2018. Maintaining
quality as it ramps up quantity
will be his toughest test.
Still, he shows no sign of

tiring. His executives are
playing a game of musical
chairs as they jostle to
succeed him.

The car that
sums up his era
Audi A8. Audi is
cool again. The
vehicles are selling
well and are highly
profitable.

The only one of the US Big
Three not to go bankrupt or
turn to the state for a bailout,
Ford was arguably a harder
company to turn round than
its Detroit cousins, GM and
Chrysler.
Affable but driven, Mr

Mulally has sold off
non­core brands such as
Jaguar and Land Rover. He
has also pushed his One Ford
strategy to streamline
production around the world.

A resurgent US market has
fuelled sales of the F­150
truck, a cash cow. Small cars
also continue to gain market
share.
Mr Mulally has adopted a

realistic stance on Europe’s
crisis and learnt from early
mistakes in emerging markets
such as India. With a
successor all but anointed,
Mr Mulally has continually
stressed he will leave Ford
after 2014.

Possible
successors
Very hard to look
beyond Mark
Fields, COO

The car that
sums up his era
From the streets
of Mumbai to the
roads of London,
the EcoSport SUV
is a one­size­fits­all
global model: the
holy grail for
carmakers.

A former telecommunications
executive and private equity
head who spent five years as
an officer on a navy destroyer,
Mr Akerson was a surprise
choice to run the US’s biggest
carmaker.
But three years into the job,

he has turned the company
round. He has drawn on a
strategy of blending his
financial acumen and
management skills with

automotive knowhow from a
close­knit team of lieutenants
with decades of experience.
The unconvinced say much

of GM’s success has been
down to a revived US car
market and products
developed before his arrival.
Still, sales are robust and

the company made $39bn in
revenues last quarter, up
4 per cent from the same
period in 2012.

Long live such
quaint customs
From Mr Peter Wheadon.
Sir, I was intrigued by your

editorial “In for the count” with its
subheading “Arguments for
scrapping UK census do not add up”
(September 3). From it I learnt that
in Britain there is a census and that
it is based on a “10-yearly
confidential survey that Britons have
been compelled to fill in for more
than two centuries”. Amazing! Over
here in Denmark there is no such
thing as a census, nor any
compulsory survey confidential or
otherwise. Britain is indeed special.
Long may these traditions of survey
and census last, just like countless
other wonderful traditions such as
MPs voting by walking through
lobbies and being counted by tellers!

WTCmemorial fails in its first duty
From Mr Michael Burke.
Sir, As your striking front page

photograph illustrated (September 5),
the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre
must be remembered, even as the
last of its survivors passes on.
To ensure that it would never be

forgotten, the French people have
preserved the town’s ruins as the
Nazis left them, June 10 1944. To
this day visitors can walk past
and gaze upon the razed church
and post office; the doctor’s car.
Signs posted about state cryptic
messages such as: “Here six
innocents were murdered. Collect
your thoughts.”
The memorial demands we

confront the crime and our
obligations in response.
Compare this to what we have

done at the billion-dollar, eight-acre
“National September 11 Memorial at
the World Trade Center”. There
every last trace of the attacks has
been eradicated and replaced with
“expressionist” architecture in order
to provide us with a lovely place of
peace and solace. Our only obligation
is to ourselves.
With its gigantic waterfalls and

hundreds of pretty little trees, all
magnificently lit at night, the
memorial is an impressive sight.
However, by wiping the site clean
of its history, it fails in its first
duty: to remind visitors, now
and for generations to come, to
never forget and to resolve never
again.

Youth unemployment is Germany’s most telling statistic
From Mr Bruce Mathers.
Sir, Adam Posen’s article on

Germany’s problems (“Germany is
being crushed by its export
obsession”, September 4) raises a lot
of questions: whether ever-increasing
university education is desirable;

whether growth in productivity
expressed as a percentage is
meaningful; why German fixed
investment, which is considerably
higher than the UK’s, is considered
too low. Surely the most telling
statistic, which subsumes all of

these, is the rate of youth
unemployment. As one of the very
few countries in the world to hold
this below 10 per cent, can Germany
really be described as “crushed”?
Bruce Mathers,
Zug, Switzerland

A peculiar position in the global business cycle
From Dr Carsten-Patrick Meier.
Sir, By joining the choir

bemoaning Germany’s trade
surpluses (“Germany is being
crushed by its export obsession”,
September 4), Adam Posen confesses
a disturbing misconception of
Germany’s recent macroeconomic
record and the role of its labour
market reforms.
You may recall that the allegedly

export-obsessed country ran a
current account deficit over all of
the 1990s, right up until 2001. Note
further that this deficit was the flip
side of the surge in residential and
corporate investment triggered by
unification, mass immigration from
eastern Europe and the deregulation
of the post and telecoms sector,
which further fuelled the already
rampant stock market hype. When
this post-unification investment
bubble finally burst, highly indebted
companies and households and a
tattered banking system went into
balance-sheet repair mode. No

recourse to low productivity growth
is needed to explain why from 2001
onwards domestic demand and in
particular investment was sharply
damped – the more so since the
newly inaugurated European Central
Bank rightly set interest rates for
the booming eurozone higher than
the Bundesbank would probably
have set it for “the sick man of
Europe”, as Germany was called at
the time.
It was under these weak domestic

conditions, with the unemployment
rate heading north of 12 per cent,
that German politicians at last found
the courage to cut back the worst of
the disincentives to work introduced
during the expansion of the welfare
state some 30 years ago. These
“Hartz” reforms were deliberately
aimed at improving the conditions in
the labour market; they were
intended to lower “reservation”
wages and increase labour demand.
The particular target was the
demand for low-skilled labour that

had effectively been shut out from
the labour market by high contract
wages – and its reintegration into
the labour market since necessarily
implied low average productivity
growth. Undoubtedly, the wage
moderation that followed meant a
sharp improvement in German
international price competitiveness.
However, this is not evidence of
Germany’s obsession with exports
but, again, a result of its peculiar
position in the global business cycle:
while its bubble-struck domestic
economy was weak, the rest of the
eurozone, the Anglo-Saxon world and
some of the emerging economies
were in the midst of an investment
boom. That boom, too, turned out to
have been just another bubble, in
2007 – interestingly, the year that
also saw the German trade surplus
(as a percentage of gross domestic
product) peak.

Comparisons
seldom edify
From Mr Geoff Loram.
Sir, With reference to Lucy

Kellaway’s column “A cure for the
pangs of cyber comparisons”
(September 2): the novelist Francis
Brett Young, in his verse history of
Britain The Island – a fascinating
book – put these words into the
mouth of James Thomson, the 18th
century Scots poet:
“Sir, comparisons may sometimes

illustrate, never prove and seldom
edify.”
A wise sentiment worthy of

remembrance by wordsmiths, of
which noble calling I am but a
modest apprentice.

Reserve currency: the three downsides
From Prof Marie Christine Duggan.
Sir, Rod Price writes (Letters,

September 4): “I struggle to see any
downside for the US in having a
monopoly on printing the world’s
currency.” I would like to point out
three downsides for US citizens from
having the dollar as the global
reserve.
First, inflows of foreign funds into

US financial sector tend to reduce
interest rates, providing incentive for
US households, government, and
business to take on debt.
Second, US assets are thereby

lower risk, which tends to increase
global demand for US assets. Rising
sales of US financial assets to
foreigners cause the dollar to
appreciate, and hence make US
manufacturing and service exports
uncompetitive internationally,

undermining the industrial base.
Third, the dollar reserve grows the

US financial sector, which, given also
deindustrialisation, leads to rising
income inequality.
If the dollar were no longer the

reserve currency, Americans would
have lower levels of personal debt,
less government debt, and businesses
with less debt. The US
manufacturing base would tend to
revive, and income inequality would
decline.
Yes, there would be losers. My own

retirement plan would plummet in
value if the dollar were no longer
the reserve. However, my children
and my students would benefit from
the better quality of life.

Excluding India’s
rural economy
From Mr Kavaljit Singh.
Sir, Your editorial “A good start by

India’s new broom” (September 5)
misses an important segment of the
inaugural statement made by
Raghuram Rajan, the new governor
of Reserve Bank of India. In another
major policy reversal, he is freeing
the domestic banks from seeking
permission from the RBI to open a
branch anywhere in the country.
Under the existing branch

authorisation policy, opening of
branches in metropolitan areas and
tier 1 cities (with a population of
100,000 and above) requires prior
permission from the RBI. This policy
was introduced by the RBI to
address the growing urban-rural
asymmetries in the post-liberalisation
period. There was a secular decline
in the absolute number of rural
branches between 1994 and 2006
while the branches in metros
proliferated from 5,839 to 11,799
during the same period. The
proportion of credit flow to rural
areas has declined substantially
since 1991.
Currently, the top 10 urban centres

(Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore
and the like) account for 49 per cent
of total deposit and 60 per cent of
total credit in India. How can the
rural economy grow if banking
services are highly concentrated in a
few metros and cities?
Left to themselves, banks would

prefer to open more branches in
metros and will “cherry-pick” the
most profitable businesses and
affluent customers. The recent
experience also shows that the
urban-centric banks are reluctant to
provide banking services to the
urban poor and low-income segments
of society.
This policy move may further

accentuate the existing asymmetry
and could undermine the ongoing
financial inclusion programmes to
provide accessible and affordable
banking services to the unbanked
population.
I do not need to remind the new

governor that financial inclusion is a
necessary precondition (not an
option) for sustainable and inclusive
growth in a country such as ours.

America’s heart is in the city once again

My former Brooklyn home wasonce almost demolished tomake way for a baseball sta-
dium. Walter O’Malley, the former
owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, drew
up plans to raze a couple of hundred
townhouses and plonk a new stadium
on top. When refused by Robert
Moses, then New York’s legendary
city planner, O’Malley moved the
Dodgers to Los Angeles.
That was in 1957, when the Dodgers’

Italian-American fans had started to
abandon Brooklyn and move to the
Long Island suburbs. O’Malley
thought if he sited the stadium by the
Long Island Rail Road station at
Atlantic Avenue, it would be an easy
journey. It was at the start of the
decline of New York that culminated,
amid street crime and urban derelic-
tion, in near bankruptcy in 1975.
These days, of course, no one would

think for a second of knocking down
several streets of brownstones in Park
Slope (the Barclays Center basketball
stadium has since been erected on old

railway yards nearby). Young families
are not heading eagerly to Long
Island and New Jersey any more –
they want to remain in hipster Brook-
lyn if they can afford it.
New York’s astonishing urban

revival since the 1980s, culminating in
bankers with children transforming
Tribeca into “Triburbia”, has turned
Brooklyn neighbourhoods such as
Park Slope, Cobble Hill and Fort
Greene into the new suburbs. For mil-
lennial parents, commuting into the
city from a detached house in Westch-
ester is a poor second best.
Whatever happened to the suburb,

the postwar phenomenon that made
the US a country of low-density hous-
ing, suburban sprawl based on driving
instead of walking – an archipelago,
according to author Leigh Gallagher
(a child of the suburbs), of “little
marching bands and soccer leagues,
bake sales and PTA meetings”?
The “inner city” – once a sinkhole

of deprivation – is the place well-off
professionals want to live. When Jane
Jacobs wrote The Death and Life of
Great American Cities in 1961, advo-
cating the virtues of high-density liv-
ing and little shops, it was a rear-
guard action. That fight is over.
There are still swaths of suburbs

(and, beyond them, the “exurbs” of
Orange County, California or Phoenix,
Arizona). There is also Detroit, whose
inner core faces demolition for want
of a better idea. But the US is becom-
ing positively European in its enthusi-
asm for high-density living.

Gallagher, a business journalist
most at home discussing the econom-
ics of city dwelling and quizzing
housebuilders, never quite answers
the question of why things changed
but does provide clues. One is that the
suburbs went too far – Brooklyn
Heights, one subway stop across the
East River from Wall Street, was once
considered a suburb but some Orange
County commuters slog through a
three-hour traffic jam to work.
Demographics also changed the cal-

culation. In the New Jersey commuter
town where Gallagher’s parents lived,
it was common to have four or five
children. Now, the US relies on immi-

gration for new workers – today’s
young parents settle for one or
two kids, and do not require huge
yards and pools. By 2025, families
with children will form only a quarter
of US households.
Perhaps because Gallagher wants to

keep the book light and entertaining,
which it is, she has little to say about
“white flight” and the ways in which
some suburbanites in the 1970s were
not simply seeking a little slice of

heaven beyond the city but were
abandoning neighbourhoods as black
and Latino residents moved in. US
development is far more fluid than in
Europe because there is more space to
move outwards, and ethnic and racial
segregation has financial effects. In
the past, the exodus drained property
tax revenues from inner cities, caus-
ing downward spirals into poverty
and crime. Now, they are spiralling in
the other direction.
Gallagher identifies the 2008 bust as

a turning point – when homes in
desirable city neighbourhoods held
their values much better than
McMansions in Florida and California.
But subprime sprawl was also a symp-
tom of people being forced to venture
ever further to find affordable hous-
ing. “Please tell me it has a happy
ending,” the chief executive of a sub-
urban developer pleads to Gallagher.
She does her best to provide one –
after years of angst about the death of
the US city, the corpse has sprung to
life and is looking sprightly. City liv-
ing is healthier, more sociable and
more environmentally sustainable.
But when prices rose in US suburbs,

you could always build another one.
Despite the “new urbanist” movement
to build city-like suburbs, there is
only one Fort Greene, or Center City,
Philadelphia. The new renovated shin-
ing city upon a hill is awfully expen-
sive.

The End of the
Suburbs
Where the American Dream is Moving

By Leigh Gallagher
(Portfolio Penguin, $25.95)

The challenges
facing Australia
Abbott’s term will be bumpier than his easy electoral stroll

Tony Abbott did not have to do all
that much to win this weekend’s
general election in Australia. The
leader of the conservative Liberal-
National coalition ran a tight cam-
paign, staying clear of the gaffes
which have marked his two-decade
long political career. But it was the
endless infighting within the rul-
ing Labor party which convinced
the electorate to back a man they
never truly loved.
Last June – a mere two months

before the vote – Labor replaced
Julia Gillard, party leader and
prime minister, with her predeces-
sor Kevin Rudd, whom Ms Gillard
had herself back-stabbed in 2010.
The party’s continuous splits over-
shadowed its reasonable record in
office. Helped by China’s demand
for its coal and iron ore, Australia
was the only major rich economy
to escape a recession during the
financial crisis.
The economic outlook facing Mr

Abbott will be far tougher. China
is moving towards a consumer-
driven model of development and
commodity prices are tumbling.
Australia can no longer rely on its
mining sector to keep the economy
going. Unemployment, which
has been hovering around 5 per
cent, is edging up. As fiscal reve-
nues shrink, it will become
harder to keep the budget deficit
in check.

Throughout the electoral cam-
paign, Australia’s new prime min-
ister has been remarkably vague
over his economic plans. The con-
servative coalition first vowed
they would close the budget deficit
within their first year in office,
only to then tone down that prom-
ise. Australia’s net debt is only
12 per cent of gross domestic prod-
uct. There is no need for a precipi-
tate fiscal tightening which could
put further strain on growth.
Mr Abbott was much clearer on

his intention to scrap a carbon tax
and a levy on miners’ profits, both
introduced by Labor. Here, his
instincts are wrong. It is better to
tax pollution than investments and
work. The government has the
right to claim a share of the gains
companies make by exploiting
Australia’s hidden treasures.
On foreign policy, the anglophile

new prime minister is widely
expected to strengthen Australia’s
ties with the US and adopt a more
cautious approach towards China.
But Mr Abbott needs to thread
carefully. Australia depends on
Washington for its military secu-
rity. But China will remain a key
commercial partner even as it
rebalances away from its resource-
driven model.
Having strolled to an easy elec-

toral victory, Mr Abbott will have
a bumpier road ahead in office.

Colombia’s peace
Curiously, it is going better in Havana than in Bogotá

After 50 years of conflict, peace in
Colombia has never been so close
nor seemed so far away. Ten
months ago, the government of
President Juan Manuel Santos
opened peace talks with the Marx-
ist Farc guerrillas in Havana.
Progress has been slow. Officially,
only one item on a six-point
agenda has been agreed. Mean-
while, Mr Santos faces serious
peace problems at home. Late last
month, he sent in troops after a
farmers’ strike spiralled out of con-
trol, leaving two dead in Bogotá.
Inevitably, there has been talk of a
“Colombian spring”.
A better comparison is with Bra-

zil’s street protests, which also
tapped into a mood of public dis-
content. What started on August
19 as a series of disparate protests
by small farmers seeking state sub-
sidies snowballed after it was
joined by striking truck drivers,
students, the odd anarchist, indige-
nous groups and anyone else with
an axe to grind.
Some of those axes are eco-

nomic. Growth has slowed. Trade
liberalisation has coincided with
rapid currency appreciation, ham-
mering domestic producers – espe-
cially the artisanal agricultural
sector.
Paradoxically the peace process,

although popular nationally, is not
helping: as the fog of war lifts,

Colombia’s other ills, especially
inequality, are more fully revealed.
The less well-off are galled by the
conspicuous consumption of the
well-to-do.
Yet much of the discontent is of

Mr Santos’ making. His handling
of the protests was ham-fisted; at
first he dismissed the farmers’
strike as irrelevant. He has a gov-
erning style that critics compare to
the tango – heading first one way,
then another. The perception is he
lacks direction, which is further
boosted by a sense the peace talks
are bogged down. His approval rat-
ings have slumped to 21 per cent,
the lowest for any president in a
decade.
This does not mean that it is all

over for Mr Santos, though. He
will probably seek a second term
in next May’s elections to see
through the peace process. Taking
Brazil’s example, his ratings could
bounce back. The economy is still
growing at a 3.5 per cent clip. And
the Havana talks are probably
going better than they seem. The
Farc, although a potent force, is at
a strategic dead-end. It also knows
that the best chance of a peace
deal lies with Mr Santos. Still, reel-
ing in that deal is akin to landing
a whale. In the meantime, as
recent events show, there will be
much thrashing about and fishing
in troubled waters.

Rush and repent
UK government should withdraw lobbying legislation

The British government’s conces-
sion on Friday night to revise its
controversial lobbying bill by
amendment was a tactical deci-
sion. By responding to legitimate
concerns over the threat it posed
to free speech, ministers hoped to
ensure rapid passage through the
House of Commons this week. The
retreat is welcome. But it fails to
resolve other flaws in a hastily-
drafted bill which, as it stands,
should be rejected.
The revised legislation will do

little to shed light on the relation-
ship between politicians and those
who seek to influence their deci-
sions. Barely 1 per cent of lobbying
will be captured because the bill
exempts vast swaths of the indus-
try from disclosing meetings with
ministers or officials. That alone
would be reason enough to
demand it be withdrawn.
But the government is also seek-

ing to deal a blow to political oppo-
nents by tacking measures on to
the bill that curb non-party cam-
paign spending and widen the
range of activities that should
come under the cap. Aimed at
restraining the big trade unions,
the measure threatened to prevent
charities, blogs and other interest
groups from campaigning on pol-
icy issues during an election year.
The government’s amendment

goes some way towards closing

this dangerous loophole. But there
are still concerns over the uncer-
tainty created by the requirement
to include activities such as rallies,
media and staff costs in the spend-
ing cap, rather than just political
material such as leaflets.
It may make sense to widen the

definition of what constitutes elec-
tion campaigning. Yet the speed
with which this bill is being
pushed through parliament means
that there is little clarity over how
the rules should apply to different
types of activity. The independent
Electoral Commission has also
criticised the lack of pre-legislative
scrutiny. The government has
acted with undue haste, simply in
an effort to ensure that the law is
in place a year before the general
election. This is not good lawmak-
ing.
The bill should be withdrawn.

Campaign measures should be
decoupled from the lobbying pro-
posals and considered independ-
ently. In any case, legislation
affecting political funding and elec-
tions should be the subject of
cross-party agreement.
A delay should also provide an

opportunity to revise the lobbying
proposals. Making sure that public
policy decisions are open to
proper scrutiny will resonate more
with voters than hasty partisan
coups.

Investors, train your attention on the US budget balance
From Mr Philip Pilkington.
Sir, Your article “Clash of the

Cape crusaders” (Analysis,
September 3), while very
illuminating, nevertheless does not
address how Robert Shiller’s Cape
index might be used to forecast
future medium-term stock market
movements. Dr Shiller hints at this
where he says of earnings: “The
sense is that they are unsustainable.

They grew at about 2 per cent per
year over the last 150 years. When
they suddenly shoot up, in the
middle of a financial crisis, you
wonder.”
In a guest post on your FT

Alphaville blog (“Playing profit with
the stock market”, July 1), I laid out
strong empirical evidence from the
Jerome Levy Forecasting Center
which indicated that abnormally

high earnings growth in the US since
the crisis has been due to the
expansion of massive government
deficits. With the scent of
sequestration in the air, I would
suggest it is on the government
budget balance that investors train
their attention.

COMMENT

The arithmetic of Germany’s election points to instability
The reason for this lies in a

combination of the fiddly arithmetic
of German elections and the balance
of power in the Bundesrat, the upper
house of parliament where the
regional states are represented. Right
now there are five parties in the
Bundestag, the lower house. On the
centre-right are the Christian
Democrats of Angela Merkel, the
chancellor – who sit as one group
with their Bavarian sibling, the
Christian Social Union – and the
liberal Free Democrats; to the left
are the Social Democrats, the Greens
and the Left party. The latest polls
suggest a sixth party might also
have an outside chance of joining
them: the Alternative für
Deutschland, the only party that
favours an exit from the euro.
The polls have been favouring a

narrow majority for the present
centre-right coalition of CDU and
FDP. But these parties do not have a
majority in the Bundesrat and, given
the electoral cycle for state elections,
such a majority will be elusive for at

least another three years. It is hard
to see how the present coalition
could govern, especially as I would
expect that should the SPD remain
in opposition they would be much
less supportive of Ms Merkel’s
eurozone policies than they were in
the outgoing legislature. The SPD
rank and file would be sorely
tempted to defy the party’s mostly
centrist leadership and move left to
embrace more populist positions.
The alternative favoured by many

is that typically European
arrangement: a grand coalition of the
two biggest parties that sees almost
everyone end up on the government
benches. The CDU and the SPD
would have a comfortable majority
in both houses of parliament.
A grand coalition would only occur

if the CDU and FDP fail to get a
majority. This inturn implies that
the parties of the left have a
majority in a five-party parliament.
The latter is only a hypothetical
majority because the SPD has ruled
out a coalition with the Left party –

for now. But the Social Democrats
could change tack during the
parliamentary term. So, Ms Merkel
would have a partner who could bail
out at any time to form a three-way
coalition of the left, or a two-party
minority government with the
Greens, tacitly supported by the Left
party. The latter has been tried at
regional level, where it has been a
great success for the SPD. The
temptation for the party to end Ms
Merkel’s reign at some point in the
next four years will be hard to resist.
I do not believe that the SPD

would form a three-party coalition of
the left right away. To do so would
be dishonest after the promises the

party has made. This leaves as the
two most probable scenarios either
an unstable government of the
centre-right, which has no majority
in the upper house, or an unstable
grand coalition, which could fall
apart at any moment. Neither might
survive a full term.
What does this mean for the rest

of Europe? In the first scenario, the
German government will have even
less room for manoeuvre in the
eurozone crisis. A grand coalition
may look more pro-European – but
be careful what you wish for.
Gridlock may swiftly return as a
permanent threat of new elections
hangs over such a coalition. Soon we
might hear again that we have to
wait until after the next German
elections.
The only scenario in which you

can see any form of stability is one
where both the AfD and the FDP
win more than 5 per cent of the
votes, the threshold for
parliamentary representation. Then
the Bundestag would have six parties

Gridlock may swiftly
return and soon we might
hear again that we have
to wait until after the
next German elections

and neither the CDU and the FDP,
nor the SPD, Greens and the Left
would have an absolute majority. In
that case, the grand coalition would
be the only option – and it would be
stable. None of the partners would
have an incentive to leave. It would
be similar to the grand coalition of
Ms Merkel’s first term in 2005-09. The
problem with that is long-term. The
AfD might become a stronger force,
pushing the CDU to a more
eurosceptic position.
The ultimate irony is that a

necessary precondition for a
continuation of Ms Merkel’s current
policies – whatever you may think of
them – is the election of an anti-
European party. If the AfD fails to
clear the 5 per cent hurdle – which
is what most observers, including
me, expect – then it is hard to see
any constellation that delivers
stability to German politics. The next
four years promise to be very
different from the last.

It has become the receivedwisdom of Europe’s politicalclasses: until the German general
election later this month nothing
much will happen – and then, hey
presto, at 12.01am on September 23,
the world will be a different place.
Do not get your hopes up. Rather

than delivering a momentous
breakthrough, opening the way for
movement on the crisis still gripping
Europe, I see the real gridlock
starting right at that moment.
Instead of looking at the impact of
the German elections on Europe, we
should look at the impact on
Germany. On the basis of the polls,
even allowing for plenty of statistical
wiggle room, it is hard to conceive of
a scenario in which Germany could
end up with a stable government for
four years. There is only one such
scenario I can think of – but this is
at present not considered a high-
probability event.

China will stay the course on sustainable growth
Instead, we must take a holistic
approach in pursuing steady growth,
structural readjustment and further
reform.
Reform remains the driving force.

We will continue to streamline
government and delegate power,
press ahead with structural changes
and grow economic sectors under
diverse ownership. Government will
leave to the market and society what
they can do well while concentrating
on those matters within its purview.
We will advance reforms of

administrative management, fiscal
and tax systems, financial sectors
and pricing. The theme of this year’s
Summer Davos Forum is “Meeting
the Innovation Imperative”. To me
this means not only technological
but more importantly institutional
innovation, and reform is also a way
of innovation.
Opening up at a faster pace gives

impetus to development. We will
continue to support the Doha round
of World Trade Organisation talks,
work for the signing of bilateral free
trade agreements, upgrade the China-
Asean Free Trade Area, and provide
a level playing field and a better
legal environment for foreign

investors. We will explore new ways
to open China to the outside world,
and Shanghai’s pilot free-trade zone
is a case in point.
A key focus is the expansion of

domestic demand. Here China enjoys
one great advantage: its 1.3bn people
are keen to work hard in pursuit of
a better life and make up a huge
domestic market. We will expand

consumer demand through initiatives
such as the promotion of the IT
sector through the expansion of
broadband and 4G licences.
While focusing on consumption, we

will keep a reasonable scale of
investment with priority given to
energy conservation, environmental
protection, railway projects in the
central and western regions, and
municipal facilities.

Urbanisation also offers huge
potential for long-term domestic
demand. Of the people living in the
countryside, more than 100m are set
to be absorbed into cities over the
next decade or so. This will be an
extremely complex process of
economic and social change,
requiring a new policy approach
aimed at balanced development.
There will be many difficulties, but
it is what we must accomplish in
order to narrow the urban-rural gap.
The service sector will be an

increasingly important pillar of our
economy. As the biggest job
provider, the sector helps ease
employment pressure in economic
transformation. The government will
improve public services. This year,
we have suspended value added tax
and sales tax on many small
businesses, the majority of which are
in the service sector.
Our government has defined the

“upper and lower limits” of the
reasonable range of economic
performance with a view to avoiding
excessive fluctuations. With a gross
domestic product growth rate of
around 7.5 per cent, the “lower limit”
is intended to ensure steady growth

and employment. The moderation of
economic growth from double-digit
figures in the past to 9.3 per cent in
2011, 7.7 per cent in 2012 and then to
around 7.5 per cent this year, is the
result of both natural economics and
our readjustment initiatives.
With the consumer price index at

around 3.5 per cent, the “upper
limit” is meant to prevent inflation.
If our economy is kept within this
reasonable range and financial risks
are effectively forestalled, markets
and society will have stable
expectations. This year there has
also been steady economic progress.
In the first half of this year, GDP
grew by 7.6 per cent year-on-year.
Surveyed unemployment at around
5 per cent and inflation at 2.4 per
cent are both within the reasonable
and manageable range. However,
global uncertainties remain.
The anticipation of the withdrawal

of quantitative easing by some major
developed countries has led to a
massive influx of capital back to
developed markets and big
fluctuations on the stock and
currency markets in many Asian
countries.
Some observers even worry about

Asian countries have
learnt the lessons from
the past and enhanced
their capabilities to
fend off risks

Li Keqiang

F ive years on from the start ofthe financial crisis, manycountries now face new
challenges as the world economy
slowly recovers.
The Summer Davos Forum, which

opens this week in Dalian, will be
closely watched for signs of the state
and strength of the Chinese
economy, which finds itself at a
crucial stage of transformation.
Observers ask whether China’s

economic slowdown will lead to a
sharp decline – or even a hard
landing – and whether our reform
programme will be derailed by
complex social problems. My answer
is that our economy will maintain its
sustained and healthy growth and
China will stay on the path of
reform and opening up.
Shortly after it took office in

March, the new Chinese government
made clear its policy was to sustain
economic growth, improve people’s
wellbeing and promote social equity.
We can no longer afford to continue
with the old model of high
consumption and high investment.

was no room for ambiguity. Mr
Obama’s credibility was at stake.
The White House’s widely leaked

plans were precise. The US was to
launch punitive strikes on Syria
within days – lasting 48 hours and
with 43 targets already identified, not
including the presidential palace. It
would have likely been over by last
Monday.
The rush to action was why David

Cameron, the UK prime minister,
recalled members of parliament early
from their summer holiday (although
not enough of them, it turns out). Mr
Obama’s Hamlet had turned into
Henry V. There was no time to lose.
Alas, Mr Cameron’s humiliating

defeat triggered an astonishing lapse
of judgment by Mr Obama – his
decision to seek authorisation from a
hostile Congress. Now we are
reassured that there is no hurry
whatsoever to strike Syria. The
Pentagon can easily monitor
chemical weapons movements on the
ground.
Whichever way Congress votes,

earth-shaking consequences are
predicted for US global power:
should Mr Obama gets the approval
he seeks, the US could get sucked
into a Levantine quagmire, say the

Last week, was arguably theworst of Barack Obama’spresidency. If the wheels arenot to come off it altogether,
this coming one will need to be
among his best – starting on
Tuesday night with his address to
the nation about Syria.
It is hard to understand how an

instinctively cautious president in
his fifth year could have manoeuvred
himself into such a dismal corner.
But his largely self-charted route
lends little confidence that he can
easily escape it.
In the next 10 days or so we will

find out if Mr Obama will get the
chance to recapture his presidential
mojo. That – and the fact that he
would share the fallout with
Congress for whatever complications
a Syria strike would present – is the
best that can be said for a “Yes”
vote. A “No” would irretrievably
weaken Mr Obama both at home and
abroad. It would qualify as one of
the costliest gambles in US
presidential history.
How exactly did Mr Obama reach

this point? It is a question that
befuddles even those who know the
president well. No one doubts Mr
Obama has always been sincere in
his desire to avoid military
engagement with Syria. As a young
politician from Illinois, he owed
much of his meteoric rise to the fact
that he opposed “dumb” wars,
starting with Iraq. His signature
foreign policy since coming to office
has been to end America’s wars in
the Muslim world and rebalance the
country towards Asia.
Even when he was cornered last

year by Hillary Clinton, the then
secretary of state, David Petraeus,
then director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, and Leon
Panetta, then defence secretary, Mr
Obama rebuffed their advice to take
a tougher stand against Bashar al-
Assad.
Very reluctantly the White House

agreed earlier this year to step up
small arms supplies to moderate
Syrian opposition groups. But it was
little more than a press release since
none has yet arrived.
Then came the August 21 chemical

attacks in a suburb of Damascus, by
far the worst that Mr Assad’s forces
have carried out. The attacks
occurred exactly a year and a day
after Mr Obama first mentioned his
chemical weapons red line. There

alarmists; if he is rebuffed, America’s
global standing could collapse.
Both views are exaggerated. In the

first, it is hard to imagine Mr Obama
would ever agree to occupy Syria.
The Senate version of the resolution
for action explicitly forbids US boots
on the ground. In spite of his
rhetoric, the president only intends a
“shot across the bow”. That may be
naive, or misleading. But this is
probably not a Vietnam in the
making.
Likewise, if Mr Obama lost the

vote in Congress, the US would still
have by far the most powerful
military in the world. And it would
no more have embraced isolationism
than Britain had become the new
Switzerland.
Yet the consequences for Mr

Obama’s grip on power could hardly
be more real. Before the chemical
attacks, Mr Obama was already
facing a rocky session on Capitol Hill
with the threat of a government
shutdown and another debt ceiling
crisis.
Add to that the Republican party’s

plans to link approval of a higher
debt ceiling to a defunding of Mr
Obama’s signature healthcare law
and an ugly autumn was assured.

Now it looks much worse. The
Syria vote will make the rest of the
agenda far harder to manage. None
of Mr Obama’s advisers agreed with
his decision to seek Congress’s green
light on Syria. Some, such as John
Kerry, the secretary of state, were
not even consulted. The methodical
Mr Obama nevertheless threw
caution to the winds.
And there lies the nagging source

of concern. Mr Obama has always
been his own chief foreign policy
adviser. Unlike the economy, where
he has generally deferred to advisers
– sometimes to a fault – on global
affairs, Mr Obama trusts his
instincts. It is hard to find too many
others who strongly share that faith.
If Mr Obama gets the approval he

seeks, it will be presented as a
significant victory. In reality, it

In my view, Asian countries have

to more flexible exchange rate
regimes, stronger foreign exchange

various bilateral financial
arrangements, China is confident
that Asian countries are now better
placed to cope.
China is still a developing country

with a myriad of tasks and
challenges. Yet as China’s national
strength grows steadily, it will
assume greater responsibilities and
obligations in international affairs
commensurate with its own
conditions. We will work with other
countries to promote global peace
and development. I look forward to
the day when the world economy

impetus to the global economy.

Events disrupt
Fed timetable
Harold Macmillan, the former British
prime minister, described the main
risks facing his government as
“events, dear boy, events”, writes
Gavyn Davies. Investors no doubt
feel the same way about the US
Federal Reserve.
A week ago, the immediate path

ahead for the Fed seemed to be well
mapped out. The FOMC would taper
its asset purchases in its September
17­18 meeting, and completely end
them in mid­2014. It also seemed
increasingly certain that Lawrence
Summers would be nominated to be
the next Fed chairman and that the
ratification process would end in time
for him to take office on February 1.
Both decisions have been thrown into
doubt.
The primary culprit is the lacklustre

jobs report for August. Non­farm
payrolls growth has dipped, and the
decline in the unemployment rate to
7.3 per cent has been driven mainly
by a fall in the labour participation
rate. The new jobs are also largely in
the low­paid sector so consumer
spending is still subdued.
Will the Fed deem this to be the

“substantial” improvement in the
labour market which it says it needs
to justify tapering? It would be
surprising if the FOMC altered course
on the basis of one month’s jobs
data, and the onset of tapering has
been absorbed with only a moderate
shock to the system. At the
weekend, the consensus seemed to
have shifted towards a minor
tapering this month (reducing asset
purchases from $85bn to $75bn).
What about Mr Summers? Apart

from personality and tribal politics,
he seems to annoy the liberal wing
of the Democrats on three main
grounds: he is seen as unfriendly to
stricter regulation, sceptical about
quantitative easing and likely to
cause bond yields to rise.
The Summers camp has

started a process of correcting
“misperceptions” in these areas,
arguing that the differences between
Mr Summers and the current
Bernanke orthodoxy are very minor.
If Mr Summers could have only

one supporter, the president would
seem to be a good place to start. Mr
Obama will not take kindly to being
told by Congress that he must think
again. But the events of the past
week show that there is much work
to be done before a Summers victory
can be declared.

BUSINESS EDUCATION

School alliance to tackle healthcare issues

If business schools are to meet
increasing demand for healthcare­
focused management education, they
will need to join forces. This is the
thinking behind the Business School
Alliance for Health Management, a
non­profit consortium of leading US
business schools. Members include
Harvard Business School, Kellogg
School of Management, the Wharton
school at the University of
Pennsylvania and the Yale School of
Management.
To help address the shortfall in

academics capable of teaching MBA
programmes to healthcare
professionals, BAHM is developing a
teaching faculty network. It also runs
doctoral student “webinars”.
The alliance has recently launched

a journal, Healthcare Management,
Policy and Innovation, intended to

present research and ideas on
improvements in management
practices and public policy.
The journal fills an important gap,

says Kevin Schulman, director of the
health sector management programme
at Duke University’s Fuqua School of
Business, an alliance member.
“If you submit your papers to

clinical journals, they say it’s too
business­focused. If you submit them
to business journals, they say it’s too
healthcare­focused.”
Guiding BAHM’s activities is the idea

that management education, when
applied to healthcare delivery, can
accelerate innovation. Prof Schulman
says this means encouraging senior
physicians and administrators to look
at business processes and solutions
outside their sector that could be
applied to healthcare.

Lessons in
management
are just what the
doctor ordered

Seismic demographic, politicaland economic shifts aredemanding radical changes toglobal healthcare systems.
With administrators under pressure

to cut costs, physicians being pushed
to work more collaboratively and new
technologies in need of commerciali-
sation, the skills acquired on an MBA
look increasingly relevant. For busi-
ness schools able to offer the right
courses, this is a big opportunity.
“Clearly you need skills in entrepre-

neurship, in how to be innovative and
in how to scale something up in a
cost-effective way,” says Regina Her-
zlinger, a Harvard Business School
professor widely recognised for her
healthcare research. “Those skills are
not traditionally taught on healthcare
administration courses – those are
skills that business schools focus on.”
The need for business innovation in

healthcare has never been so urgent.
In Europe, cash-strapped governments
with ageing populations are strug-
gling to meet demand for increasing
levels of care without pushing up
spending. In response, the drive is for
greater efficiency and collaboration
between different practitioners and
specialists. “The healthcare system is
about much more than just treating
patients,” says Steve Chick, head of
the Healthcare Management Initiative
at Insead, which runs executive pro-
grammes for practitioners and policy
makers. “The co-ordination of care is
critical and that’s where business
schools can play a big role.’
In the UK the severe budgetary

squeeze on the National Health Serv-

ice at a time of increasing demand for
healthcare means NHS leaders need
to do more with less.
“The current decade . . . is present-

ing those leading healthcare with the
biggest challenges we’ve seen since
the establishment of the NHS,” says
Chris Ham, chief executive of the
King’s Fund, a leading healthcare
think-tank.
Meanwhile, emerging markets –

many of which are still combating
infectious diseases and infant mortal-
ity – face an additional burden in the
rising incidence of conditions such as
cancer and diabetes.
Perhaps the most radical changes

are taking place in the US. Healthcare
in the country – public and private –
is now 17.9 per cent of GDP, against
9.3 per cent in the UK, according to
data from the World Bank.

Sweeping reforms in the US under
the Affordable Care Act are reshaping
care delivery and health insurance.
With costs rising and mergers creat-
ing supersized hospital groups, a once
fragmented industry is increasingly
made up of large networks requiring
accomplished leaders.
“There will be more positions

within those systems that will attract
MBA talent and for which their skills
are relevant,” says June Kinney, asso-
ciate director for the MBA in Health
Care Management at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton school.
The transformation of US health-

care systems is changing the kinds of
candidates institutions are looking
for, says Andrew Chastain, managing
partner at Witt/Kieffer, an executive
search firm focusing on healthcare.
Consolidation and reforms are gener-
ating demand for executives skilled in
operations, finance, supply chain
management and IT.

Consolidation is also bringing to an
end the days when senior healthcare
executives were responsible for man-
aging everything from operations to
finance and strategy. “Those are get-

ting sucked up to corporate, as you’d
see in any market that starts to con-
solidate,” says Mr Chastain.
If positions for mainstream MBA

graduates are growing in the health-
care sector, an increasing number of
medical professionals are looking to
pursue a health-focused MBA.
With its MBA Health Sector Man-

agement programme, The Fuqua
School of Business at Duke University
is among a number of schools offering
MBAs – some run jointly with medical
schools – designed for healthcare pro-
fessionals. At Harvard Business
School’s Health Initiative, an MBA
caters to students from fields such as
biotechnology, pharmaceuticals insur-
ance and public health, and the school
has several courses on entrepreneur-
ship in healthcare. More recently,
executive programmes have been
emerging. Indiana University’s Kelley
School of Business has just launched
a two-year Business of Medicine MBA
for practising physicians who are
moving into leadership positions.

But if they are to keep up withthe sector’s growing demandfor management education,business schools will have
to expand dramatically the number
and type of programmes they offer
healthcare professionals. This will not
be easy. Given the highly specialised
nature of healthcare and the range of
professional roles it encompasses –
from surgeons to insurance brokers –
schools will find it tough to recruit
faculty staff capable of teaching the
necessary skills.
“The challenge for business schools

is to take what they know and adapt
it to healthcare,” says Prof Herzlinger.
“What’s needed is a lot of specific
knowledge.”
A cultural shift will also be required

before the MBA becomes a degree to
which doctors or health administra-
tors naturally turn. In the US, health-
care management education is largely
provided by schools of public health
and healthcare administration, not
business schools.
In the UK, says Mr Ham, relatively

few healthcare leaders have opted for
a business school course. “Histori-
cally, MBAs were not seen in the NHS
as having value,” he explains.
Academics and policy makers

believe this needs to change. And
given the sector’s size (it is the big-
gest employer in some markets) and
the challenges it faces, management
education could play an important
role in equipping the next generation
of leaders and introducing new busi-
ness models to healthcare systems.
“This is a huge opportunity for busi-

ness schools,” says Prof Herzlinger.
“There’s a serious mismatch between
what the people who are changing
healthcare need and the kind of edu-
cation that’s being provided.”

Demographic and
economic shifts in global
healthcare systems present
business schools with
vast opportunities,
writes Sarah Murray

MBAs help to bring vaccines out of the cold

By Peter Pramstaller

Doctors are struggling. They see
themselves as victims in a work-
place that has been taken over by
bureaucrats, paperwork that has
replaced time spent with patients,
and a demand that they place eco-
nomics above patient care.

Medicine has turned from a craft
into a business. But doctors are not
trained to run businesses. This dis-
connect means doctors have been
pushed aside. To regain control
over their professional lives and the
future of their profession they need
business training.

Doctors need to be managers and
supervisors as well as diagnosti-
cians. They need the kinds of skills
that business students learn.

What is needed is business educa-
tion that touches doctors at all lev-
els and is integrated into the profes-
sion. In the 21st century every doc-
tor needs this kind of training,
whether as part of residency train-
ing or as a set of tools that can be
taught without the need for a full
MBA programme – and the time
and expense that would entail.

Thinking needs to change, other-
wise business training will never be
at the top of any doctor’s agenda.

about a third of French graduates currently work
overseas, three years after graduation. Overall, as

cohort find work abroad, principally in the UK,

Harvard students have
used research into silk
protein to develop a
business that could save
lives, says Della Bradshaw

Some of life’s most significantmeetings are serendipitous. Soit was for Livio Valenti. He wasworking in Cambodia with the
UN when he met a professor from
Tufts University, Boston who was
developing ways of using the protein
in silk for medical applications.

When Mr Valenti subsequently took
up his place at Harvard’s Kennedy
school to study public policy, he
caught up with the professors con-
ducting the silk research at nearby
Tufts’ biomedical engineering school –
David Kaplan and Fiorenzo Omenetto
are leaders in the field.

Events snowballed when Mr Valenti
then met fellow students in a Harvard
Business School class called “Com-
mercializing Science”. They drew up
a business plan to develop a range
of vaccine products that could
potentially save thousands of lives.
Mr Valenti is now vice-president of
policy and strategy for Vaxess, the
company they created.

The problem
Many vaccines are sensitive to tem-
perature and must be stored either
frozen or at a temperature of between
2C and 8C.

This presents three problems, says
Michael Schrader, who graduated
with a Harvard MBA in 2012 and is
now chief executive of Vaxess.

“One out of every five people in the
world fails to receive basic vaccines,”
he says. This can be for political or
financial reasons, but it can also be
down to logistics. Cost is the second
problem, especially the cost of the
‘last mile’ for vaccines that need to be
kept cool.

And third, there is the problem of
spoiled vaccines. Not only are the vac-
cines rendered ineffective because of
problems with storage, it is also diffi-
cult for those administering them to
know which doses are spoiled.

mostable for extended periods, allow-
ing it to be transported without the
need for refrigeration. The technology
can work with existing vaccines, such
as measles, mumps and rubella, or
with those still in development.

How the company was developed
All four of the original founders of
Vaxess – the name comes from the
company’s strategy to improve vac-
cine access – have now graduated and
taken up positions in the company.
Scientist Kathryn Kosuda is vice-
president of R&D and lawyer Patrick
Ho is vice-president of licensing and
regulatory. They are now hiring staff.

Vaxess says that the Tufts profes-
sors are happy for the company to
represent the technology and develop
links with pharmaceuticals companies
and NGOs such as the Gates Founda-
tion.

Vaxess has won three business-plan
competitions, including the 2013 HBS
Alumni New Venture Competition.
This gave the company $160,000 in
funding. In May Vaxess raised $3.75m
in first-round financing, a deal that
will support the company for the next
two years.

What next?
The group will push ahead with the
development of thermostable vaccines
while working on the business model
and looking for additional funding.

There is now a consensus among
vaccine producers that they need to
get the vaccines to as many people as
possible as quickly as possible, says
Mr Schrader.

“There is a new paradigm in global
vaccines.”

Nonetheless, it will take five to six
years to get the thermostable vaccines
to market.

business skills

Desmond Tutu and
Nelson Mandela are
all considered by Kim

BUSINESS LIFE

The shoe shop,
the walkout and
the online fallout

Until last month, Niki, Jessand TJ worked at a shoestore in a Rochester, NewYork shopping mall, where
they passed their days inserting
children’s sweaty feet into new pairs
of trainers. But then, en masse, they
resigned. On a giant piece of paper
they composed a letter to their boss
that began: “Dear Jamie, Since you
decided to say ‘cancer is not an
excuse’ and swear at your employees
like you do ALL the time . . . WE
QUIT.” They pinned the letter to the
shop window and walked out.

The story might have ended there,
were it not for the internet. Someone
took a photo of the shut-up shop – a
Journeys outlet – and posted it on
Reddit. Thousands of supportive
comments poured in and the story
went viral. “You abuse your roll
[sic]” the letter went on, in a round,
childish script. “We Aren’t Allowing
it ANYMORE.”

Hooray, I thought. Power to the
people! Who needs a trade union
when you have the internet? Niki
and her colleagues more than
compensate for any weakness in
spelling by the strength of their
courage. The three of them are
modern day martyrs, sacrificing
themselves to a good cause. Their
letter is a warning to all companies

that obnoxious middle managers not
only kill morale, they are a danger
to their reputation and their brand.

Just as I had worked myself up
into a lather of indignation, the story
took on a new turn. Jamie and
sources-close-to-Jamie surfaced online
peddling their own counter-
allegations about Niki, Jess and TJ.

To try to find out what actually
happened I called Journeys HQ
where a woman directed me to an
online statement that said the
company was investigating the
matter. Having been thus unhelpful
she added: “Thank you! Have a great
day!”

As I put down the phone I
marvelled at my own naivety in
having expected anything good to
come from this sort of thing. Perhaps
it was because I had seen The Sound
of Music on stage the night before,
and the memory of Captain von
Trapp’s transformation from a man
who summoned staff with a whistle
to a softie singing “Edelweiss” was
too fresh in my mind. When it comes
to making people behave better, the
internet is much less powerful than
a trainee nun with a guitar case. It
is far too big and too blunt a tool to
improve conditions at work.

An amplified battle on social
media is no way to settle a matter

that may be quite nuanced. Indeed,
there is no sign that viral acts of
revenge by departing employees
leave any lasting marks on the
companies they are aimed at –
though they may make the person
who carried them out rather less
employable than they were before.

The culture at Goldman Sachs
bears no visible scars from the
savage quitting of Greg Smith, who
wrote an op-ed in the New York
Times the day he left calling the
bank’s culture “toxic” and
“destructive”. For an hour or two,
the world listened: Goldman’s market
value dropped by $2bn. But then the
bank fought back. The only upshot
was that Mr Smith got a book deal –
even so, by the time the book came
out, no one much cared.

There are other cases too. There
was Joey, the smiling guy in the red
shirt who worked at the Renaissance
Providence Hotel. When he quit the
job he loathed in 2011, he took a
brass band with him when handing
in his notice. Four million people
viewed the stunt on YouTube, but
even then nothing happened. Joey
made a follow-up video recently,
claiming that conditions at the hotel
had got still worse, but by then only
10,000 could be bothered to watch it.

Then there was Steven Slater, the

steward at JetBlue Airways, who
was so fed up with rude customers
that he ejected himself from the
aircraft through an emergency chute
on to the tarmac. The result? He
became a minor celebrity, but also
got a criminal conviction.

We all love such dramas. Everyone
at some point in their working life
fantasises about flouncing out, so we
are thrilled when anyone actually
does it. Yet as an audience we are
brutal and capricious. The reason the
internet can never be a trade union
is because we don’t care enough to
follow through.

In the case of Niki and Co, I would
have left it there. But I’ve just seen
the following corporate waffle on the
company’s website: “Journeys gives
YOU the chance to be YOU. We
celebrate individuality and creativity.
The stores offer a high-energy,
customer service focused vibe. Our
employees are passionate and
energetic about what they do and it
shows.”

Guff like this makes me
determined to stick it out. I will
leave it a month, and then try to
find out what has happened to Niki,
Jess, TJ and Jamie. I’ll keep you
posted.

Fight director
Terry King

Getting into a fight seems
easy enough, but acting is
another story. As a fight
director, I choreograph
fighting scenes for the
stage, television and film,
involving everything from
swords to knives and fists.
Each job is different.

Sometimes I work
with actors
separately, while
some directors
want the fight
constructed
blow by blow
on set. While
ensuring safety
and accuracy is
important, the key is
capturing the ethos of the
story and characters. Are
they cowardly? Honourable?
Afraid?
Even if a character is bad

at fighting, the actor must
be good at it, in the same
way that an actor must
play a boring character
without being boring. So a

big part of my job is
discovering how to get each
actor engaged in the scene.
I mostly do stage work

with companies such as the
National Theatre and the
Royal Shakespeare
Company, and am currently

working on the Spanish
Golden Age season
at the Ustinov
Studio in Bath.

I have no
background in
fighting. After
going to drama
school, I

climbed
mountains for 10

years. One day I was
in the office of an agent I
knew when their fight
director cancelled. I said I
could do it. I thought it was
something I was getting
away with for a few days,
and 25 years later, I’m still
at it.

The job

The careerist

Working alongside an
underperformer can be
frustrating, especially
when you have to pick
up the slack and your boss
does not appear to notice.
What can you do?

Are they really slacking?
Business psychologist
Karen Moloney says it is
“worth asking whether
you’re exaggerating
matters or should be
more tolerant. We’re all
very different people and
you can’t expect everyone
to meet your exact
standards. Some people
enjoy working 12-hour
days and stress others out
because they can’t
understand why they
don’t.”

She adds that people
often use the wrong
yardsticks to gauge the
quality of input. “If you
measure work done by
the hours you put in and
then complain to your
boss that a colleague is
lazy, you can get in a
terrible pickle if you
discover the person in
question is very talented
and only needs to work
until six.”

Is it really a problem?
“The key issue is does it
matter,” says John Lees,
a career coach and author
of Just The Job! “You
need to look at the costs
and benefits. By raising
the issue, you will create
conflict and can come
across as a whinger. If
you do only 5-10 per cent
more than them, it might
be better just to pick up
the slack.”

Being objective is
essential. “Are you letting
your perceptions that
they’re a bit lazy colour
the way you see them so
you write off everything
they do?”

How can I change things?
Put aside your
resentment, says
executive coach Rebecca
Alexander. “The other

person might be
overworked or lack
confidence.”

Rather than confront
them, she suggests you
try and help. Try steering
them towards tasks to
which they are more
suited.

Mr Lees adds that you
may wish to draw
personal boundaries and
define points where you
let things drop. “For
example, if it is a report
and you and they were
meant to do half each,
you could just say, ‘Sorry,
I’ve done my half’.” What
you must not do, he adds,
is allow yourself to be
pushed into doing more
than you already do.

If you decide to
confront them, however,
you need evidence, says
Ms Alexander. “Build up
examples and take notes
– so that they can’t just
turn around and deny it.”

Should I take it to the
boss?
“The problem with
speaking to your manager
is that they should
already know what’s
going on – and they won’t
like people who tell
tales,” says Ms Alexander.

Mr Lees adds that you
cannot turn back the
clock once you have gone
down this route. “If you
do this, you’re crossing
the Rubicon and saying ‘I
can’t manage these things
unassisted’. It doesn’t
make you look good.

“If you do speak to
your boss, you might say,
‘I’ve tried X, Y and Z
already, which at least
makes it look like you’ve
made an effort to resolve
matters’.”

Again, he adds, it is a
good idea to approach
your boss with evidence,
rather than just saying:
“This person is lazy.”

Having an underperforming colleague

influence came to the fore last year
when The League for Internet Safety,
his new non-profit organisation, suc-
cessfully lobbied for the creation of an
internet blacklist, whereby the govern-
ment bans websites deemed harmful
to children.

Some associates of Mr Malofeev
believe this type of influence is what
has helped him survive the controver-
sies and the fraud investigation
unscathed. Others believe that he
spun a myth of his own influence and
connections, allowing for his meteoric
rise in the business world despite no
direct links to Mr Putin.

“He’s 39 years old and 10 years ago
he was no one,” says one colleague.
“You can come up with your own
judgment.”

Born in the Moscow suburb of Push-
chino in the officially atheist Soviet
Union, Mr Malofeev says he found God
– and his business acumen – during
his childhood, most of which was
spent bedridden from a serious illness,
at times in a children’s hospital. “We
would lie in bed 20 boys in a row, 20
girls in a row. You lie next to these
people 24 hours a day . . . It was a
school of life.”

He became involved in religion
through literature and began going to
his local church in Pushchino, where
he still attends weekly liturgy.

Mr Malofeev went on to study law at
Moscow State University. After work-
ing as a lawyer, he soon switched to
banking at Renaissance Capital after
realising this would allow him to
make “more than four times the
money”.

After a decade in banking, he
founded Marshall Capital Partners in
2005. But a deal with a baby food com-
pany called Nutritek soon started to
raise questions about the fund.

According to testimony by VTB in
London’s High Court, Mr Malofeev
helped a recently created company to
secure a $230m loan but was both the
buyer and the seller in the deal – a
claim Mr Malofeev denies. One year

pursuing VTB for damages related to
a worldwide freezing order that the
London court had placed on his
assets. He is optimistic about the out-
come. “We’re currently in negotia-
tions [with VTB] and I hope we’ll
reach an agreement soon,” he says.

Meanwhile, Axa and the US fund
Paul Capital were both bought out of
Marshall Capital by a Russian fund
called Aton, after which they with-
drew their complaints against Mr
Malofeev.

Though Mr Malofeev remains a wit-
ness in the fraud investigation,
his business prospects are on the
rise. His 10 per cent stake in Rostele-
com – acquired when his friend Mr
Shchegolev was Russia’s telecoms
minister – is set to go up in value
ahead of an expected merger with
another mobile operator, and the com-
pany’s planned privatisation by the
Russian state in 2016.

Mr Malofeev says he is nowtrying to devote less timeto business and more topublic service. This sum-
mer he flew to Sydney to give a
speech at an international family val-
ues conference about Orthodox Rus-
sia’s duty to unshackle the west from
liberalism.

“Like the [western] Christians that
helped us to overcome communism 30
years ago, now it is our turn to give
back to you and help you with family
and Christianity.”

While Mr Malofeev’s faith has earnt
him the nickname “the Orthodox busi-
nessman”, it is not necessarily one he
lives up to. “In a monastery you can
live according to the laws of morality
but in the real world you run up
against that law,” he explains. “I abso-
lutely consider myself Orthodox and
try to be a good Christian. But I of
course also believe that a person
working in business cannot say that
he does not sin doing business. In my
opinion that is practically impossi-
ble.”

With his monk-like visage –dark hair, slightly shaggybeard – Konstantin Malo-feev could be a dead
ringer from Father Zosima from The
Brothers Karamazov.

That is, if it were not for the
designer clothes and luxuriously
appointed Moscow office.

But as rare Tsarist maps and reli-
gious icons gleam down from the wall
behind him, the enigmatic Mr Malo-
feev seems to have no trouble balanc-
ing his apparently conflicting perso-
nas. He founded Russia’s largest pri-
vately run Orthodox charity and is an
advocate for the country’s 128,000
orphans as well as a confidant of
Father Tikhon Shevkunov, a monk
with close links to Vladimir Putin,
Russia’s president.

But as the millionaire founder of
private equity firm Marshall Capital
Partners, Mr Malofeev also has a repu-
tation as a ruthless businessman who
has been accused of defrauding state-
owned lender VTB of $200m. Though
he has never been convicted of wrong-
doing, he remains a witness in a Rus-
sian federal investigation.

Separately, Mr Malofeyev has been
accused of mismanaging the money of
French insurer Axa, once a lead inves-
tor in Marshall. Axa withdrew its com-

plaints after it was paid an undis-
closed sum for its shares.

One former business associate
describes Mr Malofeev as “a modern-
day Rasputin”, another as a cunning
businessman “who can sell sand to
someone inside the Sahara”. Both
asked not to be named.

Mr Malofeev denies any wrongdoing.
In a conversation that bounces from
biography to business to religion, he
shows off both his knowledge of his-
tory and his charm.

Where critics take issue with his
financial success and business tactics,
Mr Malofeev does not see a problem.
“Both poverty and wealth come from
God,” he says. Besides, he continues,
the laws on earth and those in heaven
do not always overlap. “You can fol-
low all the laws on earth, be the most
law-abiding citizen and end up in hell
because you have vices . . . Conversely
take [Oskar] Schindler’s list. Schindler
broke all the existing laws in Hitler’s
Germany – he broke the criminal laws
that were against Jews. But did he act
with his conscience? He did.”

Mr Malofeev is one of several
prominent Orthodox business and
political leaders who are enjoying
increasing influence in the second
Putin era, as conservative and Ortho-
dox beliefs gain greater influence over
legislation. A key figure in this circle
is Vladimir Yakunin, the head of Rus-
sian Railways and a close ally
of Mr Putin since the president was
mayor of St Petersburg in the 1990s.
Another is Alexander Provotorov, who
is poised to become head of Russia’s
fourth mobile operator, due to be cre-
ated later this year. A third is Igor
Shchegolev, a top aide to Mr Putin in
the Kremlin.

Mr Malofeev, however, rejects the
idea that a religious clique exists
within the elite. “There is no Orthodox
club where we all get together.” But
he admits that no wealthy Russian
businessman has succeeded without
the help of personal connections.

later, the new owner of Nutritek fell
behind on its payments and VTB says
it learnt that the baby-food company’s
assets had been grossly overestimated
and were worth just $35m, or nearly
$200m less than originally estimated.

The revelation started a string of
difficulties. Shortly after VTB took Mr
Malofeev and others to court, Axa
began complaining to Russian author-
ities that the money it had invested in
the fund had not gone to the intended
investment but to Mr Malofeev’s
acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in
Rostelecom, Russia’s state telecoms
group.

The scandals culminated last
November when Russian authorities
raided Mr Malofeev’s home and offices
in connection with the VTB fraud
case. Yet in the nine months since
then, the controversies appear to have
settled down. A London court in Feb-
ruary threw out VTB’s lawsuit
against Mr Malofeev, arguing that the
case should be heard in Russia, not

‘4.30pm’
(2007) by
Alex Katz

lively and simplified, and anticipate
ambitious abstracted seascapes such
as “4.30pm” – three bands of colour
and a few blocky white boats which
fix forever one late afternoon on the
Maine coast. Light is as directly
caught in large-scale drawings such
as “Study for Summer Triptych” and
“Miami Beach”: “It’s the
instantaneous light, if you get it
right then you get it in the total
present tense . . . that’s eternity,”
says Katz. But as the drawings show,
that surface brilliance in his
paintings is hard won.

To October 13, www.visitmima.com

Few artists insist so defiantly on
surface as Alex Katz. His lucid,
inviting paintings of beautiful
people in beautiful places are not
only flat and hard-edged as posters,
but use fashion – a floppy hat, a
bobbed haircut – to freeze the
passing moment. “Style is the
content of my painting, and style
belongs to fashion. Fashion is the
immediate present and that’s
what I’m really after . . . to
maintain that present-tense feeling,”
he says.
What then is beneath the surface?

Mima’s show expands on last
summer’s excellent Tate mini-
retrospective Alex Katz: Give Me
Tomorrow to explore how the artist
uses drawing. Ranging across 60
years, it includes collages, sketches,
watercolour and ink washes, and
preparatory cartoons, mostly from
Katz’s own collection, displayed
alongside paintings, to consider his
enduring concerns: light, time and
social situations.
Beguiling charcoal depictions of his

wife and muse Ada, his daughter-in-
law Vivien and Vogue editor Anna
Wintour compel as studies for

celebrated recent portraits. A series
of energetic, abbreviated notations in
marker pen for the reflective
monumental landscape “Black Brook”
demonstrate the primacy of drawing
as Katz considers composition and
proportion. Crisp black ink sketches
explore gestures between people and
the balance between distance and
intimacy – how a reclining figure
sits up to watch another leave the
scene, how a pair of bathers hold
each other – which is so finely
modulated in paintings such as “Ada
and Edwin on the Beach”.
Collages experimenting with layers

of horizon line, water and sky are

So it has happened. After
118 years a woman
conductor has stepped up
to take charge of the Last
Night of the Proms for the
first time. It was impossible
to miss the significance of
the event: the welcoming
cheer was huge and
somebody had thoughtfully
fixed to the conductor’s
rostrum a big, pink balloon
proclaiming “It’s a girl!”
That Marin Alsop would

carry off the assignment
with such panache could
have been confidently
predicted from the outset.
“I’m shocked that it can be
2013 and there are still
firsts for women,” she said
in her closing speech. But
at last the taboo has been
broken and Alsop’s joie de
vivre guaranteed a Last
Night that would be
celebratory in high style.
All the traditional

favourites were there, even
if “Rule, Britannia!” was
shorn of its companion sea
shanties. The flags waved
as ever, with the four flags
of Brazil, Russia, China and
India prominent in the
arena – surely a BRICs first
at the Last Night?
Always adapting and

growing, the Proms are
themselves flag-bearers for
the future of classical
music. More concerts were
broadcast on television this
year than in any previous
season and it was especially
gratifying to see cameras
filming the chamber music
Proms at Cadogan Hall for
the BBC website. Online
access to the Proms is
growing. In years to come
we will surely be talking
about a world audience, if
we are not already.
Overall, this Proms

season was of a decent
standard, distinguished

by some unforgettable
highlights. Prime
among those was
the first
complete
performance of
Wagner’s Ring
cycle in a
single Proms
season with

Daniel Barenboim and his
Staatskapelle Berlin
keeping up an exceptional
standard over the four
nights. New music was also
unusually strong, with full-
scale works from
composers as diverse as
Thomas Adès, Naresh
Sohal, Helmut Lachenmann
and Nishat Khan.
By contrast, the line-up

of international orchestras
was somewhat thinner. On
Thursday, the Orchestra
Sinfonica di Milano
Giuseppe Verdi honoured
its titular composer in his
bicentenary year with a
first half of Verdi arias
sung by tenor Joseph
Calleja, sounding less than
his usual wholehearted self.
Xian Zhang conducted a
heartfelt, but sometimes
slack performance of
Tchaikovsky’s “Manfred”
Symphony. ★★★☆☆
On Friday, Lorin Maazel

and the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra
brought star quality to the
penultimate night. It is
impossible to go wrong
with the Viennese
orchestra’s glorious playing
in Bruckner, but Maazel
turned the Symphony No.8
into severe blocks of sound,
when some human warmth
would have been nice. An
imaginative first half
brought solo Bach organ
works, played by Klaus
Sonnleitner, organist at the
monastery of St Florian in
Austria, where Bruckner
also served and is buried.
★★★★☆
The Last Night itself

was light-hearted and
commendably fast-moving.
Anna Clyne’s fizzy
Masquerade, a BBC
commission, made the
perfect Last Night premiere.
The star singer was
American mezzo Joyce
DiDonato, who looked a
million dollars and sounded
it, too, especially in “Over
the Rainbow” (she was
born in Kansas, land of The
Wizard of Oz). Violinist Nigel
Kennedy kept toes tapping
with his Czárdás. And over
all presided Alsop, at once
a live-wire conductor and
authoritative master of
ceremonies. What firsts will
the BBC Proms have in
store for 2014? ★★★★★

www.bbc.co.uk/proms

It was a “one, two” victory moment
at Venice. The result of the 70th
Mostra del Cinema was: Italy won,
Taiwan too. Gianfranco Rosi’s Sacro
GRA, a documentary about lives
lived on or near the Grande
Raccordo Anulare (Rome’s ring
road), took the Golden Lion, by a
rumoured whisker, from Tsai Ming-
liang’s Jiaoyou (Stray Dogs), a poetic
drama about poverty and fatherhood,
praised in my last dispatch.
Each film had friends and foes.

Each prize announcement drew a
mixture of cheers and boos. Some
critics, including this one, thought
Taiwan had been robbed. (A
colleague darkly muttered about
Italian chauvinism on a Bertolucci-
led jury.) But Sacro GRA had its real
and passionate cheerleaders. Like
past Rosi films blending ethnography
with quirky character portraiture –
Boatman (India), Below Sea Level
(American desert), El Sicario
(Mexico) – his Rome docu-odyssey
gathers idiosyncratic momentum and
a clutch of fascinating cameos.
The fallen aristocrat rents his

castle for erotic photonovel shoots.
The eel fisherman philosophises
about eels and the River Tiber. The
paramedic hastens between accident
victims. As memorably as any, the
tree expert drills palms for weevils
and catches the shrieks of larvae on
his digital recorder. Meanwhile his
voice dances on, atop ever more
whimsical tightropes of metaphor
and simile. “It’s an orgy. It’s a
corrupt feast. It’s like the chatter of
humans in a restaurant . . . ”
Tsai took his runner-up Special

Jury Prize for Jiaoyou with a good
grace. “May I say something?” he
addressed the jury. “I love you all.”
The world will soon be able to love
his film, a kind of madly lyricised
Lear of the Taipei underworld.
Both these prizes could be happily

lived with. There was a louder stir of
rebellion when the awards-night
goodwill enhanced by a Best Actress
prize handed to elderly Elena Cotta
for Italy’s Via Castellana Bandiera –
a cleverly crafted study of

neighbourhood ferment during a set-
to between women drivers – was
squandered by two prizes flattering
Greece’s Miss Violence. This black
comedy-drama about incest grows
cruder and more contrived as its
story goes on. Somehow it won Best
Director for Alexandros Avranas and
Best Actor for Themis Panou,
playing a Cesare Borgia of the
Athens petite bourgeoisie.
Britain’s Philomena, a critics’

favourite, won Best Screenplay for
Steve Coogan (also starring) and Jeff
Pope. They audio-linked their thanks
from Toronto, where the Stephen
Frears-directed film about a
baby-robbed mum (Judi Dench)
“rediscovering” her son has moved
on to warm more festival hearts.
Britain had a polarised movie

presence at Venice. Everyone loved
Philomena. Everyone (almost) hated
The Zero Theorem by honorary Brit
Terry Monty Python Gilliam.
Likewise everyone praised Steven
Knight’s out-of-competition Locke, an
ingeniously scripted drama set in a
car pounding along night motorways,
and almost everyone except Brits
abhorred Under the Skin, from

Jonathan Sexy Beast Glazer.
More chauvinism? Non-UK

reviewers practically disembowelled
Glazer’s art/horror flick: a piece of
posturing sci-fi hokum starring
Scarlett Johansson as an alien
stalking single men, to their
apparent deaths, in Scotland.
Monotonous gloom; malnourished
script. For some reason British
critics found a whole lot to like.
Locke deserved its plaudits. Here is

another great spring forward from
the man who invented Who Wants to
be a Millionaire? and scripted
Frears’s Dirty Pretty Things. Now he
secures a wallop of a performance
from Tom Hardy, the only person on
screen for 90 minutes. Welsh-
accented, Hardy plays an agonised
man in the process of leaving his
wife for the bedside of a birth-giving

mistress. He is also dumping his
next-day work date as site manager
at “the biggest concrete-pour in
Europe”. As he fields car-phone calls
from aggrieved or ballistic parties,
his life atomises before our eyes.
What could be more dramatic while,
simultaneously, more minimal in
spectacle and resource?
Which brings us to the Venice

Film Festival. This year’s event
looked a little as if it was counting
its euro cents. I am worried by the
unchanged design kitsch in front of
the Palazzo del Cinema: last year’s
exploding-armadillo motif, with the
same scarlet scales bearing the same
sponsors’ names. I am worried about
the promised super-auditoria
that don’t materialise. I am
worried . . . Well, put it this
way. Dear Mostra del
Cinema: do you need help?
We think we should be told. We
think you are too valuable to lose.
Too valuable to Venice, to cinema, to
culture lovers, to the world.

an enjoyable experience, but not one
that fulfils its potential. The plot is a
cautionary tale for our times: a pushy
property developer moves into the
area with designs on knocking down
the local shops and building a shiny
new complex. But the locals, fearing
loss of livelihood and local character,
mount a protest.
It’s a good soap subject: a serious,

contemporary issue (gentrification of
an area) brings moral dilemmas for
the characters. What the project lacks
is what soap operas usually have:
time. Storylines that might work over
a long period can only be sketched
out here and the episodic televisual
soap format means scenes are
delivered, sometimes literally, on the
run and are a bit hit and miss.
But it is performed with warmth

and vivacity by the non-professional
cast. There are eyecatching
performances from Kola Bokinni as a
confused teenager, Kemi Lofinmakin
as a big-hearted hairdresser,
Christopher Glover as a put-upon
shopkeeper and Kevin Sevilla as his
irrepressible assistant. Directed by
Ola Animashawun, this interesting
enterprise might be worth revisiting,
as it raises more questions than it
has time to answer.

www.royalcourttheatre.com

The soap opera has become a
cornerstone of popular culture, but
just how authentic are the wildly
event-laden lives of all those
everyday folk? The Royal Court
explored this question over the
summer as part of its Open Court
festival. Ten playwrights, led by Bola
Agbaje and Rachel De-lahay, worked
with local people in Peckham, south
London, to create a pastiche soap
opera drawing on daily life around
them. The result was aired in bite-
size pieces nightly at the Bussey
Building in Peckham, then drawn
together, in true soap opera style, in
an omnibus edition: it’s that version
that now reaches the Royal Court.
It’s a mischievous, light-hearted

project, but also one that raises
serious questions about the way
“ordinary” people are portrayed and
that plays around engagingly with
form. In Peckham there were people
from the community performing, in

the community, a soap opera about
that community. At the Royal Court
a further layer is added, as that
bustling community is now evoked
through projected photographs, with
the audience sitting in a mocked-up
living room.
These are great ideas, and had the

team had longer – both to work on
the show and then to deliver it – they
might have been able to dig deeper
into them. As it is, what emerges is

Rich Lesser took over as CEO of
Boston Consulting Group, one of the
world’s leading management
consultancies, at the start of this
year, having previously been
chairman of its North and South
America business. A chemical
engineer, he holds an MBA from
Harvard Business School and worked
in product development at Procter &
Gamble before joining BCG in 1988.

Edited highlights of a video interview
with FT.com appear below.

What are the key things chief
executives need to be thinking about
on a five­year view?
The first is the reshaping of the
global economy. Asia, and I would
say the rest of the emerging
markets, are going to take a much
higher share of global growth.
Second, the rate of disruption and
change from technology is
enormous . . . staying ahead of the
technology wave is incredibly
important. Third, the need to be
adaptive is incredibly important.
This classic model of “if I set a
strategy and I just run with it for
three or five years” – that’s not the
world we’re in.

Does this mean we need a new kind
of corporate leadership?
I think we do . . . in the sense that
historically a lot of leadership was
founded on knowledge and judgment.
In today’s world knowledge will be
the easier part. The ability to draw
insight from knowledge, the ability
to project leadership down the
organisation, to create diversity
within the leadership team, and to

VIDEO ON FT.COM

create more responsive, faster worlds
that are ambidextrous, that can
operate in the developed world and
in the developing world, that can
operate in established markets and
still be investing in new models and
new ways of growing. That will be
incredibly important.

People are talking about a US
manufacturing revival. Is this for real?
We’ve been talking about that . . .
going back three or four years. While
the US, along with the developed
world, will continue to [have] higher
labour cost than the emerging
markets, that gap is closing as wages
rise in China faster than they are
here. Second, there continues to be a
huge productivity advantage for the
US – very productive and very
flexible. Companies like investing
here because they have the flexibility
to redeploy investments as their
business changes. And then on top of
that we now have the . . . revolution
that’s under way in shale gas. If
you’d have asked us a couple of years
ago we’d have said there will be a
reshoring wave. We would now say
it’s actually reshoring plus export
growth that we see coming over the
next five to eight years.

Where’s your strategy taking BCG?
Thirty years ago what clients wanted
from us was really thoughtful,
strategic insights and
recommendations. Twenty years ago
it was those insights and
recommendations and the ability to
help them implement it. Ten years
ago it was do those things . . . but
orchestrate broad programmatic
changes across the company. Today,
our clients want those three things,
but they want a fourth, which is to
actually build the capabilities of the
organisation. Because in a world of
more uncertainty and volatility and
change, they need to have adaptive
organisations. So my first
responsibility is to make sure that
we are equipping ourselves in a way
that adapts to what our clients
expect today, not just what they
wanted years ago. I’d say along that
path they also want deeper
capabilities, whether it’s industry
knowledge or functional capabilities,
and they really want a global
footprint.

View from the top

Calm waters can be shark infested.
Earnings at Shanghai’s A-share listed
companies rose 12 per cent from a
year ago, on average, in the first
half. These smooth results compare
well with the flat performance in the
same period last year. The
performance of stocks in Hong
Kong’s benchmark index paints a
similarly tranquil picture. But do not
be fooled: these figures obscure
dangerously poor fundamentals.
The quality of earnings growth is

deteriorating, especially outside the
financial sector. Bank of America
points out that in the first six
months of this year, non-core
earnings contributed more than half
of the Rmb65bn in annual gains in
pre-tax profits of companies listed in
Shanghai. Much of this has come
from investment income, as
companies take advantage of the
squeeze in liquidity in the shadow
banking sector. Large groups can use
their heft to borrow cheaply from
official sources and lend at higher
rates to those without the same
access. Net debt at non-financial
companies is rising.
Moreover, overcapacity, rising

labour costs and the strengthening
renminbi continues to hurt China’s
manufacturers. And this is making it
harder for them to collect cash. The
days it takes companies to collect
cash owed has risen to 35, up by a
quarter in two years, according to
BofA. Inventories are sitting around
for longer, too. Depleting funds is
making it harder to invest in capital
expenditure – growth of which was
flat in the first half from a year
earlier, compared with 7 per cent
growth over the same period a year
ago. (At least this is in sync with
excess capacity.)
The shares of market darlings such

as Tencent reflect the expectation of
sustained growth – on a multiple of
35, it is at a four-year high. The
Hang Seng meanwhile trades on 11
times its forecast earnings, near its
post-crisis low of 10. But the fragility
of earnings among these companies
should make investors hesitate
before leaping into the water.

Broadcom
It is enough to get a value investor
slobbering. A weak short-term
outlook takes a fifth off a company’s
shares. The projections were not
awful – flattish sales in the coming
quarter. But Wall Street was
accustomed to near double-digit
expansion. The beat-up stock now

has a 10 per cent free cash yield.
There is more to any investment

case than buying when sellers have
been made myopic by an ageing rally
and a restive Federal Reserve.
Broadcom, which issued the weak
outlook back in July, is a
semiconductor maker with a $15bn
market value. Its chips go into home
broadband gear (cable boxes and the
like), infrastructure equipment for
phone companies and mobile devices.
Each set of customers contributes
about a half-billion of operating
income annually.
Mobile is the problem. Broadcom’s

historic strength is in chips for WiFi
and Bluetooth communications. Not
only is competition increasing here,
but mobile device makers, seeking
savings in dollars and power
consumption, are moving to “systems
on a chip”, single wafers of silicon
that combine WiFi and Bluetooth
with an applications processor and a
cellular radio. Broadcom has made
the move to SoCs too – witness its
$164m acquisition last week of SoC
technology from Renesas – but it is
in a squeeze. In high-end phones, it
competes with Qualcomm, which has
the advantage of owning crucial
cellular patents. At the low end it
faces MediaTek, a relative newcomer
from Taiwan that already has over
$4bn in annual revenues. The
pressure was apparent in the 22 per
cent drop in mobile profits in
Broadcom’s last quarter.
Both Morgan Stanley and Deutsche

Bank have argued that, at $27, the
shares practically price in the
disappearance of the mobile segment.
Maybe so; but it remains hard to
imagine the shares rallying until the
situation in mobile gets much
clearer. Keep salivating, for now.

Tokyo 2020
Time to tie up your Asics trainers
and reconnect the Nintendo Wii:
Japan is back. That, at least, is what
supporters of Tokyo’s successful bid
for the 2020 Olympics say it will
show, as 1964 marked the country’s
peaceful return to the global stage.
The tricky bit, when Asahi-induced
celebratory hangovers wear off, is
keeping that comeback on track
regardless of the Olympics.
The risk is that hosting the world’s

biggest sporting event proves a
distraction for a country that has
more than enough to be getting on
with. Japan’s energy supply is still
strained following the nuclear
shutdown after the 2011 Fukushima
disaster – where the government is
still fighting to contain leaks of
contaminated water. And its nascent
economic recovery is delicate. If, as
expected, second-quarter growth is
this week revised up from its initial
annualised 2.6 per cent reading, then
a consumption tax rise next April,
from 5 to 8 per cent, is more likely.
If price hikes crush consumers’
tentative revival as in 1997, no amount
of Olympic flag-waving will help.
Tokyo does not plan to splash cash

on these Games, either. The expected
spend on infrastructure and facilities
is equivalent to about 0.2 per cent of
last year’s gross domestic product,
according to Nomura. This is no
1964, when huge projects, including
the first bullet train, were equivalent
to 3.6 per cent of GDP that year. At
least the Olympics should not add
too much to Japan’s worryingly large
debt pile. But these are early days:
the UK initially thought London 2012
would cost less than £3bn but it
came in at least three times that.
Winning the games is not a fourth

arrow in prime minister Shinzo
Abe’s quiver as has been suggested.
Rather it gives a deadline for
measuring the success of his other
three arrows in reviving Japan.
Meeting that would be a real
achievement. But there is nothing
sports fans like more than a good
comeback story.

Architect of UK bank reform says
capital buffers should be doubled
By Patrick Jenkins
in London

The chief architect of Britain’s
post-crisis regulatory reforms
believes banks’ capital levels
should be double the level rec-
ommended two years ago by the
government-appointed commis-
sion that he led.
Sir John Vickers, the Oxford

academic who chaired the Inde-
pendent Commission on Bank-
ing, told the Financial Times
that in a “blue-skies” world
banks’ core tier one capital
ratios would now be 20 per cent,
rather than the 10 per cent rec-
ommended by the ICB that has
become the norm for UK
lenders.
Sir John will set out his ideas

in a speech today at the Regula-
tory Policy Institute to mark the
anniversary of Lehman Broth-
ers’ collapse at the height of the

financial crisis five years ago.
The ICB’s conclusions –

including the commission’s cen-
tral recommendation that the
high-street operations of
broader “universal banks”
should be “ringfenced” from
riskier investment banking
activities – are in the process of
being translated into UK law.
However, the commission’s 10

per cent capital recommenda-
tion is already a de facto reality
for big British banks. Policed by
the Prudential Regulation
Authority – the arm of the Bank
of England that oversees the
sector – lenders today boast cap-
ital levels that are on average
three times higher than before
the crisis took hold in 2008.
Nonetheless, reformers such

as Sir John want to go much
further. He said “the skies are
cloudy” at the moment but once
they cleared policy makers

should further strengthen capi-
tal levels in the banking sector.
Low equity levels, which some

banks burnt through within
days during the crisis, are recog-
nised as one of the key reasons
so many banks failed. An FT
analysis shows it was a princi-
pal cause of meltdown in at
least five of 34 big bank failures.
Sir John’s comments come as

Barclays is set to launch a
£5.8bn rights issue on Friday to
help it comply with PRA
requirements on leverage. The
PRA ran an exercise with the
country’s top eight lenders over
the summer, imposing a 3 per
cent leverage requirement after
factoring in expected loan losses
and other charges. Both Bar-
clays and the Nationwide, the
UK’s biggest building society,
fell short.

Oil wages
set to jump
$100,000
barrier
By Michael Kavanagh
and Vanessa Kortekaas

Average wages in the UK’s oil
and gas sector are set to rise by
15 per cent this year – breaking
through the $100,000-a-year ceil-
ing – as record levels of invest-
ment in eking out Britain’s
reserves create shortages of
trained staff in the industry.
Data compiled by industry

recruitment site Oilandgaspeo-
ple.com suggests that average
salaries will rise from £64,000 to
nearly £74,000 ($116,000) this year
as £13.5bn of total investment is
sunk into reversing the UK’s
declining oil and gas output.
Recruitment company Hays is

also predicting a sharp rise in
salaries that would take average
earnings well beyond the
$100,000-a-year level for the first
time. The forecasts reinforce
previous analysis of employ-
ment trends in the industry by
the global recruiter, which have
pointed to strong rises in sala-
ries commanded by British oil
workers in recent years.
Pay in the industry across the

world has been outpacing
broader wage inflation for sev-
eral years. But recruiters say
the UK market is exceptionally
tight due both to the recent
upswing in activity and the glo-
bal competition for staff, partic-
ularly from emerging markets
and the US shale gas industry.
Gary Ward, a North Sea spe-

cialist at Hays’ recruitment divi-
sion, said: “Several industry
sources are projecting salary
rises of between 12.5 and 15 per
cent over the next year in the
North Sea, which is by far out-
stripping rises over previous
years and other industries.”
Lindsay Wexelstein, analyst at

energy consultancy Wood Mac-
kenzie, suggested tightening
labour market conditions could
persist as $68bn of investment is
expected to pour into the UK oil
industry between 2013 and 2017.
“We are seeing levels of invest-
ment in real terms back to lev-
els seen in the 1970s,” she said.
The average wage of UK oil

and gas workers stood at $93,400
last year, above a world average
of $87,300, which itself was up
8.5 per cent in 2012 and 6 per
cent in 2011, according to an
annual survey by Hays.

Companies

By Paul J Davies in Hong Kong
and Arash Massoudi in New York

Alibaba is prepared to scrap
plans for a $60bn share sale in
Hong Kong and switch its list-
ing to New York if the senior
management cannot nominate a
majority of board directors,
according to people close to the
company.
Founder Jack Ma and other

top executives own little more

than 10 per cent of China’s big-
gest e-commerce company. But
they want to control the
make-up of the board so they
can defend Alibaba’s strategic
direction and culture in the way
US technology groups, such as
Google, have done through dual-
class shares.
Hong Kong listing rules ban

dual-class shares that give more
voting power to a small group of
owners. The local market regu-
lator is expected to stick to its
principles that any corporate
structure has to treat all share-
holders fairly. The stand-off
could see Hong Kong and China
lose one of the world’s most
eagerly anticipated listings

since Facebook, even though
Alibaba has been planning for
months to list on the island.
“The discussion is under way

internally. We would like to be
in Hong Kong, but if we can’t
land comfortably [on the board
structure] New York remains a
viable option,” said one person
close to the situation.
Hong Kong is seen as the nat-

ural home for one of China’s
biggest private companies and it
would be a disappointment for
many to see such a big success
story go to a US stock market.
The company is run by the

Alibaba Partnership, a group of
20 executives in charge of run-
ning the business day-to-day.

The partnership was formed in
2010 to preserve the culture of
Mr Ma and the other founders
long after they have left the
business, according to a person
close to Alibaba.
The rest of the company’s

stock is held by SoftBank, the
Japanese telecoms company,
Yahoo of the US, a handful of
private equity and sovereign
wealth funds and other staff.
The partnership has been

strongly influenced by the aims
that Larry Page, one of the
founders of Google, set out in
his 2004 letter to prospective
shareholders before it listed. Mr
Page and co-founder Sergey
Brin retained control of Google

with a dual-class share struc-
ture that gave them more votes
than any other owners.
As this is not allowed in Hong

Kong, the Alibaba Partnership
wants to nominate a simple
majority of board directors,
which shareholders would then
vote on individually to accept or
reject, according to a person
close to the company.
Alibaba has filed no official

application, but there has been
an informal exchange between
its advisers, Hong Kong Listing
Committee members and the
Securities and Futures Commis-
sion, the regulator.

$60bn flotation

By Andrew Bolger in London

Europe’s corporate bond market
raised a total of nearly $29bn
over the past two weeks, a dra-
matic surge after one of the qui-
etest summer lulls on record.
There were a total of 39

issues, according to figures from
Dealogic, as borrowers sought to
take advantage of low borrow-
ing costs ahead of likely rate
increases.
“There has been a flurry of

activity – people are trying to
front-load issuance, given the
uncertain outlook and prospect
of higher rates,” said Marcus
Baldini of Barclays.
Mr Baldini said investors had

become accustomed to the
increase in rates since the Fed
started talking in May of future
tapering of quantitative easing,
but remained wary that poten-
tial “curve balls” such as the
Syrian crisis might cause future
volatility.
Nestlé, the multinational

packaged food group, last week
demonstrated the market’s
appetite by launching two bond
transactions on successive days
– a $500m, six-year issue on
Tuesday, and a €500m, eight-
year issue on Wednesday. The

previous week Statoil, the Nor-
wegian state-controlled oil and
gas group, which usually taps
the US market, issued a €1.91bn
bond. There were also substan-
tial issues from Orange,
France’s largest phone com-
pany, and Volkswagen, Europe’s
biggest motor group.
Analysts said that investors

had become much more relaxed
about the eurozone story, but
were aware some difficult issues
such as banking reform have
been “parked” until after the
German election on September

22, and could quickly re-emerge.
Suki Mann, head of credit

strategy at Société Générale,
said last week had also seen
unexpected bond issues from
Eni, the Italian-based oil and
gas group; Acea, the Rome-
based utility; and EDP, Portu-
gal’s largest utility.
Mr Mann said that these were

“just the kind of deals” this
market wanted.
“All [are] peripheral deals, all

where the market is receptive
and perhaps highlighting a con-
tinued thawing of investor atti-

tude towards the region, ” he
said.
Analysts said that another

factor driving the bond market
was the continuing reduction of
lending by European banks that
were under pressure to reduce
their balance sheets, which was
forcing companies to look
towards the capital markets.
Denis Coleman, who heads

Goldman Sachs’ European lever-
aged finance business, said he
was confident the bond market
would continue to be busy.
There had been a distinct

change in psychology among
issuers since May, when the
prospect of Fed tapering started
pushing up interest rates, he
said.
“People are suddenly think-

ing: let’s get in before rates get
worse,” Mr Coleman said.
In spite of the summer slow-

down, the European corporate
bond market has raised $416bn
so far this year – a 14 per cent
increase on the same stage last
year.

COMPANIES

Why European equities are starting to look enticing

European stocks, this column has pointed
out before, are not as cheap as they look.
They have dipped in the past few years
because of the sovereign debt crisis, but it
is still reasonable to factor in a risk of
more trouble to come from that quarter.
And while European stocks look cheaper
than US stocks, that is in large part
because they always do: US indices are
stuffed with high-technology companies
that trade on expensive multiples, while
European indices have a lot of dull
dividend-paying utilities.
But there is still scope to argue for a

European buying opportunity. What if
European profits were to take off in short
order? That hope is not as far-fetched as it

sounds and has driven a flurry of interest
in “long Europe”, as funds switch into EU
equities at the urging of brokers.
We can construct such an argument first

by looking at how European profits fare
over the cycle. Over time, profits tend to
revert to the mean, with each peak in the
cycle higher than the one that preceded it.
That is what happened in the US, where
earnings were back above their 2007 peak
by the end of 2011.
In Europe, the sovereign debt crisis

interrupted the cycle. Following the sharp
fall post-Lehman, European profits had
barely made it back to their long-term
mean in 2010 before subsiding once more.
In this respect, the difference with the

US is marked. According to Andrew
Lapthorne of Société Générale, US profits
are now 25 per cent above their 10-year
moving average, while European profits
are some 10 per cent below their trend.
Now add valuation. US indices are

always more expensive but, at present, the
S&P 500 trades at 0.7 times book value
more than the FTSE-Eurofirst 300 – until
the sovereign debt crisis broke out, this

gap tended to be more like 0.5 times. And,
while brokers tend to dislike cyclically
adjusted price/earnings (Cape) ratios (the
subject of much debate in these pages
recently), many happily cite them for
European stocks, because they make
Europe look very cheap. While the Cape
suggests that the US is significantly more
expensive than its long-term mean, it
shows European stocks a full standard
deviation below their mean – a level that
has in the past been a reliable indicator of
strong returns in the future.
Or try to put it together with some

crude technical analysis. “Long US, short
Europe” has been a spectacularly
successful trade, but it now has the look
of being overdone. Since the dawning of
the credit crisis in early 2007, the S&P has
beaten the FTSE Eurofirst by 52 per cent.
Even after the recent flurry of interest in
Europe, US stocks have beaten their
European equivalents by almost
9 per cent for the year so far. It looks like
a trend that is ready to reverse.
Those, then, are the arguments. But

there is still a retort, which boils down in

one word to “Japan”. European growth is
stagnant, and much of the continent is
mired in a serious recession. All of the
arguments above rely on European profits
perking up back to the mean. But in
Japan, after its economy peaked in 1989,
corporate earnings dipped and took 15
years to get back to their peak. Many
times over the past two decades, investors
have plunged into Japan on much the
same investment case that is being laid
out for Europe, only to be disappointed.
This is a critical point, and Karen Olney

at UBS garnered much attention last week
with a five-point note on “Why Europe is
not Japan”. First, she points out that
Europe appears to be in little danger of
slipping into deflation, as Japan did. On a
continent-wide basis, it never suffered a
remotely comparable property bubble
(countries such as Spain are an exception).
Corporate debt, at 40 per cent of equity, is
far below the 123 per cent recorded by
Japanese companies four years into their
slump. Capital expenditures peaked at 22
per cent of gross domestic product ahead
of the crisis – compared with 33 per cent

in Japan in 1989 – so there is not the same
legacy of over-investment. And Japan
started wildly expensive, by any sensible
measure. Europe did not. Assuming that
Europe does not fall into a Japanese-style
morass, Ms Olney suggests that profit
growth of 8 per cent per year for the next
three years – not such a lot to ask – would
be enough to bring Europe back to the
peak profits implied by the usual cycle of
mean reversion.
These are good arguments. On a relative

basis, European stocks offer better value
than the US. (There are exceptions, but
this top-down picture is accurate).
But there remains a reason why Europe

is cheap. Buying European stocks on
anything other than a long-term basis still
involves a bet that Europe’s politicians
make the necessary institutional reforms
to the EU without triggering another leg
to the crisis. That is still not an obvious
bet. If that bet comes off, however,
Corporate Europe has a decent chance of
staging a rebound in profitability.

Technology billionaire
Michael Dell is this week
finally set to win share-
holder backing for his con-
tentious $24.8bn buyout of
the PC company that bears
his name, barring late inter-
vention from dissident
shareholder Carl Icahn.
A change in Dell’s voting

rules looks certain to hand
control to Mr Dell and Sil-
ver Lake Partners, the pri-
vate equity firm backing his
offer, at a vote at a share-
holder meeting at Dell’s
Texas headquarters on
Thursday, say people close
to the buyout and investors
who have pushed for a
higher offer.
The company’s board has

postponed the vote three
times in past months rather
than face defeat. Last
month it bowed to Mr Dell’s
request to change its voting
rules to ease passage of the
deal, in return for an
increased bid and special

dividend payment that
added $400m to the offer.
A legal challenge to the

offer by Mr Icahn, who
owns 8 per cent of the com-
pany, was rejected by a Del-
aware court three weeks
ago after the judge ruled
that the activist investor
had failed to come up with
a firm offer in his own pro-
posals for an alternative
transaction. The special
committee of directors mas-
terminding the deal would
“dance in the streets” if Mr
Icahn topped Mr Dell with a
fully-financed bid, judge
Leo Strine said.
The PC industry land-

scape has declined sharply
in the 13 months since Mr
Dell first took his buyout
proposal to the company’s
board, adding to the risks of
the highly leveraged buy-
out. Mr Icahn and other
investors have accused the
company of overstating its
difficulties to get support
for the buyout.

Glencore Xstrata will extend
cost cutting targets and
reveal revised plans for
spending when the
management of the Swiss
commodities group arrives in
London to sell the benefits
of the largest takeover
completed in the mining
sector, write Neil Hume
and James Wilson.
Glencore faces pressure to

detail the merits of its
$46bn acquisition of Xstrata
after taking a $7.7bn
impairment charge on the
miner’s assets last month.
The writedown contributed

to a half­year loss of almost
$9bn. In the first detailed
presentation for investors
sincethe deal was completed
in May, analysts expect chief

executive Ivan Glasenberg to
tell investors that cost
savings for the deal will be
at least twice the $500m
estimated. Mr Glasenberg
and senior executives will
use the investor day
tomorrow to outline the
strategy and plans for
spending and asset sales at
the UK­listed group.
Analysts believe Glencore

could mothball projects,
including the $5bn plus
Wandoan coal project in
Australia. Mr Glasenberg has
admonished industry rivals
for overspending on building
and expanding mines, which
he says has swamped the
world with raw materials
that have eroded prices and
profits. Investors have also

pressed mining groups to
return more capital rather
than plough it into further
growth amid signs of cooling
growth in China, the world’s
largest commodities user.
Glencore is one of the

world’s most diversified
mining groups, spanning
base metals, energy and
agricultural commodities.
Alongside last month’s

interim results, Mr
Glasenberg said the
integration of Xstrata had
been “a lot quick and faster
than we had envisaged” and
annual synergies would be
“materially in excess of the
$500m promised at the
time of the acquisition”.
That target was made up of
$450m of marketing

synergies and $50m of cost
savings. Mr Glasenberg is
also likely to face
questioning from investors
about the sale of Las
Bambas, a greenfield copper
project in Peru that the
company was told to put up
for sale by Chinese
regulators as a condition of
securing approval for the
deal with Xstrata.
Suitors, including Chinese

mining companies, have
registered interest in the
project, which Mr
Glasenberg has said could
be sold by the end of the
year. RBC expects Glencore
to receive $3bn for Las
Bambas and for part of the
proceeds to be returned to
shareholders.

Shareholders in Kabel Deut-
schland fear Vodafone’s bid
for the German cable com-
pany could fall apart as
approval for the deal risks
failing to meet the required
minimum level of accept-
ances.
The UK-based mobile

operator agreed a €7.7bn
takeover of Kabel Deutsch-
land in June this year as
part of its broader strategy
to become a combined TV,

internet and telecoms group
based on fixed line as well
as mobile networks.
In order for this acquisi-

tion to proceed, however,
75 per cent of Kabel Deut-
schland shareholders must
tender their shares by this
Wednesday in the first
part of a two-stage tender
process.
Some of Kabel Deutsch-

land’s shareholders believe
that the amount of tenders
offered will fall well short
of this goal.
The shareholders say that

Vodafone still has time to
reduce the requirement
ahead of the Wednesday
deadline but that failure to
do so could derail the deal.
Citing eight major deals

in Germany since 2007,
including Daimler and
Rolls-Royce’s takeover of
German diesel engine
maker Tognum in 2011, one

leading shareholder in
Kabel Deutschland said
that the total number of
shares tendered in this first
crucial phase, including
those owned by the bidder,
has averaged just 68.5 per
cent.
Another shareholder has

also expressed fears that
tenders will fail to reach
the required minimum
which, at 75 per cent, it
says has been set higher
than for similar recent
deals.
Of particular concern to

these shareholders are the
large number of index-
tracking investors in Kabel
Deutschland – accounting
for almost 10 per cent of the
cable operator’s shareholder
base.
Shareholders in KDG say

that tracker funds are
unlikely to tender their
shares in the first wave,
preferring to wait until the
second tender deadline,
thereby giving their inves-
tors exposure to Kabel
Deutschland for as long as
possible.
If Vodafone fails to secure

the necessary support from
Kabel Deutschland share-
holders it can be prevented
from relaunching a further
takeover offer for 12 months
although it can seek a
waiver from BaFin, Ger-
many’s market regulator,
shareholders said.
A failure by Vodafone to

acquire Kabel Deutschland
could make the UK-based
mobile operator more vul-
nerable to a predatory bid
from US telecoms operator
AT&T, which is understood
to be interested in Voda-
fone’s wireless operations
in Europe but not its cable
assets.
In a statement, Vodafone

said: “There’ll be no change
to the conditions set out in
our earlier announcement.”
This announcement, pub-

lished in July, set out all
the terms for the tender
offer including the 75 per
cent hurdle for this
Wednesday.

Wall Street today begins
the roadshow for what
could become the biggest
corporate debt sale in his-
tory as it seeks buyers for
Verizon’s offering of some
$20bn in bonds to help fund
the $130bn acquisition of its
wireless business.
JPMorgan, Morgan

Stanley, Barclays and Bank
of America Merrill Lynch
are tasked with finding buy-
ers for the investment-grade
rated bonds.
The sale comes when the

market for corporate debt is
sharply negative for the
year and uncertainty hangs
over the near-term direction
of yields, which move in the
opposite direction to prices.
As bankers sound out the

willingness of money man-
agers, hedge funds, insurers
and pension plans for a
massive amount of debt,
one certainty is that any
new offering will come at a

cheaper price to that at
which Verizon’s existing
bonds trade. While a big
concession in price will
result in a higher yield for
Verizon, it is seen as simply
the cost of a company seek-
ing to sell a record amount
of debt in the US debt mar-
kets – exceeding Apple’s
$17bn sale in April.
Also on the table is an

ultra-long dated bond of up
to 100 years in maturity, if
there is enough demand
from investors for such
exposure, said people famil-
iar with the deal.
“As large as this debt deal

could become, we are confi-
dent the US market can
absorb it and anticipate a
substantial concession in
pricing,” said Edward
Marrinan, head of macro
credit strategy at RBS
Securities.
Later in the week, Veri-

zon is due to start market-
ing the bonds in Europe.

Dubai’s Al-Futtaim Group

The plan, expected to be

Al-Futtaim said the poten-

tial move, which is subject
to regulatory approval,
would be one of the largest
foreign direct investments
into the east African econ-

The Dubai family-owned

cash offer for 100 per cent of
the company’s issued

Futtaim said the proposed
takeover had received
endorsement of 50.6 per
cent of shareholders in
CMC, which has operations
across Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda.
The Dubai conglomerate,

which holds lucrative distri-

easing and fostering economic
growth,” says Jim Cowles, head of
Citigroup’s operations in Europe.
In private, unreconstructed bankers

go much further in their complaints,
arguing that the extent of reforms
goes far beyond dealing with causes of
the crisis.
Many are furious about onerous pay

reforms, particularly the incoming EU
ban on bonuses that are more than
double annual salary. They resent the
US Volcker rule and its constraints on
using the bank’s own money for trad-
ing purposes. And there is growing
irritation about what many see as a
series of witch-hunts against banks
over past misdemeanours, from insur-
ance mis-selling in the UK to mort-
gage product mis-selling in the US.
“Regulators now appear to be on a
mission of retribution,” says Bill
Michael, head of financial services at
KPMG UK.
All the same, there is still plenty of

unfinished business for policy makers
to tackle – less in dealing with the
direct causes of the last crisis and
more in terms of preparing to tackle
the repercussions of the next disaster,
whatever form it takes.
In particular, worries persist about

the complexity and size of banks now-
adays, a problem that has, if any-
thing, intensified. “The banks that
were deemed too big to fail five years
ago are now even bigger,” says Rich-
ard Portes, professor of economics at
the London Business School.
JPMorgan Chase, for example,

boasts assets of $2.4tn following
organic growth and crisis-triggered
acquisitions of Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual, compared with
only $1.6tn in 2007. The UK’s Lloyds
Banking Group, after its government-
sanctioned takeover of HBOS, is more
than twice the size it was before the
crisis, with a balance sheet of nearly
£880bn. In 2007, there were only six
banks in the world with assets of
more than $2tn. Today there are 13.
Plans are afoot to deal with this.

The central recommendation of the
UK’s Vickers commission – that big
British banks hive off high-street
banking activities into safer

“ringfenced” entities – should make a
wind-down of a large universal bank
easier. But the legislation, designed to
mitigate the risk of future bank col-
lapses in the vein of RBS and Lloyds,
has yet to be passed.
In the US, there has been deadlock

on many elements of the Dodd-Frank
reforms, much to the irritation of
President Barack Obama. A campaign
to restore Glass-Steagall, the repealed
1930s legislation that barred banks
and brokerage houses from combin-
ing, has made little headway.
In tandem, policy makers in Europe

and the US are working on the con-
cept of predefined “bail-ins” of bond-
holders in times of crisis. Optimists
cite examples of recent failures, such
as the Netherlands’ SNS Reaal, which
included a bail-in of bondholders
alongside nationalisation.
Overall, though, progress on the

topic is laborious and few believe that
banks will shrink much any time
soon, whatever reformists might like
to think. “Size is too simple a metric
[anyway],” says Douglas Flint, chair-
man of HSBC. “It really doesn’t mat-
ter from a systemic point of view
whether you have four banks or 40
banks in a market. It’s the system’s
asset concentration – principally in
government debt and in mortgage
debt – that can be dangerous.”
And this, financiers say, is the eter-

nal rub. Few elected politicians are
prepared to shift the focus of debate
away from banks’ size and structure
and on to the underlying issue: lend-
ers’ crucial role in propping up the
often excessive debt burdens of gov-
ernments and households.

tors have expressed concern about the
economic impact of an alleged “regu-
latory overload”, especially amid
nervousness about the next challenge
for policy makers – weaning the world
off exceptional central bank liquidity.
The expected wind-down of bond-

buying under QE has already hurt
banks by pushing down the value of
bonds on their balance sheets. A sec-
ondary threat comes from the pro-
spective end of cheap central bank
funding in the eurozone in a little
more than a year.
“The challenge will be to balance

various regulatory initiatives with the
realities of unwinding quantitative

on capital, conscious that risk weight-
ings are fallible and can in any case
be massaged to reduce capital require-
ments.
Several countries, notably the US,

the UK and Switzerland, have begun
initiatives to boost the amount of
equity that banks hold relative to
their overall unweighted assets. This
leverage ratio – as low as 2 per cent at
many banks in the boom years, mean-
ing balance sheets were geared 50
times – will in future need to be as
high as 6 per cent under US reform
plans.
At the same time, however, politi-

cians, bankers and even some regula-

basic lending – in particular to
residential and commercial mortgage
customers. There is little that the
authorities can do directly in a mar-
ket economy to curb foolish lending
practices by private sector banks. But
reformers argue that a laser focus on
capital, which can absorb losses, is
the essential way to protect the sys-
tem from further harm.
This was the first issue tackled by

regulators in the wake of the crisis,
with big banks today required in prac-
tice to hold equity capital equivalent
to 10 per cent of their assets weighted
for risk. But in recent months reform-
ers have launched another offensive

Ever since Lehman Brothers collapsed
almost five years ago – the most
dramatic event in an unprecedented
global crisis that is still reverberating
today – policy makers have laboured
to fix the causes of that disaster and
to pre-empt the next. Have they
succeeded?
In an attempt to gauge the merit of

the glut of global reforms, the Finan-
cial Times has looked back at the 34
main banks and brokers that failed in
the crisis, judging the principal rea-
sons for failure from a menu of five –
low capital; weak funding structures;
poor lending; poor trading invest-
ments; and misguided mergers and
acquisitions. Many failed for multiple
reasons, though Royal Bank of Scot-
land is the only institution to which
all five triggers applied.
Any analysis of the precise causes

of the global financial crisis, even
after five years of reflection, is neces-
sarily subjective. But if there were
five main causes of failure, regulators
can claim at least partial victory on
four of them. Capital levels in the
system are more than three times
higher than they were before the cri-
sis as banks pre-empt the require-
ments of new Basel III global stand-
ards. Financing is more stable, with
far less reliance on risky short-term
market funding and new incoming
rules demanding banks hold mini-
mum levels of cash and safe assets.
Big acquisitions are a thing of the

past, too, with regulators making it
clear that such dealmaking is unwel-
come. And the kind of complex struc-
tured investments that spread the
contagion of US subprime mortgage

losses around the world are close to
extinct, the victim of regulators’
higher capital charges and banks’
lower risk appetites.
Those successes have emboldened

regulators on both sides of the Atlan-
tic. Banks have been chastened and
their outspoken executives slapped
down, or in the case of Barclays’ Bob
Diamond, run out of town.
“The colour has drained from bank-

ing,” says one top regulator who is
close to Mark Carney, the new gover-
nor of the Bank of England. “Regula-
tors are the rock stars these days.”
Bankers concede that supervision,

after often notoriously lax oversight
before the crisis, has clearly
improved. “Regulation now is rightly
much more intensive and intrusive
and the supervisory teams are much
better,” says Richard Meddings,
finance director at Standard Char-
tered in London.
The one category of the FT’s five

triggers of failure that is immune to
regulation is bad lending – a perennial
curse of banking since the Middle
Ages and one that in the heat of the
crisis, when the focus was on complex
collateralised debt obligations, was
often neglected. “The crisis was over-
spun as a markets problem,” says
Robert Law, a former banks analyst
and adviser to the UK’s recent parlia-
mentary commission on banking
standards. “There were major prob-
lems in traditional lending, too.”
According to the FT’s analysis, this

was the single biggest factor in the
crisis. Of the 34 big banks that failed,
three-quarters succumbed in large
part because of the poor quality of

‘The colour
has drained

banking.
Regulators
are the rock
stars these
days’

If anybody is qualified to
judge the success of
combining investment and
commercial banks in the
same institution, it is John
Reed. As chief executive of
Citicorp in the 1980s and
1990s, he evangelised the
attempt to create a “one-
stop shop” selling many
different products and took
the bank into its merger
with Travelers Group to
form Citigroup in 1998.
That deal redefined

banking in the US and
triggered a repeal of the
old Glass-Steagall split
between investment and
commercial banking in the
US, which some critics

blame for being the root
cause of the 2008 financial
crisis. Now politicians in
the US are attempting to
reintroduce the split,
saying that Glass-Steagall’s
repeal contributed to the
financial disaster.
Citigroup needed several
injections of capital from
the US government in the
fraught months after the
Lehman bankruptcy.
Now retired, Mr Reed

believes the business logic
behind the transaction was
flawed, and that the old
Glass-Steagall division
should be reinstated. Mr
Reed first expressed this
view soon after the crisis
erupted. Last year Sandy
Weill, the other main
architect of the Citicorp-
Travelers deal, changed his
position to support
breaking up the banks.
Speaking to the Financial

Times, Mr Reed says the
greatest problem was of
clashing cultures – and
this went far beyond the
strong cultures of the old
Citibank and Salomon
Brothers, the dominant
institutions in the

Citigroup merger. Rather,
the problem had to do with
compensation. Trading
attracted a different kind
of person from commercial
banking. Traders expect to
be paid bonuses. “When
trading was small in
proportion to everything
you could have a group of
high bonus professionals

that you treated differently
and it didn’t affect the
culture of the whole
organisation,” says Mr
Reed, who oversaw the
growth of foreign exchange
trading at the old Citicorp.
“As trading becomes

more important then it
becomes harder and harder
to keep those cultures
separated. And it began to
work into the risk-taking
culture as well. Risk

officers would say to
someone who wanted to
make a loan: ‘I don’t like
this credit. We aren’t going
to do it. Stop. Period’.
“But now they would

recognise that if a certain
transaction didn’t go
through, his colleague
wasn’t going to be paid
that year. It became very
difficult to say: ‘Sorry.
Don’t do it.’ Your colleague
was being compensated for
doing transactions . . . It
became infectious.”
Putting the two cultures

under one roof therefore
made risk harder to
control, and the
organisation harder to
manage. And as trading
became more important it
became a more dominant
part of the organisation.
“These cultures don’t mix

well and one tends to push
out the other, and it does
result in institutions whose
behaviour isn’t necessarily
productive for the
economy.”
As for his efforts to

create a “one-stop shop”
for financial products,
pumping numerous

products through one sales
platform, it turned out not
to produce the hoped-for
savings for the bank.
Corporate clients wanted a
“one-stop shop”, and
during the 1990s were
increasingly asking
investment banks to help
with raising loan finance
for mergers.
However, after the

merger, Citigroup still
needed to have lending
officers to assess their
credit. Meanwhile, clients
felt that banking lending
officers “weren’t equipped
to provide people with
professional advice”. So the
bank needed to continue to
pay investment bankers to
explain more sophisticated
products “and they tend to
be highly paid because of
the complexity of the
product”. For large
corporate accounts, Citi
still needed to maintain
teams of bankers who were
expert in the company’s
needs across the world.
The result was that it
made no cost savings,
while the organisation
became harder to manage.

“We had assumed that if
we helped them not only
with traditional banking
but also with securities
somehow we would be able
to leverage that cost base
and we would be able to
generate more revenue per
customer,” he says. “But
what turned out is that we
had to to add to the cost
base.” A further issue was
a change in the culture of
investment banking, away
from a traditional emphasis

on serving companies and
their financing needs – a
concentration which it
shared with traditional
commercial banks. Now,
Mr Reed says, the
investment banking is
targeted at investors.
“They are trying to
package things or create
synthetic things they might
sell an investor to get a
better return than in a
traditional portfolio.”
He dismisses objections

that a Glass-Steagall split
would be difficult to
reinstate. “It could be
done. The finance industry
is amazingly flexible. We
don’t have big fixed capital
bases. It’s not like we have
factories that need to be
re-engineered.
“Had it turned out that

you could provide finance
to industry more cost-
effectively, then there
would be a benefit to
putting the two institutions
together. But given that
there isn’t, and given these
culture problems . . . you
end up saying this
probably isn’t a great
structure for the industry.”

Cultural clash ref lects why banks must split up, says former Citi chief

There is an imperative from
the boardroom for officials
manning the stands at this
week’s Frankfurt Motor
Show: Just keep smiling.
Mired in the worst sales

decline for two decades,
Europe’s carmakers are
feeling the pinch of ineffi-
cient factories, painful
restructuring and sagging
margins.
With a chink of sunshine

peeking from behind the
clouds as the tide of falling
sales shows signs of ebbing,
the continent’s biggest car
show has come at a good
time for executives to start
talking up the future again.
“There is certainly a

sense that we have turned a
corner,” says Allan Rush-
forth, chief operating officer
of Hyundai Europe. “The
uncertainty is dissipating;
people have banked on
things not getting any
worse, which has allowed
them to shift their business
outlook and planning.”
Motor shows are tradi-

tionally events where car-
makers flex their muscles,
show off their forthcoming
products and dazzle the
industry’s journalists and
general public.
And the Frankfurt Motor

Show, which opens to the
press tomorrow ahead of a
public opening on Thurs-
day, is Europe’s largest and
brashest. More than 150
product premieres are
expected this year, with 81
press conferences scheduled
for the 10,000 registered
members of the media.
But the gap between the

profitable premium
marques and their poorer
mass-market cousins is
likely to be palpable in
terms of the new models
manufacturers will parade
before the flashbulbs.
Years of falling sales have

forced many of the conti-
nent’s biggest volume man-
ufacturers to close factories,
slash production lines and

lay off thousands of work-
ers, with 1.4m cars of capac-
ity due to be cut by 2014,
according to rating agency
Moody’s.
“I get the sense certain

carmakers in Europe have
swallowed the medicine and
made the tough decisions
they need to,” Mr Rushforth
told the Financial Times.
“Now it is about seeing

that reflect in the business
models going forward.”
Europe’s car sales fell

6.6 per cent in the first six
months of the year to their
lowest half-year total since
1993, according to official
data from the continent’s
industry body, which will
release July and August
figures this month.
That comes after three

years of consecutive falls in
annual sales, with demand
in western Europe standing

at a quarter less than it was
in 2007.
According to LMC, an

automotive consultancy,
sales rose marginally in
July, and carmakers have
tentatively begun suggest-
ing that the bottom of the
market might have been
reached.
Ford, Peugeot and

Renault have all said they
expect European sales to
improve in the second half
of the year, with analysts
and forecasters expecting
an overall decline of about
5 per cent year on year by
the end of December.
Sales in western Europe

are expected to remain stag-
nant or rise marginally next
year, according to an aver-
age of major forecasters,
with the continent’s big
producers looking to capi-
talise on growth in China,

the US or South America to
stay profitable.
“We have touched the

ground,” says Matthias
Wissmann, president of the
German automotive associ-
ation VDA. “[The industry]
goes into the run-up to the
show with optimism . . .

there is a certain trend
towards stabilisation.”
Premium carmakers,

which have been mostly
unaffected by the sales
decline, will dominate most
of the headlines at Frank-
furt. The Big Three of Audi,
BMW and Mercedes-Benz
will together take the wraps
off at least 14 new cars,

including the full debut of
BMW’s much-hyped entry
into the electric car market
with its i3 and i8 models.
“Turning expectations

upside down, ensuring that
‘wow’ effect – with this
year’s concept, we are tak-
ing the next step,” says
Luca de Meo, Audi board
member, of the carmaker’s
plan to build an upside-
down cityscape at its stand.
Jaguar Land Rover, the

British carmaker that made
after-tax profit of £1.2bn in
the latest financial year,
will announce a new model
family for its Jaguar brand
to include a crossover
model for the first time,
while Porsche will unveil
its fastest road car.
In contrast, volume man-

ufacturers, which Moody’s
estimates will lose a com-
bined €10bn in 2012 and

2013, are likely to focus
mainly on tweaked or
improved versions of
already available models.
“It feels as if we are run-

ning along the bottom,”
says Alan Mulally, CEO of
Ford, which is presenting
its S-MAX concept car at
the show and focusing its
pitch on new in-car technol-
ogy and safety features.
“But even if the [western

European] market goes
down to 12m vehicles a year
and stays there, that’s still
12m people we need to sell
cars to . . . It’s still a really
key market for us.”

British supercar manufac-
turer McLaren opens its
showroom doors in China
today as it races to catch up
with global rivals in the
world’s second-largest lux-
ury car market.
McLaren Automotive,

which builds the £1m
P1 supercar, is entering the
country as part of a drive to
ramp up its Asian presence
to 13 dealerships this year
and hopes the region will
account for a third of its
global sales in future.
The carmaker will open

four dealerships in China:
in Shanghai, Beijing,
Chengdu and Guangzhou.
Mainland China has

become a key market for
luxury marques such as
Ferrari, Lamborghini and

Bentley. In spite of a slow-
down in economic growth,
the country is expected to
overtake the US as the big-
gest premium car market
by the end of the decade.
“China is one of the most

exciting and dynamic mar-
kets in the world where we
will make every effort to be
well received,” said Ron
Dennis, McLaren chairman.
“Our entry into China . . .

represents a significant
milestone in the develop-
ment of the company.”
The manufacturer, from

Woking, Surrey, which last
year sold 1,400 cars and
exported 80 per cent of its
production, is targeting
10 per cent of future sales
to come from China.
McLaren’s growth is part

of a resurgence in the UK
car industry, written off at
the turn of the millennium
but roaring back as a global
leader in high-end manufac-

turing. With European car
demand hit by the conti-
nent’s economic gloom,
China and other emerging
markets such as Russia and
India have become impor-
tant battlegrounds for high-
end car brands targeting
the emerging world’s newly
minted rich.
Ferrari, which entered

mainland China in 2004,
sold about 350 cars in the
country in the first six
months of the year – about
10 per cent of its global
deliveries. The country is
Lamborghini’s second-larg-
est market, after the US.
Mike Flewitt, McLaren

chief executive, said:
“Entering the Chinese mar-
ket is both a huge honour
and a major opportunity
for McLaren Automotive,
and it highlights the contin-
ued development of the
company.”
China will be the 27th

retail market for the car-
maker, which has ramped
up its sales footprint in
Asia this year, opening out-
lets in cities such as Tokyo,
Hong Kong and Sydney.
Indonesia and Malaysia

are set to follow before 2014
as part of a concerted effort
since 2010 to expand
McLaren’s brand beyond
Formula One racing
and into sports cars sold
globally.

Britain has stolen a march
on the US in the race to
unlock commercial poten-
tial from unmanned aircraft
or drones. The National
Aeronautical Centre, a pri-

vately-run company at West
Wales Airport, will for the
first time make it possible
for commercial developers
to fly big unmanned air-
craft in segregated airspace
after its partnership, due to
be announced today, with
Newquay Cornwall airport.
The partnership is likely

to lower the barriers to
entry for commercial devel-
opers of large unmanned
aerial vehicles, say people
who follow the civilian mar-
ket. The main US and UK
trade associations for the

drone industry say this is
the first time that develop-
ers will be able to test big
UAVs in segregated air-
space from a privately run
airfield.
One enthusiast of the

project is Richard Deakin,
chief executive of Nats, the
UK air traffic controller,
who believes there is no
technical reason UAVs
should not be able to fly
among normal aircraft, per-
haps first in controlled air-
space.
“This is a big step for-

ward, there’s a lot of oppor-
tunity for the UK to lead
the way,” he said. “The
prizes are going to go to the
people who are bold enough
to take these first steps.
They will come.”
In the US, the Federal

Aviation Authority’s deci-
sion on which states will
get to host six test sites for
small UAVs has been
delayed by opposition from
privacy groups, and is now
expected by the end of the
year. Canada has been
pushing the commercialisa-

tion of drones, using remote
air strips to test smaller
models.
Developing large UAVs

has been the purview of big
defence contractors and the
European, US and Israeli
militaries they serve. But
with the war in Afghani-
stan coming to an end, the
focus is shifting to whether
UAVs could also be used for
civilian jobs from fighting
forest fires to monitoring
oil pipelines.
The University of South-

ampton and Teal Group, a

consultancy, estimate the
potential annual market at
$55bn-$62bn per year by
2020, while the Association
for Unmanned Vehicle Sys-
tems International, a US
lobby group, believes inte-
grating UAVs in the US
could be worth $82bn and
100,000 jobs by 2025.
It is the kind of economic

stimulus governments are
keen to capture and Europe
and the US have set very
aggressive targets for fully
integrating UAVs into civil-
ian airspace. In the UK, a

government-backed consor-
tium of defence companies
has taken the first
unmanned test flight
through civilian airspace.
Aviation authorities are

taking a cautious approach
to creating a regulatory
regime to certify that
drones are safe for flight in
civil airspace and this is
keeping the barrier to entry
for new parties high. The
National Aeronautical Cen-
tre could change that
because it offers a cheaper
and easier alternative to

military and government
partnerships. Ray Mann,
whose company owns West
Wales Airport, calls the
breakthrough a gateway to
the commercial UAV
market. “In terms of facili-
ties within which to operate
we are extremely ahead of
the race.”
In military UAVs, Euro-

pean companies such as
Thales, EADS and BAE Sys-
tems are only now catching
up with their US and Israel
counterparts, which domi-
nate the market.

COMPANIES

Jack Ma has always been a
frank speaker – at times to
his disadvantage. For poten-
tial investors in Alibaba,
the e-commerce group’s
founder was explicit about
where they rank among his
priorities in a speech in
Hong Kong in March.
“Customers are number

one, employees number two
and shareholders are
number three at the critical
times,” he said. “If you
think about who supports
you all the time, investors
support you when times are
good.”
Now that Alibaba is pre-

paring a hotly anticipated
flotation likely to value the
group at $60bn, Mr Ma and
his senior team are trying
to ensure that in difficult
times investors will not be
able to derail the company
from its chosen path.
However, the quest by the

Alibaba Partnership – made
up of 20 top executives – to
keep control over Alibaba’s
board is running up against
the determination by some
people in Hong Kong to
defend principles of inves-
tor protection. The fight
could see the city lose the
listing to New York.
The partnership would

control the board by being
allowed to nominate a sim-
ple majority of directors,
although shareholders
would vote on each individ-
ual name, according to a
person close to the com-
pany.
It is a high-stakes game

that both sides could regret.

Alibaba would end up
listed very far from home
and in an accounting envi-
ronment that demands high
and voluminous disclosure
on a quarterly basis.
Hong Kong would lose

the biggest and brightest
listing it has had the oppor-
tunity to secure since insur-
ance group AIA, while the
exchange itself would miss
a highly lucrative client.
For China too, the out-

come would be difficult to
bear. That is not only
because one of its most suc-
cessful private enterprises
would be making its finan-
cial home elsewhere, but
also because Alibaba has
become the single most
important repository of
pricing and consumer infor-
mation in the economy. If
China wants to understand
inflation, it often looks to
Alibaba.
The control that the

Alibaba Partnership is seek-
ing will be won only if
shareholders approve its
choice of directors – and Mr
Ma’s view of shareholders
does not mean Alibaba will
not pursue value for them,
according to people close to
the group.
The partnership has been

highly influenced by
Google’s defence of its con-
trol of shareholder voting
rights.
In a letter ahead of its US

listing, Larry Page, one of
Google’s founders, wrote
that they might sacrifice
short-term results for
opportunities they judged
to be in the best long-term
interests of shareholders.
When it comes to Hong

Kong, corporate governance
still dramatically lags
behind its regulator’s prin-
ciples in this small city that
has a limited pool of inde-
pendent directors and
whose stock market
remains dominated by a
tight group of ageing

tycoons. Some of Alibaba’s
investors, which include
SoftBank of Japan with
almost 35 per cent and a
string of sovereign wealth
funds and asset managers,
are supportive of the board
nomination plan, according
to people close to the com-
pany.
One of those investors,

who has “high confidence”
in the management,

believes that keeping the
senior team intact is one of
the most important consid-
erations.
But a crucial point on the

proposed make-up of the
board is whether ordinary
shareholders have sufficient
influence, the investor says.
“It has to be clear that we

can say ‘no’ to any director

they nominate,” the inves-
tor says. “Is this a good
company doing the right
thing? If the answer is yes,
we’ll give them a lot of
rope. The key is what hap-
pens if things go wrong in
the business, how can we
effect change?”
Some prospective inves-

tors balk at the plans. One
senior executive at a big
fund manager says the
exchange and its regulators
should not bend the rules
for one company.
“There is no single listing

larger than the system.
They want the best of both
worlds,” he says, adding
that if Alibaba wants
additional board control
akin to an unlisted firm, it
should remain as a partner-
ship.
In the US, the debate over

dual-class control struc-
tures is far from over. In a
case such as Google, the
shares have performed
strongly and the company
has retained the freedom to
pursue multiple strategies
from the highly successful
Android phone software to
the wacky and unproved
Google Glass wearable
device.
For companies such as

Groupon and Zynga, which
have been far from success-
ful, a dual-class share struc-
ture has been seen as an
impediment to sorely
needed change.
Alibaba’s ambitions are

nothing like Google’s,
according to people close to
the company.
But, like Google, Alibaba

still wants to retain the sta-
bility and independence in
its management to change
direction quickly in the face
of disruptive technological
developments and to make
long-term, risky bets that
could bring very large
rewards.

News analysis
Flotation is turning
into a high­stakes
game about control
of the company,
writes Paul J Davies

By Richard Milne in Oslo

Norway’s probable next
government is looking to
part-privatise a slew of
state-owned companies as
eight years of centre-left
rule seems set to come to
an end.
Svein Flatten, Conserva-

tive MP and spokesman on
ownership matters, said it
would want to reduce own-
ership “over time” in three
of the biggest partially
state-owned companies:
energy group Statoil; tele-
coms operator Telenor; and
fertiliser producer Yara.
Companies it would par-

ticularly focus on selling
down include airline SAS;
fish food group Cermaq;
property business Entra;
airport train Flytoget; and
construction services pro-
vider Mesta.
“We first of all want a

stronger private ownership
and a reduced state owner-
ship,” Mr Flatten said. “It is
our opinion that increased
private ownership in attrac-
tive companies results in
increased added value,
increased public visibility
and improved development
possibilities.”
A Conservative-led cen-

tre-right coalition is the
most likely result of elec-
tions today, putting an end
to Jens Stoltenberg’s centre-
left government.
Erna Solberg, the Con-

servative leader and likely
next prime minister, has

campaigned on a platform
of tax cuts, investment in
infrastructure and a focus
on education and health-
care. But the Conservatives
have also said they want to
have a debate about split-
ting up the $750bn oil fund,
the world’s largest sover-
eign wealth fund.
Mr Flatten said the Con-

servatives wanted to reduce
the government’s stake in
Statoil, Norway’s biggest
company by market capital-
isation, from 67 to 51 per
cent, in Telenor from 54 to
51 per cent, and from 36 to
34 per cent in Yara. Those
sales alone would net Nor-
way NKr77bn ($12.7bn) at
market prices.
“The reductions will not

be of very high priority
[and] it is important that
the reductions will be pur-
sued over time, especially
concerning Statoil,” he said.
He added that it was

important in the biggest
companies to keep a block-
ing minority state of at
least a third to ensure no
changes in a business’s stat-
utes could be made, such as
moving its headquarters
out of the country.
The Norwegian govern-

ment owns about a third of
the value of the companies
listed on the Oslo stock
exchange. A sister institu-
tion to the oil fund also has
stakes in many groups.
The current government

has been exploring a sale of
Entra, with little progress.
It also received permission
from parliament to sell
down its stake in Cermaq
but ended up increasing it
amid a takeover fight.

In BP’s battle to limit the
cost of its compensation set-
tlement for the 2010 Deep-
water Horizon disaster, the
independent investigation
into allegations of miscon-
duct in the claims process
has failed to deliver the
best outcome for the com-
pany: a call to stop pay-
ments.
It has, however, provided

BP with plenty of ammuni-
tion for future arguments.
Louis Freeh, a former

director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,
concluded that while there
had been improper and
unethical conduct at the
office administering com-
pensation payments, that
should not stop it “process-
ing and paying honest and
legitimate claims in a
timely manner”.
That assessment, in a

report that was slipped out
quietly in a court filing on
Friday evening, was backed
by an order from Judge
Carl Barbier, who has been
hearing the case over the
spill at the US District
Court in New Orleans.
It was a blow to BP,

which has twice brought
cases to Judge Barbier
arguing that compensation
payments under the settle-
ment should be suspended
because of the possibility of
improper claims.
Yet while Mr Freeh’s con-

clusion may have been dis-
appointing, there was
ample material in his 95-
page report to support BP’s
contention that there have
been serious problems at
the programme. He has also
been given a continuing
role to investigate conflicts

of interests and possible
suspect claims, and to claw
back payments on any
found to be fraudulent.
Patrick Juneau, the Loui-

siana lawyer appointed by
the court to administer the
settlement agreed by BP
and plaintiffs’ lawyers last
year, is praised in Mr
Freeh’s report for his
“proper conduct and ethical
‘tone at the top’”.
However, the report also

highlighted the difficulty of
setting up a programme to
administer tens of thou-
sands of claims from five
states along the Gulf of

Mexico coast. As Mr Juneau
said himself: “It ain’t the
easiest thing in the world in
five states to find somebody
who doesn’t have any con-
tact with the BP litigation.”
Among the staff taken on

by Mr Juneau were Chris-
tine Reitano and Lionel
“Tiger” Sutton, a married
couple who were also part-
ners in a law firm together.

Both assured Mr Juneau
that they would avoid any
possible conflicts of inter-
est. However, Mr Sutton
admitted to Mr Freeh that
he had received $40,460 in
“referral fees” for a com-
pensation claim from a fish-
erman called Casey Thonn.
That claim was taken on by
Andry Lerner, a law firm
run by Jon Andry and Glen
Lerner, Mr Sutton’s former
classmates from Tulane
Law School.
Mr Freeh’s report says

the money was paid to Mr
Sutton by a “circuitous”
route, detailed in a full-page
diagram.
Mr Sutton also worked for

a water treatment company
called Crown, in which Mr
Lerner was an investor, and
was himself a 50 per cent
shareholder in a company
called Romeo Papa that
filed a claim of its own.
Mr Sutton and Ms Reit-

ano are also described by
Mr Freeh as having been
used by Brown Greer, a law
firm working for the claims
administrator’s office, “in
an effort to resist and to
undermine the implementa-
tion of business practices to
control its costs and to
eliminate inefficiencies”.
Brown Greer was criti-

cised for being slow to
detect a potential conflict of
interest on its own staff.
One of its employees had an
“intimate relationship”
with Mr Thonn, and had a
baby with him earlier this
year.
While the evidence of

improper behaviour may be
striking, it is separate from
the issue that has been at
the heart of BP’s fight to
cut the cost of the settle-
ment in the appeals court:
the generous method for
calculating business losses
used by Mr Juneau.
Even so, Mr Freeh has

uncovered material that is
likely to be useful to BP,
and he may uncover more
in the future. It is now up
to the company to work out
how to use it.

BP can take solace from

US seeks f inal detail
before Fed rate decision
By Kate Allen

The final titbits of data will
be published this week that
add the last pieces to the
US Federal Reserve’s pic-
ture of the economy in
advance of its crucial
rate announcement on Sep-
tember 18.
Growth in retail sales is

expected on Friday, buoyed
by “back to school” spend-
ing. However, the
University of Michigan
consumer confidence indi-
cator is expected to show
that the forthcoming
Congressional wrangle over
the budget seems to be
clouding the sunny mood of
earlier this year along with
last week’s poor non-farm
payroll figures.
In Europe, this week’s

data could reinforce the
tentative air of recovery
that is beginning to take
hold, in advance of the Ger-
man election on September
22.

French industrial produc-
tion tomorrow is likely to
benefit from improved
European business confi-
dence, while Europe-wide
industrial production on
Thursday is expected to
show an improvement that
some analysts believe will
be sustained in the coming
months.
However, longer term

headwinds mean that any
mood of optimism gener-
ated by this week’s data
could be shortlived.
The Eurogroup meets this

week in Vilnius and is
likely to cover issues
such as Greece’s need for a
third rescue package and
further support for Portu-
gal.
But all difficult decisions

are being postponed until
after the German election,
meaning that an autumn of
political turmoil may be
approaching.
The first Chinese data for

August will be published
this week, and should show
whether, as some analysts
expect, growth bottomed
out in the second quarter.
Industrial production is
expected to rebound, driven
by internal demand, partic-
ularly from companies
restocking their invento-
ries.
This will offset external

demand, which remains
subdued. Rising property
investment is expected to
offset a fall in manufactur-
ing investment, meaning
that overall fixed asset

investment figures tomor-
row are likely to be moder-
ately positive.
Money supply figures are

expected to confirm the eco-
nomic upswing. “We expect
the central bank to con-
tinue to maintain relatively
steady monetary conditions
via open market operations
and other liquidity manage-
ment tools,” said John Zhu
of HSBC.
“The current credit and

money supply growth rates
are sufficient to support a
GDP growth rate of around
8 per cent.”
There could be good news

for the Japanese economy
this week, with second-
quarter GDP possibly being
revised upwards thanks to
capital spending.
This would reinforce the

case for the government to
proceed with its consump-

tion tax increase, which is
due to take effect next
April.
In the UK, labour market

data on Wednesday are not
likely to show much change
in either the unemployment
rate or real wages.
They will therefore offer

little to prompt Bank of
England governor Mark
Carney to reassess his for-
ward guidance.
Other indicators have

been positive, boosting
markets’ expectations
of an earlier interest rate
rise.
Construction output fig-

ures on Friday will have
implications for third-
quarter GDP growth: since
it is the weakest contribu-
tor to GDP, any positive
signs will feed into the
increasingly buoyant eco-
nomic mood.

● Housebuilders are
enjoying a boom and
Barratt, which delivers
full-year results, is no
exception, writes Gill
Plimmer.
Shares in the company,

the UK’s largest
housebuilder by volume,
have already risen 49 per
cent in the year to date,
outperforming the FTSE
250 index by 30 per cent
and the sector by 10 per
cent.
Barratt said in July it

expected pre-tax profits to
jump 73 per cent in the
year to June, helped by the
government’s Help to Buy
scheme and an
improvement in consumer
confidence.
But it will be interesting

to discover the extent to
which it is raising
production as a result, as
well as any news on the
dividend. Barratt’s debt
reduction plan is expected
to be on target.
Consensus forecasts have

pre-tax profits rising from
£191.52m in 2013 to
£309.90m in 2014.

● Thorntons has focused
on slashing the number of
stores and selling its goods
through other retailers
since it flirted with
oblivion at the start of
2012 – and investors can
expect more of the same
when it reports full-year
results, writes Duncan
Robinson.
The chocolate

manufacturer and retailer
cut the total number of its
stores from 496 to 482 in
its latest quarter. Instead,
Thorntons has focused on
selling its wares more in
supermarkets through its
commercial channel, where
sales jumped more than 20
per cent in its final
quarter.
The successful

turnround strategy has
been rewarded with a
near trebling of its share
price over the past 12
months.
Thorntons retail division

is, however, still
struggling. The division
posted a 0.8 per cent drop
in like-for-like sales for the
year, albeit with an
improved performance in
the second half of the year.

Profit before tax will
come in at £6.8m,
according to Panmure
Gordon, while earnings per
share will be about 5.5p.

● Sales at Wm Morrison
are expected to show some
sign of improvement
thanks to increased
promotions and reduced
prices when the grocer
reports its second-quarter
results, writes Duncan
Robinson.
Analysts expect an

improvement on Morrison’s
miserable first-quarter
performance, when like-for-

like sales dropped 1.8 per
cent – although not by
much. Deutsche Bank
expects the group to post a
1.1 per cent fall in like-for-
like sales for its second
quarter.
This improvement may

come at a cost. With the
supermarket pushing
promotions and doing its

best to cut prices it is
risking a lower margin,
with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch expecting
the grocer’s gross margin
to fall by 50 basis points.
“Kantar data suggest

that this has had some
success in reversing share
loss to both the
discounters and superstore
competitors but not to a
degree sufficient to offset
the lower gross margins,”
wrote James Collins, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Profit before tax for the
quarter is expected to drop
13 per cent year on year to
£383m.
Investors will look for

any mention of Morrison’s
expansion into the retail
sector’s two fastest
growing markets: online
and convenience.
Morrison’s plans to expand
its M Local convenience
format to 100 stores by the
end of the year, with

analysts expecting a solid
performance from the
stores already opened.
Investors will also want

to hear more about
Morrison’s tie-up with
Ocado, launched in
January 2014.

● The number of pubs in
the UK may be falling, but
JD Wetherspoon is slowly
increasing its estate of cut-
price boozers, writes
Duncan Robinson.
The group increased its

openings target from
between 20 and 25 per year
to a target of more than 30
earlier this year as the
chain of 800 pubs
continues to perform well,
despite miserly consumer
spending.
Management will outline

its expansion plans in
further detail when it
reports full-year results.
After stellar like-for-like

annual sales growth of 8.4
per cent last year,
investors can expect a
more modest sales growth
of about 2 per cent,
according to Panmure
Gordon.
Wetherspoon’s focus on

the low-price end of the
market means that
maintaining margin is key
for the business – no easy
task in an industry that
has been beset by inflation
in everything from food to
taxes.
Management says that a

margin of 8.6 per cent is
reasonable for the
business. But analysts at
Panmure Gordon suggest
that the group will need
like-for-like growth of
about 3 per cent to offset
inflation.
The market expects

annual pre-tax profits to
come in at about £76m,
leaving the group with
earnings per share of about
45p.

Primark continues to bag more sales
While the rest of the high street has
been hit by slack growth, Associated
British Foods’ Primark continues
to grow rapidly, writes Duncan
Robinson.
Primark has shrugged off the high

street’s woes, reporting a 22 per cent
jump in total sales for the first nine
months of the year as shoppers flocked
to its low-price stores.
Analysts at Davy expect Primark to

reveal 5 per cent like-for-like growth for
the whole year when it reports its full-
year trading statement on Monday.
While Primark is still focused on the

high street, the retailer has dipped its
toe into the world of ecommerce via a
partnership with Asos. Investors will be
keen to quiz management on whether
there are plans to expand it.
Away from Primark, the group’s sugar

division is expected to show falling
profits as prices fall across Europe,
according to Davy.
ABF’s grocery division, meanwhile,

has grown 3 per cent for the year to
date, with management hinting this
strong performance was going to
continue into the final quarter.

New York’s
CIO points
to pensions
‘travesty’
By Ellen Kelleher in New York

The outgoing chief invest-
ment officer of New York
City’s pension funds has
taken a parting shot at his
employer, saying that “it’s
a travesty New York City
outsources all of its invest-
ments to money managers”.
Larry Schloss said Can-

ada’s Pension Plan Invest-
ment Board and its Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan,
which manage most of their
money in-house, are far
superior to public pension
funds in the US.
“They are the best models

in the industry. They are in
a different class. They are
20 years ahead of us,” said
Mr Schloss in a valedictory
interview with FTfm.
The CPP Investment

Board has $183.3bn in assets
and Ontario Teachers has
$129.5bn.
Mr Schloss’s job of man-

aging New York’s five pub-
lic pension funds, which
have $140bn in assets, will
end when his boss John
Liu, the city’s comptroller,
leaves office next year.
The CIO said low wages

are partly responsible for
the decision to outsource all
fund management func-
tions. “This is a travesty,”
said Mr Schloss. “We
should be able to attract tal-
ent to work here.”
He added the average

wage of $100,000 for an ana-
lyst in the city’s investment
management bureau is
uncompetitive.

Fund market
rocked by
sexism claims

One in two female fund
management staff have
been subjected to regular
harassment or sexist behav-
iour in the office, shattering
the illusion that asset man-
agement represents the
softer side of financial serv-
ices.
According to the prelimi-

nary findings of an ongoing
FTfm survey – which has so
far captured the views of
100 male and female asset
management staff – 54 per
cent of women said they
have encountered “inappro-
priate” conduct in the
workplace.
A further 28 per cent of

female fund staff said they
have experienced sexual
harassment in the industry.
A female analyst cur-

rently working in the fund
industry, who requested
anonymity, recognises it is
a big problem. She said that
if “something had not gone
right” in a client meeting,
managers would ask why
she had not worn a shorter
skirt.
“I find it distressing if I

am perceived sexually in

the work environment. So
for my own protection I
never wear make-up,
always have my hair tied
up, and wear glasses and a
cardigan.”
One female former asset

management employee,
who also wanted to remain
anonymous, told FTfm: “I
experienced sexual harass-
ment at work – it is rife.
“It is a very male-man-

aged, male-dominated envi-
ronment. You have to be
one of the guys to be suc-
cessful.”
Of the women who said

they had experienced inap-
propriate behaviour in the
workplace, a quarter said
such behaviour took place
on a monthly basis, and 6
per cent said it occurred
weekly.
The results – which have

been gathered with the help
of Cerulli Associates – go
some to way to contradict-
ing common perceptions
about the fund industry
being less aggressive com-
pared with investment
banking or corporate law.
A female respondent to

the FTfm survey said: “Cer-
tain asset classes are very
male dominated, which
results in behaviours and
cultures that may alienate
female colleagues.”
Elizabeth Corley, chief

executive of Allianz Global
Investors, the German fund
house, said she was sur-
prised by the results.
“This has not been my

experience, so I am sur-
prised this has come
through so strongly as a
theme. Most heads of
department [in the indus-
try] will be determined to
look into this,” she said.
The survey showed that

women in junior roles are
most likely to experience
sexism in the office, with
more than 70 per cent say-
ing they had experienced
inappropriate behaviour at
least once over a 12 month
period, compared with 49
per cent of women in mid-
dle and senior positions.
Surprisingly, 5 per cent of

male respondents also said
they had experienced sex-
ual harassment in the asset
management industry.

Simon McMenemy, a part-
ner at Signet Partners, an
employment law firm,
agreed the findings were
unexpected.
He said: “There are a lot

of very senior female asset
managers out there
and because of that, people
are much better behaved
[than in other areas of
finance].”
The lawyer added, how-

ever, that he had seen cases
where women who had
complained about harass-
ment in the fund industry
had been edged out of their
organisations as a result.
He said: “It takes a lot of

moral courage to say some-
thing is inappropriate or
offensive when there is a

culture of showing you are
part of a team.”
Fund companies need to

concentrate on improving
the visibility of women at
the top of their organisa-
tions, according to Gemma
Godfrey, head of invest-
ment strategy at Brooks
Macdonald, the wealth man-
agement group.

how these organisations are

Hedge
funds
hate Fatca
the most
By Ellen Kelleher in New York

The Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act ranks first
on the list of regulations
that leading hedge fund
managers find most irritat-
ing, according to a survey.
Fatca, which requires the

disclosure of confidential
information about US cli-
ents to the Internal Reve-
nue Service, is seen as a
“major concern” for three-
quarters of the 40 large
hedge fund managers with
at least $1bn in assets
across Europe, the US and
Asia polled by Sungard and
Aite, two hedge fund con-
sultants.
Form PF, the part of the

Dodd-Frank Act that per-
mits US regulators to carry
out stress tests on manag-
ers’ portfolios, and the
Alternative Investment
Fund Managers Directive,
which subjects hedge funds
to greater scrutiny in
Europe, follow closely
behind Fatca as the second
and third most severe head-
aches for hedge fund man-
agers.
“Fatca varies from coun-

try to country and thus car-
ries a high degree of uncer-
tainty and complexity,”
wrote the authors of “Hedge
Fund Trends and Chal-
lenges: Achieving Institu-
tional Credibility”.
“Form PF is certainly the

overwhelming concern
among US funds, while
AIFMD’s patchy implemen-
tation brings concerns of
increased complexity to
fund administrators.”
The research also sug-

gested that corporate perks
and large headcounts
remained out of fashion,
due to squeezed budgets.

Money market ratings ‘outlawed’

By Steve Johnson

A proposal by the European
Commission to ban money
market funds from solicit-
ing or financing a rating
from a credit rating agency
has raised fears that this
prohibition could be
extended across the conti-
nent’s financial sector.
The proposal formed part

of a broader crackdown by
Brussels on the $2.9tn
money market fund indus-
try, unveiled last week, that
also included proposals to

force some funds to build
up cash buffers amounting
to 3 per cent of their assets.
The commission said the

ban on soliciting ratings
would end the risk of “sud-
den massive redemptions”
from a fund in the wake of
a rating downgrade,
strengthening financial sta-
bility.
In addition, it would

remove the incentive for
money market funds to
“fire sell” holdings issued
by a downgraded bank in
order to maintain their tri-
ple-A rating.
However some believe the

proposal could pre-empt a
report due to be presented
by the commission in Janu-
ary 2016 into the prevailing
“issuer pays” model right
across the credit rating

agency industry.
“If you decide there needs

to be a proper study into
the business model of an
industry, then you do that
study first, rather than just
going off and implementing
something,” said one indus-
try figure.
“They argue that money

market funds are different
to anything else, but clearly
they are going to draw con-
clusions from this. If you
are doing a study on busi-
ness models, this will be
part of the study. It pre-
empts the study.”
A second source said:

“It’s certainly an unprece-
dented move to effectively
outlaw fund ratings.”
The source added that, in

the US, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the

regulator, requires money
market funds to use rating
agencies to determine
which assets are eligible for
their portfolios.
Separately, both Moody’s

and Standard & Poor’s, two
leading rating agencies,
criticised the commission
for its proposal to bar
money market funds from
paying for a rating.
Daniel Piels, a spokesman

for Moody’s, said the pro-
posal “attempts to ‘control
the message’ about risk in
Europe by substituting reg-
ulatory oversight for mar-
ket transparency”.
Martin Winn, a spokes-

man for S&P, said fund
managers and investors
“should be free to use the
investment tools they deem
appropriate”.

‘issuer pays’ report

Sweden pensions urged to dump carbon
By Caroline Liinanki

Sweden’s cluster of state
pension funds face political
pressure to divest from all
of their fossil fuel holdings.
The Swedish Centre party

has called for all of the
country’s national pension
funds to sell off their hold-
ings in fossil fuel corpora-
tions in order to “climate
proof” and protect the value
of their investments.
Martin Ådahl, chief econ-

omist at the Centre party,
which is part of Sweden’s
four-party government coa-
lition, told FTfm that the
AP funds had been “impo-
tent” and that investments
in fossil fuels represented a
financial risk to the long-
term value of the country’s
pension reserves.
The four main AP funds,

with SKr971bn ($146bn) of
assets under management,

have some of their largest
foreign equity holdings in
oil and gas companies.
The Centre party’s call

for divestment follows a
report by Lord Nicholas
Stern, a professor at the
London School of Econom-
ics, and Carbon Tracker, a
think-tank. It warned of a
“carbon bubble” and cau-
tioned that at least two-
thirds of listed companies’
oil, coal and gas reserves
were “unburnable” if global
warming were to be kept
below two degrees.
Mr Ådahl admitted that

the aim was not to legislate,
which he recognised would
be both difficult and politi-
cally sensitive. “We want to
bring the issue to public
debate. We are encouraging
the AP funds to take
action,” he said.
Last year, AP4 invested

SKr1.3bn in a low-carbon

equity strategy. However,
Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell
and ExxonMobil also make
up three of the SKr241bn

fund’s five largest foreign
equity holdings.
Arne Lööw, AP4’s head of

corporate governance,
acknowledged the contra-
diction. “Excluding all fos-
sil fuel companies would be
too great a risk,” he said.
Nordic life and pension

company Storebrand, which
has NKr450bn of assets
under management,
excluded 19 fossil fuel com-
panies from its investment
line-up in July. The exclu-
sion was based on concerns
around the long-term finan-
cial risks of remaining
invested in carbon dioxide-
intensive companies.
“The reason for divesting

is to secure long-term
returns. The greatest risk
for investors is to do noth-
ing,” said Christine Tørklep
Meisingset, head of sustain-
able investments at Store-
brand.

Is it time to
return to EM?

Emerging markets have
suffered a big sell­off since
May. Rob Drijkoningen,
co­head of emerging
market debt at Neuberger
Berman, believes the sell­
off has almost run its
course and discusses
which countries and assets
are likely to perform best
when buyers return.

News analysis

Old MacDonald
had an investment
in agriculture

Investing in farmland isnot always as straight-forward as it might
appear. One New York-
based hedge fund appar-
ently pulled out of a Brazil-
ian farm project on discov-
ering the deal would only
produce positive cash flows
one month a year, a period
known to those in the trade
as a “harvest”.
Meanwhile, foreign inves-

tors that have snapped up
farmland in poorer parts of
Africa have been pilloried
for putting local tenant
farmers out of work and,
potentially, reducing local
food supplies by exporting
their produce.
But despite these set-

backs, the likes of Sweden’s
AP2 pension fund and the
UK’s Pension Protection
Fund have invested in farm-
land and, unsurprisingly,
asset managers such as
TIAA-CREF of the US and
Insight Investment of the
UK are queueing up to feed
this demand.
Indeed, one such house,

Hamburg-based Aquila Cap-
ital, believes the investment
opportunity is now better
than ever.
“There is a sea change

that has gone unnoticed,”
says Detlef Schoen, manag-
ing partner, farm invest-
ments at Aquila. “All of a
sudden very good [farmers]
have begun to welcome
financial investors, largely
because their traditional
sources of funding are dry-
ing up.
“Banks are in retreat,

asset values have ballooned
and farms are getting big-
ger, so there is a huge
equity gap. It’s a fantastic
opportunity.”
Charmion McBride, head

of innovation and develop-
ment at Insight Investment,
which has made a number of
farmland investments, says:
“The supply and demand
fundamentals are quite com-
pelling, as are the real-asset
characteristics – the hedge
against inflation, the ability
to provide income, the fact
that farmland has been resil-
ient across economic cycles,
the fact it diversifies any
portfolio. It’s going to be a
big growth area.”

Insight believes the
opportunities are signifi-
cant, with the global value
of farmland around $8tn,
while aggregate institu-
tional investment to date
amounts to somewhere
between $15bn and $25bn.
Many of the arguments in

favour of farmland are well
known. Jeremy Grantham,
co-founder and chief invest-
ment strategist at GMO, the
US asset manager, pointed
out last year that food pro-
duction will need to rise
between 60 and 100 per cent
by 2050 to feed a rapidly ris-
ing global population that
is increasingly able to
demand more resource-in-
tensive foods such as meat,
which create additional
demand for animal feed.
Taking into account

water shortages, climate
change and slowing growth
in crop yields, Mr
Grantham foresaw a “long-
term and politically danger-
ous food crisis”.
However, according to Mr

Schoen, until recently finan-
cial investors were not
needed in the sector, and
there was little incentive for
the most productive farmers
to welcome them in.

“The first wave of inves-
tors into farms over the
past 15 years was often left
disappointed because they
had the wrong managers in
the wrong geographies with
a misalignment of interests
between asset managers
and farmers,” he says.
“But we now have access

to top-class farmers who in
the recent past would not
have given us a look-in and
they are the ones offering
excellent returns. For an
investor the danger is to
not pick the right farms –
the top 25 per cent are
about 50 per cent better
than the rest.”
Aquila cites two reasons

for the improved opportu-
nity set. First, fewer than
half the farmers in the
developed world have iden-
tified a potential successor,
according to Farmtransfers,
a research project, as their

children increasingly
favour alternative careers.
This is likely to lead to

more merger and acquisi-
tion activity as these farms
are instead sold on, often to
other farmers. The UN’s
Food and Agriculture
Organisation estimated in
2009 that $208bn of private
capital would be needed to
finance this structural
change every year for the
foreseeable future.
However, the broader

scaling back of bank lend-
ing has created an “equity
gap” that offers “unprece-
dented investment opportu-
nities” for financial inves-
tors, Mr Schoen says.
He cites the case of a

dairy farmer in the Austral-
ian state of New South
Wales, who had to buy out
his siblings to take on the
family farm, as well as pay
his parents enough to retire
on. He also wanted to buy
an adjacent farm from an
elderly neighbour, offering
attractive economies of
scale, and needed a 75 per
cent loan-to-value deal to
finance both.
“Any banker up to five

years ago would have given
him a loan. Today, no
chance,” says Mr Schoen.
Instead Aquila bought a 70
per cent equity stake in the
combined operation.
“Before, these farmers

would not have talked to
you. Why would they have
given up their earnings
potential?”
Although Aquila takes

equity stakes, Mr Schoen
says the holding actually
works more like debt.
Aquila receives a guaran-
teed 3 per cent a year
return (assuming the
farmer can borrow to fund
this if he loses money), with
the farmer receiving the
next tranche of income and
the remainder split 70-30 in
Aquila’s favour.
Mr Schoen envisages pre-

tax, post-fee returns of 5-7
per cent a year from such
investments, plus a capital
gain resulting from the pro-
ductivity improvements he
believes are possible. After
15 years or so, he forecasts
the farmers will have
acquired enough capital to
buy Aquila out.
The German house argues

that, by teaming up with
“good, young expanding
farmers”, who retain an
equity stake in a farm,
rather than being tenants,
it is able to generate
“alpha”, ie to outperform
the asset class at large.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,
other investors believe they
are also perfectly capable of
generating alpha.
TIAA-CREF has invested

around $4bn of its $523bn of
assets in farmland since
2007. Its local affiliate asset
managers, who have an
agricultural investment
background, buy land and
then engage local tenant
farmers.
“We have been able to

identify tenants and local
operators who employ

responsible and modern
farming practices, and we
are able to support their
growth,” says Biff Ourso, a
director and portfolio man-
ager. He lauds the benefits
farmland brings to TIAA-
CREF’s portfolio, arguing it
is a good hedge against infla-
tion, has a low correlation to
other asset classes and has
historically provided a
return of 8-12 per cent,
including capital growth.
Insight also believes it

can generate alpha by mak-

ing improvements to farms,
for instance by building
infrastructure such as milk-
ing plants; improving irri-
gation and the genetics of
livestock; and by consoli-
dating small leasehold plots
into larger, more efficient
farms.
It has attracted long-term

investors such as pension
funds, family offices and
sovereign wealth funds, and
believes this approach can
generate annual returns of
12-15 per cent.

Larry Schloss, the under-
stated private equity expert
who safeguards the pension
money for New York City’s
police officers, firefighters
and teachers, is hunting
around quietly for a succes-
sor. But persuading ex-col-
leagues and acquaintances
from Wall Street to contem-
plate the job remains a
quixotic crusade.
“I’ve had one or two nib-

bles, but it’s amazing how
many people don’t want to
work in government. It’s
too bad,” says Mr Schloss,
who goes by the title of
New York City’s chief
investment officer. “My
time here has been spectac-
ularly interesting.”
Mr Schloss’s tenure of

three and a half years at
the helm of the city’s five
public pension funds
screeches to a halt at the
start of next year, thanks to
a decision by his boss John
Liu, the city’s comptroller,
to enter the race to succeed
Michael Bloomberg as
mayor. Mr Schloss, a self-
described independent,
holds no allegiance to
either former state gover-
nor Eliot Spitzer or Scott
Stringer, the two Democrats
vying to replace Mr Liu.
Soon, the 58-year-old

expects to leave his humble
office in the municipal
building across from City
Hall where the air condi-
tioning unit leaks and
return to the private sector,
where he bathed in success.
(He set up Diamond Castle,
a private equity firm, after
a 22-year stint at DLJ,
where he became chairman
of the group’s merchant
bank and a shorter spell
running Credit Suisse First
Boston’s global private
equity business.)
Indeed, it was Bill Mul-

row, a fellow DLJ alumnus
then working for Mr Liu,
who called in 2009 to see if
Mr Schloss would be inter-
ested in running the pen-
sion fund for a few years.
“I know nothing about pol-

itics. I have no political aspi-
rations or political tenden-
cies at all. I had never met
John Liu,” says the straight-
talking Queens native.
“The pitch was: ‘New

York City has $100bn in
pension money. It’s the
fifth-largest public pension
fund in the US and it hasn’t
been run particularly well.
You can come for two or
three years and try to make
an impact . . . You’ll meet all
of these interesting people
in government. Then you
can go back to your life’.”
“It just seemed like an

interesting thing,” Mr
Schloss says. “I’m from
New York City and I’ve
been involved in charities
raising money for cops and
firefighters killed in the line
of duty. So, I know a lot of
cops and firefighters and

they control two of the five
pension funds.”
His initiation into govern-

ment was a baptism of fire.
Upon his arrival in 2010, the
annualised 10-year return
on average for the five pen-
sion funds for the city’s
workers was 2.3 per cent,
while the funds’ actuarial
assumption was 8 per cent.
“Something wasn’t right,”

he says. So Mr Schloss and
his small team set about
changing the funds’ asset
allocation, which had not
been altered in five years,
as well as its investments.
The portfolio mix went

from roughly 70 per cent
invested in equities and the
remainder in fixed income,
to a less volatile combina-
tion of 65 per cent in equi-
ties and 35 per cent in the
debt markets. Considerable
money was made by buying
high-yield bonds and other
kinds of “opportunistic”
fixed income plays, and sell-
ing off inflation protected
and low-yielding govern-
ment debt.
Mr Schloss admits the

strategy is not foolproof and
rising interest rates will
crimp returns on debt. “My
successor is going to have
some work to do when rates
go back up.”
At a glance, Mr Schloss’s

efforts to turn things round
from his spartan command-
and-control centre seem vic-
torious. The funds’ assets
grew from $100bn to $140bn
since he has been in con-

trol, making it the fourth-
largest pension fund now,
and they carved out a 12.3
per cent return on average
in the year to June.
The teachers tend to

make more conservative
investment choices than the
police and fire departments,
clinging more closely to
passive equities. Mr Schloss
managed to convince the
trustees of the police, fire

and municipal workers’
money to invest up to 5 per
cent of their holdings in
hedge funds. Across the five
funds, more money was put
into emerging market equi-
ties as well as floating-rate
leveraged loans, private
equity and property.
But troubles still rumble

below the surface. And some
of them look hard to fix.
New York’s pension sys-

tem seems archaic com-
pared with more advanced
peers in the field. First,
there are five distinct funds:
one for teachers ($50bn);
another for firefighters
($9bn); a third for police
officers ($30bn); a fourth for
city workers ($48bn); and,
lastly, one for people who
work at schools but are not
educators ($3bn).
Each union employs its

own trustees, even though
the groups share about 90
per cent of investments.
Much to Mr Schloss’s cha-
grin, a proposal to merge
the five investment commit-
tees into a single one to cut
costs failed, thanks to polit-

ical undercurrents.
Another pitfall is that,

unlike peers such as Calp-
ers and Calstrs, California’s
two big pension funds, the
city’s pension group out-
sources all its investments
to BlackRock and 324 other
financial managers. It thus
invests only in funds. “Con-
sequently, we pay fees to
everyone . . . It’s a bit odd
that New York City, the
world’s financial capital,
outsources all of its invest-
ment management to
money managers,” laments
Mr Schloss. “You’ll save
money on the margin if you
do it in-house. The key is
not to give up the returns.”
He adds: “We have $140bn

in assets and we don’t own
one property because it’s all
in funds . . . I think we
should own some buildings
and save on fees and do
joint ventures with people.”
Bringing people on board

to manage money is also a
tedious process, due in part
to rules brought in years
ago after a corruption scan-
dal. While the time it takes
to hire a manager has been
shortened to nine months
from about 17, the rules are
the same ones the city uses
to “buy school buses and
pencils,” notes Mr Schloss.
Mr Schloss laments that

he does not pay his staff
well. The average person
who works in New York’s
bureau of investment man-
agement makes $100,000
and must live in one of the
five boroughs. “It’s not
enough,” says Mr Schloss.
“If you come out of Harvard
Business School and get a
starting job at a bank, you
get a couple of hundred
thousand dollars.”
Mr Schloss’s departure

from the job seems bitter-
sweet as he got such a kick
out of it. He is not lobbying
for a second act at the
municipal building, but he
makes the case that the
unspoken rule that the new
comptroller brings his own
chief investment officer
works against investors’
interests. “It’s not the right
way to manage money,” he
concludes. “If you look at
some of the other public pen-
sion funds, you’ll see that
the chief investment officer
is more of a staff job, and
the group in the investment
office stays, no matter who
the elected officials are.”

Opinion

Well-judged regulation is
important. Ill-judged
regulation, as in the case
of the financial transaction
tax (FTT) proposed by the
European Commission, is
harmful.
The pressure on the

commission mainly came
from the pro FTT French
and German governments
in response to public
opinion within their
countries. Plans for an EU-
wide FTT were scuppered
in 2012 by resistance from
the UK.
In February, the

commission put forward a
second draft, which is
currently the subject of
protracted negotiations
between the 11 states of
the “enhanced co-
operation” mechanism.
The commission’s

proposal is that the tax
will apply if at least one
party to the transaction is
established in a
participating member state
(known as the residence
principle), or if a financial

Financial transaction tax will ‘damage’ economy
instrument issued in a
participating state is
traded outside the 11
participating states (known
as the issuance principle).
This has already provoked
disagreement.
The British and

Americans in particular
have little enthusiasm for
the residence principle. It
would mean that for tax
purposes their financial
institutions would be
treated as resident in the
participating member
states, and they would
therefore have to pay tax,
simply because they enter
into transactions with
other financial institutions
resident in a participating
state. They would have to
make tax declarations in
all 11 countries and
establish the infrastructure
for meeting those tax
liabilities. The UK has
already lodged a challenge
at the European Court of
Justice.
The residence principle

may not only infringe the
right to the free movement
of capital but also the
international law principle
of territoriality. But should

individual states be able to
interfere with the tax
sovereignty of other
nations and impose tax
obligations on their
financial institutions?
The issuance principle is

also highly questionable.
How will Germany go

about collecting the tax if

you have a bank in China
selling German equities to
a bank in Australia? In
Germany, tax laws are
unconstitutional if they
are unenforceable. The
German focus, therefore,
will not be on the issuance
principle.
Compare this with

France, which introduced
an FTT based on this exact
principle. It will be
interesting to see which
side emerges on top.
Whatever the case, the
French model is proving to
be problematic, and not
only because of the decline
in the trading volume of
French equities.
Citing the principle of

territoriality, some German
banks are refusing to pay
the tax to France. If it does
nevertheless happen, the
situation will be absurd.
Since the tax is imposed
on the transaction, German
taxpayers dealing in
French equities could set
the tax against their
German tax liability.
Germany’s exchequer
would effectively be acting
as a source of revenue for
the French government.

In fact, the grounds on
which the FTT are based
are themselves
questionable. One of its
aims is to rein in high-
frequency trading, yet that
is already the case as a
result of the reform of the
European Markets in
Financial Instruments
Directive. Then there is the
purported goal of making
those who allegedly caused
the financial crisis help
pay for the clean up.
But the tax would also

be levied on private
investors. In the case of
investment funds, this
would have a direct impact
on fund assets, and
consequently on investors
themselves.
If we look at pensions,

the result would be a
striking paradox. On the
one hand, the state
provides billions of euros
in subsidies for pensions,
while on the other the tax
would take a hefty slice
out of investors’ savings.
For German financial

institutions, too, the
disadvantages would be
considerable, especially in
terms of competition with

other financial institutions
outside participating states.
Hubs, such as Luxembourg,
would benefit by attracting
new fund business away
from German supervisory
control.
This tax would be

economically damaging
and legally problematic,
and many of our decision
makers in Berlin are fully
aware of this. At the
moment, though, Berlin is
gearing up for national
elections, and no one is
prepared to voice criticism
of the FTPT for fear of
being seen as a friend of
the banking industry.
Most voters are in favour
of the FTT because they
do not realise that they
would also end up
paying it.
According to a survey

conducted by BVI, once
this misunderstanding is
clarified most voters will
end up deciding they are
against the tax. Let us
hope that common sense
returns after the elections.

Sound of silence from US fund houses

Some of the pieces makingup the equity marketspuzzle do not fit together
neatly.
Many analysts had predicted

that the slog back from the
depths of the financial crisis
would usher in a “new normal”
era of tepid returns. Instead,
several frantic bursts of growth
led the markets back to their
all-time highs this summer.
Even so, a picture of long-

term muted returns may be
what the jigsaw pieces add up
to after all. Look for clues, say
a few veteran market observers,
in the budgets of big US
advisory firms – or rather, in
what is missing from them.
The signs to seek are whether

large wealth managers are
making bold investments in
technology, staffing and
resources, or whether they have
settled into a mode of catch-up,
conversions, repairs and
maintenance.
It is not so strange to see

companies sitting on cash, says
Donald Robinson, chief
executive of Palladiem and a
former chief investment officer

at Smith Barney and BNY
Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors.
Uncertainty over fiscal policy,
regulatory overhauls and the
pace of the economic recovery
has frozen business activity in
many US sectors.
Nevertheless, when wealth

management companies that get
paid for their insights on
markets opt not to invest
themselves, it is a bellwether.
“These companies are choosing
to stay lean and mean,” Mr
Robinson says.
That does not mean their line

items list only zeroes. Just this
year, Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management touted a $500m
spend to bolster technology
systems, Merrill Lynch a $100m
consolidation of its portal for
advisers to use fee-based
products, and UBS the planned
appointment of 1,000 wealth
management and investment
banking support staff.
Much of that, however, has
followed cost cuts, deferred
projects, lay-offs and starved
budgets in recent years.
A better signal is whether

companies are funding
innovations on the US advisory
market’s wish list. For instance,
few houses can run a
traditional client portfolio that
also cleanly integrates “exotic”
holdings such as futures,
options, foreign securities, short
positions and complex fixed
income. Few have streamlined
basic functions of their custody
and portfolio accounting

systems – a leap that could
unlock great efficiencies. And
few can smoothly handle
multicurrency transactions or
optimise portfolio moves at the
tax-lot level.

All of those would be
expensive but market-leading
moves.
Other big ideas orbit the

industry. Paul Hatch, a former
investment products head at
Morgan Stanley’s brokerage,
says he is building a vehicle
that melds the lower cost
structure of an exchange traded
fund, the tax efficiency and
customisation of a separate
account, and the scalability of a
mutual fund. Which big
company will latch on to that
test rocket?
And the US market is still

tinkering with the long-
promised “unified managed

household”, a catch-all platform
that would let advisers run not
only a full slate of in-house
client assets, but also accounts
held elsewhere, all within a
single co-ordinated shell. Starter
kits exist, but a fully
operational version is nowhere
in sight.
If US wealth managers are

making outsized investments in
such groundbreaking projects,
they are being mighty quiet
about it. If they are not,
there are plausible excuses: one
is the challenge of getting
quarterly earnings-focused
public companies to commit
to long-term projects; another
just the need for a more
regular rhythm of revenue
growth before taking a step
forward.
A market-based explanation,

however, may be the most
likely. These firms simply do
not see galloping growth ahead,
and are unwilling to lay out big
sums, says Bevin Crodian, chief
executive of Fincastle
Consulting and a former EF
Hutton and Smith Barney
executive.
“If it was a bull market for

real, you would see firms
investing like crazy in their
businesses,” he says. “This tells
you no one believes that long-
only is a good bet.”
If that is the case, then US

advisory firms may well be
working on a different
puzzle: how to make the most
of markets in slow motion.

So, summer is over andeveryone in the moneyworld is getting ready for
the traditional autumn crisis. Of
course we will have the, now
time-honoured, eurozone
crackup farce. Show times will
be set and the cast members
announced after the German
election in two weeks, ready for
the IMF-World Bank meetings
in mid-October.
There may, though, be

something Different This Time.
You will notice that after the
spring and summer market
hiccups and corrections, a
couple of asset classes are not
only coughing, but coughing up
some blood. Emerging market-
traded debt and equities, even
after last week’s little rally,
have continued to lose
international investors’ cash
and confidence.
Multilateral Man, from the

IMF staff to the courtiers
whispering to rich countries’
heads of government, is
wondering if “EM” is turning
into a “systemic risk”. You
know, like “Lehman”. Do rich-
world investors or taxpayers
have to pay for the losses?
The answer, I believe, is that

there is a systemic risk
developing from the drain of
investor money out of emerging
market debt and equity funds,
but that risk is not an
immediate threat to the rich
world’s central banks,
commercial banks, investment
dealers or taxpayers. This time,
the systemic crisis will swirl
around EM central banks and
those dependent on their ability
to maintain independent
convertible currencies. When
you sell EM shares or bonds in
the years to come, you may not
get dollars or euros in return for
rupees or reals with quite the

same ease you have come to
expect. The losses, though, will
be spread out among the
broadly defined investor class,
rather than concentrated on the
balance sheets of large banks
and dealers that would have to
be recapitalised by rich-world
taxpayers.
The threat of financial crises

in the developing world
spreading to the rest of the globe
was supposed to have been seen
off after the Latin American
banking crisis of the late 1980s
and early 1990s, and the Asian
crisis of 1997, which followed a
collapse of fixed exchange rates
for overpriced and over-borrowed
local currencies. Huge foreign
exchange reserves were piled up
by EM central banks, who also
arranged bilateral currency swap
lines to prevent recurrences of
such shocks.
Those resources of ready cash

provided comforting bullet
points for the world’s securities
sales forces, who told rich-world
investors “never again” with
conviction.

And yet . . . trees don’t grow to
the sky, not even in Brazil or
India. Yes, the working-age
populations have been growing
faster than in Europe, Japan or
the US, but the highly skilled
part of the workforce in much
of the developing world is
smaller, and harder to increase
quickly, than you would
conclude from the advertising
inserts and dealers’ PowerPoint
presentations. According to a
recent report from Citi Research
discouragingly titled “Tourist
Traps”, real annual credit
growth in emerging markets
between 2004 and 2011 was, at
13.9 per cent, running at about
twice the rate of real growth in
gross domestic product.

Let us go back to the most
interesting example of right-
questions-asking to come out of
the Federal Reserve in recent
years: Governor Jeremy Stein’s
“Remarks” on February 7 of
this year. He wrote: “In
principle, what we’d really like
to know, for any given asset
class – be it subprime
mortgages, junk bonds or
leveraged loans – is this: what
fraction of it is ultimately
financed by short-term
demandable claims who are
likely to pull back quickly when
things start to go bad?”
Now, does not the idea of

being able to “pull back quickly
when things start to go bad”
sound like a good idea? If you
had the bad luck to be a US
money-centre bank lending to
Mexico in 1982, though, you
could not pull back quickly. If,
however, today you are an EM
debt mutual fund owner, or EM
equity exchange traded fund
holder, you can sell at a low
transaction cost with a double
click on your laptop screen.
Back in the 1980s and 1990s,

when sovereigns short of foreign
exchange restructured their
debt, bondholders tended to get
preferred treatment, since their
proportion of total obligations
was small, and litigating with
them was too much trouble. Not
so now. Since the 2008 financial
crisis, cumulative bank lending
to emerging markets has been
around $100bn. In contrast, EM
debt and equity portfolio
investment rose by more than
$700bn.
That is probably a bit more

than the global dealers’ market-
making desks will be willing to
put on their balance sheets if the
holders were to try and cut their
positions in a month or two.
That leaves two ways out for EM
central banks: pay the foreign
exchange to cover portfolio
investor sales out of their
reserves, or devalue to the point
where the would-be sellers give
up and hold on to the paper.
Oh, there is a third way. The

EM central banks can impose
capital controls.
Welcome to 1932.

Regulators around the world
have been focusing on how
financial companies deliver
advice to their clients. The
standards that apply to that
advice – especially how it is paid
for – have been the subject of
recent regulatory initiatives in
Australia, the US and Europe.
The official goals of these

initiatives are to eliminate
conflicts of interest that might
harm investors, and to help them
cope with the increasing
complexity of financial markets.
Less officially, these initiatives
aim to push investors into lower-
cost funds – something that fee
disclosure at a product level has
failed to do sufficiently, at least
in regulators’ eyes.
While the scope of the

initiatives varies, all incorporate
at least one of the following
elements: a ban on inducements,
and higher standards for advisers.
Virtually all of the proposals

call for such a ban – whether it
is called a retrocession, rebate,
sales load or commission.
Whatever the name, they all
involve payments from the
sponsor of an investment product
to the financial adviser who
recommends it. Bans are already
in place for at least some
products in Australia, the
Netherlands and the UK.
The bans eliminate incentives

for advisers to choose products
with high payouts to advisers,
even when a lower-fee option
might be better for their clients.
Instead, investors will pay

financial advisers for their
services directly, whether at an
hourly rate, as a percentage of
assets or as a fixed amount. But
whatever the schedule, investors
must agree to the fees in
advance. Australia’s “Future of
Financial Advice” reform
requires that investors opt in at
least once every two years.
Several of the proposals from

regulators also impose higher
standards on financial advisers
than previously. For example,
two of the proposals being
discussed in the US would
impose a “fiduciary standard” on
advisers, requiring them to
always put client interests ahead
of their own. By contrast, many
advisers working for brokerages
are currently only required to
make recommendations that are
“suitable”, but not necessarily
best, for their clients.
The UK Retail Distribution

Review takes a different route to
higher standards, by imposing an
educational mandate. Before
beginning to practice, advisers
must obtain a qualification,
which can involve extensive
study and multiple exams. They
must also stay up to date, with
35 hours of continuing education
each year.
Many of the initiatives

additionally encourage financial
houses to provide broad-based

advice to their clients. For
example, the UK regulations
specify that only advisers who
consider a range of retail
investment products can call
themselves “independent”.
The initiatives further aim to

close loopholes that subjected
some products to lighter
regulation than others. The
fiduciary-standard proposal from
the US Department of Labor falls
into this category. It would apply
the same oversight standards to
individual retirement accounts
that are in effect for other tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.
All of these initiatives have

been controversial. In fact, the
first to be implemented, the UK’s
Retail Distribution Review, was
discussed for more than six years
before it took effect in 2013.
Given the dramatic changes in

longstanding systems
necessitated by many of these
initiatives, the controversy is not
surprising. The cost can be
substantial. For example, Dutch
fund sponsors have had to offer
new “clean” fund share classes
stripped of any inducements.
Other critics have suggested

the initiatives may make
financial advice both less
accessible and more expensive.
They argue that investors who
need advice only occasionally
may have been best served by
the inducement approach.

The extended debate is a good
thing. First, prolonged discussion
allows more time for market
forces to operate while bringing
attention to the underlying
concerns. Indeed, the trend in
fees has been steadily downward
in the US as advisers and
investors have been encouraged
to take a closer look at costs.
Second, it provides more

opportunity to see the results of
the programmes that have
already been put in place. The
UK programme appears to have
had one of the intended effects,
which is to increase use of lower-
cost index funds. But it may also
have caused a 10 per cent
decrease in the number of
financial advisers.
While most of the discussion of

these trends to date has been at
the local level, investors
worldwide would benefit from
comparisons that identified
common experiences. We urge
both the industry and regulators
to look across borders for
relevant models.

Fire risk is a burning supply­chain issue

Investors grappling with
health and safety risks in
emerging-market supply
chains face new concerns
about factory fire hazards
in developed regions, with
Europe one of the biggest
laggards.
A report by the Supplier

Ethical Data Exchange
shows that supply chains
across a range of sectors in
Europe have the highest
level of factory fire risk,
while Africa has the lowest.
The findings, compiled by

independent auditors,
reveal 13.5 per cent of sup-
ply chains in Europe fail to
comply with safety meas-
ures, compared with 6.6 per
cent in Africa.
Asia, which has experi-

enced some devastating fac-
tory fires in Bangladesh

and Pakistan, where hun-
dreds of workers have died
in the past year, shows 12.7
per cent non-compliance,
North America 11 per cent
and South America 11.8 per
cent.
At country level, Roma-

nia has the highest propor-
tion of fire safety problems,
followed by Portugal, the
US, the Czech Republic and
Italy.
“Investors need to under-

stand that such risks and
hazards do not take place
only in developing coun-
tries. They must take a
proactive stance and engage
with companies in all
areas,” says Mark Robert-
son, a spokesman at Sedex,
which focuses on responsi-
ble and ethical business
practices within global sup-
ply chains.
Missing or inadequate

exit signs, lack of emer-
gency lighting, blocked
aisles, poor firefighting
equipment and missing or
outdated fire inspection cer-
tificates were some of the
main examples of non-com-
pliance in all countries sur-
veyed.
The garment trade has

come under renewed scru-

tiny since the collapse of
the Rana Plaza in Dhaka,
which housed several low-
cost clothing factories. The
research, however, shows a
range of sectors failing to
meet fire safety standards.
Manufacturing and phar-

maceutical sectors had the
highest level of fire risk glo-
bally, while agricultural
companies, which are par-
ticularly predominant in
Africa, had the lowest.
Fire safety comprises 32

per cent of health and
safety failings in global sup-
ply chains, according to
Sedex.
Companies have

responded to the Bangla-
desh disaster. Retailers
such as Sweden’s Hennes &
Mauritz, Spain’s Inditex,
which owns the Zara cloth-
ing chain, and Tesco, the
UK’s largest supermarket,
are among about 40, mostly
European, clothing and
retail brands sourcing from
Bangladesh that have
signed up to a binding
agreement. The Accord on
Fire and Building Safety in
Bangladesh aims to end the
cycle of factory disasters in
the country.
The factory safety pact

was set up by labour and
human rights groups such
as Industriall, a global
union representing workers
in mining, energy and man-
ufacturing, and the Interna-
tional Labor Rights Forum.
Since the tragedy, inves-

tors have become more
aware of such risks and are
adding their weight. More
than 200 global investors,
with about $2tn in managed
assets, from 16 countries in

North America, Europe and
Australia, have joined
forces to support the fac-
tory safety plan.
“We are engaging with

the apparel brands and
retailers we hold, as well as
North American trade asso-
ciations, to press them to
join [the accord] as we
believe it presents the best
path towards meaningful
sector reform,” Susana
McDermott, a representa-

tive of the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibil-
ity, which is leading the
investor group, told FTfm
in June.
The group is keen to get

more US retailers to sign up
to the plan, including Wal-
mart and Gap. Walmart has
faced renewed criticism
over factory safety in Bang-
ladesh on top of its refusal
to sign up to the binding
accord.

to infrastructure spending
over the next five years, but
domestic and foreign non-
governmental investors
remain wary of the political
and economic bottlenecks
facing the country.

The rupee hit new lows
last month, pushing inves-
tors to re-examine their
exposure to Indian infra-
structure, just months after
3i, the UK private equity
investment group, decided
to end all infrastructure
investment in the country.

David Sloan, director of
the Asia arm for Eurasia
Group, a political risk con-
sultancy, says recent cur-
rency turmoil will only fur-
ther undermine confidence
that was already waning.
He says: “Even before the

current rupee crisis, private

investors were very wary
about Indian infrastructure.
How foreign investors will
now hedge against further
rupee devaluations is the
million dollar question.”
Sasha Riser-Kositsky, an

Asia researcher at Eurasia
Group, says the biggest hur-
dle for Indian infrastructure
is land.
The World Bank’s com-

petitiveness index shows
that it takes 295 days to
acquire a lease for public
land in India – twice the
global average – and 99
days to acquire private
land, versus a global aver-
age of 61 days.
India’s infrastructure

development record is also
poor. Historically just one
in four greenfield infra-
structure projects have
been completed on time.
Investing in Indian infra-

structure therefore “has the
potential to be an enormous
mess,” Mr Kositsky says.
A drop in foreign flows to

Indian private equity infra-
structure-related deals fur-
ther demonstrates the grow-
ing unease among private
investors about projects in
the country, according to
Mr Sloan.
He estimates that there

were 56 private equity deals
relating to infrastructure in
2010, worth roughly $31bn.
In 2012, this dropped to 30
deals worth roughly $850m.
“I imagine that in 2013 the
numbers will be way
down,” Mr Sloan says.
But despite this bleak

outlook, there are pockets
of opportunity for investors
willing to invest long term.
Tanmaya Misra, the

Mumbai-based manager of
JPMorgan’s Asian Infra-
structure fund, has avoided
greenfield projects that
expose investors to con-
struction risk altogether.
Instead, he has prioritised

projects that promote sus-
tainability and benefit local
communities in order to
mitigate the political and
regulatory risk of permits
being declined when
projects become unpopular
with local communities.
Mr Misra adds that

JPMorgan’s current invest-
ments in Indian infrastruc-
ture have been unaffected
by the recent currency
movements, as such fluctu-
ations tend to affect
projects in their building
phase when equipment
needs to be imported.
He also shakes off con-

cerns over India’s energy
market, which depends
heavily on oil imports.
Roads, for example, coun-
ter-intuitively benefit from
fuel price increases, as driv-
ers that usually opt for
longer, cheaper routes
instead take toll roads to
save on fuel costs.
Unless there is a severe

drop in gross domestic
product growth, which is
still at 4-5 per cent a year,
Mr Misra believes road traf-
fic will remain at a similar
level, to the benefit of
investors in road projects.

In a recent research
report, JPMorgan points
out that India’s urban popu-
lation is set to double to
500m by 2030. The urbanisa-
tion process in developed
countries, however, is likely
to come to an end, with
90 per cent of developed
populations already living
in cities.
With the city populations

likely to boom, urban
healthcare is consequently
another area Mr Misra has
honed in on, having
invested in two Indian
hospitals, including a
15,000-bed private facility in
Mumbai.
Mr Riser-Kositsky adds

that private sector ports are
another bright spot for
Indian infrastructure.
“There is substantial for-
eign interest in ports,
mainly because there is rec-
ognition by a number of big
multinationals that India
will need more coal
imports,” he says.
“Even if [India’s ports] do

not look good in the short
term, they do in the long
term, as India will import
coal from Australia and
Indonesia and export iron
ore when iron ore imports
ramp up again,” he adds.
Mr Misra expects care-

fully selected infrastructure
investments in India and
elsewhere in Asia to return
15-20 per cent a year net of
fees, based on current deal
underwriting by JPMor-
gan’s investment teams.

However, Eurasia’s Mr
Sloan remains unconvinced
by the “positive announce-
ments” from India’s govern-
ment regarding its commit-
ment and ability to attract
infrastructure spending.
Although the government

has recognised that infra-
structure investment is a
“huge problem” for the
country, doubts linger over
how rapidly administrative
change is taking place.
The government

announced that 36 stalled
infrastructure projects were
cleared in August, but other
reports suggest up to $3bn
of investment remains
blocked, according to Mr
Sloan.
He says: “The govern-

ment has set ambitious fis-
cal deficit targets and capi-
tal spending has been
slashed in a huge way.
“Because of that, the gov-

ernment will not be able to
meet its commitment for
infrastructure spending.
There is not much that is
positive to say on India at
the moment.”

USA all the way for JPMorgan

Fund of funds veteran Tony
Lanning is looking to the
US stock market to drive
the performance of his new
JPMorgan Fusion product
range.

The five multi-manager
funds, which avoid buying
individual companies and
instead focus on buying
other funds, were launched
in March to cater for a vari-
ety of risk appetites.

The JPMorgan Asset Man-
agement (JPMAM) range
includes Income, Conserva-
tive, Balanced, Growth and
Growth Plus, which takes
the highest levels of risk.

Mr Lanning, who was
once head of multi-manager
operations at Gartmore and
until recently ran funds at
Henderson Global Investors,
that group’s new owner,
says his initial portfolios are
characterised by a focus on
US equities.

“The US economy is in
rude health. US equities
have performed well – we do
need earnings growth to
come through for companies
to move on, but there is no
evidence that this won’t
happen,” he says.

The Fusion range’s US
equity exposure varies from
10 per cent in the lowest-
risk Income fund, to 43 per
cent in Growth Plus.

Holdings include
exchange traded funds that
track the S&P 500 and MSCI
USA indices of US shares.

The manager has also
invested in a number of
JPMAM’s funds, such as
Clare Hart’s £1.8bn US
Equity Income fund, and
has additionally bought into
the US Large Cap Equities
fund from Robeco, the
Dutch asset manager.

Mr Lanning is broadly
positive about equities on a
global basis, though he
remains more cautious on
Europe and Japan than
many of his peers.

In those two regions his
Fusion funds are neutrally
positioned, compared with
the basic strategic asset
allocation model set by
JPMorgan’s private bank
strategists.

“I am very aware that
when markets sell off,
Europe sells off more, and

there are still some bumps
along the road,” Mr Lanning
says.

“In Europe, we have
moved from underweight to
neutral. We have not gone
overweight yet, but we have
gone more cyclical with the
holdings we have.”

He admitted that having a
lower weighting towards
Japan than many of his
peers had been “a bit of a
headwind” so far in 2013, as
the nation’s markets rallied.

He maintains, however,
that the Japanese govern-
ment “still has some work
to do”.

Other star names backed
by Mr Lanning include

Hugh Young’s Aberdeen
Asia Pacific fund, which
makes up a significant por-
tion of each of the five
Fusion funds’ Asian equity
exposure, and Liontrust’s
Jan Luthman and Stephen
Bailey.

The duo’s Liontrust Macro
Equity Income fund features
in three of Mr Lanning’s
funds.

Within fixed income, Ian
Spreadbury’s Fidelity Mon-
eybuilder Income fund and
Bill Gross’s Pimco Total
Return bond fund feature
heavily in four of the five
portfolios, alongside the
JPMorgan Aggregate Bond
fund, run by Nick Gartside
and Iain Stealey, and
Pimco’s UK Corporate Bond
fund.

“In fixed income we have
a much lower duration –
about three years – than
most, but we are adding
duration a little,” Mr Lan-
ning says.

“It is clear interest rates
are going to rise, but not in
the next 12 months.

“There is a difference
between travelling and
arriving. Markets should
interpret tapering as a good
thing.”

BMO targets ‘aggressive
but achievable’ expansion

Canada’s BMO Global Asset
Management wants to
become one of the world’s
top 50 money managers by
2017 on the back of a series
of acquisitions in the US,
Hong Kong and London.

With assets of $130bn at
the end of April, BMO
ranked as the world’s 75th-
largest money manager, up
from 96th place in 2010.

But Rajiv Silgardo, co-
chief executive of BMO, pre-
dicts assets will grow to
more than $300bn over the
next three and a half years
as the fund house reaches
new clients through its
expanded geographic reach.

“Asset management really
is a key focus area [for the
wider Bank of Montreal
group],” says Mr Silgardo,

who spoke exclusively to
FTfm during a recent visit
to London.

Peter Routledge, an ana-
lyst at National Bank of
Canada, says BMO’s target
for asset growth is “aggres-
sive but achievable”.

Mr Routledge warns, how-
ever, that it would be hard
for BMO to meet its target
through organic growth
alone.

“The question is whether
BMO would dare to do a big
transformational deal or
remain cautious and pru-
dent,” he says, adding that
it could make more strategic
sense to pursue small
bolt-on deals.

Mr Silgardo, part of a 10-
strong team that joined
from Barclays Global Inves-
tors in 2009, says exchange
traded funds are a signifi-
cant plank of BMO’s expan-
sion plans.

ETF assets at BMO have
grown to $11.5bn at the end
of July since the launch of
the ETF arm four years ago.
Mr Silgardo says it took
years to build the infra-
structure to market ETFs

but that the business has
now gathered momentum,
pulling in $2.8bn of inflows
during the first seven
months of 2013.

Mr Silgardo says BMO
aims to differentiate itself
from other providers by
building sophisticated “out-
come-orientated strategies”
via ETFs.

It just launched six “man-
aged solutions” portfolios
that combine actively man-
aged funds and/or passively
managed ETFs, depending
on a clients’ risk appetite.

ETFs had made access to
a variety of investment solu-
tions cheaper, more trans-
parent and simpler, accord-
ing to Mr Silgardo.

“Rather than just using
ETFs to provide access to an
asset class, clients are ask-
ing if we can make their
investment strategies more
sophisticated, to lower port-
folio volatility and to gener-
ate more consistent streams
of income,” he says.

He adds that BMO had as
much ability to compete as
any other company in this
“second act” for ETFs, by

offering these more sophisti-
cated strategies to clients in
the US, Europe and Asia.

BMO has almost as large a
presence in the US as it does
in Canada after its 2011
acquisition of Marshall &
Ilsley, a Midwest banking
group.

BMO combined the acqui-
sition with Harris, a bank-
ing group it bought in 1984.
These deals have helped it
become the eighth-largest
bank by assets in North
America.

The Marshall & Ilsley deal
expanded BMO’s distribu-
tion capabilities in the US
significantly, which the
asset manager wants to har-
ness “more efficiently”.

John Aiken, an analyst at
Barclays, says that one of
BMO’s strengths in the US
is its private client group.
The purchase of M&I dou-
bled the number of BMO’s
wealthy US clients to
around 240,000, bringing fur-
ther scale to its operations
in this area.

“The economics are very
compelling if BMO can sell
more proprietary products

to these wealth clients,”
says Mr Aiken.

The fund group has also
been expanding in Asia and
sees “real opportunities” in
Europe, where large pools of
accessible capital exist,
according to Mr Silgardo.

In 2008, BMO bought Pyr-
ford, a London-based devel-
oped equity markets active
manager. And in 2011, it
completed the acquisition of
Lloyd George Management,
an emerging markets spe-
cialist based in Hong Kong.

BMO has long had a pres-
ence in China, stretching
back decades. It employs
about 500 staff in the coun-
try, mainly in trade finance
and capital markets activi-
ties. In 2012, it acquired a 20
per cent stake (the maxi-
mum permitted for a foreign

investor) in Cofco Trust, a
subsidiary of one of China’s
largest state-owned enter-
prises that is involved in
agriculture and financial
services.

BMO now intends to
expand its asset manage-
ment capabilities and is
planning to build an invest-
ment platform to offer its
investment products to
Asian clients.

“One of the first uses for
the investment platform
would be ETFs,” says Mr Sil-
gardo. A listing is planned
for 2014 after “going through
the necessary plumbing”.

“BMO has done exception-
ally well in building up its
ETF business in Canada and
it makes sense to try to rep-
licate that in Asia,” says Mr
Aiken.

ETFs: time
to call the
plumbers?

Exchange traded funds are
driving a revolution in
financial markets and the
pace of change is accelerat-
ing.
But as ETFs become

increasingly popular, more
questions are being asked
about their risks.

Critics cite a number of
recent difficulties in trad-
ing ETFs as evidence that
problems in the industry’s
“plumbing” systems flare
up in periods of market
stress. They complain that
the rapid growth of the ETF
industry is concentrating
risks and could threaten
large scale market disrup-
tion.
ETF managers vehe-

mently dispute these
claims. They say that the
critics misunderstand how
ETFs perform and the bene-
fits they offer investors.
Mark Wiedman, global

head of iShares, the ETF
arm of BlackRock, the
world’s largest fund man-
ager, says ETFs acquitted
themselves “with flying
colours” in the latest bout
of market turmoil in late
May and June.
ETF activity tends to rise

significantly when market
volatility increases. Mr
Wiedman says that fact has
provided investors with
greater confidence that
ETFs are robust in periods
of stress.
He predicts that “ETFs

will play a much bigger role
in global capital markets as
both institutional and retail
investors become more
comfortable with advan-
tages offered by this new
technology”.
Global inflows into ETFs

(funds and products)
reached $148.5bn in the first
seven months of the year,
up 13.8 per cent compared
with the same period in
2012, according to ETFGI, a
consultancy.
The strength of the over-

all inflows is notable as it

has coincided with severe
weakness in two previously
vital drivers of the indus-
try’s growth, gold and
emerging markets ETFs,
where investors have with-
drawn more than $40bn so
far this year.
The US ETF market

remains the primary gener-
ator of growth, responsible
for almost 80 per cent of
global inflows this year,
helped by the S&P 500’s
rally to an all-time high.
Scott Ebner, global head

of product development and
research at State Street Glo-

bal Advisors, says some
observers describe the US
ETF market as mature but
it is still in a growth phase.
Mr Wiedman echoes this,

saying ETFs are becoming
the preferred vehicle of
choice for passive exposures
for both US financial advis-
ers and retail investors, out-
side 401k retirement plans.
“But there is much more

growth ahead. With $750bn
invested by US retail inves-
tors in ETFs compared with
their holdings of $10.2tn in
US active mutual funds,
ETFs still have a lot of

catching-up to do,” he says.
In the US, ETFs regularly

trade more than $60bn on a
daily basis, regularly
accounting for a quarter of
all US stock market activity
by value.
“ETFs are attractive to

both long-term holders due
to their low fees as well as
active traders because of
their tight spreads,” says
Phil Mackintosh, global
head of trading strategy at
Credit Suisse.
Critics argue that ETFs

linked to less liquid under-
lying assets, such as high

yield bonds, have not lived
up to their expected stand-
ards when volatility rises.
But industry participants

reject this charge.
“The costs of trading

some ETFs may be higher
in times of market stress.
But ETF trading takes place
in a highly competitive
environment and the addi-
tional utility that ETFs
offer via intraday trading is
extremely valuable,” says
Mr Ebner.
Mr Wiedman adds that

growing trading volumes
in fixed income ETFs dem-
onstrate that more inves-
tors want to transact in a
public marketplace where
prices are transparent
rather than via opaque
over-the-counter transac-
tions.
The industry’s rapid

growth is leading to
mounting competitive pres-
sures, particularly in the
US.
Providers loathe the sug-

gestion that they are fight-
ing a “price war” to secure
market share, aware that
their profit margins could
suffer if they cut charges
aggressively without a cor-
responding increase in
asset growth.
Most product launches,

however, are competitively
priced against established
rivals, as demonstrated
recently by Charles

Exchange traded funds

Deutsche Bank and
Lyxor have revamped their
business models to respond
to these new competitive
pressures.
“We expect to see more

managers from around the
world wanting to enter the
European ETF market to
offer investors access to a
wider range of expertise
from within the asset man-
agement community,” says
Matt Johnson, European
head of distribution at ETF
Securities, the London
based provider.
Asian ETF markets,

while at a much earlier
stage of development, are
also developing rapidly,
most clearly in China
where the process of liber-
alising capital markets has
led to a spate of new prod-
ucts being launched.
But other Asian coun-

tries are also innovating,
such as the Philippines
which has just started

accepting listing applica-
tions for ETFs.
As the industry develops,

it remains unclear just
how many of the large
existing array of sub-scale
ETFs have a sustainable
long-term future. A record
number of products closed
in the first half of the
year, suggesting a growing
realism among providers
that not every launch will
prosper.
Mr Mackintosh at Credit

Suisse notes that the
majority of assets are in
ETFs that have an expense
ratio less than 30 basis
points while trading is
heavily concentrated in
products with a bid-ask
spread less than 3bp,
underlining the cut-throat
level of competition.
With 4,883 exchange

traded funds and products
currently available, it
might appear that the lim-
its of innovation are being

Schwab’s new smart beta
range which undercut
established rivals.
In Europe, significant

changes are also afoot.
BlackRock, already the

largest player in Europe,
acquired Credit Suisse’s
ETF operations earlier this
year as part of a move to
boost its presence in Swit-
zerland. Warburg Pincus,
the private equity group,
has said it would like to
acquire ETF businesses in
Europe while Amundi, the
French asset manager, has
signalled its appetite to act
in any consolidation wave.
Vanguard has rapidly

accumulated more than
$1bn in assets just a year
after launching its first
European listed ETFs
while SSgA’s European
operations have picked up
pace and new entrants
such as First State are con-
tinuing to target the
region.

tested, as shown by the
sceptical reaction that fol-
lowed recent proposals for
a Bitcoin ETF.
However, as the strong

demand this year for cur-
rency hedged Japanese
equity ETFs has demon-
strated, even relatively
simple product innovations
can generate significant
inflows if they meet inves-
tors’ needs.
Mr Wiedman at iShares

points out that fixed
income markets remain rel-
atively untapped by ETFs.
“Assets held in fixed

income ETFs at just over
$300bn make up just a
small part of the $100tn
invested in bond markets
globally. But we expect to
see much greater adoption
as fixed income ETFs
develop greater liquidity
and bond-like analytics
become more readily avail-
able,” he says.
Another potentially rich

seam for exploitation lies
in advanced or smart beta
strategies that offer a dif-
ferent balance of risks and
returns than that attached
to conventional market
capitalisation products.
Advanced beta strategies

have been long used by
sophisticated institutional
investors but these man-
dates were frequently
undisclosed. Although the
smart beta term is some-
times misused, ETF flows
have given such strategies

Another unexplored area

lies with active ETFs. US

ban on the use of deriva-
tives in new ETFs, a move
which is expected to pave
the way for new products
Building momentum

ETFs: time to call in the plumbers?

Plumbing problems, brokenpipes and blockages – itwould be easy to think
the exchange traded fund sector
had become the sewer of the
financial markets if critics of
ETFs were to be believed.
Indeed, proponents of the ETF

structure, which was once
perceived as simple and
transparent, believe the market
is under a sustained attack
from traditional asset managers.
ETFs’ cheerleaders believe

long-established fund houses
have looked on rather enviously
as global ETF assets have risen
to almost $2.2tn since the first
ETF was launched in 1993, and
are ever ready to go on the
offensive.
The latest assault started in

early summer when a spate of
redemptions caused disruptions
in the “plumbing” of several
ETFs, which in turn caused
many ETFs to tumble below the
value of their underlying assets.
Emerging-markets funds were

among the worst affected as
investors took fright that the
end of Federal Reserve
monetary easing would lead to
outflows from developing
countries.
The upshot was that on one

day at the end of June
Citigroup stopped accepting
orders to redeem underlying
assets from ETF issuers after
one trading desk reached its
allocated risk limits. State

Street also stopped accepting
cash redemption orders for
municipal bond products from
dealers.
Tim Coyne, global head of

ETF capital markets at State
Street, told the FT at the time
that his company had contacted
participants “to say we were
not going to do any cash
redemptions today” though
redemptions “in kind” were still
taking place. Jim Ross, State
Street’s global head of ETFs,
later wrote to investors: “In
recent weeks, articles
questioning the performance of
ETFs during periods of

increased market volatility have
painted an inaccurate picture.
This underscores the continued
need for ongoing education to
ensure investors and industry
observers understand how ETFs
are structured, traded and
regulated.” The tumble in asset
prices had, however, exposed
cracks in the pipework.
Terry Smith, chief executive

of Fundsmith and an ardent
critic of ETFs, told FTfm: “It is
not just the plumbing that is at
fault. These products are
misunderstood and very
probably mis-sold.” You cannot
make an underlying illiquid
asset liquid by putting it in a
wrapper and simply calling it
an ETF, he says.
Siu Kee Chan, an investment

manager at ING Investment
Management, adds that the
“plumbing issues” should mark
“the start of a move back to
basics” for ETFs. But are the
problems overblown? “Yes,”
according to Alan Miller, chief

investment officer of SCM
Private, an investment manager
that builds portfolios using
ETFs. “What other investment
industry offers thousands of
different products and yet none
have gone bust, or even had to
suspend its operations?
Considering the amazing
diversity of underlying assets
offered, it is quite an accolade
that investors have always been
protected,” he says.
He believes some providers of

traditional mutual funds are
exploiting the situation. “Most
commentators have failed to
consider what would have
happened if this situation was
mirrored within a mutual fund
with the same size and
proportionate outflows – would
it have met redemptions by the
next day? Would the fund have
been suspended?”
Patrick Dunne, head of global

markets and investments for
iShares, the world’s largest
provider of ETFs, adds: “At

times of extreme market stress,
any financial instrument can be
affected by structural
inefficiencies in the capital
markets. However, ETFs
continue to perform as they are
designed to do, allowing
investors to move quickly and
efficiently in and out of
investment exposures.”
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at Source,
the London based ETF provider,
agrees: “The suggestion that
there are fundamental problems
with the plumbing of the ETF
industry is totally inaccurate.”
ETF providers feel aggrieved,

but it is safe to assume the
fund structure is no longer as
simple as it was once claimed.
The Bank of England had
previously warned that the
risks associated with swap-
based ETFs, for example, were
not being made clear to
investors and that ETFs are
“characterised by increasing
complexity, opacity and
interconnectedness”.
A perhaps more measured

Peter Sleep, senior portfolio
manager at 7IM, offers some
final thoughts: “ETFs are not
simple but I think they are as
reasonably safe, or at least as
safe, as the underlying assets.
ETFs are like a glass bottles;
they can contain water or they
can contain nitroglycerine.
“They are as safe as the

contents. If you buy junk bonds
you should not expect
something that is safer than
junk bonds. You get what it
says on the tin,” adds Mr Sleep,
who sounds as if he has the
makings of being a good
plumber.

The exchange traded fund
market in Asia has been
growing rapidly over the
past decade. Industry
participants, however, say
there is much more to be
done in terms of investor
education if the market is
to mature.
The Asian ETF market

as a whole has grown to
some $150bn in size from
just $35bn a decade ago,
with currently about 550
products on offer,
compared with 35 then,
according to Jackie Choy,
Hong Kong-based ETF
strategist at Morningstar.
That growth is limited to

the bigger stock exchanges
in the region, however, as
Asian investors typically
gravitate to products that
have higher trading
volumes. This is driven by
the misbelief that the more
heavily-traded ETFs have
greater liquidity.
This posts “a huge

problem” for the smaller
exchanges, says Marco
Montanari, Hong Kong-
based head of passive asset
management for Asia
Pacific at Deutsche Asset
& Wealth Management
(DeAWM).
The Philippines, which is

in the midst of gearing up
for the advent of its first
batch of ETFs, may
potentially bear the brunt
of that liquidity
misconception.
“If investors in the

Philippines have the same
misconception of looking
for the most traded ETFs,
they will not buy in the
Philippines . . . they will
just look for ETFs listed in
Hong Kong or somewhere
else,” Mr Montanari says.
Even for the bigger ETF

markets, such as Japan,
Hong Kong, China and
South Korea, the lack of
understanding among
investors that the true
liquidity of an ETF lies in
its underlying investments
has been responsible for
drawing investors to
Europe or US-listed ETFs.

Mr Montanari takes the
view that for the Asian
ETF market to grow,
investors would have to
pile into locally domiciled
products in the region,
which are also more
advantageous for investors
themselves for tax and
timezone reasons.
Frank Henze, Hong

Kong-based head of ETFs
for Asia Pacific at State
Street Global Advisors,
agrees that a large amount
of Asian money is parked
in offshore vehicles.
In Japan, for instance, a

lot of investors are buying
into US-domiciled products
with underlying Japanese

investments, he says.
He also points out that

the Asian ETF arena is
multifaceted in terms of
the pace of growth,
product demand and
regulatory landscape in
different countries.
While Hong Kong stands

out with a focus on
providing access to China,
South Korea is unique in
that it has a robust retail
investor base with inverse
and leveraged products
being traded “very
rapidly”.
China and Japan,

meanwhile, are
domestically-oriented
markets, where there is
strong demand for
products with local
underlying investments, he
says.
For BlackRock’s iShares,

South Korea is one of the
markets that has shown
the strongest growth in the
preceding eight months,
with “a lot of institutional
usage” in its US-listed
products, says Jane Leung,
the company’s Hong Kong-
based head of Asia Pacific,
citing a $400m inflow from
a single insurer.
Ms Leung also believes

that investor education is
crucial for the growth of
the industry in Asia, where
the development of

onshore products is still in
a “very nascent” stage.
“It does take time for

liquidity to build,” she
says, citing the flagship
iShares FTSE A50 China
Index ETF in Hong Kong
as an example. That fund,
which was launched in
2004, “didn’t start taking
off until four to five years
later in terms of liquidity
and trading volume”.
BlackRock is also patient

about gaining steam with
its recently launched dim
sum bond ETF. The
iShares RMB Bond Index
ETF, which went public in
Hong Kong in June, is the
first offshore renminbi
bond ETF in Asia. The
launch generated much
talk in the industry amid
concerns over the low
liquidity of the offshore
renminbi bond market.
Ms Leung says the

trading volume of the
product has been low so
far but that is “expected”
as the fund is targeting
retail assets. “We’re going
through a lot of education
with the public in terms of
how this product works.
We expect it will take time
to build both the liquidity
and education for this
fund.”
In Asia, about 80 per

cent of ETF assets are
sourced from institutional
investors, with the rest
from the retail public,
industry participants
estimate.
DeAWM’s Mr Montanari

believes it will take at
least five to 10 years before
ETFs gain traction among
retail investors in Asia.
While making “huge
efforts” in educating
investors, he believes it is
“too soon” to target Asian
retail assets right now.
Vanguard, one of the

US’s biggest ETF
providers, is nonetheless
upbeat about its end goal
of penetrating the Asian
retail market with its low-

cost strategy. It listed its
first product in Hong Kong
in May, the Vanguard
FTSE Asia ex-Japan Index
ETF.
“We haven’t been here

that long, but we expect
that history will prove us
right: people will be more
and more fee-sensitive . . . it

tends to happen when the
market gets more mature,”
says Shelly Painter,
Vanguard’s Hong Kong-
based regional managing
director, pointing to the
company’s success in
attracting retail inflows in
the US. It considers
Japan, Hong Kong and

Singapore as core retail
markets, while China and
Taiwan offer more
opportunities in the
institutional space, she
says. “The industry is so
new in China, you’ll
probably see a quick shift
to ETFs from mutual
funds.”

Education

growth, say
providers

‘We haven’t been
here long but we
expect history to

more fee-sensitive’

$7.3m for allegedly market-
ing leveraged ETFs to small
investors without proper
due diligence. The broker-
ages were also ordered to
pay a total of $1.8m in resti-
tution to investors.
Also in May, brokerage

RBC Capital Markets
agreed to reimburse Massa-
chusetts investors up to
$2.9m and paid a $250,000
fine to state regulators for
selling leveraged ETFs to
inappropriate investors and

failing to train and super-
vise sales staff.
That was followed in Sep-

tember by the federal court
of Manhattan dismissing a
class-action lawsuit against
specialist ETF provider Pro-
Shares after thousands of
investors alleged the pro-
vider did not include warn-
ings about the products
being inappropriate for
most retail investors and
did not outline the risks of
holding the products for
longer than a day.
In May this year, Direx-

ion, another ETF specialist,
settled a similar $8m class
action lawsuit. Direxion did
not, however, admit any
wrongdoing in the settle-
ment.
Andy O’Rourke, manag-

ing director and chief mar-
keting officer at Direxion,

It takes a brave company to
launch an inverse or lever-
aged exchange-traded fund.
The products attracted
severe criticism following
the 2008 financial crisis and
have been the subject of a
number of multimillion dol-
lar lawsuits and regulatory
fines in the US over the
past couple of years.
They were even accused

by a Federal Reserve econo-
mist in August of contribut-
ing to market volatility dur-
ing the financial crisis and
European sovereign debt
crisis in 2011.*
But for the founders of

Boost ETP, a UK-based bou-
tique ETF provider that has
launched 36 such products
since starting up two years
ago, leveraged and inverse
ETFs have been unfairly
maligned.
“The products have done

exactly what they said they
were going to do,” says Nik
Bienkowski, co-chief execu-
tive and co-founder of
Boost. “Five or six years on,
the products are still the
same but the information
and education supporting
them is much better.”
Leveraged and inverse

ETFs are sophisticated
products that were designed
as short-term trading
instruments, rather than
for use by buy-and-hold
investors. Leveraged ETFs
make use of derivatives and
debt to provide professional
investors with returns of up
to three times an index, but
they can also deliver up to
three times the losses.
Inverse ETFs, meanwhile,

are designed to move in the

opposite direction to an
index. These can also make
use of leverage to amplify
the gains or losses. Profes-
sional investors often use
them for just a few days at
a time to bet on a particular
movement in the market.
But the problems

emerged for these products
when not-so-sophisticated
investors piled into them,
buoyed by the promises of
three times the returns of
traditional passive prod-
ucts. Many of these inves-
tors held on for too long
and watched in horror dur-
ing the financial crisis as
their expected magnified
gains turned into magnified
losses.
The problem became

more acute thanks to the
requirement for these prod-
ucts to be rebalanced daily,
meaning that the underly-
ing assets need to be
bought and sold to ensure
the funds replicate the cor-
responding index. The
result is that the products
do not perform well during
periods of choppy markets.
“The 2007-9 period was

the worst time for these
products to launch as it was
so volatile,” says Mr
Bienkowski. “These are not
the best funds to buy dur-
ing volatile periods, unless
you are checking on them
frequently. But that’s when
they were launched in the
US.”
Over the past few years

there have been a number
of US lawsuits and actions
by regulators where inves-
tors claim they were not
given enough information
about how these products
would perform and how
they should be managed.
In May last year, the

Financial Industry Regula-
tory Authority fined Wells
Fargo, Citigroup, Morgan
Stanley and UBS a total of

says: “The court cases are
behind us. There was never
a court ruling against the
products. Certainly some
people are realising that
these products aren’t for
them. Other people can
move forward knowing
that.”
While the providers of

inverse and leveraged ETFs
feel the reputation of their
products has been unfairly
damaged as a result of the
legal cases, they have
responded with more promi-
nent educational drives.
Boost provides factsheets

and other educational mate-
rial about the products on
its website to be used by
financial advisers if their
clients ask about them.
Meanwhile, Direxion has

an online course on its web-
site that takes 45 minutes to

complete and offers an
introduction to the funds.
“We have never had any

interest in seeing anyone
use them who should not be
investing in them,” adds Mr
O’Rourke. “If they do not
understand them, almost
certainly they will have a
bad time and are more
likely not to use them
again.”

Domenick Pugliese, a
partner in the corporate
practice of Paul Hastings,
adds: “The sponsors of
these products have done a
pretty good job of describ-
ing in their prospectuses
the pros and risks of the
products. The prospectuses
are clear.

20 FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013

Exchange traded funds

When it comes to exploring the
intricacies of the exchange traded
fund industry, it is all too easy to
get bogged down in the details of
who is winning and who is losing
market share.

At first glance, the data for 2013
paint a similar picture to previous
years, revealing iShares as the
provider flexing the most muscle in
terms of ETF assets globally with
over $820bn, according to figures
from ETFGI, a consultancy that
monitors trends in the industry.

With almost a 41 per cent share
of the global ETF market, the
BlackRock division is comfortably
ahead of its closest competitor,
SPDR ETFs, which has $346bn of
global assets.

It has also been a year in which
iShares, the world’s largest ETF
provider, got even bigger following
its acquisition of the ETF division
of Credit Suisse in January.

As a result of the deal, iShares
now commands 49.7 per cent of the
European market.

While iShares is some way ahead
of its competitors, a deeper delve
into the figures reveals that players
both large and small are embroiled
in a fierce battle for assets.

According to the ETFGI figures,
Vanguard topped net inflows on a
global basis to the end of July,
registering some $36.2bn. This
surpassed net new assets pulled in
by iShares, which registered
$32.5bn during the same period.

iShares has also seen its heels
nipped at in Europe. Although it is
still ahead of the pack with $10.6bn
of net new assets in Europe so far
this year, Source and Vanguard
were the next two providers to win
the biggest amount of assets with
$1.9bn and $1.4bn respectively.

However, it seems that placing
too much emphasis on where the
providers fall in the rankings is
unlikely to provide any clues as to
who will win the battle for assets
over the longer term.

“Everyone seems to focus on
where one provider ranks compared
with another, and they forget that
growth in the size of the ETF
market overall is the main factor
that will drive expansion,” says
Simon Klein, head of exchange
traded products, Emea and Asia at
Deutsche Asset & Wealth
Management.

Deutsche is currently Europe’s

second largest ETF provider with
$48.3bn of assets, according to
ETFGI figures.

“If the market as a whole is
expanding, then all providers’
businesses will expand accordingly.
Especially in Europe, there is a lot
of scope for the ETF market to
expand,” Mr Klein adds.

“A rising tide lifts all boats, so all
providers should see their
businesses grow.” Deutsche, which
last year moved its db X-trackers
unit into its asset and wealth
management arm, has also
benefited from strong investor
demand for physical ETFs.

According to ETFGI figures,
physical ETFs saw net inflows of
$12.6bn to the end of July,
compared to outflows of $2.7bn
from synthetic products.

Mr Klein says that “the move into
Deutsche Asset & Wealth
Management has tied in nicely with
our move to be a provider of
physical ETFs. The retail and
wealth markets in particular have
shown a preference for [physical]
replication, and we’re well
positioned to serve that demand.”

Strong preference for physical
ETFs has also led Lyxor, Europe’s
third-largest provider, to increase
the number of physical products
within its arsenal. The subsidiary
of Société Générale announced last
September that it would focus its
future product development efforts
on physical ETFs. As one of
Europe’s largest synthetic outfits,
Lyxor is no doubt hoping to see
assets flow into its new physical
range, particularly after synthetic
products haemorrhaged $2.7bn this
year to the end of July.

While providers have tweaked
their product line-ups in a bid to
win a greater share of business,
Lisa Kealy, financial services
partner at Ernst & Young, expects
most ETF assets to remain mainly
with the top five players.

“It is low margin, high volume, so
from a profitability perspective
scale is critical,” says Ms Kealy.

However, there may still be room
for new entrants such as Boost, the
leveraged provider launched in 2012
by former ETF Securities managing
partners Hector McNeil and Nik
Bienkowski. Although scale will
continue to be a critical factor for
success, new entrants providing
niche products “are the exception
to the rule”, says Ms Kealy.

Asset managers that do not
currently have an ETF arm, or are
losing assets to established players,
might think of launching an ETF
range to be defensive or compete,
adds Ms Kealy.

While new entrants can be
expected, Deborah Fuhr, managing
director at ETFGI, says the real
challenge for new ETF players will
be cracking distribution.

“You have to have good products
and distribution, and the ETF
ecosystem has to support you. It is
a challenging environment if you
are not a bank or broker,” says Ms
Fuhr. “If you are an asset manager
you can talk and educate, but at
the point of sale clients will still go
to a bank or a broker.”

Fierce battle for
assets continues

US financial advisers are now
as likely to allocate new
money from their clients to
exchange traded funds as
traditional mutual funds, clear
evidence of how ETFs are
progressing into mainstream
investment products used by
retail investors.

Almost three-quarters (73
per cent) of US advisers now
use ETFs, compared to 46 per
cent in 2007, according to a
recent report by Cogent
Research, a consultancy.

“ETFs are popular as they
help to lower costs,” says
Meredith Rice, senior product
director at Cogent. She
highlights the shift among US
advisers to a fee-based model,
where they are paid based on
the value of clients’ assets, as
focusing attention on costs.

Fran Kinniry, a principal
with Vanguard, the world’s
fourth largest fund manager,
says there has been a change
in the willingness of financial
advisers to use ETFs.

“Fund fees have become the
number one issue for financial
advisers to consider because
of the low returns that are
expected from stocks and
bonds in the next few years,”
says Mr Kinniry.

He adds that financial
advisers in the US, UK,
Canada and Australia are now
working to a fiduciary
standard as a result of
regulatory reforms so they are
required to invest clients’
money as carefully as their
own.

Mr Kinniry says this was a
“significant secular change”
and is likely to become a
global phenomenon.

Sweden has just announced
that it will examine fund
commissions and fees while
the Netherlands is expected to
ban “retrocession” payments
(inducements) to advisers for
asset management products
from January 2014.

Germany’s financial
regulator is also considering

its position on commission
payments and a Europe-wide
ban could follow the Mifid II
review.

Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of
the State Street Global
Advisors’ UK intermediaries
business group, says Europe
is heading in the same
direction as the US but there
are still fundamental
differences in the engagement
of financial advisers with
ETFs on both sides of the
Atlantic.

“There are still a lot of
hurdles to overcome before
ETF usage among financial
advisers in Europe reaches
the same level as in the US.
Building a unified retail
investor base for ETFs will be
much harder to achieve in
Europe than in the US,”
cautions Ms Hope-Bell.

The UK was the first big

market in Europe to introduce
a ban on commission
payments under the Retail
Distribution Review which
came into force at the start of
2013.

Mark Johnson, head of UK
sales at BlackRock’s iShares
unit, says he expects RDR to
be a “game changer”.

“We are already seeing
growing numbers of financial
advisers in the UK using
ETFs either in model
portfolios or by outsourcing
investment decisions to
discretionary fund managers
who use ETFs in their
portfolios,” says Mr Johnson.

That view is echoed by Ms
Hope-Bell.

“We are seeing financial
advisers’ interest in ETFs
growing via their increasing
use of model portfolios and
the trend for outsourcing of
portfolio management to
discretionary fund managers
who build ETF-only portfolios
or portfolios that mix ETFs
and traditional actively

managed mutual funds,” she
says.

UK investment managers
that are pitching for financial
advisers to outsource client
funds to ETF-only portfolios
include Evercore Pan-Asset
Management, SCM Private,
7IM and WorldTrack.

BlackRock recently
launched a UK version of its
iShares “connect” service,
which links financial advisers
to investment strategists that
make use of ETFs in their
portfolios. SCM Private, JM
Finn, Quartet and Thurleigh
Investment Managers have
signed up in the initial phase
of the UK “connect” rollout.

In the US, iShares is
tracking 110 ETF strategists
with $64bn in ETF assets.
This number is expected to
grow further as a three-year
record is required for
inclusion and new entrants
are continuing to join.

Edward Allen, a portfolio
manager at Thurleigh, the UK
wealth manager which uses
ETFs mainly for asset
allocation purposes, says: “We
are very focused on the cost
of managing money. Spreads
[dealing costs] on the largest
ETFs have become
vanishingly thin so they offer
very efficient trading and it is
possible to move substantial
chunks of capital in and out
of different asset classes with
ease.”

Ms Hope-Bell cautions that
one possible unintended
consequence of RDR may be
the emergence of an “advice
gap” if some retail investors
do not have sufficient assets
to justify paying a fee to a
financial adviser.

“This is potentially an
important issue for high street
banks and there is a great
deal of work to do in raising
the awareness of ETFs in this
category,” she says.

Mr Johnson notes that bank
distribution models in
continental Europe are
already being transformed by
ETFs. “We are seeing product
structures in banks
developing new investment
solutions with ETF-only
portfolios or using ETFs in
blend with index-based
products and active mutual
funds,” he says.

FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013 21

Smart beta exchange traded
funds have pulled in signifi-
cant assets this year, but
concern is brewing over
misuse of the “smart beta”
label as a marketing tool.
Recent estimates suggest

close to $6tn of institutional
assets could enter the smart
beta sector over the next
five years, and asset man-
agement companies want a
slice of the action.
US fund house Charles

Schwab launched six new
low-cost fundamentally
weighted ETFs last month,
HSBC Global Asset Manage-
ment created a suite of
alternative weighted indices
in July, and Deutsche Bank
recently stated the impor-
tance of smart beta strate-
gies to its asset growth.
But the rising popularity

of the smart beta label,
which refers to strategies
aiming to provide a better
risk/return trade-off than
traditional market-capitali-
sation weighted indices, has
led to its misappropriation,
critics fear.
Nick Blake, head of retail

at US passive fund house
Vanguard, says: “Unfortu-
nately within what is
known as the smart beta
sector, there are some prod-
ucts attaching themselves
to the label because it is
fashionable.
“We are not anti this

stuff, we just want inves-
tors to be clear what they
are buying when these
terms are used – it is a
lovely marketing label.”
Mr Blake is not alone in

recognising the “fad mar-
ket” reputation smart beta
has gained.

Jan Kvarpil, portfolio spe-
cialist at ING Investment
Management, says smart
beta strategies are cur-
rently the “hot topic” of the
moment within the ETF
industry, while Alan Miller,
chief investment officer of
SCM Private, a wealth man-
ager that invests solely via
ETFs, describes smart beta
as the industry’s “latest
fashion”.
Even some of the best-

known providers of smart
beta products want to dis-
tance themselves from the

term. BlackRock prefers to
use “new beta”, rival US
passive fund provider State
Street opts for “advanced
beta”, while European ETF
house Source touts “beta
plus” funds.
Worryingly, Mr Miller

estimates that 50 per cent of
so-called smart beta ETFs
do not involve more intelli-
gent investment processes,
but instead use “smart mar-
keting” to justify high fees
under the guise of smart
beta when they are rela-
tively simple utility, value
or small-cap focused prod-
ucts.
“Of course there are some

[smart beta ETFs] based on
logic, common sense and a
long back-test, but as the
smart beta bandwagon

grows, these are set to
become the minority rather
than the rule,” Mr Miller
says.
Vanguard’s Mr Blake is

more concerned by some of
the niche strategies being
funnelled into smart beta
products. “There are some
very active bets going after
a particular slice of the
market, such as indices
around land mass,” he says.
He adds: “The more

minute the size of the mar-
ket, the greater the risk.
This whole concept of smart
beta is probably a more
transparent version of the
active quant strategies
which blew up at the time
of the [financial] crisis.”
Even proponents of the

smart beta industry
acknowledge that certain
strategies are a source of
concern. Richard Hannam,
head of global equity beta
solutions at State Street,
says some ETFs in the
smart beta universe are “a
bit of a black box”.
But he believes investors

should be able to distin-
guish between dubious
strategies and those that
make sense.
He says: “Just because

someone has partnered
with an index provider [to
create a smart beta ETF], it
does not mean the investor
should suspend belief. It
should be very easy to see
what the rules are and how
they work. If it isn’t, we
would be concerned.”
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at
Source, adds that the smart
beta label still has merit.
“Any concept can be
hijacked and turned into a
gimmick, but as a concept
smart beta has a niche to
fill in between pure beta

and alpha strategies,” he
says.
Demand for this niche

has translated into strong
flows for some of the estab-
lished players in the smart
beta ETF sector. Black-
Rock’s four US-domiciled
minimum volatility ETFs,
for example, have gathered
more than $2.6bn of new
assets this year, compared
to $745m over the same
period in 2012.

Mr Lytle similarly says
that smart beta type prod-
ucts accounted for 50 per
cent of Source’s inflows last
year. “Clients clearly value
receiving more than just
pure beta exposure in the
ETF format,” he says.
And there is widespread

consensus that these strong
asset flows are set to last.
Bruno Poulin, chief exec-

utive of French ETF house
Ossiam, expects the wider

ETF market to grow at an
annual rate of 30 per cent,
but he believes smart beta
assets under management
can grow 60 per cent a year.
Although some fund

groups have made signifi-
cant headway in accumulat-
ing assets in smart beta
strategies, it is not too late
for other players to enter
the sector.
Nizam Hamid, an inde-

pendent index consultant

currently working at FTSE
Group, says: “There are
always new research tech-
niques and different ways
of looking at particular fac-
tors – [smart beta] is not a
dead area.”
The consultant adds: “I

don’t think this is a fad,
and I don’t think it will die
away. Smart beta has
opened a whole world of
opportunities for people to
look at different strategies.”

The fee war effectively
started by Vanguard has
drawn in iShares and State
Street, but rather than esca-
lating, it now appears
headed for a stalemate.
“The race to the bottom

will ultimately reach some
sort of bottom, and in terms
of the plain vanilla cap-
weighted beta space, it’s
very near the bottom,” says
Ben Johnson, director of
passive fund research at
Morningstar.
In the US, where price

competition has been
fiercest, exchange traded
funds’ asset-weighted total
expense ratios averaged 0.27
per cent at the end of July,
down 6 basis points from
three years earlier but just
1 basis point lower than a
year earlier, according to
data from ETF consultancy
ETFGI.
Vanguard has harnessed

the discount trend as much
as anyone, garnering indus-
try-leading first half inflows
of $28.8bn and ranking a
close second last year to

market share leader
iShares, despite having
fewer than a quarter as
many ETFs listed.
The company has histori-

cally kept fees low through
its non-profit mutual owner-
ship structure, unique in
the ETF industry. Last
year, however, it went on
the pricing offensive by
switching 22 of its index
funds to lower-cost bench-

marks from FTSE Group
and the University of Chi-
cago’s Center for Research
on Security Prices (CRSP), a
largely unknown provider.
Aside from passing on

savings from its growing
asset base and improved
index tracking, Vanguard’s

fee-cutting knife drawer is
now all but empty, says
Daniel Wiener, editor of the
Independent Adviser for
Vanguard Investors news-
letter.
“It’s clear that whatever

they’re paying CRSP is
almost next to nothing, if
not nothing, because in
essence they’re putting
CRSP on the map,” says Mr
Wiener, who is also chair-
man and chief executive of
advisory firm Adviser
Investment Management.
“It’s pretty hard to cut your
costs below nothing.”
He says Vanguard will

never abandon its licensing
contracts with Russell
Indexes and S&P Dow Jones
Indices because of their for-
midable brand recognition.
Long a fee war holdout,

iShares responded to Van-
guard’s ETF market share
ascent with the launch of a
buy-and-hold “core” ETF
series, including some
funds that undercut corre-
sponding Vanguard ETFs
on price. State Street Global
Advisors, the second-big-
gest provider, has also been
shaving fees strategically.
In July, it undercut three
iShares broad market ETFs
on price by switching its
ETFs’ benchmark indices,
while simultaneously
launching a small-cap ETF
also drastically underpric-
ing an iShares ETF track-
ing the same index.
More extensive cuts, how-

ever, seem unlikely in part
because both iShares and
SSgA lack Vanguard’s non-
profit structure.
Moreover, the financial

advisers that flocked to
ETFs initially for their low
expense ratios are begin-
ning to recognise that ETF
costs also take the form of
bid-ask spreads and track-
ing error, says Dave Mazza,
head of ETF investment
strategy at SSgA.
“Now that investors, and

particularly advisers, have
been using ETFs for some
time, and there has been
compression on the expense
ratio side, what they’re say-
ing is . . . the overall total
cost of ownership for my
client may be worse even
though the headline
[expense ratio] number
looks better,” he says.
Rather than discounts,

increasingly ETF providers
are touting fuller service
offerings, be it through
adviser outreach, educa-
tional campaigns or user-
friendly websites. “The
resounding chorus has been
there’s a need for greater
education, and that doesn’t
come at zero cost,” says
Deborah Fuhr, managing
partner at ETFGI. “ETFs
are already very cost-effi-

cient, and if you’re going to
pay for education and other
things, you need to leave
some margin in there for
marketing and other sales
support.”
Eating costs is certainly

within the realm of possibil-
ity. Mutual fund managers
have been subsidising
money market funds for
years amid rock bottom
interest rates. Charles
Schwab, one of the bigger
money fund backstoppers,
is by all accounts also bank-
rolling its low cost ETF
suite, having pared its aver-
age overall TER to an
industry low of 7.2 basis
points.
Schwab is a special case,

however, because those
drastic discounts can be off-
set by other means, such as
the brokerage volume the
ETF traffic helps generate,
says Marie Chandoha, presi-

dent and chief executive at
Charles Schwab Investment
Management. “We are part
of a large organisation that
makes money in a number
of ways; not every company
can say that,” she says. “As
a result, we are able to take
risks, make bets, try new
things and make trade-offs
to benefit our clients and
our bottom line.”
Still, Schwab’s synergies,

no less than iShares’ econo-
mies, have their limits, and
once they are reached, the
fee war will end, though the
performance war will rage
on. “It’s an evolving indus-
try, and that’s usually
where it evolves to: price
gets standardised,” says
Richard Keary, principal of
the consulting firm Global
ETF Advisors. “Then it’s
about quality and perform-
ance, which probably is
where it should be.”

Performance will replace
price as weapon of choice

In an industry that increas-
ingly stands accused of
being stuck in a rut, the
Winkle wrinkle ETF took
many by surprise.
Named for the brothers

behind it, the Winklevoss
twins, the proposed
exchange traded product is
no regular equities tracker.
Instead, the pair filed

paperwork with US regula-
tors for an ETF that would
track the arguably illiquid,
crypto-currency known as
Bitcoin.
This ETF looks unlikely

to reach the market
because of regulatory con-
straints among other prob-
lems, but it is a novel idea
in an industry said to be
seeing less and less product
innovation.
Detlef Glow, head of

Emea research at Lipper,
attributes a fall-off in inno-
vation to the industry
maturing. There are now
“fewer white spots” offering
the opportunity to create
pioneering products, he
says. “The more mature the
industry becomes, the less
innovative in terms of prod-
ucts it will be,” he adds.
The result is fewer new

funds – 238 ETFs and ETPs
were launched globally in
the first half of 2013, com-
pared to 553 during the
same period in 2010, figures
from consultancy ETFGI
show.

Of the products launched,
many focused on traditional
asset classes – more than
half were equity ETFs,
according to ETFGI.
Providers say they are

simply meeting investor
demand. Equity products
are hugely popular – the
SPDR S&P 500 continues to
be the best-selling ETF glo-
bally.
Innovation, says Reginald

Browne, managing director
of the ETF team at Knight
Equity Markets, is all well
and good, but there has to
be investor demand for the
product – and the asset
class.
For this reason, even if

the Bitcoin ETF were
launched it is doubtful
investors would snap it up,
says Mr Browne. “Largely

the Bitcoin is a relatively
new asset class and I’m not
sure now is the time for an
ETF to come out,” he adds.
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at
Source, says if there is not
“explicit client demand” for
an ETF, it is likely to fail.
“The investment land-

scape is littered with good
ideas that were too far
ahead of their time or that
were not delivered in a
form that was compelling to
investors,” he adds.
However, investors

appear to be warming to
asset classes other than
equities. Fixed-income ETFs
– often considered more
groundbreaking in an
industry that has tradition-
ally focused on equities –
saw some of the highest
inflows of new products
this year, says ETFGI.
The Vanguard Total

International Bond and the
BMO Mid-Term US IG Cor-
porate Bond Index ETFs
both featured among the 10
best-selling new ETFs glo-
bally in the seven months
to July.
Although fixed income

products account for only
15.5 per cent of new ETFs
and ETPs so far this year,
Mr Glow expects more in
the coming years.
Mr Lytle adds: “There is

also a lot of room for inno-
vation in fixed income both
because of the breadth of
the asset class and the
potential to tap into tradi-
tional fixed-income inves-
tors who are not yet using
ETFs.”
Another asset class that

Source has looked at is mas-
ter limited partnerships. An
MLP is a corporate struc-
ture that is publicly traded
and derives most of its cash
flows from real estate, natu-
ral resources and commodi-
ties. Source’s US Energy
Infrastructure MLP, which
launched this summer, has
seen moderately strong
interest, raising more than
$115m in its first two
months.
Elsewhere, Stephen

Cohen, chief investment
strategist for BlackRock
fixed income and iShares
Emea, says there are oppor-
tunities for innovation
within smart beta – ETFs
based on alternative indices
and which apply different
weighting methods to
stocks.
“Investors are investing

in new beta ETFs, such as
minimum volatility ETFs,
to enhance risk-return,” he
says. In Europe, Mr Cohen
says four iShares minimum
volatility ETFs, launched at
the end of 2012, gathered
more than $256m in the six
months to June.
He adds: “New beta strat-

egies in the equity and
income space, as well as
building block completion
in the fixed-income space,

bring the biggest opportuni-
ties for product develop-
ment at the moment.”
At Amundi, currency-

hedged products are under
the spotlight, says Valerie
Baudson, managing director
ETF and index solutions. Its
Japan Topix Eur Hedged
Daily ETF has had inflows
of €500m since being
launched last October.
“My conviction is the cur-

rency-hedged ETF, which

has been very successful,
will remain a growing area
of innovation,” says Ms
Baudson.
Her views are echoed by

Manooj Mistry, head of
exchange traded products
for Emea at Deutsche Asset
& Wealth Management.
DeAWM has a number of
currency-hedged ETFs,
including a euro-hedged
MSCI Japan ETF. It plans
to roll out more of them

over the coming months.
Mr Mistry believes the

industry is still seeing
plenty of innovation, citing
the example of DeAWM’s
MSCI Pakistan ETF,
launched last summer.
“The innovation here is
that you are opening up
quite a difficult market to
access,” he says.
He adds: “[The industry]

doesn’t have the same rate
of growth in the products as

we had in the early stages
of the market, but I think
we will still see new prod-
ucts being brought out.”
But are new products

really innovative? Mr Glow
is not convinced. “The ques-
tion now is what do you
call an innovation? So a
gold short ETF, is that a
product innovation? It is a
new product, but it is not
innovation as you would
expect,” he says.

Genuine novelty is ever harder to come by

24 FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013

Believe it or not, there used
to be a time when the $2tn
exchange traded fund
industry did little to attract
the kind of scrutiny that
has been piled on it by glo-
bal regulators in recent
years.
Compared to their hedge

fund and active manager
counterparts, the traits of
transparency, liquidity and
low costs vaunted by ETF
providers made them seem
like the good guys.
Fast forward a few years

on from the start of the
financial crisis, and it is
probably easier to count on
one hand the number of
regulators that have not
taken a swipe at ETFs in
one way or another.
Despite some unwanted

attention, many believe it
was only a matter of time
before regulators started to
take more interest in what
was going on under the
bonnet of the ETF industry.
“Globally, over the past

few years regulators have
taken a very close look at
the way ETFs are created,
managed, traded and sold,”
says Scott Ebner, global
head of product develop-

ment at State Street Global
Advisors.
“Given the growth of the

industry, and the number of
products now available to

investors, it is not surpris-
ing that regulators are tak-
ing a closer look to ensure
products are sound and well
understood by investors.”
The Financial Stability

Board, set up after the
financial crisis, and which
represents central banks
and regulators, was one of
the first regulatory bodies
to lay into the ETF industry
in 2011.
The FSB said it had con-

cerns about “a number of
disquieting developments”
in the ETF industry, which
it said “call for closer scru-
tiny”.
It claimed that by stray-

ing from their traditional
plain vanilla focus, ETFs
had moved into credit,
emerging markets and com-
modities – typically areas
where liquidity is thinner
and transparency lower.
The increased popularity

of synthetic ETFs, as well
as the more intensive
recourse to securities lend-
ing by providers of physical
ETFs “raises new chal-
lenges in terms of counter-
party and collateral risks”,
added the FSB.
Not long after the FSB,

the International Organiza-
tion of Securities Commis-
sions launched a global
study to examine the sys-
temic risks posed by ETFs.
For its part, the Bank of

England’s Financial Policy
Committee also flagged up
the products as a signifi-
cant source of concern.
Patrick Dunne, head of

global markets and invest-
ments at iShares, says:
“ETFs have become more
prominent in recent years,
and it is appropriate for reg-
ulators to make sure they
fully understand invest-
ment vehicles that are
becoming more and more
popular with investors.”

The US Federal Reserve is
among the latest to take
aim at ETFs. It warned in
August that trading activity
by leveraged ETFs during
periods of high volatility
could trigger a crash in the
US stock market.
Ted Hood, chief executive

officer of Source, adds that
an industry trusted to take
investors’ money in order to
generate returns should

expect some degree of scru-
tiny.
“The industry continues

to grow and you cannot
complain about scrutiny.
You have to accept it if you
are trusted to take people’s
money,” says Mr Hood.
“The industry will do fine

and it’s better to have peo-
ple buying products who
know more about the prod-
ucts than they did three
years ago. We feel more
comfortable with clients
that have looked under the
hood and know what they
are buying.”
Many ETF providers

accept that regulators will
want to delve deeper into
the inner workings of the
industry, but those doing
the scrutinising have failed
to explain their motives,
says Mr Hood.
“What is lacking is the

policy saying who regula-
tors are trying to protect,

and what it is they are try-
ing to achieve,” says Mr
Hood.
“Are they saying they do

not want investors to buy
into certain asset classes or
have money locked up?”
ETF providers in Europe,

particularly those offering
synthetic products, have
arguably received the most
scrutiny.
Last year, the Paris-based

European Securities and
Markets Authority con-
ducted a widespread review
of the industry after con-
cerns that more complex
ETFs, such as those
employing derivatives,
could pose a risk to retail
investors, along with jeop-
ardising the reputation of
the European mutual fund
Ucits brand.
Mr Dunne says that “cer-

tain concerns raised by reg-
ulators” over products car-
rying different risks to
physical products “may be
legitimate”.
However, rather than

introducing a complete
overhaul of sales and trad-
ing practices of synthetic
ETFs as many were expect-
ing, the final Esma guide-
lines were presented as
measures addressing the
entire Ucits universe.
The toughest demand

made of ETF providers was
a change to their practices
around disclosure and secu-
rities lending, and introduc-
ing product identifiers.
While the uncertainty in

the run-up to the Esma
guidelines caused a number
of synthetic providers to
bleed assets, some believe
the process may have been
worth it.
Lisa Kealy, a partner at

Ernst & Young, says:
“Many feel the regulatory
scrutiny has been a cleans-
ing process for ETFs.”

Watchdogs on the scent of the money
Regulation
David Ricketts
says it was only a
matter of time
before a maturing
and complex sector
attracted scrutiny

Taking aim: the Fed warned in August that trading by leveraged ETFs could trigger a crash in the US stock market Bloomberg

‘As the industry
continues to grow
you cannot
complain about
scrutiny. You have
to accept it if you
are trusted to take
people’s money’

Guide to pricing of Authorised
Investment Funds.
Compiled with the assistance of the
IMA. The Investment Management
Association, 65 Kingsway, London
WC2B 6TD. +44 (0)20 7831 0898. All
funds within this section, whether
OEICs or unit trusts are authorised in
the UK by the Financial Services
Authority. The prices quoted should
only be used as a guide.
OEIC: Open­Ended Investment
Company. Similar to a unit trust but
using a company rather than a trust
structure.
Share Classes: Separate classes of
share are denoted by a letter or
number after the name of the fund.
Different classes are issued to reflect a
different currency, charging structure
or type of holder.
Buying price: Also called offer price.
The price at which units in a unit trust
are bought by investors. Includes

manager’s initial charge.
Selling price: Also called bid price.
The price at which units in a unit trust
are sold by investors.
Single price: Based on a mid­market
valuation of the underlying
investments. The buying and selling
price for shares of an OEIC and units
of a single priced unit trust are the
same.
Exit Charges: The letter E denotes
that an exit charge may be made
when you sell units, contact the
manager/operator for full details.
Time: The time shown alongside the
fund manager’s/operator’s name is the
time of the unit trust’s/OEIC’s
valuation point unless another time is
indicated by the symbol alongside the
individual unit trust/OEIC name.
The symbols are as follows: ✠ 0001
to 1100 hours; ♦ 1101 to 1400 hours;
▲1401 to 1700 hours; # 1701 to
midnight. Daily dealing prices are set
on the basis of the valuation point, a
short period of time may elapse before

prices become available.
Yield: Funds comprising mainly of
bonds normally quote a gross
redemption yield after all charges but
before tax has been deducted. Funds
mainly made up of equities normally
quote a yield representing the
estimated annual payout net of tax for
basic rate taxpayer. For further
information contact the management
company.
Historic pricing: The letter H denotes
that the managers/operators will
normally deal on the price set at the
most recent valuation.
The prices shown are the latest
available before publication and may
not be the current dealing levels
because of an intervening portfolio
revaluation or a switch to a forward
pricing basis. The managers/operators
must deal at a forward price on
request, and may move to forward
pricing at any time.
Forward pricing: The letter F denotes
that that managers/operators deal at

the price to be set at the next
valuation. Investors can be given no
definite price in advance of the
purchase or sale being carried out.
The prices appearing in the newspaper
are the most recent provided by the
managers/operators. Scheme
particulars, prospectus, key features
and reports: The most recent report,
scheme particulars, prospectus and
key features document may be
obtained free of charge from fund
managers/operators.

on Fridays.

I have no insideknowledge on whetherJanet Yellen or Larry
Summers is most likely to
be given the job as the next
chairman of the Federal
Reserve. It is not an
exaggeration to suggest,
however, as many
commentators have already,
that this is probably the
most important
appointment that President
Obama is likely to make in
his second term.
If the media are to be

believed, the White House
is pushing the claims of
the imperious Mr Summers
over those of Ben
Bernanke’s deputy, even
though the former will face
the tougher ride at Senate
confirmation hearings.
It would be fascinating

to listen in on the
president’s discussion of
the issue. History has
spoiled us – no, make that
appalled us – by allowing
us to listen in, courtesy of
the Nixon tapes, on the
discussions that went on in
the White House about its
relationship with Arthur
Burns, the chairman of the
Fed during the Nixon era,
and the man widely
blamed since for letting
inflation get out of hand in
the aftermath of the
Vietnam war.
At the time of his

nomination in 1969, Mr
Burns had a secure
reputation as an academic
economist. But he was also
a longstanding Republican
sympathiser who had
known Mr Nixon for a
number of years, and had
given him advice in the
run-up to the 1960 election
campaign that Nixon lost.
According to Mr Nixon, Mr
Burns had called him in
March 1960 to warn him
that the economy was
likely to dip before the
election in November and
“urged [him] strongly that
everything possible be
done to avert this
development”.
After Mr Nixon had

successfully nominated Mr
Burns, he took a typically
poor stab at humour
during the welcoming
ceremony in the White
House. He noted that while
“as you all know” the Fed
was independent of the
White House, the president
also had strong views on
the economy, which he
intended to convey to the
chairman in forceful terms.

He concluded: “I respect
his independence. However
I hope that independently
he will conclude that my
views are the ones that
should be followed.”
This clumsy opening

turned out to be anything
but a joke. Over the next
three years Mr Burns was
subjected to a series of
subtle and not so subtle
attempts to cajole him into
following the president’s
wishes on the economy –
those pressures increasing
as his re-election campaign
in 1972 approached. It
included blocking Mr
Burns’ recommendations
on new members of the
Fed’s open market
committee, leaking
unhelpful stories to the
media, and threatening
him that he would not be
re-elected, while urging
him to loosen monetary
policy all the time.
Although Mr Burns and

other economists of the
day, including Milton
Friedman, warned Mr
Nixon about the risks of
loosening monetary policy
prematurely, in due course

the Fed did just that, with
disastrous consequences.
In the end it was left to

Paul Volcker, Fed
chairman under President
Jimmy Carter from 1979, to
wring inflation out of the
US economy, which then
ushered in a long period of
economic advance, albeit at
a huge cost in terms of
unemployment. At least
one recent academic study
has sought to defend Mr
Burns against some of the
harshest critics, arguing
that the policy measures
the Fed adopted at the
time were not
unreasonable, given the
unprecedented conditions
and the state of economic
understanding at the time.
The blame for the
hyperinflation of the 1970s
cannot be laid solely at the
Fed’s door.
The challenges facing the

Fed today are also
however, undeniably,
unprecedented, even if
they are of a completely
different nature. No central
bank has ever had to steer
an economy out of a
financial crisis on the scale
of 2008. None has ever
presided over such an
enormous programme of
asset purchases as the
world’s central banks

currently have in place.
None has had to test the
limits of monetary policy
in a zero interest rate
environment in real life, at
a time when
unemployment remains
high by historical
standards and outstanding
debt is at unprecedented
levels. The new chairman
will to some extent

inevitably be flying blind
in this tricky environment.
In a recent issue of The

New York Review of
Books, Mr Volcker makes a
strong case for the
importance of the central
bank acknowledging the
limitations of monetary
policy and effectively
warns the central bank
against the dangers of

being dragged by the
ambiguities of its dual
mandate into going soft on
inflation. Few presidents,
fortunately, have displayed
such crude and obsessive
political instincts as Mr
Nixon – it is certainly hard
to think of Mr Obama
talking about “goosing the
money supply” – but we
all have to hope that the

next chairman, in addition
to possessing good
judgment and effective
communication skills, will
be as sensitive to the
subtler modern risks of
political pressure as his or
her hapless predecessor
proved not to be.

A stiff triple for Irish whiskey as
distilleries are poised to multiply
By Jamie Smyth in Dublin

It was a favourite tipple of
Queen Elizabeth I of England,
who had casks of it delivered to
her court in the 16th century.
Dr Samuel Johnson, the writer,
was also a fan of its “pleasant
and mild flavour”. Now, after
100 years of near terminal
decline, Irish whiskey is making
a comeback.
Exports of the spirit are surg-

ing in key markets, multination-
als are investing in the main
brands – Jameson, Bushmills
and Tullamore Dew – and the
number of distilleries is set to
triple over five years. The resur-
gence of whiskey, known as
uisce beatha, or water of life, in
Irish, is part of a wider growth
in food and drink exports that is
helping Dublin emerge from its
financial crisis.
“Interest in Irish whiskey is

huge, particularly in the US,

Russia and eastern Europe.
Forty of the 130 markets where
we sell Jameson are seeing dou-
ble or triple-digit sales growth,”
said Peter Morehead, production
director at Irish Distillers,
which is owned by Pernod
Ricard and makes the top-
selling Jameson brand.
Last week, Irish Distillers cut

the ribbon on a €200m expan-
sion of its distillery in County
Cork, to double production to
16m nine-litre cases a year. Per-
nod Ricard said Jameson sales
grew in value by 17 per cent in
the year to the end of June,
making it the second largest
brand contributor to its growth.
Scottish spirits group William

Grant & Sons, which bought
Tullamore Dew for €171m in
2010, is investing €35m in a new
distillery. More than a dozen
other distilleries are either in
construction or in planning.
Overall Irish whiskey sales grew

10.5 per cent last year to 6.2m
nine-litre cases, faster than all
other types of brandy, Scotch,
US whiskey, tequila and cognac.
The surge in whiskey sales is

being driven by changing US
consumer tastes, where brown
spirits have become more popu-
lar among younger drinkers. A
similar trend is occurring in
eastern Europe and Russia, says
Mr Morehead.
Irish whiskey is attracting

young women drinkers. Pop
singer Lady Gaga declared her
love for Jameson at a recent
Dublin show, while Rihanna
named the brand in her party
track “Cheers (Drink to That)”.
The main difference between

Irish whiskey and Scotch is in
the distillation. Scotch is dis-
tilled twice while Irish is dis-
tilled three times, giving it a
more mellow flavour. Last year,
96m nine-litre cases of Scotch
were sold.

By David Oakley in London

US investors have pumped more
money into European equities
than at any time since 1977, in a
big vote of confidence for the
region and its ability to recover
from the sovereign debt crisis.
Pension funds and other big

US groups invested $65bn in
European stocks in the first six
months of this year, the highest
in 36 years over that period,
according to research compiled
by Goldman Sachs’ European
strategy team from US Treasury
data.
Early signs of recovery and

rising confidence have restored
the faith of US investors in
Europe as hopes grow that mar-
kets can rally further on a wave
of stronger earnings in the sec-
ond half of the year.
Eddie Perkins, chief invest-

ment officer of international
equity at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said: “The eco-
nomic story makes Europe a
good bet. We expect European
equities to keep rising as the
continent recovers.”
Robert Parkes, equity strate-

gist at HSBC, added: “We see
earnings surprising on the
upside, which will act like a tail-
wind for European equities.”
HSBC says that European

stocks are still 15 per cent
undervalued compared with the
long-term average.
This is the case despite the

big rise in European equities
since July 2012 when Mario
Draghi, European Central Bank
president, pledged to do “what-
ever it takes” to save the euro.
European stocks have risen
27 per cent since June 4 2012.

However, equity markets still
face big risks. A possible US
military strike against Syria,
worries about emerging markets
instability and a renewed
flare-up of the eurozone crisis
could prevent further gains.
The poor performance of

emerging markets is a particu-
lar worry as European groups
derive about a third of their rev-
enues from that region. A fur-
ther setback in emerging mar-
kets would hit their profits.
Despite the risks, the fact that

European stocks remain cheap
is encouraging more US funds
to put money into the market,
say strategists and investment
managers. HSBC’s cyclically
adjusted price earnings multi-
ples are running at 11.4 times
compared with a historical aver-
age of 14.8 times.
Sectors favoured by Goldman

Sachs and HSBC are financials,
telecoms and utilities as these
have underperformed because of
the eurozone debt crisis in the
past few years.
European banking stocks, in

particular, are back in vogue as
the success of financials tends
to depend on an improving
economy. Expectations of more
mergers and acquisitions activ-
ity in areas such as telecoms is
also seen as positive for stocks.
Mr Parkes said: “There are

still a lot of pessimists out
there, but the cheapness of
stocks makes them attractive.
The risks are outweighed by the
positives and I think European
stocks can definitely move
higher.”

Assad warns of retaliation as Kerry
steps up lobbying for Syria strikes

By Hugh Carnegy in Paris,
Robin Harding in Washington
and Abigail Fielding­Smith
in Beirut

John Kerry, US secretary of
state, stepped up frantic admin-
istration efforts to win congres-
sional backing for military
action against Syria yesterday
as Bashar al-Assad, the coun-
try’s president, reportedly
warned of unspecified retalia-
tion for any attack.
According to CBS News, Mr

Assad, in an interview to be
broadcast today, denied using
chemical weapons against his
own people, thrusting him into
a head-to-head battle for US
hearts and minds with Presi-
dent Barack Obama.
The remarks come ahead of a

crucial week in which Mr
Obama will embark on a series
of TV interviews and address

the nation tomorrow, amid
signs in Congress of growing
opposition to action. A Senate
vote is likely on Wednesday.
Mr Assad’s remarks seemed

calculated to play on US
doubts. As well as suggesting
retaliation by forces aligned
with Syria, he expressed con-
cern that US strikes would tip
the military balance against his
regime, according to a preview
of the remarks by CBS inter-
viewer Charlie Rose.
Mr Assad said in the inter-

view in Damascus: “There has

been no evidence that I used
chemical weapons against my
own people.”
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry said

most members of the Senate
and House of Representatives
had yet to make up their minds
on the issue. Speaking in Paris,
Mr Kerry said predictions of
entrenched opposition in Con-
gress were “early and not par-
ticularly accurate”.
He said a compilation of vid-

eos released by the administra-
tion showing evidence of the
chemical weapons attack in
Damascus on August 21 that
Washington insists was carried
out by the Syrian regime was
designed to help swing opinion.
“The vast majority of mem-

bers of Congress, House and
Senate, are undecided. That’s
why the videos are being
shown and why the briefings
[of congressional members] are

taking place,” he told reporters.
He said he would be joining

the lobbying effort when he
returned to Washington tomor-
row. “I don’t think this case
has yet been made enough, to
enough people,” he said.
Mr Kerry arrived in London

last night.
US opponents of military

action argue that it could help
extremists come to power in
Syria. “[If] the strike is really
significant, it weakens Assad
and the result is the rebels are
able to succeed, and if what
happened there is al-Qaeda tak-
ing over . . . and extremist ter-
rorists getting access to those
chemical weapons, that hurts
US national security,” Ted
Cruz, a Republican senator
from Texas, told ABC News.

rowing and construction
are really being driven by
the weakening economy.
Since 2008, Australians

have preferred saving over
spending even though
incomes have grown and
unemployment remains rel-
atively low. A savings rate
of more than 10 per cent is
double that seen in the US.
“The Australian con-

sumer is deleveraging, but
the Australian consumer
has income whereas the US
or UK consumer doesn’t,”
said Alan Oster, chief econ-
omist at National Australia
Bank. “Their balance sheet

domestic economy not hav-
ing any mojo,” said Martin
Whetton, a strategist at
Nomura.
The Reserve Bank of Aus-

tralia has cut official inter-
est rates to a record low of
2.5 per cent over the past
two years. It says the min-
ing boom of recent years
crowded out other forms of
business investment.
The manufacturing sector

has been slowing for almost
two years, hurt by a strong
Australian dollar that made
exports uncompetitive
abroad as imports became
cheaper at home.
The RBA hopes house-

building will pick up the
slack as the mining boom
fades, but that could be
wide of the mark when the
interest rate cuts that are

Liberal governments’ plans,
equivalent to about 0.5 per
cent of gross domestic prod-
uct.
In his victory speech on

Saturday night, Mr Abbott
said: “From today, I declare
that Australia is under new
management and that Aus-
tralia is once more open for
business.”
The question is how the

new government will spur
the economy, given the lack
of big policy differences
between the two main par-
ties and external drags,
such as the end of the surge
in mining investment.
“Whichever government

came in, I do not think it is
the easiest of elections to
win because you have still
got a lot of headwinds from
China slowing and from the

ore and nickel assets who
plans to build a working
replica of the Titanic.
Only half of the Senate is

re-elected during a normal
election and the new sena-
tors will not take their seats
until July 2014. Until then,
the Greens hold the balance
of power in the upper
house, making it unlikely
the carbon tax can be
repealed before then.
The new government will

soon have to raise the
$300bn debt ceiling –
expected to be breached
before the end of the year –
in order to avoid deep
spending cuts.
According to the parties’

pre-election estimates, the
budget deficit will be about
A$8.8bn smaller by the year

Tony Abbott, Australia’s
prime minister-elect, hit the
ground cycling yesterday,
donning his Lycra gear for
an early morning bike ride
in Sydney before meeting
senior public servants
including the heads of the
Treasury, finance and
prime minister and cabinet
departments.
“This is essentially a

working day,” Mr Abbott
said a day after his centre-
right coalition was swept to
power by an electorate that
punished the six-year Labor
government for its bitter
infighting.
The Liberal-National coa-

lition secured a strong
swing away from Labor, led
by Kevin Rudd, after high-
lighting its divisions and
promising to repeal mining
and carbon taxes.
Labor had governed for

two terms, the shortest
party reign since the mid-
1970s in a country where
governments usually get at
least three terms.
With three-quarters of the

votes counted, the coalition
is expected to win 88 or 89
of the 150 seats in the lower
house, which determines
the government. Labor is
expected to win just 57
seats, its worst performance
in almost two decades. The
new administration would
be sworn in by the gover-
nor-general in a “week or
so”, Mr Abbott said.
The new prime minister

will take over the running
of an economy that is wit-
nessing the end of a mining
boom as he looks to meet
his campaign promises. The
coalition’s big proposals
include a repeal of taxes on
carbon and mining profits,
the cutting of 12,000 public
sector jobs and a paid
maternity leave scheme
that will be funded by a
levy on businesses with
more than A$5m in pre-tax
profits. Smaller businesses
will enjoy a 1.5 per cent tax
cut.
Mr Abbott said scrapping

the carbon tax, introduced
last year, was “obviously a
very early item of busi-
ness”. But this may be the
most difficult policy change
to effect as it would require
approval from the parlia-
ment’s upper house.

Mad monk, no more.
Tony Abbott, the
opposition Rottweiler who
has torn Kevin Rudd’s
dysfunctional Labor party
to shreds, is now prime
minister-elect of
Australia.
The former student

boxer has visibly toned
down his pugilistic image
and sought to tune in to
his inner statesman. Gone
are the budgie smugglers,
the skimpy swimming
trunks in which he once
flaunted his machismo. In
their stead, he has
donned conservative suits
and a conservative
persona – with the
primary emphasis that
the economy of Australia
is safer in his hands.
Not that he has dropped

his fighting talk. As he
celebrated victory on
Saturday night, he
returned to two of his
favourite causes. “In
three years’ time, the
carbon tax will be gone.
The boats will be
stopped,” he said, the
latter a reference to his
uncompromising policy
towards refugees
attempting to reach
Australia by sea.
There are three main

areas in which Mr Abbott
the prime minister –
rather than Mr Abbott
the opposition attack dog
– will be judged.
The most important is

the one that dominated
the election, the economy.
For a country that has
avoided recession for 22
years, the mood has been
astonishingly negative.
That is partly because
Australians believe years
of sturdy growth have
made the lifestyle they
take for granted now
harder to afford. It is also
partly because of fears
that the China-led
resources wave on which
the economy has surfed is
losing its force.
Mr Abbott is probably

right to deny Mr Rudd’s
claim that the resources
boom is over. Barring
severe economic crises in
China and the rest of
Asia, there should be
continued robust demand
for Australia’s iron ore,
coal and liquefied natural
gas. Still, the best years
may be gone. Prices are
unlikely to return to the
levels of a few years ago.
Mining investment, now 8
per cent of gross domestic
product, will dip back
towards its historic norm
of 2 per cent.
Non-resource industries,

crowded out by mining
and rendered
uncompetitive by a strong

currency, will need to be
nursed back to life. The
new government has also
pledged to be more
business-friendly. Not
only does it intend to
scrap the carbon tax, it
also wants to axe Labor’s
mining tax and other
corporate burdens. Mr
Abbott has promised to
be the “infrastructure
prime minister”, building
the projects needed to
raise productivity.
Contrary to Mr Rudd’s

assertion that a coalition
government would “cut,
cut, cut”, Mr Abbott’s
team has presented a
rather modest four-year
budget, providing savings
of just A$6bn ($5.5bn).
That hints at a
pragmatism that has
grown the closer Mr
Abbott has got to office.
It is also sensible. If the
economy really does slow,
then sharp and quick
fiscal contraction is not
what it will need.
Still, the coalition

budget is not exactly

transparent. As well as
corporate tax giveaways,
Mr Abbott will have to
find the money for his
expensive parental leave
scheme. That progressive
piece of legislation raises
the question of whether
Mr Abbott as prime
minister will mellow
socially. His values,
inspired by his Catholic
faith, represent what one
commentator described as
a “throwback choice” for
Australians. By no means
are all comfortable with
Mr Abbott’s views on
same-sex marriage or
abortion. As prime
minister, he may well
have to soften his stance.
The final test comes on

foreign policy. Mr Abbott
has so far adopted a shrill
patriotic tone. Again, in
office, this may need to
be modified if Australia is
to negotiate its chief
challenge – balancing its
security alliance with the
US and its economic
dependence on Asia.
There are hints of

pragmatism here too. The
new government will re-
examine a decision to ban
Huawei, the Chinese
telecoms company, from
tendering for the
broadband project. And
he intends his first
foreign visit to be to
Indonesia, an emerging
regional power.
Mr Abbott marked his

victory by donning
cycling shorts and going
for a Sunday morning
bike ride. His future
success might depend on
putting his budgie
smugglers away for good.

In a mood of sobriety and
preferring the safe option,
Olympic leaders abandoned
their risk-taking instincts
and plumped for the sensi-
ble choice of Tokyo over the
more hazardous alterna-
tives of Istanbul and Madrid
as the 2020 games host.
The outcome at the Inter-

national Olympic Commit-
tee’s congress in Buenos
Aires was decisive. Tokyo
overcame Istanbul in the
second and final round of
voting after Madrid was
eliminated in the first – and
prevailed by a comfortable
60 votes to 36.
Renewed worries about

radiation leaks at the Fuku-
shima nuclear plant threat-
ened to destabilise Tokyo’s
bid. But thanks to a slick
presentation, a relentlessly
drilled message of financial
stability and a not overly
ambitious venue construc-
tion programme, Tokyo saw
off its rivals with ease.
For the vanquished cities,

the only comfort was the
realisation that no amount
of presentational skills or
powers of persuasion would
shake the IOC from its tight
embrace of caution.
“You described yourself

as a safe pair of hands and
as a surgeon . . . this appeals
to me,” Jacques Rogge, IOC
president, told Shinzo Abe,
the Japanese prime minis-
ter, after the decision.
IOC members like the

grandiose statement when
choosing host cities. Beijing
would build bridges
between China and the

west. Athens would link the
modern games with its
ancient tradition. Rio would
be the first games in Latin
America. Sochi would be
Russia’s first winter games.
But none of these choices

have left the IOC feeling
good about itself. Each had
problems, some of these are
continuing – and for the
time being, the IOC has had
enough of uncertainty.
For Istanbul, staging the

Olympics would have been
“the sign of a country enter-
ing the world stage”, said
Soner Cagaptay at the
Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, as it had
been perceived for Seoul
1988, Barcelona 1992 and
Beijing 2008.
Its defeat was a blow for

Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
prime minister, who had
put the Olympics at the
heart of a huge infrastruc-
ture plan for his home city.
“It is a symbolic setback

for Turkey’s ambitions to
become a global power,”
said Mr Cagaptay.

Mr Erdogan’s government
had already seen its inter-
national image damaged by
the government crackdown
on mass protests over the
summer. Riot police fanned
out again in Istanbul on
Saturday even as the votes
were cast in Buenos Aires.
Other reasons for the

IOC to vote against Istanbul
included fears about insta-
bility spreading from
Syria – which shares a
900km border with Turkey.
There were also pointed

questions from IOC mem-
bers to both Turkey and
Spain about their question-
able doping record. Claims
from Spanish newspaper El
Mundo that 50 IOC mem-
bers had promised to vote
for Madrid, even publishing
their names, helped to raise
expectations in the Spanish
camp. But some observers
suggested the stunt may
have been detrimental to
the bid. “IOC members
don’t like it when people
try to influence them,” one
member told Argentine
daily La Nación.
Spain’s persuasive Crown

Prince Felipe, a former
Olympic sailor who is popu-
lar in IOC circles and who
many hoped would help to
seal the deal for Madrid,
declared: “I am an Olym-
pian and proud father of
two daughters who want a
bright future.”
It was not enough. For

the IOC, its priorities are
real issues such as the
plight of the Spanish econ-
omy rather than emotive
calls to Olympic values.
The safe, sound, solid
Tokyo offering will do.

FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013 ★ 3

By John Reed in Jerusalem

The EU is facing growing
pressure from Israel and
the US to water down tough
new guidelines restricting
EU funding for institutions
in Jewish settlements on
Palestinian lands.
John Kerry, US secretary

of state, told a press confer-
ence in Paris he had asked
the EU to suspend the
guidelines at a meeting of
European foreign ministers
at the weekend. He also
warned against possible fur-
ther measures to label
goods made in Israeli settle-
ments in the West Bank.
Reports of his interven-

tion brought an angry
response from the Palestini-
ans, who reported US lobby-
ing on the issue as “discour-
aging” and urged Brussels
to stick to its guidelines.
Mr Kerry, who is sponsor-

ing a new round of Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, said
he told European ministers
that it was important to
repay Mr Netanyahu for the
“political price” he had paid
to engage in the peace
talks. He said he was not
asking the EU to change its
rules, but to hold back from
applying them while the
talks were taking place.
The issue is expected to

be discussed during a visit
to Israel tomorrow led by
Pierre Vimont, secretary-
general of the EU’s Exter-
nal Action Service. Israeli
and European officials are
then due to meet in Brus-
sels on Thursday to discuss
Israel’s participation in the
bloc’s Horizon 2020 research
funding programme, Israel’s
foreign ministry said.
The new EU rules, drawn

up in July, would restrict
European loans, grants and
scholarships for Israeli enti-
ties based in the West
Bank, East Jerusalem and
the Golan Heights, which
Israel occupied after the six-

day war in 1967. Following
Mr Kerry’s request, Cathy
Ashton, the EU foreign pol-
icy chief, said Brussels
would implement the fund-
ing measures “sensitively”.
She added: “We of course
want to continue to have a
strong relationship with
Israel.”
Israel began lobbying in

several European capitals
in July, claiming the meas-
ures would make a peace
deal less attainable by hard-
ening the Palestinians’
negotiating stance on the
borders of any future state.

Israel says the funding
restrictions would force it
to formally accept the Euro-
pean position, which holds
that settlements beyond the
“Green Line” are illegal. It
says that even institutions
applying for funding from
within the pre-1967 borders
will be ineligible if they
have projects beyond the
Green Line.
The Palestinians, by con-

trast, say the EU’s new
guidelines will help foster a
two-state solution by rein-
forcing the 1967 borders.
“Reports of [the] US lobby-
ing the EU on behalf of
Israel are extremely dis-
couraging and cast serious
doubts on the US mediation
role,” Hanan Ashrawi, a
member of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation’s
executive committee, said
on Saturday. “Once again
the US is using the negotia-
tion process to grant Israel
immunity and to buy it
more time to create facts on
the ground.”

The late morning sun is
burning brightly, Málaga’s
many beaches are a short
bus ride away and school
has yet to resume. But when
Maribel Galacho opens the
gate of the Colegio Severo
Ochoa, the junior school
she heads in the southern
Spanish city, she finds doz-
ens of pupils waiting.
The youngsters from the

impoverished areas nearby
have made the daily trip for
a simple reason: to get a
decent meal.
After they kiss their

mothers goodbye, the pupils
head straight to the school
canteen for a late breakfast
of chocolate milk, fruit and
sandwiches stuffed with
spicy chorizo sausage. For
most, says Ms Galacho, this
is their first food of the day.
“We have pupils who

don’t have their basic needs
covered – even things like
clothing and hygiene,” said
the principal.
Her school is part of a

programme launched by the
regional government of
Andalucia this year to com-
bat the rising hardship
caused by Spain’s prolonged
economic crisis. It allows
children from poor families
to spend summer holidays
back at school, where they
are entertained with games
and special projects.
More importantly, they

receive breakfast, lunch
and an afternoon snack – a
balanced diet that includes
fresh fruit and vegetables,
meat and fish. This is often
hard to come by in their
homes.
Even in an age of abun-

dant food supplies and dis-
count supermarkets, food
has become a worry for
Spain’s poorest. Over the

past year, says Ms Galacho,
she and her colleagues
noticed that a growing
number of students were
falling asleep in class,
apparently from fatigue and
lack of a proper diet.
“They arrive in the morn-

ing, and by mid-morning
they fall asleep,” she said.
“They just don’t have the
energy to follow the school
programme.”
The Colegio Severo Ochoa

is one of 12 state schools in
Málaga that have stayed
open over the summer.
Across Andalucia, about
11,000 children have taken
part in the programme.

Regional governments in
Extremadura and the
Canary Islands have offered
similar but smaller-scale
schemes. Taken together,
the programmes offer a
powerful reminder that
Spain’s economic crisis and
high unemployment have
led to severe social hard-
ship. And while the eco-
nomic news has been
brightening in recent
months, few believe that
there will be a speedy turn-
round for the country’s
poorest and their children.
According to recent data

from Unicef, child poverty
in Spain has been rising

since the start of the crisis
more than five years ago.
The UN children’s fund
found that almost a fifth of
Spanish youngsters live
below the poverty line – one
of the worst performers
among the 29 advanced
countries included in the
ranking, and below other
crisis-ridden southern Euro-
pean states such as Italy,
Portugal and Greece.
“Due to the crisis, fami-

lies with real economic
problems often have prob-
lems to supply their chil-
dren with proper food, to
buy fish and meat and vege-
tables. Families are cutting

spending on everything,
including on food,” said
Marta Arias, a director at
Unicef in Spain. She cites
recent survey findings indi-
cating that 40 per cent of
Spaniards say they are
changing their eating hab-
its as a result of the crisis.
Her assessment is con-

firmed by some of the moth-
ers who have sent their
children to the summer
school in Málaga.
Before the crisis, they

were able to earn a little on
the side to top up their wel-
fare benefits by cleaning
houses or helping out at
markets. Now, says Tam-
ara, a mother-of-three who
says her family lives on
€900 a month, “we have to
get the food that fits the
[economic] situation . . . We
have enough to eat but it is
often difficult to get to the
end of the month.”
The summer school pro-

grammes have been accom-
panied by alarmist warn-
ings of a growing malnutri-
tion problem, but Spain’s
association of paediatri-
cians does not agree.
José Manuel Moreno Vil-

lares, of the association’s
nutrition programme. said:
“It is clear there are more
families that have to ask for
help from private or public
institutions. But, thanks to
that support, we have not
seen any repercussions on
infant malnutrition.”
Some politicians from the

centre-right ruling Popular
party have spoken out
openly against the need for
special food programmes,
arguing it is the family’s
responsibility to feed their
children – not the state’s.
The government of Mariano
Rajoy has promised to step
up the fight against child
poverty, but has otherwise
voiced scepticism about the
need for wider Andalucian-
style school programmes.
For Ms Galacho, however,

the political debate that has
simmered for much of the
summer is of little signifi-
cance: “There is a real need,
and we try to cover that
need,” she said.

The select black T-shirts
said it all: “Stay cool, and
choose the chancellor”. The
ubiquitous orange ones sim-
ply proclaimed: “Team
Deutschland”.
Seven thousand support-

ers from the Christian Dem-
ocrat Union came to Düs-
seldorf to cheer Angela Mer-
kel, the German chancellor,
yesterday and launch the
final spurt of an election
campaign that she has dom-
inated from the start.
Huge posters of the chan-

cellor’s face plastered the
pillars and walls of the ice
hockey stadium in a blatant
demonstration of how her
ruling party is seeking to
exploit the popularity of Ms
Merkel to sweep it back to
office in the general elec-
tion on September 22.
She faced a sea of orange

T-shirts, cardboard orange
hats and posters with one
word – “Angie!” – as if to
orchestrate the chanting
that greeted her arrival at
the rally.
They used a Beatles band

to warm up the audience,
hammering out old favour-
ites to encourage a feel-
good mood in the crowd. It
was good old-fashioned nos-
talgia with old favourites
such as “A Hard Day’s
Night” and “Twist and
Shout” belted out to an
adoring audience.
Perhaps the most appro-

priate song for the occasion
was “She Loves You”,
although perhaps the real
message was that they love
her. Personalities do not
normally dominate politics
in Germany, where elec-
tions are a matter of choos-
ing a coalition government
to rule the land. But if any-
one can hope to swing an
election, it is Ms Merkel in
Germany today.
The principal, abiding

image of the CDU campaign
is an advertisement featur-
ing the chancellor’s hands
in her most popular pose –
her fingers held together in
the shape of a diamond. It
has been plastered across
the biggest election bill-
board in the land, outside
the main railway station in
Berlin. In Düsseldorf it was
more discreet: supporters in
black T-shirts bore the sim-
ple slogan of diamond
hands: “stay cool”.
And that was the message

of the chancellor, as she
deliberately delivered a
downbeat speech, hammer-
ing away at her main cam-
paign themes: free choice
for families on schools and
jobs, decent pensions for
the low paid and mothers
who have stayed at home to
look after their children,
minimum wages for the
lowest paid, but no tax rises
for the better off, as the
opposition wants.
She has stolen the middle

ground of German politics

from the centre-left opposi-
tion, insisting that the
country should be one
“where the stronger help
the weaker”, and where
there are opportunities for
all. But she also attacked
the opposition for wanting
to tell people how they
should behave, and raise
their taxes.
“We don’t try to tell peo-

ple what food they should
eat,” she said, mocking the
Green party for suggesting
that everyone should have
one meat-free day every
week.
She defended her euro-

zone crisis management,
too, insisting that holding
the eurozone together was a
fundamental national inter-
est for Germany. “Europe
for Germany is like a sec-
ond side of our homeland,”
she declared. Europe stood
for freedom of opinion, free-
dom of speech, freedom of
the press and freedom of
religion. Thanks to Euro-
pean integration, there
were no conflicts any more
over such fundamental val-
ues.

Yet the real message from
Ms Merkel is very simple:
Trust Me. I am a safe pair
of hands. I think before I
act. You know me by now,
so don’t vote for change.
Behind the razzmatazz of

the reception, however, was
a more urgent message for
the faithful. “The election
isn’t over yet. It will be a
very tight race,” as Her-
mann Gröhe, general-secre-
tary of the CDU, spelt it out
before the chancellor
arrived.
He quoted the latest poll

figures from Bild am Son-
ntag, the mass circulation
Sunday newspaper, show-
ing that the CDU, with its
Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union, and
its coalition partners, the
liberal Free Democrats, are
on a combined 45 per cent.
The opposition combina-

tion of Social Democrats
and Greens may be “far
behind”, he admitted, but if
you include the far-left
Linke party, their combined
support is exactly the same
as Ms Merkel’s – 45
per cent.

By Sarah Gordon
in Cernobbio, Italy

What a difference a year
makes. Last September’s
Ambrosetti Forum, which
gathers together policy
makers, business people
and academics at the Villa
d’Este on the banks of Lake
Como in northern Italy, was
a gloomy affair despite the
glorious surroundings.
Proceedings were domi-

nated by discussion of the
crisis in the eurozone. “It
would have been better if
we had never created the
eurozone,” said one partici-
pant. “But now that we
have, it would be disastrous
to let it collapse.”
Now, the atmosphere has

lightened considerably.
Talk of the “green shoots”
of economic recovery, in
Europe and the US, was
much on speakers’ lips,
accompanied, in the case of
senior bureaucrats from the
European institutions, by a
certain degree of self-con-
gratulation for having
“saved” the currency union.
“Unit labour costs are

converging, fiscal balances
are improving,” said a sen-
ior German academic.
“Growth is not exactly stel-
lar, but it is coming back.”
Several panellists, includ-

ing Christine Lagarde, man-
aging director of the IMF,
had come straight to Lake
Como from last week’s G20
meeting in St Petersburg.
“For the first time in

three years at the G20 and
the G8 the eurozone was
not the main target of dis-
cussion,” said one senior

European bureaucrat. “Our
patience and tenacity are
starting to bring concrete
results. Markets now know
that we stand by the euro.”
Yet, despite the change in

mood, economists at the
forum pointed out the data
from Europe and the US
were mixed, an observation
reinforced by the release of
weaker-than-expected US
jobs numbers on Friday.
And speaker after speaker

warned of the risks of com-
placency now the danger of
a eurozone collapse
appeared to have passed. As
one pointed out, “Confi-
dence leaves on horseback,
but returns on foot.”
There were repeated calls

to speed up the process of
banking union in the euro-
zone, particularly the imple-
mentation of a bank resolu-
tion mechanism. Even more
frequent were calls for
measures to create a fully
single market. “Our best
bet to improve productivity
remains our European sin-
gle market,” said one
speaker from Brussels.
Calls for reform focused

on energy and telecommu-
nications. “We need a Euro-
pean broadband system and
a European electricity net-
work,” said the leader of
one industry body.
The high cost of energy,

and consequent loss of com-
petitiveness vis a vis the US
as it benefits from cheap
shale gas, was high on the
list of concerns of chief
executives at the forum.
Several speakers argued

that some pooling of euro-
zone countries’ debt

remained a crucial step
towards recovery.
“Some degree of debt

mutualisation is neces-
sary,” argued one much-
published academic. “You
can’t be half-pregnant, and
you can’t be half-federal.”
Political uncertainty –

with elections in Germany
and Italy’s tottering coali-
tion – added to the sense

the eurozone was not out of
the woods, as did concern
over the state of one of its
most important members.
“The most vital country

today is France,” said a
former multilateral institu-
tion head. “On competitive
statistics, France is going
the wrong way.” Although
recent indicators showed its
economy out of recession,
growth remains weak,
unemployment rising and
competitive performance
continues to lag.
One source of optimism

was the prospect of a free-
trade deal with the US. But

expected higher global
interest rates were seen as
potentially damaging to
economic prospects, partic-
ularly in emerging markets.
“Emerging markets have

been lucky over the past
few years,” said economist
Nouriel Roubini. “Global
interest rates have been
low, there has been very
high demand for commodi-
ties from China, and inves-
tors have been searching
for yield. Now the tide is
turning. The risk is of a
financial crisis there [in
emerging markets] leading
to a new slowdown in the
advanced economies.”
Mr Roubini also

bemoaned the lack of lead-
ership globally, a theme to
which many speakers
returned. “There is no inter-
national community,”
asserted one panellist.
“Instead of a G20 or a G8 we
live in a G-zero world.”
Indeed, it was difficult to

avoid the sense at Ambro-
setti that debate within the
eurozone remains inward-
looking, a feeling reinforced
by the ornate surroundings
in which the forum is held.
Professor David Daokui

Li, an academic from Bei-
jing’s Tsinghua University,
was not just the only Chi-
nese participant at Ambro-
setti but the only Asian rep-
resentative. “We are very
far from where we want to
be,” said one Brussels
bureaucrat. “There is much
work to be done.”

New York mayoral race

Ombudsman makes surge
A backlash against Michael
Bloomberg has thrown the
race to replace New York’s
billionaire mayor into
turmoil, propelling one of
his biggest critics to the top
of the Democratic field,
writes Shannon Bond in
New York.
Bill de Blasio, the city’s

ombudsman, has made an
unlikely late surge fuelled
by his criticism of Mr
Bloomberg and an
emphasis on the city’s
growing economic
inequality. He has left his
Democrat rivals scrambling
to distance themselves from
the mayor and ramp up
attacks on Mr de Blasio in
the days before their
party’s primary tomorrow.
Christine Quinn, the city

council speaker once seen
as Mr Bloomberg’s heir
apparent, has found herself
in third place in the polls
after leading the field for
most of the year.
She released the first

negative advert of the
primary race last week,
attacking Mr de Blasio for
taking campaign
contributions from landlords
he had once placed on a
watch list, and accusing him
of supporting the police
department’s controversial
“stop and frisk” policy,
which the ombudsman has
criticised.
Mr Bloomberg himself

lashed out at the
frontrunner, calling the
campaign “racist” because
of Mr de Blasio’s use of his
mixed­race family in
advertisements and on the
campaign trail. “I do not
think he himself is racist
[but] it’s comparable to me
pointing out I’m Jewish in
attracting the Jewish vote,”
the mayor said.
Mr de Blasio described

Mr Bloomberg’s remarks as
“inappropriate”.

German election
The CDU aims to
exploit chancellor’s
popularity to sweep
the party back into
office, writes
Quentin Peel

By Charles Clover and
Courtney Weaver in Moscow

Alexei Navalny, the Rus-
sian opposition leader,
appeared to have exceeded
expectations in an election
for mayor of Moscow yester-
day, raising the possibility
of a recount or even a run-
off against Sergei Sobyanin,
the Kremlin-backed incum-
bent.
As polling stations closed,

exit polls conflicted with
each other over whether Mr
Navalny had done enough
to take the contest into a
second round. His own
camp’s poll put him at 35
per cent versus Mr Soby-
anin at 46 per cent. How-
ever, another poll from the
Public Opinion Foundation
– a private agency that car-
ries out sociological studies
for the Kremlin – had Mr
Sobyanin at 52 per cent and
Mr Navalny at 29 per cent.
The state-owned VTsyum

polling group gave Mr Soby-
anin 53 per cent and his
challenger 32 per cent.
If no candidate wins more

than 50 per cent in the first
round, a run-off between
the two top finishers is sup-
posed to be held within two

weeks. Preliminary results
of the voting were sched-
uled to be released at 10pm
Moscow time.
Mr Navalny was helped

by historically low turnout
in the election, at 26 per
cent as of 6pm local time,
two hours before voting
ended. The anti-corruption
blogger – who was con-
victed of fraud in July on
controversial charges – is a
populist and nationalist
opposition leader with
lower name recognition
than Mr Sobyanin, but he
made up ground with a
committed group of sup-
porters.
But even if the incumbent

is eventually declared a
first-round winner, Mr Nav-
alny’s showing is likely to
energise the opposition to
Vladimir Putin, Russia’s
president. Last week, some
projections gave the chal-
lenger only 15-16 per cent.
Furthermore, while the

exit polls could be mislead-
ing, they could provide fuel
for protests if evidence of
vote fraud emerges, as Mr
Navalny’s supporters have
claimed.
Mr Navalny’s supporters

complain that they have
not had “administrative
resources” on their side – a
euphemism for government
interference in elections.
Some measures have been
taken to address fears of
fraud. Web cameras have

been installed at all polling
stations, making the stuff-
ing of ballot boxes more dif-
ficult.
Throughout the day, sup-

porters of Mr Navalny
tweeted about instances of
alleged fraud.
In one election district,

700 soldiers were illegally
registered to vote, accord-
ing to Leonid Volkov, Mr
Navalny’s campaign man-
ager. In another, monitors
were not allowed to accom-
pany a ballot box that was
removed from the station
and which was allegedly
returned with 300 extra
ballots.
However, in Russia most

electoral fraud claims in the
past have centred on the
counting stage rather than
during voting, after proto-

cols containing vote tallies
are transferred from voting
precincts to regional cen-
tres.
Mr Navalny told his sup-

porters after the close of
voting: “We will do every-
thing so [falsification] does
not occur. We ask the
observers to work hard
these next few hours so

votes will not be stolen.”
Mr Sobyanin has

defended the voting as fair
and says the opposition has
long had a strategy of
accusing the government of
falsifying votes in order to
cover up their lack of real
domestic support.
“People are already get-

ting ready to go out on to
the street and protest
against the unfair election,”
Mr Sobyanin told the news-
paper Arguments and Facts
last week, four days before
the vote actually took place.
“We already have a huge

number of people who were
dissatisfied with the way
the elections of September 8
were held – you didn’t
know?” he joked.
“The results will be

counted both automatically
and by hand, every candi-
date will have observers.
What else should we be
doing? It seems to me that
cries of a possible fraudu-
lent mayoral election in the
capital is a provocation in
its purest form.”
At a voting station near

Polyanka metro in central
Moscow, several voters said
they planned or had already
voted for Mr Navalny.
Roman Ivanov, an audi-

tor, said although he
believed there was some
truth to the fraud charges
against Mr Navalny, the
opposition candidate had
shown “he would fight eve-

ryone who was doing all the
real stealing”.
“The battle Navalny has

chosen to fight comes at
great emotional expense
and requires huge risks,”
Mr Ivanov said. Mr Soby-
anin, by contrast, “was an
artificially created politi-
cian”.
Elena Saed, an editor,

said she had been galva-
nised by Mr Navalny’s
appearance in the race. “I
believe this is the first real
election,” she said.
Accusations of fraud in

the December 2011 parlia-
mentary elections triggered
mass street protests that
winter, which the Kremlin
only managed to contain
after suppressing opposition
activities.
The fact that Mr Navalny

was allowed to run at all
seemed to be a sign the
Kremlin was confident of
victory but also that Mr
Putin’s government might
be rethinking its authoritar-
ian strategy. There were
several other elections yes-
terday, notably in Yekater-
inburg, Russia’s fourth-
largest city, where opposi-
tion politicians were
allowed to take part.
Mr Sobyanin appeared

confident he would win a
fair election against Mr
Navalny and some observ-
ers said he welcomed the
challenge as a way of mak-
ing his win more credible.

By Simeon Kerr in Dubai

A group of businessmen
have gone on hunger strike
in Dubai’s main jail to pro-
test against their continued
incarceration for writing
cheques that bounced.
Twelve inmates from

India, Pakistan and the
Gulf, who have spent years
behind bars for failing to
honour debts during the
global financial crisis, are
likely to be joined by other
men of different nationali-
ties over the next few days,
one of the hunger strikers
said.
The 12 have written to

public prosecutors to com-
plain their sentences were
handed out in “bad faith”
and as a result of improper
application of the law.
Their protest follows a

similar hunger strike in
Dubai last year, which
ended in the release of two
prisoners after the authori-
ties reviewed their cases.
Failing to honour debts is a
criminal offence in the
United Arab Emirates.
Inmates estimate that

about 500 expatriate prison-
ers remain in jail on debt-
related crimes. Judges do
not take into consideration
the circumstances sur-
rounding a default.
But as Dubai’s economy

recovers from its tumultu-
ous real estate crash,
imprisoned debtors hope
that the authorities can be
persuaded to release them
and allow them to work off
their remaining debts.
A UAE presidential

decree last year stopped the

jailing of Emiratis for fail-
ing to honour their debts.
About 1,000 local prisoners
were subsequently released
from prisons across the fed-
eration of seven emirates.
“The Emiratis have gone

home, but we are still stuck
here,” said one of the
foreign inmates, who has
been in jail for two years,
speaking on condition of
anonymity from a prison
pay phone. “We just ask
that we can get out and
start to recover the receiva-
bles we have so we can pay
back our debts.”
Dubai’s public prosecu-

tion declined to comment.
The criminalisation of

debt has prompted interna-
tional criticism and acts as
an impediment to the crea-
tion of an entrepreneurial
culture, given the risk of
imprisonment for failing
start-ups.
The UAE government has

launched a credit bureau to
present banks with better
intelligence on prospective
borrowers’ credit profile, a
prerequisite for any attempt
to make debt a civil, rather
than criminal, offence.
But there is resistance

to decriminalisation as
personal guarantees on
cheques underpin the finan-
cial architecture of the
country, providing creditors
with leverage against
borrowers.
Many banks argue that

tough measures are needed
to prevent debtors fleeing
the country. Expatriates
form a large majority of
about 75 per cent of the
country.

Carmakers Many of the world’s most powerful motor industry chief executives are expected
to step down soon but questions remain about potential successors. By Henry Foy

New hands on the wheel

O
n August 29, Renault’s chief
operating officer Carlos
Tavares quit the company
after an emergency meeting

of the astonished board.
Only two weeks earlier, the Portu-

guese executive had given an inter-
view that convulsed the motor indus-
try: he had taken a shot at his widely-
respected boss and had suggested that
he would be more successful as chief
executive at a rival carmaker.

His remarks, made to the Bloomberg
news agency on August 14, have so far
failed to land him a plum job at
another company. Still, the unex-
pected comments from a man consid-
ered heir-apparent at France’s second-
largest carmaker has lifted the bonnet
on the hottest and most intriguing
story in the car industry: succession.

Many of the world’s biggest car com-
panies, all run by men, are expected to
change their chief executives soon.

“You are going to see a generational
transition start to emerge over the
next 12 to 18 months,” says a senior
executive at one global carmaker.
“There’s a cycle approaching in the

industry.” In an industry that requires
long product development and
demands long-term investment deci-
sions, automotive chief executives typ-
ically stay for the best part of a dec-
ade. They define companies and their
vehicles for years.

Such is the sense of anticipation
about the leaders-in-waiting that when
General Motors merely tweaked the
composition of the pension of 64-year-
old chief executive Dan Akerson in
April, it sparked a flurry of specula-
tion that he was looking to leave.

Boardroom pressure on Daimler
chief Dieter Zetsche and the move-
ments of those tipped as frontrunners
to replace him have generated more
headlines this year than the com-
pany’s financial performance.

The world’s most powerful car chief
executives come from mixed back-
grounds. Gone are the days when an
engineering degree and a decade on
the production line were the route to
the top. The seven largest car groups
by sales are now headed by a former
aviation executive (Ford), an account-
ant (Fiat-Chrysler), a tyre expert

(Renault-Nissan), a naval officer
turned private equity executive (GM),
one metallurgist (Volkswagen) and
two sons from distinguished families
(Toyota and Hyundai).

Ford and Fiat have all turned to
successful businessmen from outside
the industry to rescue them in the
past 10 years. Both rebounded spectac-
ularly, thanks mainly to financial rig-
our and restructuring.

“There are very few people today
that you can really call auto guys
[at the top],” says Stefano Aversa,
managing director at AlixPartners, a
consultancy. “The concept that a
top executive should be an auto
guy . . . that knows the product inside
out, clearly is not true any more.”

But at Volkswagen, run almost
exclusively by engineers and techni-
cally-minded managers such as chief
executive Martin Winterkorn, success
has been built on an unrelenting focus
on improving the engineering of the
vehicles. “In the premium segment
you need to be more of a product guy,
long-term oriented,” adds Mr Aversa.
“But in the mainstream volume, you
need more general management skills,
financial discipline.”

Mr Tavares named Ford and GM as
the two companies that he thought he
was good enough to run. Both have
denied plans to hire him, but the two
are considered the most likely to begin
the expected flurry of successions.

At Ford, the future looks clear. The
company announced in November that
chief executive Alan Mulally, 68,
would remain at the helm through
2014, while all but anointing Mark
Fields as his replacement by promot-
ing him to chief operating officer.

Mr Akerson at GM has yet to set a
departure date but is considered
unlikely to continue past 2016. The
field of potential successors is wide.

Vice-chairman Steve Girsky and North
America head Mark Reuss are seen
internally as the frontrunners, say two
people close to the company. Mary
Barra, head of product development,
and Grace Lieblein, who is in charge
of purchasing, are also in contention
to become the industry’s first female
chief executive.

Mr Winterkorn, 66, is keeping his
cards close to his chest. Volkswagen
has a wide range of internal candi-
dates across the group’s vast array of
brands. Audi’s chief executive Rupert
Stadler is considered the frontrunner.

Many big names in the industry
sport a number of different company
marques on their CVs. Companies typ-
ically choose to hire talent from out-
side when launching new initiatives or
product lines. Nissan poached Audi’s
former US head Johan de Nysschen to
run its new push towards premium
vehicles and VW’s former China chief
Karl-Thomas Neumann left to head up
GM in Europe.

That is good news for carmakers
without an obvious successor.

Fiat’s Sergio Marchionne shows no

sign of stepping down but lacks an
obvious protégé at the Italian car-
maker and has struggled to cultivate a
shortlist of potential heirs, say two
people who know the company.

The same is true at Renault in the
wake of Mr Tavares’ departure, offi-
cials admit. At sister company Nissan,
which has the most international
blend of executives in the industry,
the bench is deeper.

“One of our main concerns in the
industry broadly is a lack of leader-
ship candidates across the board,”
says Anil Valsan, lead automotive
analyst at EY, the professional serv-
ices firm. “There’s a worry that [car-
makers] are not doing enough to men-
tor and nurture future leaders.”

The changemaker Alan Mulally The businessman Dan Akerson

The dealmaker Sergio Marchionne

In an industry enamoured of
alliances but awful at making
them work, Mr Ghosn is the
exception.
He was an executive at

Renault in 1999 when it
bought a stake in Nissan. He
made the Japanese company
profitable within a year and
was leading both carmakers
by 2005.
The Brazilian­Lebanese­

Frenchman’s gruelling air miles
between Paris and Yokohama
play to the alliance’s
strengths, blending Renault’s

diesel technology and
European reach with Nissan’s
manufacturing prowess. It is
the world’s fourth­largest
carmaker by combined sales.
He shows no sign of

loosening his grip. When
his protégé agitated for a
promotion, the successor­in­
waiting had to quit.
Mr Ghosn’s legacy hinges

on his bet on emerging
markets through revival of the
Datsun marque and Russia’s
Lada, and his faith in electric
and self­driving vehicles.

The car that
sums up his era
Ghosn promised to
make a mass­
market electric car.
Four years later

world’s top­selling.

Possible
successors
Andy Palmer,
Nissan’s executive
vice­president
Joe Peter,
Nissan CFO
Jérôme Stoll,
Renault sales and
marketing chief

A one­company man, the
60­year­old Mr Zetsche has
led Daimler since 2006 and is
respected for reviving its
flagship Mercedes­Benz brand
after the disastrous merger
with Chrysler was abandoned.
As head of Mercedes, in

addition to his chairmanship of
the group, his attention to
detail and focus on
engineering excellence led the
marque to stem years of
declining quality.
But despite a pledge to

make Mercedes the world’s
top luxury brand by sales, it
has slipped behind Audi and
BMW because of a lack of
key products and mistakes
made in China. Daimler’s
stock price has trailed that of
its German rivals.
Famous for his immaculately

coiffured white moustache,
Zetsche has been under
pressure from disgruntled
investors in recent quarters
and in February was given a

contract extension only to
2016, two years less

than expected.

piece of technical
brilliance but sales

successors

manufacturing

Admired for his straight­talking
and dry humour, Mr
Marchionne is an executive
who defied the odds to rescue
Fiat and the Agnelli family’s
fortune in the company.
Feted by many as the most

wily dealmaker in the car
industry, he honed his
negotiating skills by dealing
with Italian politicians and
unions over restructuring Fiat.
He snapped up Chrysler
cheaply after its bankruptcy in

what could come to be seen
as one of the best car deals
of all time.
However, the job is only

half­done. In the short term,
Mr Marchionne has to
convince a union trust that
holds the rest of Chrysler to
sell its stake at a price
acceptable to Fiat. He then
has to make the merged
company work efficiently.
Revitalising Alfa Romeo will be
a big challenge.

Global sales have increased by
half during Martin Winterkorn’s
six­and­a­half year tenure at
Volkswagen Group. Its
premium brand Audi has
almost overtaken BMW as the
biggest luxury marque. The
mainstream VW brand remains
profitable while other leading
brands in Europe are making
losses.
Crucially, he is backed by

Ferdinand Piëch, chairman of
the supervisory board.
One of the only true nuts­

and­bolts enthusiasts at the
top of the industry, Mr
Winterkorn oversees 12
automotive brands and
Volkswagen is on track to
overtake GM and Toyota at
the top of the global sales
tree by 2018. Maintaining
quality as it ramps up quantity
will be his toughest test.
Still, he shows no sign of

tiring. His executives are
playing a game of musical
chairs as they jostle to
succeed him.

The car that
sums up his era
Audi A8. Audi is
cool again. The
vehicles are selling
well and are highly
profitable.

The only one of the US Big
Three not to go bankrupt or
turn to the state for a bailout,
Ford was arguably a harder
company to turn round than
its Detroit cousins, GM and
Chrysler.
Affable but driven, Mr

Mulally has sold off
non­core brands such as
Jaguar and Land Rover. He
has also pushed his One Ford
strategy to streamline
production around the world.

A resurgent US market has
fuelled sales of the F­150
truck, a cash cow. Small cars
also continue to gain market
share.
Mr Mulally has adopted a

realistic stance on Europe’s
crisis and learnt from early
mistakes in emerging markets
such as India. With a
successor all but anointed,
Mr Mulally has continually
stressed he will leave Ford
after 2014.

Possible
successors
Very hard to look
beyond Mark
Fields, COO

The car that
sums up his era
From the streets
of Mumbai to the
roads of London,
the EcoSport SUV
is a one­size­fits­all
global model: the
holy grail for
carmakers.

A former telecommunications
executive and private equity
head who spent five years as
an officer on a navy destroyer,
Mr Akerson was a surprise
choice to run the US’s biggest
carmaker.
But three years into the job,

he has turned the company
round. He has drawn on a
strategy of blending his
financial acumen and
management skills with

automotive knowhow from a
close­knit team of lieutenants
with decades of experience.
The unconvinced say much

of GM’s success has been
down to a revived US car
market and products
developed before his arrival.
Still, sales are robust and

the company made $39bn in
revenues last quarter, up
4 per cent from the same
period in 2012.

Possible
successors
Steve Girsky,
vice­chairman

Long live such
quaint customs
From Mr Peter Wheadon.
Sir, I was intrigued by your

editorial “In for the count” with its
subheading “Arguments for
scrapping UK census do not add up”
(September 3). From it I learnt that
in Britain there is a census and that
it is based on a “10-yearly
confidential survey that Britons have
been compelled to fill in for more
than two centuries”. Amazing! Over
here in Denmark there is no such
thing as a census, nor any
compulsory survey confidential or
otherwise. Britain is indeed special.
Long may these traditions of survey
and census last, just like countless
other wonderful traditions such as
MPs voting by walking through
lobbies and being counted by tellers!

WTCmemorial fails in its first duty
From Mr Michael Burke.
Sir, As your striking front page

photograph illustrated (September 5),
the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre
must be remembered, even as the
last of its survivors passes on.
To ensure that it would never be

forgotten, the French people have
preserved the town’s ruins as the
Nazis left them, June 10 1944. To
this day visitors can walk past
and gaze upon the razed church
and post office; the doctor’s car.
Signs posted about state cryptic
messages such as: “Here six
innocents were murdered. Collect
your thoughts.”
The memorial demands we

confront the crime and our
obligations in response.
Compare this to what we have

done at the billion-dollar, eight-acre
“National September 11 Memorial at
the World Trade Center”. There
every last trace of the attacks has
been eradicated and replaced with
“expressionist” architecture in order
to provide us with a lovely place of
peace and solace. Our only obligation
is to ourselves.
With its gigantic waterfalls and

hundreds of pretty little trees, all
magnificently lit at night, the
memorial is an impressive sight.
However, by wiping the site clean
of its history, it fails in its first
duty: to remind visitors, now
and for generations to come, to
never forget and to resolve never
again.

Youth unemployment is Germany’s most telling statistic
From Mr Bruce Mathers.
Sir, Adam Posen’s article on

Germany’s problems (“Germany is
being crushed by its export
obsession”, September 4) raises a lot
of questions: whether ever-increasing
university education is desirable;

whether growth in productivity
expressed as a percentage is
meaningful; why German fixed
investment, which is considerably
higher than the UK’s, is considered
too low. Surely the most telling
statistic, which subsumes all of

these, is the rate of youth
unemployment. As one of the very
few countries in the world to hold
this below 10 per cent, can Germany
really be described as “crushed”?
Bruce Mathers,
Zug, Switzerland

A peculiar position in the global business cycle
From Dr Carsten-Patrick Meier.
Sir, By joining the choir

bemoaning Germany’s trade
surpluses (“Germany is being
crushed by its export obsession”,
September 4), Adam Posen confesses
a disturbing misconception of
Germany’s recent macroeconomic
record and the role of its labour
market reforms.
You may recall that the allegedly

export-obsessed country ran a
current account deficit over all of
the 1990s, right up until 2001. Note
further that this deficit was the flip
side of the surge in residential and
corporate investment triggered by
unification, mass immigration from
eastern Europe and the deregulation
of the post and telecoms sector,
which further fuelled the already
rampant stock market hype. When
this post-unification investment
bubble finally burst, highly indebted
companies and households and a
tattered banking system went into
balance-sheet repair mode. No

recourse to low productivity growth
is needed to explain why from 2001
onwards domestic demand and in
particular investment was sharply
damped – the more so since the
newly inaugurated European Central
Bank rightly set interest rates for
the booming eurozone higher than
the Bundesbank would probably
have set it for “the sick man of
Europe”, as Germany was called at
the time.
It was under these weak domestic

conditions, with the unemployment
rate heading north of 12 per cent,
that German politicians at last found
the courage to cut back the worst of
the disincentives to work introduced
during the expansion of the welfare
state some 30 years ago. These
“Hartz” reforms were deliberately
aimed at improving the conditions in
the labour market; they were
intended to lower “reservation”
wages and increase labour demand.
The particular target was the
demand for low-skilled labour that

had effectively been shut out from
the labour market by high contract
wages – and its reintegration into
the labour market since necessarily
implied low average productivity
growth. Undoubtedly, the wage
moderation that followed meant a
sharp improvement in German
international price competitiveness.
However, this is not evidence of
Germany’s obsession with exports
but, again, a result of its peculiar
position in the global business cycle:
while its bubble-struck domestic
economy was weak, the rest of the
eurozone, the Anglo-Saxon world and
some of the emerging economies
were in the midst of an investment
boom. That boom, too, turned out to
have been just another bubble, in
2007 – interestingly, the year that
also saw the German trade surplus
(as a percentage of gross domestic
product) peak.

Comparisons
seldom edify
From Mr Geoff Loram.
Sir, With reference to Lucy

Kellaway’s column “A cure for the
pangs of cyber comparisons”
(September 2): the novelist Francis
Brett Young, in his verse history of
Britain The Island – a fascinating
book – put these words into the
mouth of James Thomson, the 18th
century Scots poet:
“Sir, comparisons may sometimes

illustrate, never prove and seldom
edify.”
A wise sentiment worthy of

remembrance by wordsmiths, of
which noble calling I am but a

Reserve currency: the three downsides
From Prof Marie Christine Duggan.
Sir, Rod Price writes (Letters,

September 4): “I struggle to see any
downside for the US in having a
monopoly on printing the world’s
currency.” I would like to point out
three downsides for US citizens from
having the dollar as the global
reserve.
First, inflows of foreign funds into

US financial sector tend to reduce
interest rates, providing incentive for
US households, government, and
business to take on debt.
Second, US assets are thereby

lower risk, which tends to increase
global demand for US assets. Rising
sales of US financial assets to
foreigners cause the dollar to
appreciate, and hence make US
manufacturing and service exports
uncompetitive internationally,

undermining the industrial base.
Third, the dollar reserve grows the

US financial sector, which, given also
deindustrialisation, leads to rising
income inequality.
If the dollar were no longer the

reserve currency, Americans would
have lower levels of personal debt,
less government debt, and businesses
with less debt. The US
manufacturing base would tend to
revive, and income inequality would
decline.
Yes, there would be losers. My own

retirement plan would plummet in
value if the dollar were no longer
the reserve. However, my children
and my students would benefit from
the better quality of life.

Excluding India’s
rural economy
From Mr Kavaljit Singh.
Sir, Your editorial “A good start by

India’s new broom” (September 5)
misses an important segment of the
inaugural statement made by
Raghuram Rajan, the new governor
of Reserve Bank of India. In another
major policy reversal, he is freeing
the domestic banks from seeking
permission from the RBI to open a
branch anywhere in the country.
Under the existing branch

authorisation policy, opening of
branches in metropolitan areas and
tier 1 cities (with a population of
100,000 and above) requires prior
permission from the RBI. This policy
was introduced by the RBI to
address the growing urban-rural
asymmetries in the post-liberalisation
period. There was a secular decline
in the absolute number of rural
branches between 1994 and 2006
while the branches in metros
proliferated from 5,839 to 11,799
during the same period. The
proportion of credit flow to rural
areas has declined substantially
since 1991.
Currently, the top 10 urban centres

(Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore
and the like) account for 49 per cent
of total deposit and 60 per cent of
total credit in India. How can the
rural economy grow if banking
services are highly concentrated in a
few metros and cities?
Left to themselves, banks would

prefer to open more branches in
metros and will “cherry-pick” the
most profitable businesses and
affluent customers. The recent
experience also shows that the
urban-centric banks are reluctant to
provide banking services to the
urban poor and low-income segments
of society.
This policy move may further

accentuate the existing asymmetry
and could undermine the ongoing
financial inclusion programmes to
provide accessible and affordable
banking services to the unbanked
population.
I do not need to remind the new

governor that financial inclusion is a
necessary precondition (not an
option) for sustainable and inclusive
growth in a country such as ours.

America’s heart is in the city once again

My former Brooklyn home wasonce almost demolished tomake way for a baseball sta-
dium. Walter O’Malley, the former
owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, drew
up plans to raze a couple of hundred
townhouses and plonk a new stadium
on top. When refused by Robert
Moses, then New York’s legendary
city planner, O’Malley moved the
Dodgers to Los Angeles.
That was in 1957, when the Dodgers’

Italian-American fans had started to
abandon Brooklyn and move to the
Long Island suburbs. O’Malley
thought if he sited the stadium by the
Long Island Rail Road station at
Atlantic Avenue, it would be an easy
journey. It was at the start of the
decline of New York that culminated,
amid street crime and urban derelic-
tion, in near bankruptcy in 1975.
These days, of course, no one would

think for a second of knocking down
several streets of brownstones in Park
Slope (the Barclays Center basketball
stadium has since been erected on old

railway yards nearby). Young families
are not heading eagerly to Long
Island and New Jersey any more –
they want to remain in hipster Brook-
lyn if they can afford it.
New York’s astonishing urban

revival since the 1980s, culminating in
bankers with children transforming
Tribeca into “Triburbia”, has turned
Brooklyn neighbourhoods such as
Park Slope, Cobble Hill and Fort
Greene into the new suburbs. For mil-
lennial parents, commuting into the
city from a detached house in Westch-
ester is a poor second best.
Whatever happened to the suburb,

the postwar phenomenon that made
the US a country of low-density hous-
ing, suburban sprawl based on driving
instead of walking – an archipelago,
according to author Leigh Gallagher
(a child of the suburbs), of “little
marching bands and soccer leagues,
bake sales and PTA meetings”?
The “inner city” – once a sinkhole

of deprivation – is the place well-off
professionals want to live. When Jane
Jacobs wrote The Death and Life of
Great American Cities in 1961, advo-
cating the virtues of high-density liv-
ing and little shops, it was a rear-
guard action. That fight is over.
There are still swaths of suburbs

(and, beyond them, the “exurbs” of
Orange County, California or Phoenix,
Arizona). There is also Detroit, whose
inner core faces demolition for want
of a better idea. But the US is becom-
ing positively European in its enthusi-
asm for high-density living.

Gallagher, a business journalist
most at home discussing the econom-
ics of city dwelling and quizzing
housebuilders, never quite answers
the question of why things changed
but does provide clues. One is that the
suburbs went too far – Brooklyn
Heights, one subway stop across the
East River from Wall Street, was once
considered a suburb but some Orange
County commuters slog through a
three-hour traffic jam to work.
Demographics also changed the cal-

culation. In the New Jersey commuter
town where Gallagher’s parents lived,
it was common to have four or five
children. Now, the US relies on immi-

gration for new workers – today’s
young parents settle for one or
two kids, and do not require huge
yards and pools. By 2025, families
with children will form only a quarter
of US households.
Perhaps because Gallagher wants to

keep the book light and entertaining,
which it is, she has little to say about
“white flight” and the ways in which
some suburbanites in the 1970s were
not simply seeking a little slice of

heaven beyond the city but were
abandoning neighbourhoods as black
and Latino residents moved in. US
development is far more fluid than in
Europe because there is more space to
move outwards, and ethnic and racial
segregation has financial effects. In
the past, the exodus drained property
tax revenues from inner cities, caus-
ing downward spirals into poverty
and crime. Now, they are spiralling in
the other direction.
Gallagher identifies the 2008 bust as

a turning point – when homes in
desirable city neighbourhoods held
their values much better than
McMansions in Florida and California.
But subprime sprawl was also a symp-
tom of people being forced to venture
ever further to find affordable hous-
ing. “Please tell me it has a happy
ending,” the chief executive of a sub-
urban developer pleads to Gallagher.
She does her best to provide one –
after years of angst about the death of
the US city, the corpse has sprung to
life and is looking sprightly. City liv-
ing is healthier, more sociable and
more environmentally sustainable.
But when prices rose in US suburbs,

you could always build another one.
Despite the “new urbanist” movement
to build city-like suburbs, there is
only one Fort Greene, or Center City,
Philadelphia. The new renovated shin-
ing city upon a hill is awfully expen-
sive.

The End of the
Suburbs
Where the American Dream is Moving

By Leigh Gallagher
(Portfolio Penguin, $25.95)

The challenges
facing Australia
Abbott’s term will be bumpier than his easy electoral stroll

Tony Abbott did not have to do all
that much to win this weekend’s
general election in Australia. The
leader of the conservative Liberal-
National coalition ran a tight cam-
paign, staying clear of the gaffes
which have marked his two-decade
long political career. But it was the
endless infighting within the rul-
ing Labor party which convinced
the electorate to back a man they
never truly loved.
Last June – a mere two months

before the vote – Labor replaced
Julia Gillard, party leader and
prime minister, with her predeces-
sor Kevin Rudd, whom Ms Gillard
had herself back-stabbed in 2010.
The party’s continuous splits over-
shadowed its reasonable record in
office. Helped by China’s demand
for its coal and iron ore, Australia
was the only major rich economy
to escape a recession during the
financial crisis.
The economic outlook facing Mr

Abbott will be far tougher. China
is moving towards a consumer-
driven model of development and
commodity prices are tumbling.
Australia can no longer rely on its
mining sector to keep the economy
going. Unemployment, which
has been hovering around 5 per
cent, is edging up. As fiscal reve-
nues shrink, it will become
harder to keep the budget deficit
in check.

Throughout the electoral cam-
paign, Australia’s new prime min-
ister has been remarkably vague
over his economic plans. The con-
servative coalition first vowed
they would close the budget deficit
within their first year in office,
only to then tone down that prom-
ise. Australia’s net debt is only
12 per cent of gross domestic prod-
uct. There is no need for a precipi-
tate fiscal tightening which could
put further strain on growth.
Mr Abbott was much clearer on

his intention to scrap a carbon tax
and a levy on miners’ profits, both
introduced by Labor. Here, his
instincts are wrong. It is better to
tax pollution than investments and
work. The government has the
right to claim a share of the gains
companies make by exploiting
Australia’s hidden treasures.
On foreign policy, the anglophile

new prime minister is widely
expected to strengthen Australia’s
ties with the US and adopt a more
cautious approach towards China.
But Mr Abbott needs to thread
carefully. Australia depends on
Washington for its military secu-
rity. But China will remain a key
commercial partner even as it
rebalances away from its resource-
driven model.
Having strolled to an easy elec-

toral victory, Mr Abbott will have
a bumpier road ahead in office.

Colombia’s peace
Curiously, it is going better in Havana than in Bogotá

After 50 years of conflict, peace in
Colombia has never been so close
nor seemed so far away. Ten
months ago, the government of
President Juan Manuel Santos
opened peace talks with the Marx-
ist Farc guerrillas in Havana.
Progress has been slow. Officially,
only one item on a six-point
agenda has been agreed. Mean-
while, Mr Santos faces serious
peace problems at home. Late last
month, he sent in troops after a
farmers’ strike spiralled out of con-
trol, leaving two dead in Bogotá.
Inevitably, there has been talk of a
“Colombian spring”.
A better comparison is with Bra-

zil’s street protests, which also
tapped into a mood of public dis-
content. What started on August
19 as a series of disparate protests
by small farmers seeking state sub-
sidies snowballed after it was
joined by striking truck drivers,
students, the odd anarchist, indige-
nous groups and anyone else with
an axe to grind.
Some of those axes are eco-

nomic. Growth has slowed. Trade
liberalisation has coincided with
rapid currency appreciation, ham-
mering domestic producers – espe-
cially the artisanal agricultural
sector.
Paradoxically the peace process,

although popular nationally, is not
helping: as the fog of war lifts,

Colombia’s other ills, especially
inequality, are more fully revealed.
The less well-off are galled by the
conspicuous consumption of the
well-to-do.
Yet much of the discontent is of

Mr Santos’ making. His handling
of the protests was ham-fisted; at
first he dismissed the farmers’
strike as irrelevant. He has a gov-
erning style that critics compare to
the tango – heading first one way,
then another. The perception is he
lacks direction, which is further
boosted by a sense the peace talks
are bogged down. His approval rat-
ings have slumped to 21 per cent,
the lowest for any president in a
decade.
This does not mean that it is all

over for Mr Santos, though. He
will probably seek a second term
in next May’s elections to see
through the peace process. Taking
Brazil’s example, his ratings could
bounce back. The economy is still
growing at a 3.5 per cent clip. And
the Havana talks are probably
going better than they seem. The
Farc, although a potent force, is at
a strategic dead-end. It also knows
that the best chance of a peace
deal lies with Mr Santos. Still, reel-
ing in that deal is akin to landing
a whale. In the meantime, as
recent events show, there will be
much thrashing about and fishing
in troubled waters.

Rush and repent
UK government should withdraw lobbying legislation

The British government’s conces-
sion on Friday night to revise its
controversial lobbying bill by
amendment was a tactical deci-
sion. By responding to legitimate
concerns over the threat it posed
to free speech, ministers hoped to
ensure rapid passage through the
House of Commons this week. The
retreat is welcome. But it fails to
resolve other flaws in a hastily-
drafted bill which, as it stands,
should be rejected.
The revised legislation will do

little to shed light on the relation-
ship between politicians and those
who seek to influence their deci-
sions. Barely 1 per cent of lobbying
will be captured because the bill
exempts vast swaths of the indus-
try from disclosing meetings with
ministers or officials. That alone
would be reason enough to
demand it be withdrawn.
But the government is also seek-

ing to deal a blow to political oppo-
nents by tacking measures on to
the bill that curb non-party cam-
paign spending and widen the
range of activities that should
come under the cap. Aimed at
restraining the big trade unions,
the measure threatened to prevent
charities, blogs and other interest
groups from campaigning on pol-
icy issues during an election year.
The government’s amendment

goes some way towards closing

this dangerous loophole. But there
are still concerns over the uncer-
tainty created by the requirement
to include activities such as rallies,
media and staff costs in the spend-
ing cap, rather than just political
material such as leaflets.
It may make sense to widen the

definition of what constitutes elec-
tion campaigning. Yet the speed
with which this bill is being
pushed through parliament means
that there is little clarity over how
the rules should apply to different
types of activity. The independent
Electoral Commission has also
criticised the lack of pre-legislative
scrutiny. The government has
acted with undue haste, simply in
an effort to ensure that the law is
in place a year before the general
election. This is not good lawmak-
ing.
The bill should be withdrawn.

Campaign measures should be
decoupled from the lobbying pro-
posals and considered independ-
ently. In any case, legislation
affecting political funding and elec-
tions should be the subject of
cross-party agreement.
A delay should also provide an

opportunity to revise the lobbying
proposals. Making sure that public
policy decisions are open to
proper scrutiny will resonate more
with voters than hasty partisan
coups.

Investors, train your attention on the US budget balance
From Mr Philip Pilkington.
Sir, Your article “Clash of the

Cape crusaders” (Analysis,
September 3), while very
illuminating, nevertheless does not
address how Robert Shiller’s Cape
index might be used to forecast
future medium-term stock market
movements. Dr Shiller hints at this
where he says of earnings: “The
sense is that they are unsustainable.

They grew at about 2 per cent per
year over the last 150 years. When
they suddenly shoot up, in the
middle of a financial crisis, you
wonder.”
In a guest post on your FT

Alphaville blog (“Playing profit with
the stock market”, July 1), I laid out
strong empirical evidence from the
Jerome Levy Forecasting Center
which indicated that abnormally

high earnings growth in the US since
the crisis has been due to the
expansion of massive government
deficits. With the scent of
sequestration in the air, I would
suggest it is on the government
budget balance that investors train
their attention.

COMMENT

The arithmetic of Germany’s election points to instability
The reason for this lies in a

combination of the fiddly arithmetic
of German elections and the balance
of power in the Bundesrat, the upper
house of parliament where the
regional states are represented. Right
now there are five parties in the
Bundestag, the lower house. On the
centre-right are the Christian
Democrats of Angela Merkel, the
chancellor – who sit as one group
with their Bavarian sibling, the
Christian Social Union – and the
liberal Free Democrats; to the left
are the Social Democrats, the Greens
and the Left party. The latest polls
suggest a sixth party might also
have an outside chance of joining
them: the Alternative für
Deutschland, the only party that
favours an exit from the euro.
The polls have been favouring a

narrow majority for the present
centre-right coalition of CDU and
FDP. But these parties do not have a
majority in the Bundesrat and, given
the electoral cycle for state elections,
such a majority will be elusive for at

least another three years. It is hard
to see how the present coalition
could govern, especially as I would
expect that should the SPD remain
in opposition they would be much
less supportive of Ms Merkel’s
eurozone policies than they were in
the outgoing legislature. The SPD
rank and file would be sorely
tempted to defy the party’s mostly
centrist leadership and move left to
embrace more populist positions.
The alternative favoured by many

is that typically European
arrangement: a grand coalition of the
two biggest parties that sees almost
everyone end up on the government
benches. The CDU and the SPD
would have a comfortable majority
in both houses of parliament.
A grand coalition would only occur

if the CDU and FDP fail to get a
majority. This inturn implies that
the parties of the left have a
majority in a five-party parliament.
The latter is only a hypothetical
majority because the SPD has ruled
out a coalition with the Left party –

for now. But the Social Democrats
could change tack during the
parliamentary term. So, Ms Merkel
would have a partner who could bail
out at any time to form a three-way
coalition of the left, or a two-party
minority government with the
Greens, tacitly supported by the Left
party. The latter has been tried at
regional level, where it has been a
great success for the SPD. The
temptation for the party to end Ms
Merkel’s reign at some point in the
next four years will be hard to resist.
I do not believe that the SPD

would form a three-party coalition of
the left right away. To do so would
be dishonest after the promises the

party has made. This leaves as the
two most probable scenarios either
an unstable government of the
centre-right, which has no majority
in the upper house, or an unstable
grand coalition, which could fall
apart at any moment. Neither might
survive a full term.
What does this mean for the rest

of Europe? In the first scenario, the
German government will have even
less room for manoeuvre in the
eurozone crisis. A grand coalition
may look more pro-European – but
be careful what you wish for.
Gridlock may swiftly return as a
permanent threat of new elections
hangs over such a coalition. Soon we
might hear again that we have to
wait until after the next German
elections.
The only scenario in which you

can see any form of stability is one
where both the AfD and the FDP
win more than 5 per cent of the
votes, the threshold for
parliamentary representation. Then
the Bundestag would have six parties

Gridlock may swiftly
return and soon we might
hear again that we have
to wait until after the
next German elections

and neither the CDU and the FDP,
nor the SPD, Greens and the Left
would have an absolute majority. In
that case, the grand coalition would
be the only option – and it would be
stable. None of the partners would
have an incentive to leave. It would
be similar to the grand coalition of
Ms Merkel’s first term in 2005-09. The
problem with that is long-term. The
AfD might become a stronger force,
pushing the CDU to a more
eurosceptic position.
The ultimate irony is that a

necessary precondition for a
continuation of Ms Merkel’s current
policies – whatever you may think of
them – is the election of an anti-
European party. If the AfD fails to
clear the 5 per cent hurdle – which
is what most observers, including
me, expect – then it is hard to see
any constellation that delivers
stability to German politics. The next
four years promise to be very
different from the last.

It has become the receivedwisdom of Europe’s politicalclasses: until the German general
election later this month nothing
much will happen – and then, hey
presto, at 12.01am on September 23,
the world will be a different place.
Do not get your hopes up. Rather

than delivering a momentous
breakthrough, opening the way for
movement on the crisis still gripping
Europe, I see the real gridlock
starting right at that moment.
Instead of looking at the impact of
the German elections on Europe, we
should look at the impact on
Germany. On the basis of the polls,
even allowing for plenty of statistical
wiggle room, it is hard to conceive of
a scenario in which Germany could
end up with a stable government for
four years. There is only one such
scenario I can think of – but this is
at present not considered a high-
probability event.

China will stay the course on sustainable growth
Instead, we must take a holistic
approach in pursuing steady growth,
structural readjustment and further
reform.
Reform remains the driving force.

We will continue to streamline
government and delegate power,
press ahead with structural changes
and grow economic sectors under
diverse ownership. Government will
leave to the market and society what
they can do well while concentrating
on those matters within its purview.
We will advance reforms of

administrative management, fiscal
and tax systems, financial sectors
and pricing. The theme of this year’s
Summer Davos Forum is “Meeting
the Innovation Imperative”. To me
this means not only technological
but more importantly institutional
innovation, and reform is also a way
of innovation.
Opening up at a faster pace gives

impetus to development. We will
continue to support the Doha round
of World Trade Organisation talks,
work for the signing of bilateral free
trade agreements, upgrade the China-
Asean Free Trade Area, and provide
a level playing field and a better
legal environment for foreign

investors. We will explore new ways
to open China to the outside world,
and Shanghai’s pilot free-trade zone
is a case in point.
A key focus is the expansion of

domestic demand. Here China enjoys
one great advantage: its 1.3bn people
are keen to work hard in pursuit of
a better life and make up a huge
domestic market. We will expand

consumer demand through initiatives
such as the promotion of the IT
sector through the expansion of
broadband and 4G licences.
While focusing on consumption, we

will keep a reasonable scale of
investment with priority given to
energy conservation, environmental
protection, railway projects in the
central and western regions, and
municipal facilities.

Urbanisation also offers huge
potential for long-term domestic
demand. Of the people living in the
countryside, more than 100m are set
to be absorbed into cities over the
next decade or so. This will be an
extremely complex process of
economic and social change,
requiring a new policy approach
aimed at balanced development.
There will be many difficulties, but
it is what we must accomplish in
order to narrow the urban-rural gap.
The service sector will be an

increasingly important pillar of our
economy. As the biggest job
provider, the sector helps ease
employment pressure in economic
transformation. The government will
improve public services. This year,
we have suspended value added tax
and sales tax on many small
businesses, the majority of which are
in the service sector.
Our government has defined the

“upper and lower limits” of the
reasonable range of economic
performance with a view to avoiding
excessive fluctuations. With a gross
domestic product growth rate of
around 7.5 per cent, the “lower limit”
is intended to ensure steady growth

and employment. The moderation of
economic growth from double-digit
figures in the past to 9.3 per cent in
2011, 7.7 per cent in 2012 and then to
around 7.5 per cent this year, is the
result of both natural economics and
our readjustment initiatives.
With the consumer price index at

around 3.5 per cent, the “upper
limit” is meant to prevent inflation.
If our economy is kept within this
reasonable range and financial risks
are effectively forestalled, markets
and society will have stable
expectations. This year there has
also been steady economic progress.
In the first half of this year, GDP
grew by 7.6 per cent year-on-year.
Surveyed unemployment at around
5 per cent and inflation at 2.4 per
cent are both within the reasonable
and manageable range. However,
global uncertainties remain.
The anticipation of the withdrawal

of quantitative easing by some major
developed countries has led to a
massive influx of capital back to
developed markets and big
fluctuations on the stock and
currency markets in many Asian
countries.
Some observers even worry about

Asian countries have
learnt the lessons from
the past and enhanced
their capabilities to
fend off risks

F ive years on from the start ofthe financial crisis, manycountries now face new
challenges as the world economy
slowly recovers.
The Summer Davos Forum, which

opens this week in Dalian, will be
closely watched for signs of the state
and strength of the Chinese
economy, which finds itself at a
crucial stage of transformation.
Observers ask whether China’s

economic slowdown will lead to a
sharp decline – or even a hard
landing – and whether our reform
programme will be derailed by
complex social problems. My answer
is that our economy will maintain its
sustained and healthy growth and
China will stay on the path of
reform and opening up.
Shortly after it took office in

March, the new Chinese government
made clear its policy was to sustain
economic growth, improve people’s
wellbeing and promote social equity.
We can no longer afford to continue
with the old model of high
consumption and high investment.

was no room for ambiguity. Mr
Obama’s credibility was at stake.
The White House’s widely leaked

plans were precise. The US was to
launch punitive strikes on Syria
within days – lasting 48 hours and
with 43 targets already identified, not
including the presidential palace. It
would have likely been over by last
Monday.
The rush to action was why David

Cameron, the UK prime minister,
recalled members of parliament early
from their summer holiday (although
not enough of them, it turns out). Mr
Obama’s Hamlet had turned into
Henry V. There was no time to lose.
Alas, Mr Cameron’s humiliating

defeat triggered an astonishing lapse
of judgment by Mr Obama – his
decision to seek authorisation from a
hostile Congress. Now we are
reassured that there is no hurry
whatsoever to strike Syria. The
Pentagon can easily monitor
chemical weapons movements on the
ground.
Whichever way Congress votes,

earth-shaking consequences are
predicted for US global power:
should Mr Obama gets the approval
he seeks, the US could get sucked
into a Levantine quagmire, say the

Last week, was arguably theworst of Barack Obama’spresidency. If the wheels arenot to come off it altogether,
this coming one will need to be
among his best – starting on
Tuesday night with his address to
the nation about Syria.
It is hard to understand how an

instinctively cautious president in
his fifth year could have manoeuvred
himself into such a dismal corner.
But his largely self-charted route
lends little confidence that he can
easily escape it.
In the next 10 days or so we will

find out if Mr Obama will get the
chance to recapture his presidential
mojo. That – and the fact that he
would share the fallout with
Congress for whatever complications
a Syria strike would present – is the
best that can be said for a “Yes”
vote. A “No” would irretrievably
weaken Mr Obama both at home and
abroad. It would qualify as one of
the costliest gambles in US
presidential history.
How exactly did Mr Obama reach

this point? It is a question that
befuddles even those who know the
president well. No one doubts Mr
Obama has always been sincere in
his desire to avoid military
engagement with Syria. As a young
politician from Illinois, he owed
much of his meteoric rise to the fact
that he opposed “dumb” wars,
starting with Iraq. His signature
foreign policy since coming to office
has been to end America’s wars in
the Muslim world and rebalance the
country towards Asia.
Even when he was cornered last

year by Hillary Clinton, the then
secretary of state, David Petraeus,
then director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, and Leon
Panetta, then defence secretary, Mr
Obama rebuffed their advice to take
a tougher stand against Bashar al-
Assad.
Very reluctantly the White House

agreed earlier this year to step up
small arms supplies to moderate
Syrian opposition groups. But it was
little more than a press release since
none has yet arrived.
Then came the August 21 chemical

attacks in a suburb of Damascus, by
far the worst that Mr Assad’s forces
have carried out. The attacks
occurred exactly a year and a day
after Mr Obama first mentioned his
chemical weapons red line. There

alarmists; if he is rebuffed, America’s
global standing could collapse.
Both views are exaggerated. In the

first, it is hard to imagine Mr Obama
would ever agree to occupy Syria.
The Senate version of the resolution
for action explicitly forbids US boots
on the ground. In spite of his
rhetoric, the president only intends a
“shot across the bow”. That may be
naive, or misleading. But this is
probably not a Vietnam in the
making.
Likewise, if Mr Obama lost the

vote in Congress, the US would still
have by far the most powerful
military in the world. And it would
no more have embraced isolationism
than Britain had become the new
Switzerland.
Yet the consequences for Mr

Obama’s grip on power could hardly
be more real. Before the chemical
attacks, Mr Obama was already
facing a rocky session on Capitol Hill
with the threat of a government
shutdown and another debt ceiling
crisis.
Add to that the Republican party’s

plans to link approval of a higher
debt ceiling to a defunding of Mr
Obama’s signature healthcare law
and an ugly autumn was assured.

Now it looks much worse. The
Syria vote will make the rest of the
agenda far harder to manage. None
of Mr Obama’s advisers agreed with
his decision to seek Congress’s green
light on Syria. Some, such as John
Kerry, the secretary of state, were
not even consulted. The methodical
Mr Obama nevertheless threw
caution to the winds.
And there lies the nagging source

of concern. Mr Obama has always
been his own chief foreign policy
adviser. Unlike the economy, where
he has generally deferred to advisers
– sometimes to a fault – on global
affairs, Mr Obama trusts his
instincts. It is hard to find too many
others who strongly share that faith.
If Mr Obama gets the approval he

seeks, it will be presented as a
significant victory. In reality, it
would be a narrowly avoided
disaster.
What it would mean for Syria, and

Mr Obama’s ability to handle an
escalation, is an open question. He
will aim to keep any Syrian
engagement to a minimum. But after
the past two weeks who knows
where his caution will lead him?

A trap of the president’s making

a repeat of the Asian financial
turmoil of the late 1990s.
In my view, Asian countries have

learnt the lessons from the past and
significantly enhanced their
capabilities to fend off risks. Thanks
to more flexible exchange rate
regimes, stronger foreign exchange
reserves, the Chiang Mai Initiative
Multilateralisation agreement – a
currency swap arrangement – and
various bilateral financial
arrangements, China is confident
that Asian countries are now better
placed to cope.
China is still a developing country

with a myriad of tasks and
challenges. Yet as China’s national
strength grows steadily, it will
assume greater responsibilities and
obligations in international affairs
commensurate with its own
conditions. We will work with other
countries to promote global peace
and development. I look forward to
the day when the world economy
returns to good health. In the
meantime, the upgrading of the
Chinese economy will give fresh
impetus to the global economy.

Events disrupt
Fed timetable
Harold Macmillan, the former British
prime minister, described the main
risks facing his government as
“events, dear boy, events”, writes
Gavyn Davies. Investors no doubt
feel the same way about the US
Federal Reserve.
A week ago, the immediate path

ahead for the Fed seemed to be well
mapped out. The FOMC would taper
its asset purchases in its September
17­18 meeting, and completely end
them in mid­2014. It also seemed
increasingly certain that Lawrence
Summers would be nominated to be
the next Fed chairman and that the
ratification process would end in time
for him to take office on February 1.
Both decisions have been thrown into
doubt.
The primary culprit is the lacklustre

jobs report for August. Non­farm
payrolls growth has dipped, and the
decline in the unemployment rate to
7.3 per cent has been driven mainly
by a fall in the labour participation
rate. The new jobs are also largely in
the low­paid sector so consumer
spending is still subdued.
Will the Fed deem this to be the

“substantial” improvement in the
labour market which it says it needs
to justify tapering? It would be
surprising if the FOMC altered course
on the basis of one month’s jobs
data, and the onset of tapering has
been absorbed with only a moderate
shock to the system. At the
weekend, the consensus seemed to
have shifted towards a minor
tapering this month (reducing asset
purchases from $85bn to $75bn).
What about Mr Summers? Apart

from personality and tribal politics,
he seems to annoy the liberal wing
of the Democrats on three main
grounds: he is seen as unfriendly to
stricter regulation, sceptical about
quantitative easing and likely to
cause bond yields to rise.
The Summers camp has

started a process of correcting
“misperceptions” in these areas,
arguing that the differences between
Mr Summers and the current
Bernanke orthodoxy are very minor.
If Mr Summers could have only

one supporter, the president would
seem to be a good place to start. Mr
Obama will not take kindly to being
told by Congress that he must think
again. But the events of the past
week show that there is much work
to be done before a Summers victory
can be declared.

BUSINESS EDUCATION

School alliance to tackle healthcare issues

If business schools are to meet
increasing demand for healthcare­
focused management education, they
will need to join forces. This is the
thinking behind the Business School
Alliance for Health Management, a
non­profit consortium of leading US
business schools. Members include
Harvard Business School, Kellogg
School of Management, the Wharton
school at the University of
Pennsylvania and the Yale School of
Management.
To help address the shortfall in

academics capable of teaching MBA
programmes to healthcare
professionals, BAHM is developing a
teaching faculty network. It also runs
doctoral student “webinars”.
The alliance has recently launched

a journal, Healthcare Management,
Policy and Innovation, intended to

present research and ideas on
improvements in management
practices and public policy.
The journal fills an important gap,

says Kevin Schulman, director of the
health sector management programme
at Duke University’s Fuqua School of
Business, an alliance member.
“If you submit your papers to

clinical journals, they say it’s too
business­focused. If you submit them
to business journals, they say it’s too
healthcare­focused.”
Guiding BAHM’s activities is the idea

that management education, when
applied to healthcare delivery, can
accelerate innovation. Prof Schulman
says this means encouraging senior
physicians and administrators to look
at business processes and solutions
outside their sector that could be
applied to healthcare.

Lessons in
management
are just what the
doctor ordered

Seismic demographic, politicaland economic shifts aredemanding radical changes toglobal healthcare systems.
With administrators under pressure

to cut costs, physicians being pushed
to work more collaboratively and new
technologies in need of commerciali-
sation, the skills acquired on an MBA
look increasingly relevant. For busi-
ness schools able to offer the right
courses, this is a big opportunity.
“Clearly you need skills in entrepre-

neurship, in how to be innovative and
in how to scale something up in a
cost-effective way,” says Regina Her-
zlinger, a Harvard Business School
professor widely recognised for her
healthcare research. “Those skills are
not traditionally taught on healthcare
administration courses – those are
skills that business schools focus on.”
The need for business innovation in

healthcare has never been so urgent.
In Europe, cash-strapped governments
with ageing populations are strug-
gling to meet demand for increasing
levels of care without pushing up
spending. In response, the drive is for
greater efficiency and collaboration
between different practitioners and
specialists. “The healthcare system is
about much more than just treating
patients,” says Steve Chick, head of
the Healthcare Management Initiative
at Insead, which runs executive pro-
grammes for practitioners and policy
makers. “The co-ordination of care is
critical and that’s where business
schools can play a big role.’
In the UK the severe budgetary

squeeze on the National Health Serv-

ice at a time of increasing demand for
healthcare means NHS leaders need
to do more with less.
“The current decade . . . is present-

ing those leading healthcare with the
biggest challenges we’ve seen since
the establishment of the NHS,” says
Chris Ham, chief executive of the
King’s Fund, a leading healthcare
think-tank.
Meanwhile, emerging markets –

many of which are still combating
infectious diseases and infant mortal-
ity – face an additional burden in the
rising incidence of conditions such as
cancer and diabetes.
Perhaps the most radical changes

are taking place in the US. Healthcare
in the country – public and private –
is now 17.9 per cent of GDP, against
9.3 per cent in the UK, according to
data from the World Bank.

Sweeping reforms in the US under
the Affordable Care Act are reshaping
care delivery and health insurance.
With costs rising and mergers creat-
ing supersized hospital groups, a once
fragmented industry is increasingly
made up of large networks requiring
accomplished leaders.
“There will be more positions

within those systems that will attract
MBA talent and for which their skills
are relevant,” says June Kinney, asso-
ciate director for the MBA in Health
Care Management at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton school.
The transformation of US health-

care systems is changing the kinds of
candidates institutions are looking
for, says Andrew Chastain, managing
partner at Witt/Kieffer, an executive
search firm focusing on healthcare.
Consolidation and reforms are gener-
ating demand for executives skilled in
operations, finance, supply chain
management and IT.

Consolidation is also bringing to an
end the days when senior healthcare
executives were responsible for man-
aging everything from operations to
finance and strategy. “Those are get-

ting sucked up to corporate, as you’d
see in any market that starts to con-
solidate,” says Mr Chastain.
If positions for mainstream MBA

graduates are growing in the health-
care sector, an increasing number of
medical professionals are looking to
pursue a health-focused MBA.
With its MBA Health Sector Man-

agement programme, The Fuqua
School of Business at Duke University
is among a number of schools offering
MBAs – some run jointly with medical
schools – designed for healthcare pro-
fessionals. At Harvard Business
School’s Health Initiative, an MBA
caters to students from fields such as
biotechnology, pharmaceuticals insur-
ance and public health, and the school
has several courses on entrepreneur-
ship in healthcare. More recently,
executive programmes have been
emerging. Indiana University’s Kelley
School of Business has just launched
a two-year Business of Medicine MBA
for practising physicians who are
moving into leadership positions.

But if they are to keep up withthe sector’s growing demandfor management education,business schools will have
to expand dramatically the number
and type of programmes they offer
healthcare professionals. This will not
be easy. Given the highly specialised
nature of healthcare and the range of
professional roles it encompasses –
from surgeons to insurance brokers –
schools will find it tough to recruit
faculty staff capable of teaching the
necessary skills.
“The challenge for business schools

is to take what they know and adapt
it to healthcare,” says Prof Herzlinger.
“What’s needed is a lot of specific
knowledge.”
A cultural shift will also be required

before the MBA becomes a degree to
which doctors or health administra-
tors naturally turn. In the US, health-
care management education is largely
provided by schools of public health
and healthcare administration, not
business schools.
In the UK, says Mr Ham, relatively

few healthcare leaders have opted for
a business school course. “Histori-
cally, MBAs were not seen in the NHS
as having value,” he explains.
Academics and policy makers

believe this needs to change. And
given the sector’s size (it is the big-
gest employer in some markets) and
the challenges it faces, management
education could play an important
role in equipping the next generation
of leaders and introducing new busi-
ness models to healthcare systems.
“This is a huge opportunity for busi-

ness schools,” says Prof Herzlinger.
“There’s a serious mismatch between
what the people who are changing
healthcare need and the kind of edu-
cation that’s being provided.”

Demographic and
economic shifts in global
healthcare systems present
business schools with
vast opportunities,
writes Sarah Murray

MBAs help to bring vaccines out of the cold

By Peter Pramstaller

Doctors are struggling. They see
themselves as victims in a work-
place that has been taken over by
bureaucrats, paperwork that has
replaced time spent with patients,
and a demand that they place eco-
nomics above patient care.

Medicine has turned from a craft
into a business. But doctors are not
trained to run businesses. This dis-
connect means doctors have been
pushed aside. To regain control
over their professional lives and the
future of their profession they need
business training.

Doctors need to be managers and
supervisors as well as diagnosti-
cians. They need the kinds of skills
that business students learn.

What is needed is business educa-
tion that touches doctors at all lev-
els and is integrated into the profes-
sion. In the 21st century every doc-
tor needs this kind of training,
whether as part of residency train-
ing or as a set of tools that can be
taught without the need for a full
MBA programme – and the time
and expense that would entail.

Thinking needs to change, other-
wise business training will never be
at the top of any doctor’s agenda.

A Financial Times survey of 2010 graduates from
Masters in Management programmes reveals that
about a third of French graduates currently work
overseas, three years after graduation. Overall, as
many as 2,500 French graduates from each
cohort find work abroad, principally in the UK,

be published on September 16.

Harvard students have
used research into silk
protein to develop a
business that could save
lives, says Della Bradshaw

Some of life’s most significantmeetings are serendipitous. Soit was for Livio Valenti. He wasworking in Cambodia with the
UN when he met a professor from
Tufts University, Boston who was
developing ways of using the protein
in silk for medical applications.

When Mr Valenti subsequently took
up his place at Harvard’s Kennedy
school to study public policy, he
caught up with the professors con-
ducting the silk research at nearby
Tufts’ biomedical engineering school –
David Kaplan and Fiorenzo Omenetto
are leaders in the field.

Events snowballed when Mr Valenti
then met fellow students in a Harvard
Business School class called “Com-
mercializing Science”. They drew up
a business plan to develop a range
of vaccine products that could
potentially save thousands of lives.
Mr Valenti is now vice-president of
policy and strategy for Vaxess, the
company they created.

The problem
Many vaccines are sensitive to tem-
perature and must be stored either
frozen or at a temperature of between
2C and 8C.

This presents three problems, says
Michael Schrader, who graduated
with a Harvard MBA in 2012 and is
now chief executive of Vaxess.

“One out of every five people in the
world fails to receive basic vaccines,”
he says. This can be for political or
financial reasons, but it can also be
down to logistics. Cost is the second
problem, especially the cost of the
‘last mile’ for vaccines that need to be
kept cool.

And third, there is the problem of
spoiled vaccines. Not only are the vac-
cines rendered ineffective because of
problems with storage, it is also diffi-
cult for those administering them to
know which doses are spoiled.

mostable for extended periods, allow-
ing it to be transported without the
need for refrigeration. The technology
can work with existing vaccines, such
as measles, mumps and rubella, or
with those still in development.

How the company was developed
All four of the original founders of
Vaxess – the name comes from the
company’s strategy to improve vac-
cine access – have now graduated and
taken up positions in the company.
Scientist Kathryn Kosuda is vice-
president of R&D and lawyer Patrick
Ho is vice-president of licensing and
regulatory. They are now hiring staff.

Vaxess says that the Tufts profes-
sors are happy for the company to
represent the technology and develop
links with pharmaceuticals companies
and NGOs such as the Gates Founda-
tion.

Vaxess has won three business-plan
competitions, including the 2013 HBS
Alumni New Venture Competition.
This gave the company $160,000 in
funding. In May Vaxess raised $3.75m
in first-round financing, a deal that
will support the company for the next
two years.

What next?
The group will push ahead with the
development of thermostable vaccines
while working on the business model
and looking for additional funding.

There is now a consensus among
vaccine producers that they need to
get the vaccines to as many people as
possible as quickly as possible, says
Mr Schrader.

“There is a new paradigm in global
vaccines.”

Nonetheless, it will take five to six
years to get the thermostable vaccines
to market.

Doctors need
business skills

Desmond Tutu and
Nelson Mandela are

Between 14 per cent and 20 per cent
of global immunisation costs come
from the need to keep vaccines cold.
With the total global vaccine market
worth $20bn, developing vaccines that
are temperature-tolerant could save
billions of dollars.

solution of this protein is added to a
vaccine, the latter becomes stable at
higher temperatures – room tempera-

resigned. On a giant piece of paper

QUIT.” They pinned the letter to the
shop window and walked out.

The story might have ended there,
were it not for the internet. Someone
took a photo of the shut-up shop – a
Journeys outlet – and posted it on
Reddit. Thousands of supportive
comments poured in and the story
went viral. “You abuse your roll
[sic]” the letter went on, in a round,
childish script. “We Aren’t Allowing
it ANYMORE.”

Hooray, I thought. Power to the
people! Who needs a trade union
when you have the internet? Niki
and her colleagues more than
compensate for any weakness in
spelling by the strength of their
courage. The three of them are
modern day martyrs, sacrificing
themselves to a good cause. Their
letter is a warning to all companies

that obnoxious middle managers not
only kill morale, they are a danger
to their reputation and their brand.

Just as I had worked myself up
into a lather of indignation, the story
took on a new turn. Jamie and
sources-close-to-Jamie surfaced online
peddling their own counter-
allegations about Niki, Jess and TJ.

To try to find out what actually
happened I called Journeys HQ
where a woman directed me to an
online statement that said the
company was investigating the
matter. Having been thus unhelpful
she added: “Thank you! Have a great
day!”

As I put down the phone I
marvelled at my own naivety in
having expected anything good to
come from this sort of thing. Perhaps
it was because I had seen The Sound
of Music on stage the night before,
and the memory of Captain von
Trapp’s transformation from a man
who summoned staff with a whistle
to a softie singing “Edelweiss” was
too fresh in my mind. When it comes
to making people behave better, the
internet is much less powerful than
a trainee nun with a guitar case. It
is far too big and too blunt a tool to
improve conditions at work.

An amplified battle on social
media is no way to settle a matter

that may be quite nuanced. Indeed,
there is no sign that viral acts of
revenge by departing employees
leave any lasting marks on the
companies they are aimed at –
though they may make the person
who carried them out rather less
employable than they were before.

The culture at Goldman Sachs
bears no visible scars from the
savage quitting of Greg Smith, who
wrote an op-ed in the New York
Times the day he left calling the
bank’s culture “toxic” and
“destructive”. For an hour or two,
the world listened: Goldman’s market
value dropped by $2bn. But then the
bank fought back. The only upshot
was that Mr Smith got a book deal –
even so, by the time the book came
out, no one much cared.

There are other cases too. There
was Joey, the smiling guy in the red
shirt who worked at the Renaissance
Providence Hotel. When he quit the
job he loathed in 2011, he took a
brass band with him when handing
in his notice. Four million people
viewed the stunt on YouTube, but
even then nothing happened. Joey
made a follow-up video recently,
claiming that conditions at the hotel
had got still worse, but by then only
10,000 could be bothered to watch it.

Then there was Steven Slater, the

steward at JetBlue Airways, who
was so fed up with rude customers
that he ejected himself from the
aircraft through an emergency chute
on to the tarmac. The result? He
became a minor celebrity, but also
got a criminal conviction.

We all love such dramas. Everyone
at some point in their working life
fantasises about flouncing out, so we
are thrilled when anyone actually
does it. Yet as an audience we are
brutal and capricious. The reason the
internet can never be a trade union
is because we don’t care enough to
follow through.

In the case of Niki and Co, I would
have left it there. But I’ve just seen
the following corporate waffle on the
company’s website: “Journeys gives
YOU the chance to be YOU. We
celebrate individuality and creativity.
The stores offer a high-energy,
customer service focused vibe. Our
employees are passionate and
energetic about what they do and it
shows.”

Guff like this makes me
determined to stick it out. I will
leave it a month, and then try to
find out what has happened to Niki,
Jess, TJ and Jamie. I’ll keep you
posted.

Fight director
Terry King

Getting into a fight seems
easy enough, but acting is
another story. As a fight
director, I choreograph
fighting scenes for the
stage, television and film,
involving everything from
swords to knives and fists.
Each job is different.

Sometimes I work
with actors
separately, while
some directors
want the fight
constructed
blow by blow
on set. While
ensuring safety
and accuracy is
important, the key is
capturing the ethos of the
story and characters. Are
they cowardly? Honourable?
Afraid?
Even if a character is bad

at fighting, the actor must
be good at it, in the same
way that an actor must
play a boring character
without being boring. So a

big part of my job is
discovering how to get each
actor engaged in the scene.
I mostly do stage work

with companies such as the
National Theatre and the
Royal Shakespeare
Company, and am currently

working on the Spanish
Golden Age season
at the Ustinov
Studio in Bath.

I have no
background in
fighting. After
going to drama
school, I

climbed
mountains for 10

years. One day I was
in the office of an agent I
knew when their fight
director cancelled. I said I
could do it. I thought it was
something I was getting
away with for a few days,
and 25 years later, I’m still
at it.

The job

The careerist

Working alongside an
underperformer can be
frustrating, especially
when you have to pick
up the slack and your boss
does not appear to notice.
What can you do?

Are they really slacking?
Business psychologist
Karen Moloney says it is
“worth asking whether
you’re exaggerating
matters or should be
more tolerant. We’re all
very different people and
you can’t expect everyone
to meet your exact
standards. Some people
enjoy working 12-hour
days and stress others out
because they can’t
understand why they
don’t.”

She adds that people
often use the wrong
yardsticks to gauge the
quality of input. “If you
measure work done by
the hours you put in and
then complain to your
boss that a colleague is
lazy, you can get in a
terrible pickle if you
discover the person in
question is very talented
and only needs to work
until six.”

Is it really a problem?
“The key issue is does it
matter,” says John Lees,
a career coach and author
of Just The Job! “You
need to look at the costs
and benefits. By raising
the issue, you will create
conflict and can come
across as a whinger. If
you do only 5-10 per cent
more than them, it might
be better just to pick up
the slack.”

Being objective is
essential. “Are you letting
your perceptions that
they’re a bit lazy colour
the way you see them so
you write off everything
they do?”

How can I change things?
Put aside your
resentment, says
executive coach Rebecca
Alexander. “The other

person might be
overworked or lack
confidence.”

Rather than confront
them, she suggests you
try and help. Try steering
them towards tasks to
which they are more
suited.

Mr Lees adds that you
may wish to draw
personal boundaries and
define points where you
let things drop. “For
example, if it is a report
and you and they were
meant to do half each,
you could just say, ‘Sorry,
I’ve done my half’.” What
you must not do, he adds,
is allow yourself to be
pushed into doing more
than you already do.

If you decide to
confront them, however,
you need evidence, says
Ms Alexander. “Build up
examples and take notes
– so that they can’t just
turn around and deny it.”

Should I take it to the
boss?
“The problem with
speaking to your manager
is that they should
already know what’s
going on – and they won’t
like people who tell
tales,” says Ms Alexander.

Mr Lees adds that you
cannot turn back the
clock once you have gone
down this route. “If you
do this, you’re crossing
the Rubicon and saying ‘I
can’t manage these things
unassisted’. It doesn’t
make you look good.

“If you do speak to
your boss, you might say,
‘I’ve tried X, Y and Z
already, which at least
makes it look like you’ve
made an effort to resolve
matters’.”

Again, he adds, it is a
good idea to approach
your boss with evidence,
rather than just saying:
“This person is lazy.”

create conf lict’
Having an underperforming colleague

influence came to the fore last year
when The League for Internet Safety,
his new non-profit organisation, suc-
cessfully lobbied for the creation of an
internet blacklist, whereby the govern-
ment bans websites deemed harmful
to children.

Some associates of Mr Malofeev
believe this type of influence is what
has helped him survive the controver-
sies and the fraud investigation
unscathed. Others believe that he
spun a myth of his own influence and
connections, allowing for his meteoric
rise in the business world despite no
direct links to Mr Putin.

“He’s 39 years old and 10 years ago
he was no one,” says one colleague.
“You can come up with your own
judgment.”

Born in the Moscow suburb of Push-
chino in the officially atheist Soviet
Union, Mr Malofeev says he found God
– and his business acumen – during
his childhood, most of which was
spent bedridden from a serious illness,
at times in a children’s hospital. “We
would lie in bed 20 boys in a row, 20
girls in a row. You lie next to these
people 24 hours a day . . . It was a
school of life.”

He became involved in religion
through literature and began going to
his local church in Pushchino, where
he still attends weekly liturgy.

Mr Malofeev went on to study law at
Moscow State University. After work-
ing as a lawyer, he soon switched to
banking at Renaissance Capital after
realising this would allow him to
make “more than four times the
money”.

After a decade in banking, he
founded Marshall Capital Partners in
2005. But a deal with a baby food com-
pany called Nutritek soon started to
raise questions about the fund.

According to testimony by VTB in
London’s High Court, Mr Malofeev
helped a recently created company to
secure a $230m loan but was both the
buyer and the seller in the deal – a
claim Mr Malofeev denies. One year

pursuing VTB for damages related to
a worldwide freezing order that the
London court had placed on his
assets. He is optimistic about the out-
come. “We’re currently in negotia-
tions [with VTB] and I hope we’ll
reach an agreement soon,” he says.

Meanwhile, Axa and the US fund
Paul Capital were both bought out of
Marshall Capital by a Russian fund
called Aton, after which they with-
drew their complaints against Mr
Malofeev.

Though Mr Malofeev remains a wit-
ness in the fraud investigation,
his business prospects are on the
rise. His 10 per cent stake in Rostele-
com – acquired when his friend Mr
Shchegolev was Russia’s telecoms
minister – is set to go up in value
ahead of an expected merger with
another mobile operator, and the com-
pany’s planned privatisation by the
Russian state in 2016.

Mr Malofeev says he is nowtrying to devote less timeto business and more topublic service. This sum-
mer he flew to Sydney to give a
speech at an international family val-
ues conference about Orthodox Rus-
sia’s duty to unshackle the west from
liberalism.

“Like the [western] Christians that
helped us to overcome communism 30
years ago, now it is our turn to give
back to you and help you with family
and Christianity.”

While Mr Malofeev’s faith has earnt
him the nickname “the Orthodox busi-
nessman”, it is not necessarily one he
lives up to. “In a monastery you can
live according to the laws of morality
but in the real world you run up
against that law,” he explains. “I abso-
lutely consider myself Orthodox and
try to be a good Christian. But I of
course also believe that a person
working in business cannot say that
he does not sin doing business. In my
opinion that is practically impossi-
ble.”

With his monk-like visage –dark hair, slightly shaggybeard – Konstantin Malo-feev could be a dead
ringer from Father Zosima from The
Brothers Karamazov.

That is, if it were not for the
designer clothes and luxuriously
appointed Moscow office.

But as rare Tsarist maps and reli-
gious icons gleam down from the wall
behind him, the enigmatic Mr Malo-
feev seems to have no trouble balanc-
ing his apparently conflicting perso-
nas. He founded Russia’s largest pri-
vately run Orthodox charity and is an
advocate for the country’s 128,000
orphans as well as a confidant of
Father Tikhon Shevkunov, a monk
with close links to Vladimir Putin,
Russia’s president.

But as the millionaire founder of
private equity firm Marshall Capital
Partners, Mr Malofeev also has a repu-
tation as a ruthless businessman who
has been accused of defrauding state-
owned lender VTB of $200m. Though
he has never been convicted of wrong-
doing, he remains a witness in a Rus-
sian federal investigation.

Separately, Mr Malofeyev has been
accused of mismanaging the money of
French insurer Axa, once a lead inves-
tor in Marshall. Axa withdrew its com-

plaints after it was paid an undis-
closed sum for its shares.

One former business associate
describes Mr Malofeev as “a modern-
day Rasputin”, another as a cunning
businessman “who can sell sand to
someone inside the Sahara”. Both
asked not to be named.

Mr Malofeev denies any wrongdoing.
In a conversation that bounces from
biography to business to religion, he
shows off both his knowledge of his-
tory and his charm.

Where critics take issue with his
financial success and business tactics,
Mr Malofeev does not see a problem.
“Both poverty and wealth come from
God,” he says. Besides, he continues,
the laws on earth and those in heaven
do not always overlap. “You can fol-
low all the laws on earth, be the most
law-abiding citizen and end up in hell
because you have vices . . . Conversely
take [Oskar] Schindler’s list. Schindler
broke all the existing laws in Hitler’s
Germany – he broke the criminal laws
that were against Jews. But did he act
with his conscience? He did.”

Mr Malofeev is one of several
prominent Orthodox business and
political leaders who are enjoying
increasing influence in the second
Putin era, as conservative and Ortho-
dox beliefs gain greater influence over
legislation. A key figure in this circle
is Vladimir Yakunin, the head of Rus-
sian Railways and a close ally
of Mr Putin since the president was
mayor of St Petersburg in the 1990s.
Another is Alexander Provotorov, who
is poised to become head of Russia’s
fourth mobile operator, due to be cre-
ated later this year. A third is Igor
Shchegolev, a top aide to Mr Putin in
the Kremlin.

Mr Malofeev, however, rejects the
idea that a religious clique exists
within the elite. “There is no Orthodox
club where we all get together.” But
he admits that no wealthy Russian
businessman has succeeded without
the help of personal connections.

later, the new owner of Nutritek fell
behind on its payments and VTB says
it learnt that the baby-food company’s
assets had been grossly overestimated
and were worth just $35m, or nearly
$200m less than originally estimated.

The revelation started a string of
difficulties. Shortly after VTB took Mr
Malofeev and others to court, Axa
began complaining to Russian author-
ities that the money it had invested in
the fund had not gone to the intended
investment but to Mr Malofeev’s
acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in
Rostelecom, Russia’s state telecoms

raided Mr Malofeev’s home and offices
in connection with the VTB fraud
case. Yet in the nine months since
then, the controversies appear to have
settled down. A London court in Feb-

against Mr Malofeev, arguing that the
case should be heard in Russia, not

lively and simplified, and anticipate
ambitious abstracted seascapes such
as “4.30pm” – three bands of colour
and a few blocky white boats which
fix forever one late afternoon on the
Maine coast. Light is as directly
caught in large-scale drawings such
as “Study for Summer Triptych” and
“Miami Beach”: “It’s the
instantaneous light, if you get it
right then you get it in the total
present tense . . . that’s eternity,”
says Katz. But as the drawings show,
that surface brilliance in his
paintings is hard won.

To October 13, www.visitmima.com

Few artists insist so defiantly on
surface as Alex Katz. His lucid,
inviting paintings of beautiful
people in beautiful places are not
only flat and hard-edged as posters,
but use fashion – a floppy hat, a
bobbed haircut – to freeze the
passing moment. “Style is the
content of my painting, and style
belongs to fashion. Fashion is the
immediate present and that’s
what I’m really after . . . to
maintain that present-tense feeling,”
he says.
What then is beneath the surface?

Mima’s show expands on last
summer’s excellent Tate mini-
retrospective Alex Katz: Give Me
Tomorrow to explore how the artist
uses drawing. Ranging across 60
years, it includes collages, sketches,
watercolour and ink washes, and
preparatory cartoons, mostly from
Katz’s own collection, displayed
alongside paintings, to consider his
enduring concerns: light, time and
social situations.
Beguiling charcoal depictions of his

wife and muse Ada, his daughter-in-
law Vivien and Vogue editor Anna
Wintour compel as studies for

celebrated recent portraits. A series
of energetic, abbreviated notations in
marker pen for the reflective
monumental landscape “Black Brook”
demonstrate the primacy of drawing
as Katz considers composition and
proportion. Crisp black ink sketches
explore gestures between people and
the balance between distance and
intimacy – how a reclining figure
sits up to watch another leave the
scene, how a pair of bathers hold
each other – which is so finely
modulated in paintings such as “Ada
and Edwin on the Beach”.
Collages experimenting with layers

of horizon line, water and sky are

So it has happened. After
118 years a woman
conductor has stepped up
to take charge of the Last
Night of the Proms for the
first time. It was impossible
to miss the significance of
the event: the welcoming
cheer was huge and
somebody had thoughtfully
fixed to the conductor’s
rostrum a big, pink balloon
proclaiming “It’s a girl!”
That Marin Alsop would

carry off the assignment
with such panache could
have been confidently
predicted from the outset.
“I’m shocked that it can be
2013 and there are still
firsts for women,” she said
in her closing speech. But
at last the taboo has been
broken and Alsop’s joie de
vivre guaranteed a Last
Night that would be
celebratory in high style.
All the traditional

favourites were there, even
if “Rule, Britannia!” was
shorn of its companion sea
shanties. The flags waved
as ever, with the four flags
of Brazil, Russia, China and
India prominent in the
arena – surely a BRICs first
at the Last Night?
Always adapting and

growing, the Proms are
themselves flag-bearers for
the future of classical
music. More concerts were
broadcast on television this
year than in any previous
season and it was especially
gratifying to see cameras
filming the chamber music
Proms at Cadogan Hall for
the BBC website. Online
access to the Proms is
growing. In years to come
we will surely be talking
about a world audience, if
we are not already.
Overall, this Proms

season was of a decent
standard, distinguished

by some unforgettable
highlights. Prime
among those was
the first
complete
performance of
Wagner’s Ring
cycle in a
single Proms
season with

Daniel Barenboim and his
Staatskapelle Berlin
keeping up an exceptional
standard over the four
nights. New music was also
unusually strong, with full-
scale works from
composers as diverse as
Thomas Adès, Naresh
Sohal, Helmut Lachenmann
and Nishat Khan.
By contrast, the line-up

of international orchestras
was somewhat thinner. On
Thursday, the Orchestra
Sinfonica di Milano
Giuseppe Verdi honoured
its titular composer in his
bicentenary year with a
first half of Verdi arias
sung by tenor Joseph
Calleja, sounding less than
his usual wholehearted self.
Xian Zhang conducted a
heartfelt, but sometimes
slack performance of
Tchaikovsky’s “Manfred”
Symphony. ★★★☆☆
On Friday, Lorin Maazel

and the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra
brought star quality to the
penultimate night. It is
impossible to go wrong
with the Viennese
orchestra’s glorious playing
in Bruckner, but Maazel
turned the Symphony No.8
into severe blocks of sound,
when some human warmth
would have been nice. An
imaginative first half
brought solo Bach organ
works, played by Klaus
Sonnleitner, organist at the
monastery of St Florian in
Austria, where Bruckner
also served and is buried.
★★★★☆
The Last Night itself

was light-hearted and
commendably fast-moving.
Anna Clyne’s fizzy
Masquerade, a BBC
commission, made the
perfect Last Night premiere.
The star singer was
American mezzo Joyce
DiDonato, who looked a
million dollars and sounded
it, too, especially in “Over
the Rainbow” (she was
born in Kansas, land of The
Wizard of Oz). Violinist Nigel
Kennedy kept toes tapping
with his Czárdás. And over
all presided Alsop, at once
a live-wire conductor and
authoritative master of
ceremonies. What firsts will
the BBC Proms have in
store for 2014? ★★★★★

It was a “one, two” victory moment
at Venice. The result of the 70th
Mostra del Cinema was: Italy won,
Taiwan too. Gianfranco Rosi’s Sacro
GRA, a documentary about lives
lived on or near the Grande
Raccordo Anulare (Rome’s ring
road), took the Golden Lion, by a
rumoured whisker, from Tsai Ming-
liang’s Jiaoyou (Stray Dogs), a poetic
drama about poverty and fatherhood,
praised in my last dispatch.
Each film had friends and foes.

Each prize announcement drew a
mixture of cheers and boos. Some
critics, including this one, thought
Taiwan had been robbed. (A
colleague darkly muttered about
Italian chauvinism on a Bertolucci-
led jury.) But Sacro GRA had its real
and passionate cheerleaders. Like
past Rosi films blending ethnography
with quirky character portraiture –
Boatman (India), Below Sea Level
(American desert), El Sicario
(Mexico) – his Rome docu-odyssey
gathers idiosyncratic momentum and
a clutch of fascinating cameos.
The fallen aristocrat rents his

castle for erotic photonovel shoots.
The eel fisherman philosophises
about eels and the River Tiber. The
paramedic hastens between accident
victims. As memorably as any, the
tree expert drills palms for weevils
and catches the shrieks of larvae on
his digital recorder. Meanwhile his
voice dances on, atop ever more
whimsical tightropes of metaphor
and simile. “It’s an orgy. It’s a
corrupt feast. It’s like the chatter of
humans in a restaurant . . . ”
Tsai took his runner-up Special

Jury Prize for Jiaoyou with a good
grace. “May I say something?” he
addressed the jury. “I love you all.”
The world will soon be able to love
his film, a kind of madly lyricised
Lear of the Taipei underworld.
Both these prizes could be happily

lived with. There was a louder stir of
rebellion when the awards-night
goodwill enhanced by a Best Actress
prize handed to elderly Elena Cotta
for Italy’s Via Castellana Bandiera –
a cleverly crafted study of

neighbourhood ferment during a set-
to between women drivers – was
squandered by two prizes flattering
Greece’s Miss Violence. This black
comedy-drama about incest grows
cruder and more contrived as its
story goes on. Somehow it won Best
Director for Alexandros Avranas and
Best Actor for Themis Panou,
playing a Cesare Borgia of the
Athens petite bourgeoisie.
Britain’s Philomena, a critics’

favourite, won Best Screenplay for
Steve Coogan (also starring) and Jeff
Pope. They audio-linked their thanks
from Toronto, where the Stephen
Frears-directed film about a
baby-robbed mum (Judi Dench)
“rediscovering” her son has moved
on to warm more festival hearts.
Britain had a polarised movie

presence at Venice. Everyone loved
Philomena. Everyone (almost) hated
The Zero Theorem by honorary Brit
Terry Monty Python Gilliam.
Likewise everyone praised Steven
Knight’s out-of-competition Locke, an
ingeniously scripted drama set in a
car pounding along night motorways,
and almost everyone except Brits
abhorred Under the Skin, from

Jonathan Sexy Beast Glazer.
More chauvinism? Non-UK

reviewers practically disembowelled
Glazer’s art/horror flick: a piece of
posturing sci-fi hokum starring
Scarlett Johansson as an alien
stalking single men, to their
apparent deaths, in Scotland.
Monotonous gloom; malnourished
script. For some reason British
critics found a whole lot to like.
Locke deserved its plaudits. Here is

another great spring forward from
the man who invented Who Wants to
be a Millionaire? and scripted
Frears’s Dirty Pretty Things. Now he
secures a wallop of a performance
from Tom Hardy, the only person on
screen for 90 minutes. Welsh-
accented, Hardy plays an agonised
man in the process of leaving his
wife for the bedside of a birth-giving

mistress. He is also dumping his
next-day work date as site manager
at “the biggest concrete-pour in
Europe”. As he fields car-phone calls
from aggrieved or ballistic parties,
his life atomises before our eyes.
What could be more dramatic while,
simultaneously, more minimal in
spectacle and resource?
Which brings us to the Venice

Film Festival. This year’s event
looked a little as if it was counting
its euro cents. I am worried by the
unchanged design kitsch in front of
the Palazzo del Cinema: last year’s
exploding-armadillo motif, with the
same scarlet scales bearing the same
sponsors’ names. I am worried about
the promised super-auditoria
that don’t materialise. I am
worried . . . Well, put it this
way. Dear Mostra del
Cinema: do you need help?
We think we should be told. We
think you are too valuable to lose.
Too valuable to Venice, to cinema, to
culture lovers, to the world.

an enjoyable experience, but not one
that fulfils its potential. The plot is a
cautionary tale for our times: a pushy
property developer moves into the
area with designs on knocking down
the local shops and building a shiny
new complex. But the locals, fearing
loss of livelihood and local character,
mount a protest.
It’s a good soap subject: a serious,

contemporary issue (gentrification of
an area) brings moral dilemmas for
the characters. What the project lacks
is what soap operas usually have:
time. Storylines that might work over
a long period can only be sketched
out here and the episodic televisual
soap format means scenes are
delivered, sometimes literally, on the
run and are a bit hit and miss.
But it is performed with warmth

and vivacity by the non-professional
cast. There are eyecatching
performances from Kola Bokinni as a
confused teenager, Kemi Lofinmakin
as a big-hearted hairdresser,
Christopher Glover as a put-upon
shopkeeper and Kevin Sevilla as his
irrepressible assistant. Directed by
Ola Animashawun, this interesting
enterprise might be worth revisiting,
as it raises more questions than it
has time to answer.

www.royalcourttheatre.com

The soap opera has become a
cornerstone of popular culture, but
just how authentic are the wildly
event-laden lives of all those
everyday folk? The Royal Court
explored this question over the
summer as part of its Open Court
festival. Ten playwrights, led by Bola
Agbaje and Rachel De-lahay, worked
with local people in Peckham, south
London, to create a pastiche soap
opera drawing on daily life around
them. The result was aired in bite-
size pieces nightly at the Bussey
Building in Peckham, then drawn
together, in true soap opera style, in
an omnibus edition: it’s that version
that now reaches the Royal Court.
It’s a mischievous, light-hearted

project, but also one that raises
serious questions about the way
“ordinary” people are portrayed and
that plays around engagingly with
form. In Peckham there were people
from the community performing, in

the community, a soap opera about
that community. At the Royal Court
a further layer is added, as that
bustling community is now evoked
through projected photographs, with
the audience sitting in a mocked-up
living room.
These are great ideas, and had the

team had longer – both to work on
the show and then to deliver it – they
might have been able to dig deeper
into them. As it is, what emerges is

Rich Lesser took over as CEO of
Boston Consulting Group, one of the
world’s leading management
consultancies, at the start of this
year, having previously been
chairman of its North and South
America business. A chemical
engineer, he holds an MBA from
Harvard Business School and worked
in product development at Procter &
Gamble before joining BCG in 1988.

Edited highlights of a video interview
with FT.com appear below.

What are the key things chief
executives need to be thinking about
on a five­year view?
The first is the reshaping of the
global economy. Asia, and I would
say the rest of the emerging
markets, are going to take a much
higher share of global growth.
Second, the rate of disruption and
change from technology is
enormous . . . staying ahead of the
technology wave is incredibly
important. Third, the need to be
adaptive is incredibly important.
This classic model of “if I set a
strategy and I just run with it for
three or five years” – that’s not the
world we’re in.

Does this mean we need a new kind
of corporate leadership?
I think we do . . . in the sense that
historically a lot of leadership was
founded on knowledge and judgment.
In today’s world knowledge will be
the easier part. The ability to draw
insight from knowledge, the ability
to project leadership down the
organisation, to create diversity
within the leadership team, and to

create more responsive, faster worlds
that are ambidextrous, that can
operate in the developed world and
in the developing world, that can
operate in established markets and
still be investing in new models and
new ways of growing. That will be
incredibly important.

People are talking about a US
manufacturing revival. Is this for real?
We’ve been talking about that . . .
going back three or four years. While
the US, along with the developed
world, will continue to [have] higher
labour cost than the emerging
markets, that gap is closing as wages
rise in China faster than they are
here. Second, there continues to be a
huge productivity advantage for the
US – very productive and very
flexible. Companies like investing
here because they have the flexibility
to redeploy investments as their
business changes. And then on top of
that we now have the . . . revolution
that’s under way in shale gas. If
you’d have asked us a couple of years
ago we’d have said there will be a
reshoring wave. We would now say
it’s actually reshoring plus export
growth that we see coming over the
next five to eight years.

Where’s your strategy taking BCG?
Thirty years ago what clients wanted
from us was really thoughtful,
strategic insights and
recommendations. Twenty years ago
it was those insights and
recommendations and the ability to
help them implement it. Ten years
ago it was do those things . . . but
orchestrate broad programmatic
changes across the company. Today,
our clients want those three things,
but they want a fourth, which is to
actually build the capabilities of the
organisation. Because in a world of
more uncertainty and volatility and
change, they need to have adaptive
organisations. So my first
responsibility is to make sure that
we are equipping ourselves in a way
that adapts to what our clients
expect today, not just what they
wanted years ago. I’d say along that
path they also want deeper
capabilities, whether it’s industry
knowledge or functional capabilities,
and they really want a global
footprint.

View from the top

Calm waters can be shark infested.
Earnings at Shanghai’s A-share listed
companies rose 12 per cent from a
year ago, on average, in the first
half. These smooth results compare
well with the flat performance in the
same period last year. The
performance of stocks in Hong
Kong’s benchmark index paints a
similarly tranquil picture. But do not
be fooled: these figures obscure
dangerously poor fundamentals.
The quality of earnings growth is

deteriorating, especially outside the
financial sector. Bank of America
points out that in the first six
months of this year, non-core
earnings contributed more than half
of the Rmb65bn in annual gains in
pre-tax profits of companies listed in
Shanghai. Much of this has come
from investment income, as
companies take advantage of the
squeeze in liquidity in the shadow
banking sector. Large groups can use
their heft to borrow cheaply from
official sources and lend at higher
rates to those without the same
access. Net debt at non-financial
companies is rising.
Moreover, overcapacity, rising

labour costs and the strengthening
renminbi continues to hurt China’s
manufacturers. And this is making it
harder for them to collect cash. The
days it takes companies to collect
cash owed has risen to 35, up by a
quarter in two years, according to
BofA. Inventories are sitting around
for longer, too. Depleting funds is
making it harder to invest in capital
expenditure – growth of which was
flat in the first half from a year
earlier, compared with 7 per cent
growth over the same period a year
ago. (At least this is in sync with
excess capacity.)
The shares of market darlings such

as Tencent reflect the expectation of
sustained growth – on a multiple of
35, it is at a four-year high. The
Hang Seng meanwhile trades on 11
times its forecast earnings, near its
post-crisis low of 10. But the fragility
of earnings among these companies
should make investors hesitate
before leaping into the water.

Broadcom
It is enough to get a value investor
slobbering. A weak short-term
outlook takes a fifth off a company’s
shares. The projections were not
awful – flattish sales in the coming
quarter. But Wall Street was
accustomed to near double-digit
expansion. The beat-up stock now

has a 10 per cent free cash yield.
There is more to any investment

case than buying when sellers have
been made myopic by an ageing rally
and a restive Federal Reserve.
Broadcom, which issued the weak
outlook back in July, is a
semiconductor maker with a $15bn
market value. Its chips go into home
broadband gear (cable boxes and the
like), infrastructure equipment for
phone companies and mobile devices.
Each set of customers contributes
about a half-billion of operating
income annually.
Mobile is the problem. Broadcom’s

historic strength is in chips for WiFi
and Bluetooth communications. Not
only is competition increasing here,
but mobile device makers, seeking
savings in dollars and power
consumption, are moving to “systems
on a chip”, single wafers of silicon
that combine WiFi and Bluetooth
with an applications processor and a
cellular radio. Broadcom has made
the move to SoCs too – witness its
$164m acquisition last week of SoC
technology from Renesas – but it is
in a squeeze. In high-end phones, it
competes with Qualcomm, which has
the advantage of owning crucial
cellular patents. At the low end it
faces MediaTek, a relative newcomer
from Taiwan that already has over
$4bn in annual revenues. The
pressure was apparent in the 22 per
cent drop in mobile profits in
Broadcom’s last quarter.
Both Morgan Stanley and Deutsche

Bank have argued that, at $27, the
shares practically price in the
disappearance of the mobile segment.
Maybe so; but it remains hard to
imagine the shares rallying until the
situation in mobile gets much
clearer. Keep salivating, for now.

Tokyo 2020
Time to tie up your Asics trainers
and reconnect the Nintendo Wii:
Japan is back. That, at least, is what
supporters of Tokyo’s successful bid
for the 2020 Olympics say it will
show, as 1964 marked the country’s
peaceful return to the global stage.
The tricky bit, when Asahi-induced
celebratory hangovers wear off, is
keeping that comeback on track
regardless of the Olympics.
The risk is that hosting the world’s

biggest sporting event proves a
distraction for a country that has
more than enough to be getting on
with. Japan’s energy supply is still
strained following the nuclear
shutdown after the 2011 Fukushima
disaster – where the government is
still fighting to contain leaks of
contaminated water. And its nascent
economic recovery is delicate. If, as
expected, second-quarter growth is
this week revised up from its initial
annualised 2.6 per cent reading, then
a consumption tax rise next April,
from 5 to 8 per cent, is more likely.
If price hikes crush consumers’
tentative revival as in 1997, no amount
of Olympic flag-waving will help.
Tokyo does not plan to splash cash

on these Games, either. The expected
spend on infrastructure and facilities
is equivalent to about 0.2 per cent of
last year’s gross domestic product,
according to Nomura. This is no
1964, when huge projects, including
the first bullet train, were equivalent
to 3.6 per cent of GDP that year. At
least the Olympics should not add
too much to Japan’s worryingly large
debt pile. But these are early days:
the UK initially thought London 2012
would cost less than £3bn but it
came in at least three times that.
Winning the games is not a fourth

arrow in prime minister Shinzo
Abe’s quiver as has been suggested.
Rather it gives a deadline for
measuring the success of his other
three arrows in reviving Japan.
Meeting that would be a real
achievement. But there is nothing
sports fans like more than a good
comeback story.

Architect of UK bank reform says
capital buffers should be doubled
By Patrick Jenkins
in London

The chief architect of Britain’s
post-crisis regulatory reforms
believes banks’ capital levels
should be double the level rec-
ommended two years ago by the
government-appointed commis-
sion that he led.
Sir John Vickers, the Oxford

academic who chaired the Inde-
pendent Commission on Bank-
ing, told the Financial Times
that in a “blue-skies” world
banks’ core tier one capital
ratios would now be 20 per cent,
rather than the 10 per cent rec-
ommended by the ICB that has
become the norm for UK
lenders.
Sir John will set out his ideas

in a speech today at the Regula-
tory Policy Institute to mark the
anniversary of Lehman Broth-
ers’ collapse at the height of the

financial crisis five years ago.
The ICB’s conclusions –

including the commission’s cen-
tral recommendation that the
high-street operations of
broader “universal banks”
should be “ringfenced” from
riskier investment banking
activities – are in the process of
being translated into UK law.
However, the commission’s 10

per cent capital recommenda-
tion is already a de facto reality
for big British banks. Policed by
the Prudential Regulation
Authority – the arm of the Bank
of England that oversees the
sector – lenders today boast cap-
ital levels that are on average
three times higher than before
the crisis took hold in 2008.
Nonetheless, reformers such

as Sir John want to go much
further. He said “the skies are
cloudy” at the moment but once
they cleared policy makers

should further strengthen capi-
tal levels in the banking sector.
Low equity levels, which some

banks burnt through within
days during the crisis, are recog-
nised as one of the key reasons
so many banks failed. An FT
analysis shows it was a princi-
pal cause of meltdown in at

Oil wages
set to jump
$100,000
barrier
By Michael Kavanagh
and Vanessa Kortekaas

Average wages in the UK’s oil
and gas sector are set to rise by
15 per cent this year – breaking
through the $100,000-a-year ceil-
ing – as record levels of invest-
ment in eking out Britain’s
reserves create shortages of
trained staff in the industry.
Data compiled by industry

recruitment site Oilandgaspeo-
ple.com suggests that average
salaries will rise from £64,000 to
nearly £74,000 ($116,000) this year
as £13.5bn of total investment is
sunk into reversing the UK’s
declining oil and gas output.
Recruitment company Hays is

also predicting a sharp rise in
salaries that would take average
earnings well beyond the
$100,000-a-year level for the first
time. The forecasts reinforce
previous analysis of employ-
ment trends in the industry by
the global recruiter, which have
pointed to strong rises in sala-
ries commanded by British oil
workers in recent years.
Pay in the industry across the

world has been outpacing
broader wage inflation for sev-
eral years. But recruiters say
the UK market is exceptionally
tight due both to the recent
upswing in activity and the glo-
bal competition for staff, partic-
ularly from emerging markets
and the US shale gas industry.
Gary Ward, a North Sea spe-

cialist at Hays’ recruitment divi-
sion, said: “Several industry
sources are projecting salary
rises of between 12.5 and 15 per
cent over the next year in the
North Sea, which is by far out-
stripping rises over previous
years and other industries.”
Lindsay Wexelstein, analyst at

energy consultancy Wood Mac-
kenzie, suggested tightening
labour market conditions could
persist as $68bn of investment is
expected to pour into the UK oil
industry between 2013 and 2017.
“We are seeing levels of invest-
ment in real terms back to lev-
els seen in the 1970s,” she said.
The average wage of UK oil

and gas workers stood at $93,400
last year, above a world average
of $87,300, which itself was up
8.5 per cent in 2012 and 6 per
cent in 2011, according to an
annual survey by Hays.

Companies

By Paul J Davies in Hong Kong
and Arash Massoudi in New York

Alibaba is prepared to scrap
plans for a $60bn share sale in
Hong Kong and switch its list-
ing to New York if the senior
management cannot nominate a
majority of board directors,
according to people close to the
company.
Founder Jack Ma and other

top executives own little more

than 10 per cent of China’s big-
gest e-commerce company. But
they want to control the
make-up of the board so they
can defend Alibaba’s strategic
direction and culture in the way
US technology groups, such as
Google, have done through dual-
class shares.
Hong Kong listing rules ban

dual-class shares that give more
voting power to a small group of
owners. The local market regu-
lator is expected to stick to its
principles that any corporate
structure has to treat all share-
holders fairly. The stand-off
could see Hong Kong and China
lose one of the world’s most
eagerly anticipated listings

since Facebook, even though
Alibaba has been planning for
months to list on the island.
“The discussion is under way

internally. We would like to be
in Hong Kong, but if we can’t
land comfortably [on the board
structure] New York remains a
viable option,” said one person
close to the situation.
Hong Kong is seen as the nat-

ural home for one of China’s
biggest private companies and it
would be a disappointment for
many to see such a big success
story go to a US stock market.
The company is run by the

Alibaba Partnership, a group of
20 executives in charge of run-
ning the business day-to-day.

The partnership was formed in
2010 to preserve the culture of
Mr Ma and the other founders
long after they have left the
business, according to a person
close to Alibaba.
The rest of the company’s

stock is held by SoftBank, the
Japanese telecoms company,
Yahoo of the US, a handful of
private equity and sovereign
wealth funds and other staff.
The partnership has been

strongly influenced by the aims
that Larry Page, one of the
founders of Google, set out in
his 2004 letter to prospective
shareholders before it listed. Mr
Page and co-founder Sergey
Brin retained control of Google

with a dual-class share struc-
ture that gave them more votes
than any other owners.
As this is not allowed in Hong

Kong, the Alibaba Partnership
wants to nominate a simple
majority of board directors,
which shareholders would then
vote on individually to accept or
reject, according to a person
close to the company.
Alibaba has filed no official

application, but there has been
an informal exchange between
its advisers, Hong Kong Listing
Committee members and the
Securities and Futures Commis-
sion, the regulator.

$60bn flotation

By Andrew Bolger in London

Europe’s corporate bond market
raised a total of nearly $29bn
over the past two weeks, a dra-
matic surge after one of the qui-
etest summer lulls on record.
There were a total of 39

issues, according to figures from
Dealogic, as borrowers sought to
take advantage of low borrow-
ing costs ahead of likely rate
increases.
“There has been a flurry of

activity – people are trying to
front-load issuance, given the
uncertain outlook and prospect
of higher rates,” said Marcus
Baldini of Barclays.
Mr Baldini said investors had

become accustomed to the
increase in rates since the Fed
started talking in May of future
tapering of quantitative easing,
but remained wary that poten-
tial “curve balls” such as the
Syrian crisis might cause future
volatility.
Nestlé, the multinational

packaged food group, last week
demonstrated the market’s
appetite by launching two bond
transactions on successive days
– a $500m, six-year issue on
Tuesday, and a €500m, eight-
year issue on Wednesday. The

previous week Statoil, the Nor-
wegian state-controlled oil and
gas group, which usually taps
the US market, issued a €1.91bn
bond. There were also substan-
tial issues from Orange,
France’s largest phone com-
pany, and Volkswagen, Europe’s
biggest motor group.
Analysts said that investors

had become much more relaxed
about the eurozone story, but
were aware some difficult issues
such as banking reform have
been “parked” until after the
German election on September

22, and could quickly re-emerge.
Suki Mann, head of credit

strategy at Société Générale,
said last week had also seen
unexpected bond issues from
Eni, the Italian-based oil and
gas group; Acea, the Rome-
based utility; and EDP, Portu-
gal’s largest utility.
Mr Mann said that these were

“just the kind of deals” this
market wanted.
“All [are] peripheral deals, all

where the market is receptive
and perhaps highlighting a con-
tinued thawing of investor atti-

tude towards the region, ” he
said.
Analysts said that another

factor driving the bond market
was the continuing reduction of
lending by European banks that
were under pressure to reduce
their balance sheets, which was
forcing companies to look
towards the capital markets.
Denis Coleman, who heads

Goldman Sachs’ European lever-
aged finance business, said he
was confident the bond market
would continue to be busy.
There had been a distinct

change in psychology among
issuers since May, when the
prospect of Fed tapering started
pushing up interest rates, he
said.
“People are suddenly think-

ing: let’s get in before rates get
worse,” Mr Coleman said.
In spite of the summer slow-

down, the European corporate
bond market has raised $416bn
so far this year – a 14 per cent
increase on the same stage last
year.

COMPANIES

Why European equities are starting to look enticing

European stocks, this column has pointed
out before, are not as cheap as they look.
They have dipped in the past few years
because of the sovereign debt crisis, but it
is still reasonable to factor in a risk of
more trouble to come from that quarter.
And while European stocks look cheaper
than US stocks, that is in large part
because they always do: US indices are
stuffed with high-technology companies
that trade on expensive multiples, while
European indices have a lot of dull
dividend-paying utilities.
But there is still scope to argue for a

European buying opportunity. What if
European profits were to take off in short
order? That hope is not as far-fetched as it

sounds and has driven a flurry of interest
in “long Europe”, as funds switch into EU
equities at the urging of brokers.
We can construct such an argument first

by looking at how European profits fare
over the cycle. Over time, profits tend to
revert to the mean, with each peak in the
cycle higher than the one that preceded it.
That is what happened in the US, where
earnings were back above their 2007 peak
by the end of 2011.
In Europe, the sovereign debt crisis

interrupted the cycle. Following the sharp
fall post-Lehman, European profits had
barely made it back to their long-term
mean in 2010 before subsiding once more.
In this respect, the difference with the

US is marked. According to Andrew
Lapthorne of Société Générale, US profits
are now 25 per cent above their 10-year
moving average, while European profits
are some 10 per cent below their trend.
Now add valuation. US indices are

always more expensive but, at present, the
S&P 500 trades at 0.7 times book value
more than the FTSE-Eurofirst 300 – until
the sovereign debt crisis broke out, this

gap tended to be more like 0.5 times. And,
while brokers tend to dislike cyclically
adjusted price/earnings (Cape) ratios (the
subject of much debate in these pages
recently), many happily cite them for
European stocks, because they make
Europe look very cheap. While the Cape
suggests that the US is significantly more
expensive than its long-term mean, it
shows European stocks a full standard
deviation below their mean – a level that
has in the past been a reliable indicator of
strong returns in the future.
Or try to put it together with some

crude technical analysis. “Long US, short
Europe” has been a spectacularly
successful trade, but it now has the look
of being overdone. Since the dawning of
the credit crisis in early 2007, the S&P has
beaten the FTSE Eurofirst by 52 per cent.
Even after the recent flurry of interest in
Europe, US stocks have beaten their
European equivalents by almost
9 per cent for the year so far. It looks like
a trend that is ready to reverse.
Those, then, are the arguments. But

there is still a retort, which boils down in

one word to “Japan”. European growth is
stagnant, and much of the continent is
mired in a serious recession. All of the
arguments above rely on European profits
perking up back to the mean. But in
Japan, after its economy peaked in 1989,
corporate earnings dipped and took 15
years to get back to their peak. Many
times over the past two decades, investors
have plunged into Japan on much the
same investment case that is being laid
out for Europe, only to be disappointed.
This is a critical point, and Karen Olney

at UBS garnered much attention last week
with a five-point note on “Why Europe is
not Japan”. First, she points out that
Europe appears to be in little danger of
slipping into deflation, as Japan did. On a
continent-wide basis, it never suffered a
remotely comparable property bubble
(countries such as Spain are an exception).
Corporate debt, at 40 per cent of equity, is
far below the 123 per cent recorded by
Japanese companies four years into their
slump. Capital expenditures peaked at 22
per cent of gross domestic product ahead
of the crisis – compared with 33 per cent

in Japan in 1989 – so there is not the same
legacy of over-investment. And Japan
started wildly expensive, by any sensible
measure. Europe did not. Assuming that
Europe does not fall into a Japanese-style
morass, Ms Olney suggests that profit
growth of 8 per cent per year for the next
three years – not such a lot to ask – would
be enough to bring Europe back to the
peak profits implied by the usual cycle of
mean reversion.
These are good arguments. On a relative

basis, European stocks offer better value
than the US. (There are exceptions, but
this top-down picture is accurate).
But there remains a reason why Europe

is cheap. Buying European stocks on
anything other than a long-term basis still
involves a bet that Europe’s politicians
make the necessary institutional reforms
to the EU without triggering another leg
to the crisis. That is still not an obvious
bet. If that bet comes off, however,
Corporate Europe has a decent chance of
staging a rebound in profitability.

Technology billionaire
Michael Dell is this week
finally set to win share-
holder backing for his con-
tentious $24.8bn buyout of
the PC company that bears
his name, barring late inter-
vention from dissident
shareholder Carl Icahn.
A change in Dell’s voting

rules looks certain to hand
control to Mr Dell and Sil-
ver Lake Partners, the pri-
vate equity firm backing his
offer, at a vote at a share-
holder meeting at Dell’s
Texas headquarters on
Thursday, say people close
to the buyout and investors
who have pushed for a
higher offer.
The company’s board has

postponed the vote three
times in past months rather
than face defeat. Last
month it bowed to Mr Dell’s
request to change its voting
rules to ease passage of the
deal, in return for an
increased bid and special

dividend payment that
added $400m to the offer.
A legal challenge to the

offer by Mr Icahn, who
owns 8 per cent of the com-
pany, was rejected by a Del-
aware court three weeks
ago after the judge ruled
that the activist investor
had failed to come up with
a firm offer in his own pro-
posals for an alternative
transaction. The special
committee of directors mas-
terminding the deal would
“dance in the streets” if Mr
Icahn topped Mr Dell with a
fully-financed bid, judge
Leo Strine said.
The PC industry land-

scape has declined sharply
in the 13 months since Mr
Dell first took his buyout
proposal to the company’s
board, adding to the risks of
the highly leveraged buy-
out. Mr Icahn and other
investors have accused the
company of overstating its
difficulties to get support
for the buyout.

Glencore Xstrata will extend
cost cutting targets and
reveal revised plans for
spending when the
management of the Swiss
commodities group arrives in
London to sell the benefits
of the largest takeover
completed in the mining
sector, write Neil Hume
and James Wilson.
Glencore faces pressure to

detail the merits of its
$46bn acquisition of Xstrata
after taking a $7.7bn
impairment charge on the
miner’s assets last month.
The writedown contributed

to a half­year loss of almost
$9bn. In the first detailed
presentation for investors
sincethe deal was completed
in May, analysts expect chief

executive Ivan Glasenberg to
tell investors that cost
savings for the deal will be
at least twice the $500m
estimated. Mr Glasenberg
and senior executives will
use the investor day
tomorrow to outline the
strategy and plans for
spending and asset sales at
the UK­listed group.
Analysts believe Glencore

could mothball projects,
including the $5bn plus
Wandoan coal project in
Australia. Mr Glasenberg has
admonished industry rivals
for overspending on building
and expanding mines, which
he says has swamped the
world with raw materials
that have eroded prices and
profits. Investors have also

pressed mining groups to
return more capital rather
than plough it into further
growth amid signs of cooling
growth in China, the world’s
largest commodities user.
Glencore is one of the

world’s most diversified
mining groups, spanning
base metals, energy and
agricultural commodities.
Alongside last month’s

interim results, Mr
Glasenberg said the
integration of Xstrata had
been “a lot quick and faster
than we had envisaged” and
annual synergies would be
“materially in excess of the
$500m promised at the
time of the acquisition”.
That target was made up of
$450m of marketing

synergies and $50m of cost
savings. Mr Glasenberg is
also likely to face
questioning from investors
about the sale of Las
Bambas, a greenfield copper
project in Peru that the
company was told to put up
for sale by Chinese
regulators as a condition of
securing approval for the
deal with Xstrata.
Suitors, including Chinese

mining companies, have
registered interest in the
project, which Mr
Glasenberg has said could
be sold by the end of the
year. RBC expects Glencore
to receive $3bn for Las
Bambas and for part of the
proceeds to be returned to
shareholders.

Shareholders in Kabel Deut-
schland fear Vodafone’s bid
for the German cable com-
pany could fall apart as
approval for the deal risks
failing to meet the required
minimum level of accept-
ances.
The UK-based mobile

operator agreed a €7.7bn
takeover of Kabel Deutsch-
land in June this year as
part of its broader strategy
to become a combined TV,

internet and telecoms group
based on fixed line as well
as mobile networks.
In order for this acquisi-

tion to proceed, however,
75 per cent of Kabel Deut-
schland shareholders must
tender their shares by this
Wednesday in the first
part of a two-stage tender
process.
Some of Kabel Deutsch-

land’s shareholders believe
that the amount of tenders
offered will fall well short
of this goal.
The shareholders say that

Vodafone still has time to
reduce the requirement
ahead of the Wednesday
deadline but that failure to
do so could derail the deal.
Citing eight major deals

in Germany since 2007,
including Daimler and
Rolls-Royce’s takeover of
German diesel engine
maker Tognum in 2011, one

leading shareholder in
Kabel Deutschland said
that the total number of
shares tendered in this first
crucial phase, including
those owned by the bidder,
has averaged just 68.5 per
cent.
Another shareholder has

also expressed fears that
tenders will fail to reach
the required minimum
which, at 75 per cent, it
says has been set higher
than for similar recent
deals.
Of particular concern to

these shareholders are the
large number of index-
tracking investors in Kabel
Deutschland – accounting
for almost 10 per cent of the
cable operator’s shareholder
base.
Shareholders in KDG say

that tracker funds are
unlikely to tender their
shares in the first wave,
preferring to wait until the
second tender deadline,
thereby giving their inves-
tors exposure to Kabel
Deutschland for as long as
possible.
If Vodafone fails to secure

the necessary support from
Kabel Deutschland share-
holders it can be prevented
from relaunching a further
takeover offer for 12 months
although it can seek a
waiver from BaFin, Ger-
many’s market regulator,
shareholders said.
A failure by Vodafone to

acquire Kabel Deutschland
could make the UK-based
mobile operator more vul-
nerable to a predatory bid
from US telecoms operator
AT&T, which is understood
to be interested in Voda-
fone’s wireless operations
in Europe but not its cable
assets.
In a statement, Vodafone

said: “There’ll be no change
to the conditions set out in
our earlier announcement.”
This announcement, pub-

lished in July, set out all
the terms for the tender
offer including the 75 per
cent hurdle for this
Wednesday.

Wall Street today begins
the roadshow for what
could become the biggest
corporate debt sale in his-
tory as it seeks buyers for
Verizon’s offering of some
$20bn in bonds to help fund
the $130bn acquisition of its
wireless business.
JPMorgan, Morgan

Stanley, Barclays and Bank
of America Merrill Lynch
are tasked with finding buy-
ers for the investment-grade
rated bonds.
The sale comes when the

market for corporate debt is
sharply negative for the
year and uncertainty hangs
over the near-term direction
of yields, which move in the
opposite direction to prices.
As bankers sound out the

willingness of money man-
agers, hedge funds, insurers
and pension plans for a
massive amount of debt,
one certainty is that any
new offering will come at a

cheaper price to that at
which Verizon’s existing
bonds trade. While a big
concession in price will
result in a higher yield for
Verizon, it is seen as simply
the cost of a company seek-
ing to sell a record amount
of debt in the US debt mar-
kets – exceeding Apple’s
$17bn sale in April.
Also on the table is an

ultra-long dated bond of up
to 100 years in maturity, if
there is enough demand
from investors for such
exposure, said people famil-
iar with the deal.
“As large as this debt deal

could become, we are confi-
dent the US market can
absorb it and anticipate a
substantial concession in
pricing,” said Edward
Marrinan, head of macro
credit strategy at RBS
Securities.
Later in the week, Veri-

zon is due to start market-
ing the bonds in Europe.

Al-Futtaim said the poten-

tial move, which is subject
to regulatory approval,
would be one of the largest
foreign direct investments
into the east African econ-
omy in recent years.
The Dubai family-owned

group, which has interests
spanning motors, hospital-
ity and retail, plans to sig-
nal its intention to make a
cash offer for 100 per cent of
the company’s issued
shares on the Nairobi Secu-

rities Exchange at Ks13 a
share, or about $90m. Al-
Futtaim said the proposed
takeover had received
endorsement of 50.6 per
cent of shareholders in
CMC, which has operations
across Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda.
The Dubai conglomerate,

which holds lucrative distri-
bution rights for Toyota

and Honda in its home mar-
ket, will help the struggling
Nairobi automotive group
expand its brands beyond
its existing stable, which
includes Volkswagen, Ford,
Mazda and Suzuki.
CMC has historically won

large government contracts
to supply state vehicles.

Six of the world’s leading
insurers are to invest in a
new $400m private equity
fund being set up to back
companies that sell finan-
cial services to individuals
in developing countries.
MetLife, Prudential

Financial and Swiss Re are
among the companies back-
ing the second fund being
put together by specialist
“microfinance” house,
Leapfrog Investments.
The group will disclose as

early as today that it has
raised $204m for the ven-
ture, with plans to raise up
to $200m more in the com-
ing months.
Other investors include

the financial institutions
JPMorgan Chase, TIAA-
CREF and the European
Investment Bank as well as
mainstream insurers such
as Partner Re, XL and
Achmea.
The fund will aim to take

stakes in companies that
offer general insurance and
life assurance, as well as
savings, pensions and
investment products, to
low-income consumers,
some of whom earn
between $1.25 and $10 a day.
It will be looking at pro-

spective investments in
south and southeast Asian
markets such as India, Indo-
nesia and Sri Lanka, as well
as parts of sub-Saharan
Africa including Ghana,
Nigeria and Kenya.
“A lot of people are say-

ing the fundraising environ-
ment is quite brutal,” said
Andrew Kuper, founder of
Leapfrog. “But people
[investors] are looking for
operators [of businesses] –
not just clever [financial]

easing and fostering economic
growth,” says Jim Cowles, head of
Citigroup’s operations in Europe.
In private, unreconstructed bankers

go much further in their complaints,
arguing that the extent of reforms
goes far beyond dealing with causes of
the crisis.
Many are furious about onerous pay

reforms, particularly the incoming EU
ban on bonuses that are more than
double annual salary. They resent the
US Volcker rule and its constraints on
using the bank’s own money for trad-
ing purposes. And there is growing
irritation about what many see as a
series of witch-hunts against banks
over past misdemeanours, from insur-
ance mis-selling in the UK to mort-
gage product mis-selling in the US.
“Regulators now appear to be on a
mission of retribution,” says Bill
Michael, head of financial services at
KPMG UK.
All the same, there is still plenty of

unfinished business for policy makers
to tackle – less in dealing with the
direct causes of the last crisis and
more in terms of preparing to tackle
the repercussions of the next disaster,
whatever form it takes.
In particular, worries persist about

the complexity and size of banks now-
adays, a problem that has, if any-
thing, intensified. “The banks that
were deemed too big to fail five years
ago are now even bigger,” says Rich-
ard Portes, professor of economics at
the London Business School.
JPMorgan Chase, for example,

boasts assets of $2.4tn following
organic growth and crisis-triggered
acquisitions of Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual, compared with
only $1.6tn in 2007. The UK’s Lloyds
Banking Group, after its government-
sanctioned takeover of HBOS, is more
than twice the size it was before the
crisis, with a balance sheet of nearly
£880bn. In 2007, there were only six
banks in the world with assets of
more than $2tn. Today there are 13.
Plans are afoot to deal with this.

The central recommendation of the
UK’s Vickers commission – that big
British banks hive off high-street
banking activities into safer

“ringfenced” entities – should make a
wind-down of a large universal bank
easier. But the legislation, designed to
mitigate the risk of future bank col-
lapses in the vein of RBS and Lloyds,
has yet to be passed.
In the US, there has been deadlock

on many elements of the Dodd-Frank
reforms, much to the irritation of
President Barack Obama. A campaign
to restore Glass-Steagall, the repealed
1930s legislation that barred banks
and brokerage houses from combin-
ing, has made little headway.
In tandem, policy makers in Europe

and the US are working on the con-
cept of predefined “bail-ins” of bond-
holders in times of crisis. Optimists
cite examples of recent failures, such
as the Netherlands’ SNS Reaal, which
included a bail-in of bondholders
alongside nationalisation.
Overall, though, progress on the

topic is laborious and few believe that
banks will shrink much any time
soon, whatever reformists might like
to think. “Size is too simple a metric
[anyway],” says Douglas Flint, chair-
man of HSBC. “It really doesn’t mat-
ter from a systemic point of view
whether you have four banks or 40
banks in a market. It’s the system’s
asset concentration – principally in
government debt and in mortgage
debt – that can be dangerous.”
And this, financiers say, is the eter-

nal rub. Few elected politicians are
prepared to shift the focus of debate
away from banks’ size and structure
and on to the underlying issue: lend-
ers’ crucial role in propping up the
often excessive debt burdens of gov-
ernments and households.

tors have expressed concern about the
economic impact of an alleged “regu-
latory overload”, especially amid
nervousness about the next challenge
for policy makers – weaning the world
off exceptional central bank liquidity.
The expected wind-down of bond-

buying under QE has already hurt
banks by pushing down the value of
bonds on their balance sheets. A sec-
ondary threat comes from the pro-
spective end of cheap central bank
funding in the eurozone in a little
more than a year.
“The challenge will be to balance

various regulatory initiatives with the
realities of unwinding quantitative

on capital, conscious that risk weight-
ings are fallible and can in any case
be massaged to reduce capital require-
ments.
Several countries, notably the US,

the UK and Switzerland, have begun
initiatives to boost the amount of
equity that banks hold relative to
their overall unweighted assets. This
leverage ratio – as low as 2 per cent at
many banks in the boom years, mean-
ing balance sheets were geared 50
times – will in future need to be as
high as 6 per cent under US reform
plans.
At the same time, however, politi-

cians, bankers and even some regula-

basic lending – in particular to
residential and commercial mortgage
customers. There is little that the
authorities can do directly in a mar-
ket economy to curb foolish lending
practices by private sector banks. But
reformers argue that a laser focus on
capital, which can absorb losses, is
the essential way to protect the sys-
tem from further harm.
This was the first issue tackled by

regulators in the wake of the crisis,
with big banks today required in prac-
tice to hold equity capital equivalent
to 10 per cent of their assets weighted
for risk. But in recent months reform-
ers have launched another offensive

Ever since Lehman Brothers collapsed
almost five years ago – the most
dramatic event in an unprecedented
global crisis that is still reverberating
today – policy makers have laboured
to fix the causes of that disaster and
to pre-empt the next. Have they
succeeded?
In an attempt to gauge the merit of

the glut of global reforms, the Finan-
cial Times has looked back at the 34
main banks and brokers that failed in
the crisis, judging the principal rea-
sons for failure from a menu of five –
low capital; weak funding structures;
poor lending; poor trading invest-
ments; and misguided mergers and
acquisitions. Many failed for multiple
reasons, though Royal Bank of Scot-
land is the only institution to which
all five triggers applied.
Any analysis of the precise causes

of the global financial crisis, even
after five years of reflection, is neces-
sarily subjective. But if there were
five main causes of failure, regulators
can claim at least partial victory on
four of them. Capital levels in the
system are more than three times
higher than they were before the cri-
sis as banks pre-empt the require-
ments of new Basel III global stand-
ards. Financing is more stable, with
far less reliance on risky short-term
market funding and new incoming
rules demanding banks hold mini-
mum levels of cash and safe assets.
Big acquisitions are a thing of the

past, too, with regulators making it
clear that such dealmaking is unwel-
come. And the kind of complex struc-
tured investments that spread the
contagion of US subprime mortgage

losses around the world are close to
extinct, the victim of regulators’
higher capital charges and banks’
lower risk appetites.
Those successes have emboldened

regulators on both sides of the Atlan-
tic. Banks have been chastened and
their outspoken executives slapped
down, or in the case of Barclays’ Bob
Diamond, run out of town.
“The colour has drained from bank-

ing,” says one top regulator who is
close to Mark Carney, the new gover-
nor of the Bank of England. “Regula-
tors are the rock stars these days.”
Bankers concede that supervision,

after often notoriously lax oversight
before the crisis, has clearly
improved. “Regulation now is rightly
much more intensive and intrusive
and the supervisory teams are much
better,” says Richard Meddings,
finance director at Standard Char-
tered in London.
The one category of the FT’s five

triggers of failure that is immune to
regulation is bad lending – a perennial
curse of banking since the Middle
Ages and one that in the heat of the
crisis, when the focus was on complex
collateralised debt obligations, was
often neglected. “The crisis was over-
spun as a markets problem,” says
Robert Law, a former banks analyst
and adviser to the UK’s recent parlia-
mentary commission on banking
standards. “There were major prob-
lems in traditional lending, too.”
According to the FT’s analysis, this

was the single biggest factor in the
crisis. Of the 34 big banks that failed,
three-quarters succumbed in large
part because of the poor quality of

If anybody is qualified to
judge the success of
combining investment and
commercial banks in the
same institution, it is John
Reed. As chief executive of
Citicorp in the 1980s and
1990s, he evangelised the
attempt to create a “one-
stop shop” selling many
different products and took
the bank into its merger
with Travelers Group to
form Citigroup in 1998.
That deal redefined

banking in the US and
triggered a repeal of the
old Glass-Steagall split
between investment and
commercial banking in the
US, which some critics

blame for being the root
cause of the 2008 financial
crisis. Now politicians in
the US are attempting to
reintroduce the split,
saying that Glass-Steagall’s
repeal contributed to the
financial disaster.
Citigroup needed several
injections of capital from
the US government in the
fraught months after the
Lehman bankruptcy.
Now retired, Mr Reed

believes the business logic
behind the transaction was
flawed, and that the old
Glass-Steagall division
should be reinstated. Mr
Reed first expressed this
view soon after the crisis
erupted. Last year Sandy
Weill, the other main
architect of the Citicorp-
Travelers deal, changed his
position to support
breaking up the banks.
Speaking to the Financial

Times, Mr Reed says the
greatest problem was of
clashing cultures – and
this went far beyond the
strong cultures of the old
Citibank and Salomon
Brothers, the dominant
institutions in the

Citigroup merger. Rather,
the problem had to do with
compensation. Trading
attracted a different kind
of person from commercial
banking. Traders expect to
be paid bonuses. “When
trading was small in
proportion to everything
you could have a group of
high bonus professionals

that you treated differently
and it didn’t affect the
culture of the whole
organisation,” says Mr
Reed, who oversaw the
growth of foreign exchange
trading at the old Citicorp.
“As trading becomes

more important then it
becomes harder and harder
to keep those cultures
separated. And it began to
work into the risk-taking
culture as well. Risk

officers would say to
someone who wanted to
make a loan: ‘I don’t like
this credit. We aren’t going
to do it. Stop. Period’.
“But now they would

recognise that if a certain
transaction didn’t go
through, his colleague
wasn’t going to be paid
that year. It became very
difficult to say: ‘Sorry.
Don’t do it.’ Your colleague
was being compensated for
doing transactions . . . It
became infectious.”
Putting the two cultures

under one roof therefore
made risk harder to
control, and the
organisation harder to
manage. And as trading
became more important it
became a more dominant
part of the organisation.
“These cultures don’t mix

well and one tends to push
out the other, and it does
result in institutions whose
behaviour isn’t necessarily
productive for the
economy.”
As for his efforts to

create a “one-stop shop”
for financial products,
pumping numerous

products through one sales
platform, it turned out not
to produce the hoped-for
savings for the bank.
Corporate clients wanted a
“one-stop shop”, and
during the 1990s were
increasingly asking
investment banks to help
with raising loan finance
for mergers.
However, after the

merger, Citigroup still
needed to have lending
officers to assess their
credit. Meanwhile, clients
felt that banking lending
officers “weren’t equipped
to provide people with
professional advice”. So the
bank needed to continue to
pay investment bankers to
explain more sophisticated
products “and they tend to
be highly paid because of
the complexity of the
product”. For large
corporate accounts, Citi
still needed to maintain
teams of bankers who were
expert in the company’s
needs across the world.
The result was that it
made no cost savings,
while the organisation
became harder to manage.

“We had assumed that if
we helped them not only
with traditional banking
but also with securities
somehow we would be able
to leverage that cost base
and we would be able to
generate more revenue per
customer,” he says. “But
what turned out is that we
had to to add to the cost
base.” A further issue was
a change in the culture of
investment banking, away
from a traditional emphasis

on serving companies and
their financing needs – a
concentration which it
shared with traditional
commercial banks. Now,
Mr Reed says, the
investment banking is
targeted at investors.
“They are trying to
package things or create
synthetic things they might
sell an investor to get a
better return than in a
traditional portfolio.”
He dismisses objections

that a Glass-Steagall split
would be difficult to
reinstate. “It could be
done. The finance industry
is amazingly flexible. We
don’t have big fixed capital
bases. It’s not like we have
factories that need to be
re-engineered.
“Had it turned out that

you could provide finance
to industry more cost-
effectively, then there
would be a benefit to
putting the two institutions
together. But given that
there isn’t, and given these
culture problems . . . you
end up saying this
probably isn’t a great
structure for the industry.”

Cultural clash ref lects why banks must split up, says former Citi chief

COMPANIES

There is an imperative from
the boardroom for officials
manning the stands at this
week’s Frankfurt Motor
Show: Just keep smiling.
Mired in the worst sales

decline for two decades,
Europe’s carmakers are
feeling the pinch of ineffi-
cient factories, painful
restructuring and sagging
margins.
With a chink of sunshine

peeking from behind the
clouds as the tide of falling
sales shows signs of ebbing,
the continent’s biggest car
show has come at a good
time for executives to start
talking up the future again.
“There is certainly a

sense that we have turned a
corner,” says Allan Rush-
forth, chief operating officer
of Hyundai Europe. “The
uncertainty is dissipating;
people have banked on
things not getting any
worse, which has allowed
them to shift their business
outlook and planning.”
Motor shows are tradi-

tionally events where car-
makers flex their muscles,
show off their forthcoming
products and dazzle the
industry’s journalists and
general public.
And the Frankfurt Motor

Show, which opens to the
press tomorrow ahead of a
public opening on Thurs-
day, is Europe’s largest and
brashest. More than 150
product premieres are
expected this year, with 81
press conferences scheduled
for the 10,000 registered
members of the media.
But the gap between the

profitable premium
marques and their poorer
mass-market cousins is
likely to be palpable in
terms of the new models
manufacturers will parade
before the flashbulbs.
Years of falling sales have

forced many of the conti-
nent’s biggest volume man-
ufacturers to close factories,
slash production lines and

lay off thousands of work-
ers, with 1.4m cars of capac-
ity due to be cut by 2014,
according to rating agency
Moody’s.
“I get the sense certain

carmakers in Europe have
swallowed the medicine and
made the tough decisions
they need to,” Mr Rushforth
told the Financial Times.
“Now it is about seeing

that reflect in the business
models going forward.”
Europe’s car sales fell

6.6 per cent in the first six
months of the year to their
lowest half-year total since
1993, according to official
data from the continent’s
industry body, which will
release July and August
figures this month.
That comes after three

years of consecutive falls in
annual sales, with demand
in western Europe standing

at a quarter less than it was
in 2007.
According to LMC, an

automotive consultancy,
sales rose marginally in
July, and carmakers have
tentatively begun suggest-
ing that the bottom of the
market might have been
reached.
Ford, Peugeot and

Renault have all said they
expect European sales to
improve in the second half
of the year, with analysts
and forecasters expecting
an overall decline of about
5 per cent year on year by
the end of December.
Sales in western Europe

are expected to remain stag-
nant or rise marginally next
year, according to an aver-
age of major forecasters,
with the continent’s big
producers looking to capi-
talise on growth in China,

the US or South America to
stay profitable.
“We have touched the

ground,” says Matthias
Wissmann, president of the
German automotive associ-
ation VDA. “[The industry]
goes into the run-up to the
show with optimism . . .

there is a certain trend
towards stabilisation.”
Premium carmakers,

which have been mostly
unaffected by the sales
decline, will dominate most
of the headlines at Frank-
furt. The Big Three of Audi,
BMW and Mercedes-Benz
will together take the wraps
off at least 14 new cars,

including the full debut of
BMW’s much-hyped entry

“Turning expectations

British supercar manufac-
turer McLaren opens its
showroom doors in China
today as it races to catch up
with global rivals in the
world’s second-largest lux-
ury car market.
McLaren Automotive,

which builds the £1m
P1 supercar, is entering the
country as part of a drive to
ramp up its Asian presence
to 13 dealerships this year
and hopes the region will
account for a third of its
global sales in future.
The carmaker will open

four dealerships in China:
in Shanghai, Beijing,
Chengdu and Guangzhou.
Mainland China has

become a key market for
luxury marques such as
Ferrari, Lamborghini and

Bentley. In spite of a slow-
down in economic growth,
the country is expected to
overtake the US as the big-
gest premium car market
by the end of the decade.
“China is one of the most

exciting and dynamic mar-
kets in the world where we
will make every effort to be
well received,” said Ron
Dennis, McLaren chairman.
“Our entry into China . . .

represents a significant
milestone in the develop-
ment of the company.”
The manufacturer, from

Woking, Surrey, which last
year sold 1,400 cars and
exported 80 per cent of its
production, is targeting
10 per cent of future sales
to come from China.
McLaren’s growth is part

of a resurgence in the UK
car industry, written off at
the turn of the millennium
but roaring back as a global
leader in high-end manufac-

turing. With European car
demand hit by the conti-
nent’s economic gloom,
China and other emerging
markets such as Russia and
India have become impor-
tant battlegrounds for high-
end car brands targeting
the emerging world’s newly
minted rich.
Ferrari, which entered

mainland China in 2004,
sold about 350 cars in the
country in the first six
months of the year – about
10 per cent of its global
deliveries. The country is
Lamborghini’s second-larg-
est market, after the US.
Mike Flewitt, McLaren

chief executive, said:
“Entering the Chinese mar-
ket is both a huge honour
and a major opportunity
for McLaren Automotive,
and it highlights the contin-
ued development of the
company.”
China will be the 27th

retail market for the car-
maker, which has ramped
up its sales footprint in
Asia this year, opening out-
lets in cities such as Tokyo,
Hong Kong and Sydney.
Indonesia and Malaysia

are set to follow before 2014
as part of a concerted effort
since 2010 to expand
McLaren’s brand beyond
Formula One racing
and into sports cars sold
globally.

Britain has stolen a march
on the US in the race to
unlock commercial poten-
tial from unmanned aircraft
or drones. The National
Aeronautical Centre, a pri-

vately-run company at West
Wales Airport, will for the
first time make it possible
for commercial developers
to fly big unmanned air-
craft in segregated airspace
after its partnership, due to
be announced today, with
Newquay Cornwall airport.
The partnership is likely

to lower the barriers to
entry for commercial devel-
opers of large unmanned
aerial vehicles, say people
who follow the civilian mar-
ket. The main US and UK
trade associations for the

drone industry say this is
the first time that develop-
ers will be able to test big
UAVs in segregated air-
space from a privately run
airfield.
One enthusiast of the

project is Richard Deakin,
chief executive of Nats, the
UK air traffic controller,
who believes there is no
technical reason UAVs
should not be able to fly
among normal aircraft, per-
haps first in controlled air-
space.
“This is a big step for-

ward, there’s a lot of oppor-
tunity for the UK to lead
the way,” he said. “The
prizes are going to go to the
people who are bold enough
to take these first steps.
They will come.”
In the US, the Federal

Aviation Authority’s deci-
sion on which states will
get to host six test sites for
small UAVs has been
delayed by opposition from
privacy groups, and is now
expected by the end of the
year. Canada has been
pushing the commercialisa-

tion of drones, using remote
air strips to test smaller
models.
Developing large UAVs

has been the purview of big
defence contractors and the
European, US and Israeli
militaries they serve. But
with the war in Afghani-
stan coming to an end, the
focus is shifting to whether
UAVs could also be used for
civilian jobs from fighting
forest fires to monitoring
oil pipelines.
The University of South-

ampton and Teal Group, a

consultancy, estimate the
potential annual market at
$55bn-$62bn per year by
2020, while the Association
for Unmanned Vehicle Sys-
tems International, a US
lobby group, believes inte-
grating UAVs in the US
could be worth $82bn and
100,000 jobs by 2025.
It is the kind of economic

stimulus governments are
keen to capture and Europe
and the US have set very
aggressive targets for fully
integrating UAVs into civil-
ian airspace. In the UK, a

government-backed consor-
tium of defence companies
has taken the first
unmanned test flight
through civilian airspace.
Aviation authorities are

taking a cautious approach
to creating a regulatory
regime to certify that
drones are safe for flight in
civil airspace and this is
keeping the barrier to entry
for new parties high. The
National Aeronautical Cen-
tre could change that
because it offers a cheaper
and easier alternative to

military and government
partnerships. Ray Mann,
whose company owns West
Wales Airport, calls the
breakthrough a gateway to
the commercial UAV
market. “In terms of facili-
ties within which to operate
we are extremely ahead of
the race.”
In military UAVs, Euro-

pean companies such as
Thales, EADS and BAE Sys-
tems are only now catching
up with their US and Israel
counterparts, which domi-
nate the market.

FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013 ★ 19

COMPANIES

Jack Ma has always been a
frank speaker – at times to
his disadvantage. For poten-
tial investors in Alibaba,
the e-commerce group’s
founder was explicit about
where they rank among his
priorities in a speech in
Hong Kong in March.
“Customers are number

one, employees number two
and shareholders are
number three at the critical
times,” he said. “If you
think about who supports
you all the time, investors
support you when times are
good.”
Now that Alibaba is pre-

paring a hotly anticipated
flotation likely to value the
group at $60bn, Mr Ma and
his senior team are trying
to ensure that in difficult
times investors will not be
able to derail the company
from its chosen path.
However, the quest by the

Alibaba Partnership – made
up of 20 top executives – to
keep control over Alibaba’s
board is running up against
the determination by some
people in Hong Kong to
defend principles of inves-
tor protection. The fight
could see the city lose the
listing to New York.
The partnership would

control the board by being
allowed to nominate a sim-
ple majority of directors,
although shareholders
would vote on each individ-
ual name, according to a
person close to the com-
pany.
It is a high-stakes game

that both sides could regret.

Alibaba would end up
listed very far from home
and in an accounting envi-
ronment that demands high
and voluminous disclosure
on a quarterly basis.
Hong Kong would lose

the biggest and brightest
listing it has had the oppor-
tunity to secure since insur-
ance group AIA, while the
exchange itself would miss
a highly lucrative client.
For China too, the out-

come would be difficult to
bear. That is not only
because one of its most suc-
cessful private enterprises
would be making its finan-
cial home elsewhere, but
also because Alibaba has
become the single most
important repository of
pricing and consumer infor-
mation in the economy. If
China wants to understand
inflation, it often looks to
Alibaba.
The control that the

Alibaba Partnership is seek-
ing will be won only if
shareholders approve its
choice of directors – and Mr
Ma’s view of shareholders
does not mean Alibaba will
not pursue value for them,
according to people close to
the group.
The partnership has been

highly influenced by
Google’s defence of its con-
trol of shareholder voting
rights.
In a letter ahead of its US

listing, Larry Page, one of
Google’s founders, wrote
that they might sacrifice
short-term results for
opportunities they judged
to be in the best long-term
interests of shareholders.
When it comes to Hong

Kong, corporate governance
still dramatically lags
behind its regulator’s prin-
ciples in this small city that
has a limited pool of inde-
pendent directors and
whose stock market
remains dominated by a
tight group of ageing

tycoons. Some of Alibaba’s
investors, which include
SoftBank of Japan with
almost 35 per cent and a
string of sovereign wealth
funds and asset managers,
are supportive of the board
nomination plan, according
to people close to the com-
pany.
One of those investors,

who has “high confidence”
in the management,

believes that keeping the
senior team intact is one of
the most important consid-
erations.
But a crucial point on the

proposed make-up of the
board is whether ordinary
shareholders have sufficient
influence, the investor says.
“It has to be clear that we

can say ‘no’ to any director

they nominate,” the inves-
tor says. “Is this a good
company doing the right
thing? If the answer is yes,
we’ll give them a lot of
rope. The key is what hap-
pens if things go wrong in
the business, how can we
effect change?”
Some prospective inves-

tors balk at the plans. One
senior executive at a big
fund manager says the
exchange and its regulators
should not bend the rules
for one company.
“There is no single listing

larger than the system.
They want the best of both
worlds,” he says, adding
that if Alibaba wants
additional board control
akin to an unlisted firm, it
should remain as a partner-
ship.
In the US, the debate over

dual-class control struc-
tures is far from over. In a
case such as Google, the
shares have performed
strongly and the company
has retained the freedom to
pursue multiple strategies
from the highly successful
Android phone software to
the wacky and unproved
Google Glass wearable
device.
For companies such as

Groupon and Zynga, which
have been far from success-
ful, a dual-class share struc-
ture has been seen as an
impediment to sorely
needed change.
Alibaba’s ambitions are

nothing like Google’s,
according to people close to
the company.
But, like Google, Alibaba

still wants to retain the sta-
bility and independence in
its management to change
direction quickly in the face
of disruptive technological
developments and to make
long-term, risky bets that
could bring very large
rewards.

News analysis
Flotation is turning
into a high­stakes
game about control
of the company,
writes Paul J Davies

By Richard Milne in Oslo

Norway’s probable next
government is looking to
part-privatise a slew of
state-owned companies as
eight years of centre-left
rule seems set to come to
an end.
Svein Flatten, Conserva-

tive MP and spokesman on
ownership matters, said it
would want to reduce own-
ership “over time” in three
of the biggest partially
state-owned companies:
energy group Statoil; tele-
coms operator Telenor; and
fertiliser producer Yara.
Companies it would par-

ticularly focus on selling
down include airline SAS;
fish food group Cermaq;
property business Entra;
airport train Flytoget; and
construction services pro-
vider Mesta.
“We first of all want a

stronger private ownership
and a reduced state owner-
ship,” Mr Flatten said. “It is
our opinion that increased
private ownership in attrac-
tive companies results in
increased added value,
increased public visibility
and improved development
possibilities.”
A Conservative-led cen-

tre-right coalition is the
most likely result of elec-
tions today, putting an end
to Jens Stoltenberg’s centre-
left government.
Erna Solberg, the Con-

servative leader and likely
next prime minister, has

campaigned on a platform
of tax cuts, investment in
infrastructure and a focus
on education and health-
care. But the Conservatives
have also said they want to
have a debate about split-
ting up the $750bn oil fund,
the world’s largest sover-
eign wealth fund.
Mr Flatten said the Con-

servatives wanted to reduce
the government’s stake in
Statoil, Norway’s biggest
company by market capital-
isation, from 67 to 51 per
cent, in Telenor from 54 to
51 per cent, and from 36 to
34 per cent in Yara. Those
sales alone would net Nor-
way NKr77bn ($12.7bn) at
market prices.
“The reductions will not

be of very high priority
[and] it is important that
the reductions will be pur-
sued over time, especially
concerning Statoil,” he said.
He added that it was

important in the biggest
companies to keep a block-
ing minority state of at
least a third to ensure no
changes in a business’s stat-
utes could be made, such as
moving its headquarters
out of the country.
The Norwegian govern-

ment owns about a third of
the value of the companies
listed on the Oslo stock
exchange. A sister institu-
tion to the oil fund also has
stakes in many groups.
The current government

has been exploring a sale of
Entra, with little progress.
It also received permission
from parliament to sell
down its stake in Cermaq
but ended up increasing it
amid a takeover fight.

In BP’s battle to limit the
cost of its compensation set-
tlement for the 2010 Deep-
water Horizon disaster, the
independent investigation
into allegations of miscon-
duct in the claims process
has failed to deliver the
best outcome for the com-
pany: a call to stop pay-
ments.
It has, however, provided

BP with plenty of ammuni-
tion for future arguments.
Louis Freeh, a former

director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,
concluded that while there
had been improper and
unethical conduct at the
office administering com-
pensation payments, that
should not stop it “process-
ing and paying honest and
legitimate claims in a
timely manner”.
That assessment, in a

report that was slipped out
quietly in a court filing on
Friday evening, was backed
by an order from Judge
Carl Barbier, who has been
hearing the case over the
spill at the US District
Court in New Orleans.
It was a blow to BP,

which has twice brought
cases to Judge Barbier
arguing that compensation
payments under the settle-
ment should be suspended
because of the possibility of
improper claims.
Yet while Mr Freeh’s con-

clusion may have been dis-
appointing, there was
ample material in his 95-
page report to support BP’s
contention that there have
been serious problems at
the programme. He has also
been given a continuing
role to investigate conflicts

of interests and possible
suspect claims, and to claw
back payments on any
found to be fraudulent.
Patrick Juneau, the Loui-

siana lawyer appointed by
the court to administer the
settlement agreed by BP
and plaintiffs’ lawyers last
year, is praised in Mr
Freeh’s report for his
“proper conduct and ethical
‘tone at the top’”.
However, the report also

highlighted the difficulty of
setting up a programme to
administer tens of thou-
sands of claims from five
states along the Gulf of

Mexico coast. As Mr Juneau
said himself: “It ain’t the
easiest thing in the world in
five states to find somebody
who doesn’t have any con-
tact with the BP litigation.”
Among the staff taken on

by Mr Juneau were Chris-
tine Reitano and Lionel
“Tiger” Sutton, a married
couple who were also part-
ners in a law firm together.

Both assured Mr Juneau
that they would avoid any
possible conflicts of inter-
est. However, Mr Sutton
admitted to Mr Freeh that
he had received $40,460 in
“referral fees” for a com-
pensation claim from a fish-
erman called Casey Thonn.
That claim was taken on by
Andry Lerner, a law firm
run by Jon Andry and Glen
Lerner, Mr Sutton’s former
classmates from Tulane
Law School.
Mr Freeh’s report says

the money was paid to Mr
Sutton by a “circuitous”
route, detailed in a full-page
diagram.
Mr Sutton also worked for

a water treatment company
called Crown, in which Mr
Lerner was an investor, and
was himself a 50 per cent
shareholder in a company
called Romeo Papa that
filed a claim of its own.
Mr Sutton and Ms Reit-

ano are also described by
Mr Freeh as having been
used by Brown Greer, a law
firm working for the claims
administrator’s office, “in
an effort to resist and to
undermine the implementa-
tion of business practices to
control its costs and to
eliminate inefficiencies”.
Brown Greer was criti-

cised for being slow to
detect a potential conflict of
interest on its own staff.
One of its employees had an
“intimate relationship”
with Mr Thonn, and had a
baby with him earlier this
year.
While the evidence of

improper behaviour may be
striking, it is separate from
the issue that has been at
the heart of BP’s fight to
cut the cost of the settle-
ment in the appeals court:
the generous method for
calculating business losses
used by Mr Juneau.
Even so, Mr Freeh has

uncovered material that is
likely to be useful to BP,
and he may uncover more
in the future. It is now up
to the company to work out
how to use it.

US seeks f inal detail
before Fed rate decision
By Kate Allen

The final titbits of data will
be published this week that
add the last pieces to the
US Federal Reserve’s pic-
ture of the economy in
advance of its crucial
rate announcement on Sep-
tember 18.
Growth in retail sales is

expected on Friday, buoyed
by “back to school” spend-
ing. However, the
University of Michigan
consumer confidence indi-
cator is expected to show
that the forthcoming
Congressional wrangle over
the budget seems to be
clouding the sunny mood of
earlier this year along with
last week’s poor non-farm
payroll figures.
In Europe, this week’s

data could reinforce the
tentative air of recovery
that is beginning to take
hold, in advance of the Ger-
man election on September
22.

French industrial produc-
tion tomorrow is likely to
benefit from improved
European business confi-
dence, while Europe-wide
industrial production on
Thursday is expected to
show an improvement that
some analysts believe will
be sustained in the coming
months.
However, longer term

headwinds mean that any
mood of optimism gener-
ated by this week’s data
could be shortlived.
The Eurogroup meets this

week in Vilnius and is
likely to cover issues
such as Greece’s need for a
third rescue package and
further support for Portu-
gal.
But all difficult decisions

are being postponed until
after the German election,
meaning that an autumn of
political turmoil may be
approaching.
The first Chinese data for

August will be published
this week, and should show
whether, as some analysts
expect, growth bottomed
out in the second quarter.
Industrial production is
expected to rebound, driven
by internal demand, partic-
ularly from companies
restocking their invento-
ries.
This will offset external

demand, which remains
subdued. Rising property
investment is expected to
offset a fall in manufactur-
ing investment, meaning
that overall fixed asset

investment figures tomor-
row are likely to be moder-
ately positive.
Money supply figures are

expected to confirm the eco-
nomic upswing. “We expect
the central bank to con-
tinue to maintain relatively
steady monetary conditions
via open market operations
and other liquidity manage-
ment tools,” said John Zhu
of HSBC.
“The current credit and

money supply growth rates
are sufficient to support a
GDP growth rate of around
8 per cent.”
There could be good news

for the Japanese economy
this week, with second-
quarter GDP possibly being
revised upwards thanks to
capital spending.
This would reinforce the

case for the government to
proceed with its consump-

tion tax increase, which is
due to take effect next
April.
In the UK, labour market

data on Wednesday are not
likely to show much change
in either the unemployment
rate or real wages.
They will therefore offer

little to prompt Bank of
England governor Mark
Carney to reassess his for-
ward guidance.
Other indicators have

been positive, boosting
markets’ expectations
of an earlier interest rate
rise.
Construction output fig-

ures on Friday will have
implications for third-
quarter GDP growth: since
it is the weakest contribu-
tor to GDP, any positive
signs will feed into the
increasingly buoyant eco-
nomic mood.

● Housebuilders are
enjoying a boom and
Barratt, which delivers
full-year results, is no
exception, writes Gill
Plimmer.
Shares in the company,

the UK’s largest
housebuilder by volume,
have already risen 49 per
cent in the year to date,
outperforming the FTSE
250 index by 30 per cent
and the sector by 10 per
cent.
Barratt said in July it

expected pre-tax profits to
jump 73 per cent in the
year to June, helped by the
government’s Help to Buy
scheme and an
improvement in consumer
confidence.
But it will be interesting

to discover the extent to
which it is raising
production as a result, as
well as any news on the
dividend. Barratt’s debt
reduction plan is expected
to be on target.
Consensus forecasts have

pre-tax profits rising from
£191.52m in 2013 to
£309.90m in 2014.

● Thorntons has focused
on slashing the number of
stores and selling its goods
through other retailers
since it flirted with
oblivion at the start of
2012 – and investors can
expect more of the same
when it reports full-year
results, writes Duncan
Robinson.
The chocolate

manufacturer and retailer
cut the total number of its
stores from 496 to 482 in
its latest quarter. Instead,
Thorntons has focused on
selling its wares more in
supermarkets through its
commercial channel, where
sales jumped more than 20
per cent in its final
quarter.
The successful

turnround strategy has
been rewarded with a
near trebling of its share
price over the past 12
months.
Thorntons retail division

is, however, still
struggling. The division
posted a 0.8 per cent drop
in like-for-like sales for the
year, albeit with an
improved performance in
the second half of the year.

Profit before tax will
come in at £6.8m,
according to Panmure
Gordon, while earnings per
share will be about 5.5p.

● Sales at Wm Morrison
are expected to show some
sign of improvement
thanks to increased
promotions and reduced
prices when the grocer
reports its second-quarter
results, writes Duncan
Robinson.
Analysts expect an

improvement on Morrison’s
miserable first-quarter
performance, when like-for-

like sales dropped 1.8 per
cent – although not by
much. Deutsche Bank
expects the group to post a
1.1 per cent fall in like-for-
like sales for its second
quarter.
This improvement may

come at a cost. With the
supermarket pushing
promotions and doing its

best to cut prices it is
risking a lower margin,
with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch expecting
the grocer’s gross margin
to fall by 50 basis points.
“Kantar data suggest

that this has had some
success in reversing share
loss to both the
discounters and superstore
competitors but not to a
degree sufficient to offset
the lower gross margins,”
wrote James Collins, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Profit before tax for the
quarter is expected to drop
13 per cent year on year to
£383m.
Investors will look for

any mention of Morrison’s
expansion into the retail
sector’s two fastest
growing markets: online
and convenience.
Morrison’s plans to expand
its M Local convenience
format to 100 stores by the
end of the year, with

analysts expecting a solid
performance from the
stores already opened.
Investors will also want

to hear more about
Morrison’s tie-up with
Ocado, launched in
January 2014.

● The number of pubs in
the UK may be falling, but
JD Wetherspoon is slowly
increasing its estate of cut-
price boozers, writes
Duncan Robinson.
The group increased its

openings target from
between 20 and 25 per year
to a target of more than 30
earlier this year as the
chain of 800 pubs
continues to perform well,
despite miserly consumer
spending.
Management will outline

its expansion plans in
further detail when it
reports full-year results.
After stellar like-for-like

annual sales growth of 8.4
per cent last year,
investors can expect a
more modest sales growth
of about 2 per cent,
according to Panmure
Gordon.
Wetherspoon’s focus on

the low-price end of the
market means that
maintaining margin is key
for the business – no easy
task in an industry that
has been beset by inflation
in everything from food to
taxes.
Management says that a

margin of 8.6 per cent is
reasonable for the
business. But analysts at
Panmure Gordon suggest
that the group will need
like-for-like growth of
about 3 per cent to offset
inflation.
The market expects

annual pre-tax profits to
come in at about £76m,
leaving the group with
earnings per share of about
45p.

Primark continues to bag more sales
While the rest of the high street has
been hit by slack growth, Associated
British Foods’ Primark continues
to grow rapidly, writes Duncan
Robinson.
Primark has shrugged off the high

street’s woes, reporting a 22 per cent
jump in total sales for the first nine
months of the year as shoppers flocked
to its low-price stores.
Analysts at Davy expect Primark to

reveal 5 per cent like-for-like growth for
the whole year when it reports its full-
year trading statement on Monday.
While Primark is still focused on the

high street, the retailer has dipped its
toe into the world of ecommerce via a
partnership with Asos. Investors will be
keen to quiz management on whether
there are plans to expand it.
Away from Primark, the group’s sugar

division is expected to show falling
profits as prices fall across Europe,
according to Davy.
ABF’s grocery division, meanwhile,

has grown 3 per cent for the year to
date, with management hinting this
strong performance was going to
continue into the final quarter.

New York’s
CIO points
to pensions
‘travesty’
By Ellen Kelleher in New York

The outgoing chief invest-
ment officer of New York
City’s pension funds has
taken a parting shot at his
employer, saying that “it’s
a travesty New York City
outsources all of its invest-
ments to money managers”.
Larry Schloss said Can-

ada’s Pension Plan Invest-
ment Board and its Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan,
which manage most of their
money in-house, are far
superior to public pension
funds in the US.
“They are the best models

in the industry. They are in
a different class. They are
20 years ahead of us,” said
Mr Schloss in a valedictory
interview with FTfm.
The CPP Investment

Board has $183.3bn in assets
and Ontario Teachers has
$129.5bn.
Mr Schloss’s job of man-

aging New York’s five pub-
lic pension funds, which
have $140bn in assets, will
end when his boss John
Liu, the city’s comptroller,
leaves office next year.
The CIO said low wages

are partly responsible for
the decision to outsource all
fund management func-
tions. “This is a travesty,”
said Mr Schloss. “We
should be able to attract tal-
ent to work here.”
He added the average

wage of $100,000 for an ana-
lyst in the city’s investment
management bureau is
uncompetitive.

Fund market
rocked by
sexism claims

One in two female fund
management staff have
been subjected to regular
harassment or sexist behav-
iour in the office, shattering
the illusion that asset man-
agement represents the
softer side of financial serv-
ices.
According to the prelimi-

nary findings of an ongoing
FTfm survey – which has so
far captured the views of
100 male and female asset
management staff – 54 per
cent of women said they
have encountered “inappro-
priate” conduct in the
workplace.
A further 28 per cent of

female fund staff said they
have experienced sexual
harassment in the industry.
A female analyst cur-

rently working in the fund
industry, who requested
anonymity, recognises it is
a big problem. She said that
if “something had not gone
right” in a client meeting,
managers would ask why
she had not worn a shorter
skirt.
“I find it distressing if I

am perceived sexually in

the work environment. So
for my own protection I
never wear make-up,
always have my hair tied
up, and wear glasses and a
cardigan.”
One female former asset

management employee,
who also wanted to remain
anonymous, told FTfm: “I
experienced sexual harass-
ment at work – it is rife.
“It is a very male-man-

aged, male-dominated envi-
ronment. You have to be
one of the guys to be suc-
cessful.”
Of the women who said

they had experienced inap-
propriate behaviour in the
workplace, a quarter said
such behaviour took place
on a monthly basis, and 6
per cent said it occurred
weekly.
The results – which have

been gathered with the help
of Cerulli Associates – go
some to way to contradict-
ing common perceptions
about the fund industry
being less aggressive com-
pared with investment
banking or corporate law.
A female respondent to

the FTfm survey said: “Cer-
tain asset classes are very
male dominated, which
results in behaviours and
cultures that may alienate
female colleagues.”
Elizabeth Corley, chief

executive of Allianz Global
Investors, the German fund
house, said she was sur-
prised by the results.
“This has not been my

experience, so I am sur-
prised this has come
through so strongly as a
theme. Most heads of
department [in the indus-
try] will be determined to
look into this,” she said.
The survey showed that

women in junior roles are
most likely to experience
sexism in the office, with
more than 70 per cent say-
ing they had experienced
inappropriate behaviour at
least once over a 12 month
period, compared with 49
per cent of women in mid-
dle and senior positions.
Surprisingly, 5 per cent of

male respondents also said
they had experienced sex-
ual harassment in the asset
management industry.

Simon McMenemy, a part-
ner at Signet Partners, an
employment law firm,
agreed the findings were
unexpected.
He said: “There are a lot

of very senior female asset
managers out there
and because of that, people
are much better behaved
[than in other areas of
finance].”
The lawyer added, how-

ever, that he had seen cases
where women who had
complained about harass-
ment in the fund industry
had been edged out of their
organisations as a result.
He said: “It takes a lot of

moral courage to say some-
thing is inappropriate or
offensive when there is a

culture of showing you are
part of a team.”
Fund companies need to

concentrate on improving
the visibility of women at
the top of their organisa-
tions, according to Gemma
Godfrey, head of invest-
ment strategy at Brooks
Macdonald, the wealth man-
agement group.
She said: “The results are

incredibly sad, but they are
less to do with aggressive-
ness or how stressful the
work is and more to do with
how these organisations are
structured.”

Hedge
funds
hate Fatca
the most
By Ellen Kelleher in New York

The Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act ranks first
on the list of regulations
that leading hedge fund
managers find most irritat-
ing, according to a survey.
Fatca, which requires the

disclosure of confidential
information about US cli-
ents to the Internal Reve-
nue Service, is seen as a
“major concern” for three-
quarters of the 40 large
hedge fund managers with
at least $1bn in assets
across Europe, the US and
Asia polled by Sungard and
Aite, two hedge fund con-
sultants.
Form PF, the part of the

Dodd-Frank Act that per-
mits US regulators to carry
out stress tests on manag-
ers’ portfolios, and the
Alternative Investment
Fund Managers Directive,
which subjects hedge funds
to greater scrutiny in
Europe, follow closely
behind Fatca as the second
and third most severe head-
aches for hedge fund man-
agers.
“Fatca varies from coun-

try to country and thus car-
ries a high degree of uncer-
tainty and complexity,”
wrote the authors of “Hedge
Fund Trends and Chal-
lenges: Achieving Institu-
tional Credibility”.
“Form PF is certainly the

overwhelming concern
among US funds, while
AIFMD’s patchy implemen-
tation brings concerns of
increased complexity to
fund administrators.”
The research also sug-

gested that corporate perks
and large headcounts
remained out of fashion,
due to squeezed budgets.

Money market ratings ‘outlawed’

By Steve Johnson

A proposal by the European
Commission to ban money
market funds from solicit-
ing or financing a rating
from a credit rating agency
has raised fears that this
prohibition could be
extended across the conti-
nent’s financial sector.
The proposal formed part

of a broader crackdown by
Brussels on the $2.9tn
money market fund indus-
try, unveiled last week, that
also included proposals to

force some funds to build
up cash buffers amounting
to 3 per cent of their assets.
The commission said the

ban on soliciting ratings
would end the risk of “sud-
den massive redemptions”
from a fund in the wake of
a rating downgrade,
strengthening financial sta-
bility.
In addition, it would

remove the incentive for
money market funds to
“fire sell” holdings issued
by a downgraded bank in
order to maintain their tri-
ple-A rating.
However some believe the

proposal could pre-empt a
report due to be presented
by the commission in Janu-
ary 2016 into the prevailing
“issuer pays” model right
across the credit rating

agency industry.
“If you decide there needs

to be a proper study into
the business model of an
industry, then you do that
study first, rather than just
going off and implementing
something,” said one indus-
try figure.
“They argue that money

market funds are different
to anything else, but clearly
they are going to draw con-
clusions from this. If you
are doing a study on busi-
ness models, this will be
part of the study. It pre-
empts the study.”
A second source said:

“It’s certainly an unprece-
dented move to effectively
outlaw fund ratings.”
The source added that, in

the US, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the

regulator, requires money
market funds to use rating
agencies to determine
which assets are eligible for
their portfolios.
Separately, both Moody’s

and Standard & Poor’s, two
leading rating agencies,
criticised the commission
for its proposal to bar
money market funds from
paying for a rating.
Daniel Piels, a spokesman

for Moody’s, said the pro-
posal “attempts to ‘control
the message’ about risk in
Europe by substituting reg-
ulatory oversight for mar-
ket transparency”.
Martin Winn, a spokes-

man for S&P, said fund
managers and investors
“should be free to use the
investment tools they deem
appropriate”.

‘issuer pays’ report

Sweden pensions urged to dump carbon
By Caroline Liinanki

Sweden’s cluster of state
pension funds face political
pressure to divest from all
of their fossil fuel holdings.
The Swedish Centre party

has called for all of the
country’s national pension
funds to sell off their hold-
ings in fossil fuel corpora-
tions in order to “climate
proof” and protect the value
of their investments.
Martin Ådahl, chief econ-

omist at the Centre party,
which is part of Sweden’s
four-party government coa-
lition, told FTfm that the
AP funds had been “impo-
tent” and that investments
in fossil fuels represented a
financial risk to the long-
term value of the country’s
pension reserves.
The four main AP funds,

with SKr971bn ($146bn) of
assets under management,

have some of their largest
foreign equity holdings in
oil and gas companies.
The Centre party’s call

for divestment follows a
report by Lord Nicholas
Stern, a professor at the
London School of Econom-
ics, and Carbon Tracker, a
think-tank. It warned of a
“carbon bubble” and cau-
tioned that at least two-
thirds of listed companies’
oil, coal and gas reserves
were “unburnable” if global
warming were to be kept
below two degrees.
Mr Ådahl admitted that

the aim was not to legislate,
which he recognised would
be both difficult and politi-
cally sensitive. “We want to
bring the issue to public
debate. We are encouraging
the AP funds to take
action,” he said.
Last year, AP4 invested

SKr1.3bn in a low-carbon

equity strategy. However,
Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell
and ExxonMobil also make
up three of the SKr241bn

fund’s five largest foreign
equity holdings.
Arne Lööw, AP4’s head of

corporate governance,
acknowledged the contra-
diction. “Excluding all fos-
sil fuel companies would be
too great a risk,” he said.
Nordic life and pension

company Storebrand, which
has NKr450bn of assets
under management,
excluded 19 fossil fuel com-
panies from its investment
line-up in July. The exclu-
sion was based on concerns
around the long-term finan-
cial risks of remaining
invested in carbon dioxide-
intensive companies.
“The reason for divesting

is to secure long-term
returns. The greatest risk
for investors is to do noth-
ing,” said Christine Tørklep
Meisingset, head of sustain-
able investments at Store-
brand.

Is it time to
return to EM?

Emerging markets have
suffered a big sell­off since
May. Rob Drijkoningen,
co­head of emerging
market debt at Neuberger
Berman, believes the sell­
off has almost run its
course and discusses
which countries and assets
are likely to perform best
when buyers return.

News analysis

Old MacDonald
had an investment
in agriculture

Investing in farmland isnot always as straight-forward as it might
appear. One New York-
based hedge fund appar-
ently pulled out of a Brazil-
ian farm project on discov-
ering the deal would only
produce positive cash flows
one month a year, a period
known to those in the trade
as a “harvest”.
Meanwhile, foreign inves-

tors that have snapped up
farmland in poorer parts of
Africa have been pilloried
for putting local tenant
farmers out of work and,
potentially, reducing local
food supplies by exporting
their produce.
But despite these set-

backs, the likes of Sweden’s
AP2 pension fund and the
UK’s Pension Protection
Fund have invested in farm-
land and, unsurprisingly,
asset managers such as
TIAA-CREF of the US and
Insight Investment of the
UK are queueing up to feed
this demand.
Indeed, one such house,

Hamburg-based Aquila Cap-
ital, believes the investment
opportunity is now better
than ever.
“There is a sea change

that has gone unnoticed,”
says Detlef Schoen, manag-
ing partner, farm invest-
ments at Aquila. “All of a
sudden very good [farmers]
have begun to welcome
financial investors, largely
because their traditional
sources of funding are dry-
ing up.
“Banks are in retreat,

asset values have ballooned
and farms are getting big-
ger, so there is a huge
equity gap. It’s a fantastic
opportunity.”
Charmion McBride, head

of innovation and develop-
ment at Insight Investment,
which has made a number of
farmland investments, says:
“The supply and demand
fundamentals are quite com-
pelling, as are the real-asset
characteristics – the hedge
against inflation, the ability
to provide income, the fact
that farmland has been resil-
ient across economic cycles,
the fact it diversifies any
portfolio. It’s going to be a
big growth area.”

Insight believes the
opportunities are signifi-
cant, with the global value
of farmland around $8tn,
while aggregate institu-
tional investment to date
amounts to somewhere
between $15bn and $25bn.
Many of the arguments in

favour of farmland are well
known. Jeremy Grantham,
co-founder and chief invest-
ment strategist at GMO, the
US asset manager, pointed
out last year that food pro-
duction will need to rise
between 60 and 100 per cent
by 2050 to feed a rapidly ris-
ing global population that
is increasingly able to
demand more resource-in-
tensive foods such as meat,
which create additional
demand for animal feed.
Taking into account

water shortages, climate
change and slowing growth
in crop yields, Mr
Grantham foresaw a “long-
term and politically danger-
ous food crisis”.
However, according to Mr

Schoen, until recently finan-
cial investors were not
needed in the sector, and
there was little incentive for
the most productive farmers
to welcome them in.

“The first wave of inves-
tors into farms over the
past 15 years was often left
disappointed because they
had the wrong managers in
the wrong geographies with
a misalignment of interests
between asset managers
and farmers,” he says.
“But we now have access

to top-class farmers who in
the recent past would not
have given us a look-in and
they are the ones offering
excellent returns. For an
investor the danger is to
not pick the right farms –
the top 25 per cent are
about 50 per cent better
than the rest.”
Aquila cites two reasons

for the improved opportu-
nity set. First, fewer than
half the farmers in the
developed world have iden-
tified a potential successor,
according to Farmtransfers,
a research project, as their

children increasingly
favour alternative careers.
This is likely to lead to

more merger and acquisi-
tion activity as these farms
are instead sold on, often to
other farmers. The UN’s
Food and Agriculture
Organisation estimated in
2009 that $208bn of private
capital would be needed to
finance this structural
change every year for the
foreseeable future.
However, the broader

scaling back of bank lend-
ing has created an “equity
gap” that offers “unprece-
dented investment opportu-
nities” for financial inves-
tors, Mr Schoen says.
He cites the case of a

dairy farmer in the Austral-
ian state of New South
Wales, who had to buy out
his siblings to take on the
family farm, as well as pay
his parents enough to retire
on. He also wanted to buy
an adjacent farm from an
elderly neighbour, offering
attractive economies of
scale, and needed a 75 per
cent loan-to-value deal to
finance both.
“Any banker up to five

years ago would have given
him a loan. Today, no
chance,” says Mr Schoen.
Instead Aquila bought a 70
per cent equity stake in the
combined operation.
“Before, these farmers

would not have talked to
you. Why would they have
given up their earnings
potential?”
Although Aquila takes

equity stakes, Mr Schoen
says the holding actually
works more like debt.
Aquila receives a guaran-
teed 3 per cent a year
return (assuming the
farmer can borrow to fund
this if he loses money), with
the farmer receiving the
next tranche of income and
the remainder split 70-30 in
Aquila’s favour.
Mr Schoen envisages pre-

tax, post-fee returns of 5-7
per cent a year from such
investments, plus a capital
gain resulting from the pro-
ductivity improvements he
believes are possible. After
15 years or so, he forecasts
the farmers will have
acquired enough capital to
buy Aquila out.
The German house argues

that, by teaming up with
“good, young expanding
farmers”, who retain an
equity stake in a farm,
rather than being tenants,
it is able to generate
“alpha”, ie to outperform
the asset class at large.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,
other investors believe they
are also perfectly capable of
generating alpha.
TIAA-CREF has invested

around $4bn of its $523bn of
assets in farmland since
2007. Its local affiliate asset
managers, who have an
agricultural investment
background, buy land and
then engage local tenant
farmers.
“We have been able to

identify tenants and local
operators who employ

responsible and modern
farming practices, and we
are able to support their
growth,” says Biff Ourso, a
director and portfolio man-
ager. He lauds the benefits
farmland brings to TIAA-
CREF’s portfolio, arguing it
is a good hedge against infla-
tion, has a low correlation to
other asset classes and has
historically provided a
return of 8-12 per cent,
including capital growth.
Insight also believes it

can generate alpha by mak-

ing improvements to farms,
for instance by building
infrastructure such as milk-
ing plants; improving irri-
gation and the genetics of
livestock; and by consoli-
dating small leasehold plots
into larger, more efficient
farms.
It has attracted long-term

investors such as pension
funds, family offices and
sovereign wealth funds, and
believes this approach can
generate annual returns of
12-15 per cent.

Larry Schloss, the under-
stated private equity expert
who safeguards the pension
money for New York City’s
police officers, firefighters
and teachers, is hunting
around quietly for a succes-
sor. But persuading ex-col-
leagues and acquaintances
from Wall Street to contem-
plate the job remains a
quixotic crusade.
“I’ve had one or two nib-

bles, but it’s amazing how
many people don’t want to
work in government. It’s
too bad,” says Mr Schloss,
who goes by the title of
New York City’s chief
investment officer. “My
time here has been spectac-
ularly interesting.”
Mr Schloss’s tenure of

three and a half years at
the helm of the city’s five
public pension funds
screeches to a halt at the
start of next year, thanks to
a decision by his boss John
Liu, the city’s comptroller,
to enter the race to succeed
Michael Bloomberg as
mayor. Mr Schloss, a self-
described independent,
holds no allegiance to
either former state gover-
nor Eliot Spitzer or Scott
Stringer, the two Democrats
vying to replace Mr Liu.
Soon, the 58-year-old

expects to leave his humble
office in the municipal
building across from City
Hall where the air condi-
tioning unit leaks and
return to the private sector,
where he bathed in success.
(He set up Diamond Castle,
a private equity firm, after
a 22-year stint at DLJ,
where he became chairman
of the group’s merchant
bank and a shorter spell
running Credit Suisse First
Boston’s global private
equity business.)
Indeed, it was Bill Mul-

row, a fellow DLJ alumnus
then working for Mr Liu,
who called in 2009 to see if
Mr Schloss would be inter-
ested in running the pen-
sion fund for a few years.
“I know nothing about pol-

itics. I have no political aspi-
rations or political tenden-
cies at all. I had never met
John Liu,” says the straight-
talking Queens native.
“The pitch was: ‘New

York City has $100bn in
pension money. It’s the
fifth-largest public pension
fund in the US and it hasn’t
been run particularly well.
You can come for two or
three years and try to make
an impact . . . You’ll meet all
of these interesting people
in government. Then you
can go back to your life’.”
“It just seemed like an

interesting thing,” Mr
Schloss says. “I’m from
New York City and I’ve
been involved in charities
raising money for cops and
firefighters killed in the line
of duty. So, I know a lot of
cops and firefighters and

they control two of the five
pension funds.”
His initiation into govern-

ment was a baptism of fire.
Upon his arrival in 2010, the
annualised 10-year return
on average for the five pen-
sion funds for the city’s
workers was 2.3 per cent,
while the funds’ actuarial
assumption was 8 per cent.
“Something wasn’t right,”

he says. So Mr Schloss and
his small team set about
changing the funds’ asset
allocation, which had not
been altered in five years,
as well as its investments.
The portfolio mix went

from roughly 70 per cent
invested in equities and the
remainder in fixed income,
to a less volatile combina-
tion of 65 per cent in equi-
ties and 35 per cent in the
debt markets. Considerable
money was made by buying
high-yield bonds and other
kinds of “opportunistic”
fixed income plays, and sell-
ing off inflation protected
and low-yielding govern-
ment debt.
Mr Schloss admits the

strategy is not foolproof and
rising interest rates will
crimp returns on debt. “My
successor is going to have
some work to do when rates
go back up.”
At a glance, Mr Schloss’s

efforts to turn things round
from his spartan command-
and-control centre seem vic-
torious. The funds’ assets
grew from $100bn to $140bn
since he has been in con-

trol, making it the fourth-
largest pension fund now,
and they carved out a 12.3
per cent return on average
in the year to June.
The teachers tend to

make more conservative
investment choices than the
police and fire departments,
clinging more closely to
passive equities. Mr Schloss
managed to convince the
trustees of the police, fire

and municipal workers’
money to invest up to 5 per
cent of their holdings in
hedge funds. Across the five
funds, more money was put
into emerging market equi-
ties as well as floating-rate
leveraged loans, private
equity and property.
But troubles still rumble

below the surface. And some
of them look hard to fix.
New York’s pension sys-

tem seems archaic com-
pared with more advanced
peers in the field. First,
there are five distinct funds:
one for teachers ($50bn);
another for firefighters
($9bn); a third for police
officers ($30bn); a fourth for
city workers ($48bn); and,
lastly, one for people who
work at schools but are not
educators ($3bn).
Each union employs its

own trustees, even though
the groups share about 90
per cent of investments.
Much to Mr Schloss’s cha-
grin, a proposal to merge
the five investment commit-
tees into a single one to cut
costs failed, thanks to polit-

ical undercurrents.
Another pitfall is that,

unlike peers such as Calp-
ers and Calstrs, California’s
two big pension funds, the
city’s pension group out-
sources all its investments
to BlackRock and 324 other
financial managers. It thus
invests only in funds. “Con-
sequently, we pay fees to
everyone . . . It’s a bit odd
that New York City, the
world’s financial capital,
outsources all of its invest-
ment management to
money managers,” laments
Mr Schloss. “You’ll save
money on the margin if you
do it in-house. The key is
not to give up the returns.”
He adds: “We have $140bn

in assets and we don’t own
one property because it’s all
in funds . . . I think we
should own some buildings
and save on fees and do
joint ventures with people.”
Bringing people on board

to manage money is also a
tedious process, due in part
to rules brought in years
ago after a corruption scan-
dal. While the time it takes
to hire a manager has been
shortened to nine months
from about 17, the rules are
the same ones the city uses
to “buy school buses and
pencils,” notes Mr Schloss.
Mr Schloss laments that

he does not pay his staff
well. The average person
who works in New York’s
bureau of investment man-
agement makes $100,000
and must live in one of the
five boroughs. “It’s not
enough,” says Mr Schloss.
“If you come out of Harvard
Business School and get a
starting job at a bank, you
get a couple of hundred
thousand dollars.”
Mr Schloss’s departure

from the job seems bitter-
sweet as he got such a kick
out of it. He is not lobbying
for a second act at the
municipal building, but he
makes the case that the
unspoken rule that the new
comptroller brings his own
chief investment officer
works against investors’
interests. “It’s not the right
way to manage money,” he
concludes. “If you look at
some of the other public pen-
sion funds, you’ll see that
the chief investment officer
is more of a staff job, and
the group in the investment
office stays, no matter who
the elected officials are.”

Opinion

Well-judged regulation is
important. Ill-judged
regulation, as in the case
of the financial transaction
tax (FTT) proposed by the
European Commission, is
harmful.
The pressure on the

commission mainly came
from the pro FTT French
and German governments
in response to public
opinion within their
countries. Plans for an EU-
wide FTT were scuppered
in 2012 by resistance from
the UK.
In February, the

commission put forward a
second draft, which is
currently the subject of
protracted negotiations
between the 11 states of
the “enhanced co-
operation” mechanism.
The commission’s

proposal is that the tax
will apply if at least one
party to the transaction is
established in a
participating member state
(known as the residence
principle), or if a financial

Financial transaction tax will ‘damage’ economy
instrument issued in a
participating state is
traded outside the 11
participating states (known
as the issuance principle).
This has already provoked
disagreement.
The British and

Americans in particular
have little enthusiasm for
the residence principle. It
would mean that for tax
purposes their financial
institutions would be
treated as resident in the
participating member
states, and they would
therefore have to pay tax,
simply because they enter
into transactions with
other financial institutions
resident in a participating
state. They would have to
make tax declarations in
all 11 countries and
establish the infrastructure
for meeting those tax
liabilities. The UK has
already lodged a challenge
at the European Court of
Justice.
The residence principle

may not only infringe the
right to the free movement
of capital but also the
international law principle
of territoriality. But should

individual states be able to
interfere with the tax
sovereignty of other
nations and impose tax
obligations on their
financial institutions?
The issuance principle is

also highly questionable.
How will Germany go

about collecting the tax if

you have a bank in China
selling German equities to
a bank in Australia? In
Germany, tax laws are
unconstitutional if they
are unenforceable. The
German focus, therefore,
will not be on the issuance
principle.
Compare this with

France, which introduced
an FTT based on this exact
principle. It will be
interesting to see which
side emerges on top.
Whatever the case, the
French model is proving to
be problematic, and not
only because of the decline
in the trading volume of
French equities.
Citing the principle of

territoriality, some German
banks are refusing to pay
the tax to France. If it does
nevertheless happen, the
situation will be absurd.
Since the tax is imposed
on the transaction, German
taxpayers dealing in
French equities could set
the tax against their
German tax liability.
Germany’s exchequer
would effectively be acting
as a source of revenue for
the French government.

In fact, the grounds on
which the FTT are based
are themselves
questionable. One of its
aims is to rein in high-
frequency trading, yet that
is already the case as a
result of the reform of the
European Markets in
Financial Instruments
Directive. Then there is the
purported goal of making
those who allegedly caused
the financial crisis help
pay for the clean up.
But the tax would also

be levied on private
investors. In the case of
investment funds, this
would have a direct impact
on fund assets, and
consequently on investors
themselves.
If we look at pensions,

the result would be a
striking paradox. On the
one hand, the state
provides billions of euros
in subsidies for pensions,
while on the other the tax
would take a hefty slice
out of investors’ savings.
For German financial

institutions, too, the
disadvantages would be
considerable, especially in
terms of competition with

other financial institutions
outside participating states.
Hubs, such as Luxembourg,
would benefit by attracting
new fund business away
from German supervisory
control.
This tax would be

economically damaging
and legally problematic,
and many of our decision
makers in Berlin are fully
aware of this. At the
moment, though, Berlin is
gearing up for national
elections, and no one is
prepared to voice criticism
of the FTPT for fear of
being seen as a friend of
the banking industry.
Most voters are in favour
of the FTT because they
do not realise that they
would also end up
paying it.
According to a survey

conducted by BVI, once
this misunderstanding is
clarified most voters will
end up deciding they are
against the tax. Let us
hope that common sense
returns after the elections.

Talking head
THOMAS RICHTER

Sound of silence from US fund houses

Some of the pieces makingup the equity marketspuzzle do not fit together
neatly.
Many analysts had predicted

that the slog back from the
depths of the financial crisis
would usher in a “new normal”
era of tepid returns. Instead,
several frantic bursts of growth
led the markets back to their
all-time highs this summer.
Even so, a picture of long-

term muted returns may be
what the jigsaw pieces add up
to after all. Look for clues, say
a few veteran market observers,
in the budgets of big US
advisory firms – or rather, in
what is missing from them.
The signs to seek are whether

large wealth managers are
making bold investments in
technology, staffing and
resources, or whether they have
settled into a mode of catch-up,
conversions, repairs and
maintenance.
It is not so strange to see

companies sitting on cash, says
Donald Robinson, chief
executive of Palladiem and a
former chief investment officer

at Smith Barney and BNY
Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors.
Uncertainty over fiscal policy,
regulatory overhauls and the
pace of the economic recovery
has frozen business activity in
many US sectors.
Nevertheless, when wealth

management companies that get
paid for their insights on
markets opt not to invest
themselves, it is a bellwether.
“These companies are choosing
to stay lean and mean,” Mr
Robinson says.
That does not mean their line

items list only zeroes. Just this
year, Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management touted a $500m
spend to bolster technology
systems, Merrill Lynch a $100m
consolidation of its portal for
advisers to use fee-based
products, and UBS the planned
appointment of 1,000 wealth
management and investment
banking support staff.
Much of that, however, has
followed cost cuts, deferred
projects, lay-offs and starved
budgets in recent years.
A better signal is whether

companies are funding
innovations on the US advisory
market’s wish list. For instance,
few houses can run a
traditional client portfolio that
also cleanly integrates “exotic”
holdings such as futures,
options, foreign securities, short
positions and complex fixed
income. Few have streamlined
basic functions of their custody
and portfolio accounting

systems – a leap that could
unlock great efficiencies. And
few can smoothly handle
multicurrency transactions or
optimise portfolio moves at the
tax-lot level.

All of those would be
expensive but market-leading
moves.
Other big ideas orbit the

industry. Paul Hatch, a former
investment products head at
Morgan Stanley’s brokerage,
says he is building a vehicle
that melds the lower cost
structure of an exchange traded
fund, the tax efficiency and
customisation of a separate
account, and the scalability of a
mutual fund. Which big
company will latch on to that
test rocket?
And the US market is still

tinkering with the long-
promised “unified managed

household”, a catch-all platform
that would let advisers run not
only a full slate of in-house
client assets, but also accounts
held elsewhere, all within a
single co-ordinated shell. Starter
kits exist, but a fully
operational version is nowhere
in sight.
If US wealth managers are

making outsized investments in
such groundbreaking projects,
they are being mighty quiet
about it. If they are not,
there are plausible excuses: one
is the challenge of getting
quarterly earnings-focused
public companies to commit
to long-term projects; another
just the need for a more
regular rhythm of revenue
growth before taking a step
forward.
A market-based explanation,

however, may be the most
likely. These firms simply do
not see galloping growth ahead,
and are unwilling to lay out big
sums, says Bevin Crodian, chief
executive of Fincastle
Consulting and a former EF
Hutton and Smith Barney
executive.
“If it was a bull market for

real, you would see firms
investing like crazy in their
businesses,” he says. “This tells
you no one believes that long-
only is a good bet.”
If that is the case, then US

advisory firms may well be
working on a different
puzzle: how to make the most
of markets in slow motion.

management
companies that get

So, summer is over andeveryone in the moneyworld is getting ready for
the traditional autumn crisis. Of
course we will have the, now
time-honoured, eurozone
crackup farce. Show times will
be set and the cast members
announced after the German
election in two weeks, ready for
the IMF-World Bank meetings
in mid-October.
There may, though, be

something Different This Time.
You will notice that after the
spring and summer market
hiccups and corrections, a
couple of asset classes are not
only coughing, but coughing up
some blood. Emerging market-
traded debt and equities, even
after last week’s little rally,
have continued to lose
international investors’ cash
and confidence.
Multilateral Man, from the

IMF staff to the courtiers
whispering to rich countries’
heads of government, is
wondering if “EM” is turning
into a “systemic risk”. You
know, like “Lehman”. Do rich-
world investors or taxpayers
have to pay for the losses?
The answer, I believe, is that

there is a systemic risk
developing from the drain of
investor money out of emerging
market debt and equity funds,
but that risk is not an
immediate threat to the rich
world’s central banks,
commercial banks, investment
dealers or taxpayers. This time,
the systemic crisis will swirl
around EM central banks and
those dependent on their ability
to maintain independent
convertible currencies. When
you sell EM shares or bonds in
the years to come, you may not
get dollars or euros in return for
rupees or reals with quite the

same ease you have come to
expect. The losses, though, will
be spread out among the
broadly defined investor class,
rather than concentrated on the
balance sheets of large banks
and dealers that would have to
be recapitalised by rich-world
taxpayers.
The threat of financial crises

in the developing world
spreading to the rest of the globe
was supposed to have been seen
off after the Latin American
banking crisis of the late 1980s
and early 1990s, and the Asian
crisis of 1997, which followed a
collapse of fixed exchange rates
for overpriced and over-borrowed
local currencies. Huge foreign
exchange reserves were piled up
by EM central banks, who also
arranged bilateral currency swap
lines to prevent recurrences of
such shocks.
Those resources of ready cash

provided comforting bullet
points for the world’s securities
sales forces, who told rich-world
investors “never again” with
conviction.

And yet . . . trees don’t grow to
the sky, not even in Brazil or
India. Yes, the working-age
populations have been growing
faster than in Europe, Japan or
the US, but the highly skilled
part of the workforce in much
of the developing world is
smaller, and harder to increase
quickly, than you would
conclude from the advertising
inserts and dealers’ PowerPoint
presentations. According to a
recent report from Citi Research
discouragingly titled “Tourist
Traps”, real annual credit
growth in emerging markets
between 2004 and 2011 was, at
13.9 per cent, running at about
twice the rate of real growth in
gross domestic product.

Let us go back to the most
interesting example of right-
questions-asking to come out of
the Federal Reserve in recent
years: Governor Jeremy Stein’s
“Remarks” on February 7 of
this year. He wrote: “In
principle, what we’d really like
to know, for any given asset
class – be it subprime
mortgages, junk bonds or
leveraged loans – is this: what
fraction of it is ultimately
financed by short-term
demandable claims who are
likely to pull back quickly when
things start to go bad?”
Now, does not the idea of

being able to “pull back quickly
when things start to go bad”
sound like a good idea? If you
had the bad luck to be a US
money-centre bank lending to
Mexico in 1982, though, you
could not pull back quickly. If,
however, today you are an EM
debt mutual fund owner, or EM
equity exchange traded fund
holder, you can sell at a low
transaction cost with a double
click on your laptop screen.
Back in the 1980s and 1990s,

when sovereigns short of foreign
exchange restructured their
debt, bondholders tended to get
preferred treatment, since their
proportion of total obligations
was small, and litigating with
them was too much trouble. Not
so now. Since the 2008 financial
crisis, cumulative bank lending
to emerging markets has been
around $100bn. In contrast, EM
debt and equity portfolio
investment rose by more than
$700bn.
That is probably a bit more

than the global dealers’ market-
making desks will be willing to
put on their balance sheets if the
holders were to try and cut their
positions in a month or two.
That leaves two ways out for EM
central banks: pay the foreign
exchange to cover portfolio
investor sales out of their
reserves, or devalue to the point
where the would-be sellers give
up and hold on to the paper.
Oh, there is a third way. The

EM central banks can impose
capital controls.
Welcome to 1932.

Regulators around the world
have been focusing on how
financial companies deliver
advice to their clients. The
standards that apply to that
advice – especially how it is paid
for – have been the subject of
recent regulatory initiatives in
Australia, the US and Europe.
The official goals of these

initiatives are to eliminate
conflicts of interest that might
harm investors, and to help them
cope with the increasing
complexity of financial markets.
Less officially, these initiatives
aim to push investors into lower-
cost funds – something that fee
disclosure at a product level has
failed to do sufficiently, at least
in regulators’ eyes.
While the scope of the

initiatives varies, all incorporate
at least one of the following
elements: a ban on inducements,
and higher standards for advisers.
Virtually all of the proposals

call for such a ban – whether it
is called a retrocession, rebate,
sales load or commission.
Whatever the name, they all
involve payments from the
sponsor of an investment product
to the financial adviser who
recommends it. Bans are already
in place for at least some
products in Australia, the
Netherlands and the UK.
The bans eliminate incentives

for advisers to choose products
with high payouts to advisers,
even when a lower-fee option
might be better for their clients.
Instead, investors will pay

financial advisers for their
services directly, whether at an
hourly rate, as a percentage of
assets or as a fixed amount. But
whatever the schedule, investors
must agree to the fees in
advance. Australia’s “Future of
Financial Advice” reform
requires that investors opt in at
least once every two years.
Several of the proposals from

regulators also impose higher
standards on financial advisers
than previously. For example,
two of the proposals being
discussed in the US would
impose a “fiduciary standard” on
advisers, requiring them to
always put client interests ahead
of their own. By contrast, many
advisers working for brokerages
are currently only required to
make recommendations that are
“suitable”, but not necessarily
best, for their clients.
The UK Retail Distribution

Review takes a different route to
higher standards, by imposing an
educational mandate. Before
beginning to practice, advisers
must obtain a qualification,
which can involve extensive
study and multiple exams. They
must also stay up to date, with
35 hours of continuing education
each year.
Many of the initiatives

additionally encourage financial
houses to provide broad-based

advice to their clients. For
example, the UK regulations
specify that only advisers who
consider a range of retail
investment products can call
themselves “independent”.
The initiatives further aim to

close loopholes that subjected
some products to lighter
regulation than others. The
fiduciary-standard proposal from
the US Department of Labor falls
into this category. It would apply
the same oversight standards to
individual retirement accounts
that are in effect for other tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.
All of these initiatives have

been controversial. In fact, the
first to be implemented, the UK’s
Retail Distribution Review, was
discussed for more than six years
before it took effect in 2013.
Given the dramatic changes in

longstanding systems
necessitated by many of these
initiatives, the controversy is not
surprising. The cost can be
substantial. For example, Dutch
fund sponsors have had to offer
new “clean” fund share classes
stripped of any inducements.
Other critics have suggested

the initiatives may make
financial advice both less
accessible and more expensive.
They argue that investors who
need advice only occasionally
may have been best served by
the inducement approach.

The extended debate is a good
thing. First, prolonged discussion
allows more time for market
forces to operate while bringing
attention to the underlying
concerns. Indeed, the trend in
fees has been steadily downward
in the US as advisers and
investors have been encouraged
to take a closer look at costs.
Second, it provides more

opportunity to see the results of
the programmes that have
already been put in place. The
UK programme appears to have
had one of the intended effects,
which is to increase use of lower-
cost index funds. But it may also
have caused a 10 per cent
decrease in the number of
financial advisers.
While most of the discussion of

these trends to date has been at
the local level, investors
worldwide would benefit from
comparisons that identified
common experiences. We urge
both the industry and regulators
to look across borders for
relevant models.

Fire risk is a burning supply­chain issue

Investors grappling with
health and safety risks in
emerging-market supply
chains face new concerns
about factory fire hazards
in developed regions, with
Europe one of the biggest
laggards.
A report by the Supplier

Ethical Data Exchange
shows that supply chains
across a range of sectors in
Europe have the highest
level of factory fire risk,
while Africa has the lowest.
The findings, compiled by

independent auditors,
reveal 13.5 per cent of sup-
ply chains in Europe fail to
comply with safety meas-
ures, compared with 6.6 per
cent in Africa.
Asia, which has experi-

enced some devastating fac-
tory fires in Bangladesh

and Pakistan, where hun-
dreds of workers have died
in the past year, shows 12.7
per cent non-compliance,
North America 11 per cent
and South America 11.8 per
cent.
At country level, Roma-

nia has the highest propor-
tion of fire safety problems,
followed by Portugal, the
US, the Czech Republic and
Italy.
“Investors need to under-

stand that such risks and
hazards do not take place
only in developing coun-
tries. They must take a
proactive stance and engage
with companies in all
areas,” says Mark Robert-
son, a spokesman at Sedex,
which focuses on responsi-
ble and ethical business
practices within global sup-
ply chains.
Missing or inadequate

exit signs, lack of emer-
gency lighting, blocked
aisles, poor firefighting
equipment and missing or
outdated fire inspection cer-
tificates were some of the
main examples of non-com-
pliance in all countries sur-
veyed.
The garment trade has

come under renewed scru-

tiny since the collapse of
the Rana Plaza in Dhaka,
which housed several low-
cost clothing factories. The
research, however, shows a
range of sectors failing to
meet fire safety standards.
Manufacturing and phar-

maceutical sectors had the
highest level of fire risk glo-
bally, while agricultural
companies, which are par-
ticularly predominant in
Africa, had the lowest.
Fire safety comprises 32

per cent of health and
safety failings in global sup-
ply chains, according to
Sedex.
Companies have

responded to the Bangla-
desh disaster. Retailers
such as Sweden’s Hennes &
Mauritz, Spain’s Inditex,
which owns the Zara cloth-
ing chain, and Tesco, the
UK’s largest supermarket,
are among about 40, mostly
European, clothing and
retail brands sourcing from
Bangladesh that have
signed up to a binding
agreement. The Accord on
Fire and Building Safety in
Bangladesh aims to end the
cycle of factory disasters in
the country.
The factory safety pact

was set up by labour and
human rights groups such
as Industriall, a global
union representing workers
in mining, energy and man-
ufacturing, and the Interna-
tional Labor Rights Forum.
Since the tragedy, inves-

tors have become more
aware of such risks and are
adding their weight. More
than 200 global investors,
with about $2tn in managed
assets, from 16 countries in

North America, Europe and
Australia, have joined
forces to support the fac-
tory safety plan.
“We are engaging with

the apparel brands and
retailers we hold, as well as
North American trade asso-
ciations, to press them to
join [the accord] as we
believe it presents the best
path towards meaningful
sector reform,” Susana
McDermott, a representa-

tive of the Interfaith Center
on Corporate Responsibil-
ity, which is leading the
investor group, told FTfm
in June.
The group is keen to get

more US retailers to sign up
to the plan, including Wal-
mart and Gap. Walmart has
faced renewed criticism
over factory safety in Bang-
ladesh on top of its refusal
to sign up to the binding
accord.

The Indian government
may have committed $1tn
to infrastructure spending
over the next five years, but
domestic and foreign non-
governmental investors
remain wary of the political
and economic bottlenecks
facing the country.

The rupee hit new lows
last month, pushing inves-
tors to re-examine their
exposure to Indian infra-
structure, just months after
3i, the UK private equity
investment group, decided
to end all infrastructure
investment in the country.

David Sloan, director of
the Asia arm for Eurasia
Group, a political risk con-
sultancy, says recent cur-
rency turmoil will only fur-
ther undermine confidence
that was already waning.
He says: “Even before the

current rupee crisis, private

investors were very wary
about Indian infrastructure.
How foreign investors will
now hedge against further
rupee devaluations is the
million dollar question.”
Sasha Riser-Kositsky, an

Asia researcher at Eurasia
Group, says the biggest hur-
dle for Indian infrastructure
is land.
The World Bank’s com-

petitiveness index shows
that it takes 295 days to
acquire a lease for public
land in India – twice the
global average – and 99
days to acquire private
land, versus a global aver-
age of 61 days.
India’s infrastructure

development record is also
poor. Historically just one
in four greenfield infra-
structure projects have
been completed on time.
Investing in Indian infra-

structure therefore “has the
potential to be an enormous
mess,” Mr Kositsky says.
A drop in foreign flows to

Indian private equity infra-
structure-related deals fur-
ther demonstrates the grow-
ing unease among private
investors about projects in
the country, according to
Mr Sloan.
He estimates that there

were 56 private equity deals
relating to infrastructure in
2010, worth roughly $31bn.
In 2012, this dropped to 30
deals worth roughly $850m.
“I imagine that in 2013 the
numbers will be way
down,” Mr Sloan says.
But despite this bleak

outlook, there are pockets
of opportunity for investors
willing to invest long term.
Tanmaya Misra, the

Mumbai-based manager of
JPMorgan’s Asian Infra-
structure fund, has avoided
greenfield projects that
expose investors to con-
struction risk altogether.
Instead, he has prioritised

projects that promote sus-
tainability and benefit local
communities in order to
mitigate the political and
regulatory risk of permits
being declined when
projects become unpopular
with local communities.
Mr Misra adds that

JPMorgan’s current invest-
ments in Indian infrastruc-
ture have been unaffected
by the recent currency
movements, as such fluctu-
ations tend to affect
projects in their building
phase when equipment
needs to be imported.
He also shakes off con-

cerns over India’s energy
market, which depends
heavily on oil imports.
Roads, for example, coun-
ter-intuitively benefit from
fuel price increases, as driv-
ers that usually opt for
longer, cheaper routes
instead take toll roads to
save on fuel costs.
Unless there is a severe

drop in gross domestic
product growth, which is
still at 4-5 per cent a year,
Mr Misra believes road traf-
fic will remain at a similar
level, to the benefit of
investors in road projects.

In a recent research
report, JPMorgan points
out that India’s urban popu-
lation is set to double to
500m by 2030. The urbanisa-
tion process in developed
countries, however, is likely
to come to an end, with
90 per cent of developed
populations already living
in cities.
With the city populations

likely to boom, urban
healthcare is consequently
another area Mr Misra has
honed in on, having
invested in two Indian
hospitals, including a
15,000-bed private facility in
Mumbai.
Mr Riser-Kositsky adds

that private sector ports are
another bright spot for
Indian infrastructure.
“There is substantial for-
eign interest in ports,
mainly because there is rec-
ognition by a number of big
multinationals that India
will need more coal
imports,” he says.
“Even if [India’s ports] do

not look good in the short
term, they do in the long
term, as India will import
coal from Australia and
Indonesia and export iron
ore when iron ore imports
ramp up again,” he adds.
Mr Misra expects care-

fully selected infrastructure
investments in India and
elsewhere in Asia to return
15-20 per cent a year net of
fees, based on current deal
underwriting by JPMor-
gan’s investment teams.

However, Eurasia’s Mr
Sloan remains unconvinced
by the “positive announce-
ments” from India’s govern-
ment regarding its commit-
ment and ability to attract
infrastructure spending.
Although the government

has recognised that infra-
structure investment is a
“huge problem” for the
country, doubts linger over
how rapidly administrative
change is taking place.
The government

announced that 36 stalled
infrastructure projects were
cleared in August, but other
reports suggest up to $3bn
of investment remains
blocked, according to Mr
Sloan.
He says: “The govern-

ment has set ambitious fis-
cal deficit targets and capi-
tal spending has been
slashed in a huge way.
“Because of that, the gov-

ernment will not be able to
meet its commitment for
infrastructure spending.
There is not much that is
positive to say on India at
the moment.”

USA all the way for JPMorgan

Fund of funds veteran Tony
Lanning is looking to the
US stock market to drive
the performance of his new
JPMorgan Fusion product
range.

The five multi-manager
funds, which avoid buying
individual companies and
instead focus on buying
other funds, were launched
in March to cater for a vari-
ety of risk appetites.

The JPMorgan Asset Man-
agement (JPMAM) range
includes Income, Conserva-
tive, Balanced, Growth and
Growth Plus, which takes
the highest levels of risk.

Mr Lanning, who was
once head of multi-manager
operations at Gartmore and
until recently ran funds at
Henderson Global Investors,
that group’s new owner,
says his initial portfolios are
characterised by a focus on
US equities.

“The US economy is in
rude health. US equities
have performed well – we do
need earnings growth to
come through for companies
to move on, but there is no
evidence that this won’t
happen,” he says.

The Fusion range’s US
equity exposure varies from
10 per cent in the lowest-
risk Income fund, to 43 per
cent in Growth Plus.

Holdings include
exchange traded funds that
track the S&P 500 and MSCI
USA indices of US shares.

The manager has also
invested in a number of
JPMAM’s funds, such as
Clare Hart’s £1.8bn US
Equity Income fund, and
has additionally bought into
the US Large Cap Equities
fund from Robeco, the
Dutch asset manager.

Mr Lanning is broadly
positive about equities on a
global basis, though he
remains more cautious on
Europe and Japan than
many of his peers.

In those two regions his
Fusion funds are neutrally
positioned, compared with
the basic strategic asset
allocation model set by
JPMorgan’s private bank
strategists.

“I am very aware that
when markets sell off,
Europe sells off more, and

there are still some bumps
along the road,” Mr Lanning
says.

“In Europe, we have
moved from underweight to
neutral. We have not gone
overweight yet, but we have
gone more cyclical with the
holdings we have.”

He admitted that having a
lower weighting towards
Japan than many of his
peers had been “a bit of a
headwind” so far in 2013, as
the nation’s markets rallied.

He maintains, however,
that the Japanese govern-
ment “still has some work
to do”.

Other star names backed
by Mr Lanning include

Hugh Young’s Aberdeen
Asia Pacific fund, which
makes up a significant por-
tion of each of the five
Fusion funds’ Asian equity
exposure, and Liontrust’s
Jan Luthman and Stephen
Bailey.

The duo’s Liontrust Macro
Equity Income fund features
in three of Mr Lanning’s
funds.

Within fixed income, Ian
Spreadbury’s Fidelity Mon-
eybuilder Income fund and
Bill Gross’s Pimco Total
Return bond fund feature
heavily in four of the five
portfolios, alongside the
JPMorgan Aggregate Bond
fund, run by Nick Gartside
and Iain Stealey, and
Pimco’s UK Corporate Bond
fund.

“In fixed income we have
a much lower duration –
about three years – than
most, but we are adding
duration a little,” Mr Lan-
ning says.

“It is clear interest rates
are going to rise, but not in
the next 12 months.

“There is a difference
between travelling and
arriving. Markets should
interpret tapering as a good
thing.”

BMO targets ‘aggressive
but achievable’ expansion

Canada’s BMO Global Asset
Management wants to
become one of the world’s
top 50 money managers by
2017 on the back of a series
of acquisitions in the US,
Hong Kong and London.

With assets of $130bn at
the end of April, BMO
ranked as the world’s 75th-
largest money manager, up
from 96th place in 2010.

But Rajiv Silgardo, co-
chief executive of BMO, pre-
dicts assets will grow to
more than $300bn over the
next three and a half years
as the fund house reaches
new clients through its
expanded geographic reach.

“Asset management really
is a key focus area [for the
wider Bank of Montreal
group],” says Mr Silgardo,

who spoke exclusively to
FTfm during a recent visit
to London.

Peter Routledge, an ana-
lyst at National Bank of
Canada, says BMO’s target
for asset growth is “aggres-
sive but achievable”.

Mr Routledge warns, how-
ever, that it would be hard
for BMO to meet its target
through organic growth
alone.

“The question is whether
BMO would dare to do a big
transformational deal or
remain cautious and pru-
dent,” he says, adding that
it could make more strategic
sense to pursue small
bolt-on deals.

Mr Silgardo, part of a 10-
strong team that joined
from Barclays Global Inves-
tors in 2009, says exchange
traded funds are a signifi-
cant plank of BMO’s expan-
sion plans.

ETF assets at BMO have
grown to $11.5bn at the end
of July since the launch of
the ETF arm four years ago.
Mr Silgardo says it took
years to build the infra-
structure to market ETFs

but that the business has
now gathered momentum,
pulling in $2.8bn of inflows
during the first seven
months of 2013.

Mr Silgardo says BMO
aims to differentiate itself
from other providers by
building sophisticated “out-
come-orientated strategies”
via ETFs.

It just launched six “man-
aged solutions” portfolios
that combine actively man-
aged funds and/or passively
managed ETFs, depending
on a clients’ risk appetite.

ETFs had made access to
a variety of investment solu-
tions cheaper, more trans-
parent and simpler, accord-
ing to Mr Silgardo.

“Rather than just using
ETFs to provide access to an
asset class, clients are ask-
ing if we can make their
investment strategies more
sophisticated, to lower port-
folio volatility and to gener-
ate more consistent streams
of income,” he says.

He adds that BMO had as
much ability to compete as
any other company in this
“second act” for ETFs, by

offering these more sophisti-
cated strategies to clients in
the US, Europe and Asia.

BMO has almost as large a
presence in the US as it does
in Canada after its 2011
acquisition of Marshall &
Ilsley, a Midwest banking
group.

BMO combined the acqui-
sition with Harris, a bank-
ing group it bought in 1984.
These deals have helped it
become the eighth-largest
bank by assets in North
America.

The Marshall & Ilsley deal
expanded BMO’s distribu-
tion capabilities in the US
significantly, which the
asset manager wants to har-
ness “more efficiently”.

John Aiken, an analyst at
Barclays, says that one of
BMO’s strengths in the US
is its private client group.
The purchase of M&I dou-
bled the number of BMO’s
wealthy US clients to
around 240,000, bringing fur-
ther scale to its operations
in this area.

“The economics are very
compelling if BMO can sell
more proprietary products

to these wealth clients,”
says Mr Aiken.

The fund group has also
been expanding in Asia and
sees “real opportunities” in
Europe, where large pools of
accessible capital exist,
according to Mr Silgardo.

In 2008, BMO bought Pyr-
ford, a London-based devel-
oped equity markets active
manager. And in 2011, it
completed the acquisition of
Lloyd George Management,
an emerging markets spe-
cialist based in Hong Kong.

BMO has long had a pres-
ence in China, stretching
back decades. It employs
about 500 staff in the coun-
try, mainly in trade finance
and capital markets activi-
ties. In 2012, it acquired a 20
per cent stake (the maxi-
mum permitted for a foreign

investor) in Cofco Trust, a
subsidiary of one of China’s
largest state-owned enter-
prises that is involved in
agriculture and financial
services.

BMO now intends to
expand its asset manage-
ment capabilities and is
planning to build an invest-
ment platform to offer its
investment products to
Asian clients.

“One of the first uses for
the investment platform
would be ETFs,” says Mr Sil-
gardo. A listing is planned
for 2014 after “going through
the necessary plumbing”.

“BMO has done exception-
ally well in building up its
ETF business in Canada and
it makes sense to try to rep-
licate that in Asia,” says Mr
Aiken.

But as ETFs become

increasingly popular, more
questions are being asked
about their risks.

Critics cite a number of
recent difficulties in trad-
ing ETFs as evidence that
problems in the industry’s
“plumbing” systems flare
up in periods of market
stress. They complain that
the rapid growth of the ETF
industry is concentrating
risks and could threaten
large scale market disrup-
tion.
ETF managers vehe-

mently dispute these
claims. They say that the
critics misunderstand how
ETFs perform and the bene-
fits they offer investors.
Mark Wiedman, global

head of iShares, the ETF
arm of BlackRock, the
world’s largest fund man-
ager, says ETFs acquitted
themselves “with flying
colours” in the latest bout
of market turmoil in late
May and June.
ETF activity tends to rise

significantly when market
volatility increases. Mr
Wiedman says that fact has
provided investors with
greater confidence that
ETFs are robust in periods
of stress.
He predicts that “ETFs

will play a much bigger role
in global capital markets as
both institutional and retail
investors become more
comfortable with advan-
tages offered by this new
technology”.
Global inflows into ETFs

(funds and products)
reached $148.5bn in the first
seven months of the year,
up 13.8 per cent compared
with the same period in
2012, according to ETFGI, a
consultancy.
The strength of the over-

all inflows is notable as it

has coincided with severe
weakness in two previously
vital drivers of the indus-
try’s growth, gold and
emerging markets ETFs,
where investors have with-
drawn more than $40bn so
far this year.
The US ETF market

remains the primary gener-
ator of growth, responsible
for almost 80 per cent of
global inflows this year,
helped by the S&P 500’s
rally to an all-time high.
Scott Ebner, global head

of product development and
research at State Street Glo-

bal Advisors, says some
observers describe the US
ETF market as mature but
it is still in a growth phase.
Mr Wiedman echoes this,

saying ETFs are becoming
the preferred vehicle of
choice for passive exposures
for both US financial advis-
ers and retail investors, out-
side 401k retirement plans.
“But there is much more

growth ahead. With $750bn
invested by US retail inves-
tors in ETFs compared with
their holdings of $10.2tn in
US active mutual funds,
ETFs still have a lot of

catching-up to do,” he says.
In the US, ETFs regularly

trade more than $60bn on a
daily basis, regularly
accounting for a quarter of
all US stock market activity
by value.
“ETFs are attractive to

both long-term holders due
to their low fees as well as
active traders because of
their tight spreads,” says
Phil Mackintosh, global
head of trading strategy at
Credit Suisse.
Critics argue that ETFs

linked to less liquid under-
lying assets, such as high

yield bonds, have not lived
up to their expected stand-
ards when volatility rises.
But industry participants

reject this charge.
“The costs of trading

some ETFs may be higher
in times of market stress.
But ETF trading takes place
in a highly competitive
environment and the addi-
tional utility that ETFs
offer via intraday trading is
extremely valuable,” says
Mr Ebner.
Mr Wiedman adds that

growing trading volumes
in fixed income ETFs dem-
onstrate that more inves-
tors want to transact in a
public marketplace where
prices are transparent
rather than via opaque
over-the-counter transac-
tions.
The industry’s rapid

growth is leading to
mounting competitive pres-
sures, particularly in the
US.
Providers loathe the sug-

gestion that they are fight-
ing a “price war” to secure
market share, aware that
their profit margins could
suffer if they cut charges
aggressively without a cor-
responding increase in
asset growth.
Most product launches,

however, are competitively
priced against established
rivals, as demonstrated
recently by Charles

Exchange traded funds

Deutsche Bank and
Lyxor have revamped their
business models to respond
to these new competitive
pressures.
“We expect to see more

managers from around the
world wanting to enter the
European ETF market to
offer investors access to a
wider range of expertise
from within the asset man-
agement community,” says
Matt Johnson, European
head of distribution at ETF
Securities, the London
based provider.
Asian ETF markets,

while at a much earlier
stage of development, are
also developing rapidly,
most clearly in China
where the process of liber-
alising capital markets has
led to a spate of new prod-
ucts being launched.
But other Asian coun-

tries are also innovating,
such as the Philippines
which has just started

accepting listing applica-
tions for ETFs.
As the industry develops,

it remains unclear just
how many of the large
existing array of sub-scale
ETFs have a sustainable
long-term future. A record
number of products closed
in the first half of the
year, suggesting a growing
realism among providers
that not every launch will
prosper.
Mr Mackintosh at Credit

Suisse notes that the
majority of assets are in
ETFs that have an expense
ratio less than 30 basis
points while trading is
heavily concentrated in
products with a bid-ask
spread less than 3bp,
underlining the cut-throat
level of competition.
With 4,883 exchange

traded funds and products
currently available, it
might appear that the lim-
its of innovation are being

Schwab’s new smart beta
range which undercut
established rivals.
In Europe, significant

changes are also afoot.
BlackRock, already the

largest player in Europe,
acquired Credit Suisse’s
ETF operations earlier this
year as part of a move to
boost its presence in Swit-
zerland. Warburg Pincus,
the private equity group,
has said it would like to
acquire ETF businesses in
Europe while Amundi, the
French asset manager, has
signalled its appetite to act
in any consolidation wave.
Vanguard has rapidly

accumulated more than
$1bn in assets just a year
after launching its first
European listed ETFs
while SSgA’s European
operations have picked up
pace and new entrants
such as First State are con-
tinuing to target the
region.

tested, as shown by the
sceptical reaction that fol-
lowed recent proposals for
a Bitcoin ETF.
However, as the strong

demand this year for cur-
rency hedged Japanese
equity ETFs has demon-
strated, even relatively
simple product innovations
can generate significant
inflows if they meet inves-
tors’ needs.
Mr Wiedman at iShares

points out that fixed
income markets remain rel-
atively untapped by ETFs.
“Assets held in fixed

income ETFs at just over
$300bn make up just a
small part of the $100tn
invested in bond markets
globally. But we expect to
see much greater adoption
as fixed income ETFs
develop greater liquidity
and bond-like analytics
become more readily avail-
able,” he says.
Another potentially rich

seam for exploitation lies
in advanced or smart beta
strategies that offer a dif-
ferent balance of risks and
returns than that attached
to conventional market
capitalisation products.
Advanced beta strategies

have been long used by
sophisticated institutional
investors but these man-
dates were frequently
undisclosed. Although the
smart beta term is some-
times misused, ETF flows
have given such strategies
much greater visibility.
Another unexplored area

lies with active ETFs. US
regulators recently lifted a
ban on the use of deriva-
tives in new ETFs, a move
which is expected to pave
the way for new products
Building momentum

among new users in differ-
ent investment strategies,
asset classes and regions,
the ETF revolution is
really only starting.

ETFs: time to call in the plumbers?

Plumbing problems, brokenpipes and blockages – itwould be easy to think
the exchange traded fund sector
had become the sewer of the
financial markets if critics of
ETFs were to be believed.
Indeed, proponents of the ETF

structure, which was once
perceived as simple and
transparent, believe the market
is under a sustained attack
from traditional asset managers.
ETFs’ cheerleaders believe

long-established fund houses
have looked on rather enviously
as global ETF assets have risen
to almost $2.2tn since the first
ETF was launched in 1993, and
are ever ready to go on the
offensive.
The latest assault started in

early summer when a spate of
redemptions caused disruptions
in the “plumbing” of several
ETFs, which in turn caused
many ETFs to tumble below the
value of their underlying assets.
Emerging-markets funds were

among the worst affected as
investors took fright that the
end of Federal Reserve
monetary easing would lead to
outflows from developing
countries.
The upshot was that on one

day at the end of June
Citigroup stopped accepting
orders to redeem underlying
assets from ETF issuers after
one trading desk reached its
allocated risk limits. State

Street also stopped accepting
cash redemption orders for
municipal bond products from
dealers.
Tim Coyne, global head of

ETF capital markets at State
Street, told the FT at the time
that his company had contacted
participants “to say we were
not going to do any cash
redemptions today” though
redemptions “in kind” were still
taking place. Jim Ross, State
Street’s global head of ETFs,
later wrote to investors: “In
recent weeks, articles
questioning the performance of
ETFs during periods of

increased market volatility have
painted an inaccurate picture.
This underscores the continued
need for ongoing education to
ensure investors and industry
observers understand how ETFs
are structured, traded and
regulated.” The tumble in asset
prices had, however, exposed
cracks in the pipework.
Terry Smith, chief executive

of Fundsmith and an ardent
critic of ETFs, told FTfm: “It is
not just the plumbing that is at
fault. These products are
misunderstood and very
probably mis-sold.” You cannot
make an underlying illiquid
asset liquid by putting it in a
wrapper and simply calling it
an ETF, he says.
Siu Kee Chan, an investment

manager at ING Investment
Management, adds that the
“plumbing issues” should mark
“the start of a move back to
basics” for ETFs. But are the
problems overblown? “Yes,”
according to Alan Miller, chief

investment officer of SCM
Private, an investment manager
that builds portfolios using
ETFs. “What other investment
industry offers thousands of
different products and yet none
have gone bust, or even had to
suspend its operations?
Considering the amazing
diversity of underlying assets
offered, it is quite an accolade
that investors have always been
protected,” he says.
He believes some providers of

traditional mutual funds are
exploiting the situation. “Most
commentators have failed to
consider what would have
happened if this situation was
mirrored within a mutual fund
with the same size and
proportionate outflows – would
it have met redemptions by the
next day? Would the fund have
been suspended?”
Patrick Dunne, head of global

markets and investments for
iShares, the world’s largest
provider of ETFs, adds: “At

times of extreme market stress,
any financial instrument can be
affected by structural
inefficiencies in the capital
markets. However, ETFs
continue to perform as they are
designed to do, allowing
investors to move quickly and
efficiently in and out of
investment exposures.”
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at Source,
the London based ETF provider,
agrees: “The suggestion that
there are fundamental problems
with the plumbing of the ETF
industry is totally inaccurate.”
ETF providers feel aggrieved,

but it is safe to assume the
fund structure is no longer as
simple as it was once claimed.
The Bank of England had
previously warned that the
risks associated with swap-
based ETFs, for example, were
not being made clear to
investors and that ETFs are
“characterised by increasing
complexity, opacity and
interconnectedness”.
A perhaps more measured

Peter Sleep, senior portfolio
manager at 7IM, offers some
final thoughts: “ETFs are not
simple but I think they are as
reasonably safe, or at least as
safe, as the underlying assets.
ETFs are like a glass bottles;
they can contain water or they
can contain nitroglycerine.
“They are as safe as the

contents. If you buy junk bonds
you should not expect
something that is safer than
junk bonds. You get what it
says on the tin,” adds Mr Sleep,
who sounds as if he has the
makings of being a good
plumber.

FINANCIAL TIMES MONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013 17

The exchange traded fund
market in Asia has been
growing rapidly over the
past decade. Industry
participants, however, say
there is much more to be
done in terms of investor
education if the market is
to mature.
The Asian ETF market

as a whole has grown to
some $150bn in size from
just $35bn a decade ago,
with currently about 550
products on offer,
compared with 35 then,
according to Jackie Choy,
Hong Kong-based ETF
strategist at Morningstar.
That growth is limited to

the bigger stock exchanges
in the region, however, as
Asian investors typically
gravitate to products that
have higher trading
volumes. This is driven by
the misbelief that the more
heavily-traded ETFs have
greater liquidity.
This posts “a huge

problem” for the smaller
exchanges, says Marco
Montanari, Hong Kong-
based head of passive asset
management for Asia
Pacific at Deutsche Asset
& Wealth Management
(DeAWM).
The Philippines, which is

in the midst of gearing up
for the advent of its first
batch of ETFs, may
potentially bear the brunt
of that liquidity
misconception.
“If investors in the

Philippines have the same
misconception of looking
for the most traded ETFs,
they will not buy in the
Philippines . . . they will
just look for ETFs listed in
Hong Kong or somewhere
else,” Mr Montanari says.
Even for the bigger ETF

markets, such as Japan,
Hong Kong, China and
South Korea, the lack of
understanding among
investors that the true
liquidity of an ETF lies in
its underlying investments
has been responsible for
drawing investors to
Europe or US-listed ETFs.

Mr Montanari takes the
view that for the Asian
ETF market to grow,
investors would have to
pile into locally domiciled
products in the region,
which are also more
advantageous for investors
themselves for tax and
timezone reasons.
Frank Henze, Hong

Kong-based head of ETFs
for Asia Pacific at State
Street Global Advisors,
agrees that a large amount
of Asian money is parked
in offshore vehicles.
In Japan, for instance, a

lot of investors are buying
into US-domiciled products
with underlying Japanese

investments, he says.
He also points out that

the Asian ETF arena is
multifaceted in terms of
the pace of growth,
product demand and
regulatory landscape in
different countries.
While Hong Kong stands

out with a focus on
providing access to China,
South Korea is unique in
that it has a robust retail
investor base with inverse
and leveraged products
being traded “very
rapidly”.
China and Japan,

meanwhile, are
domestically-oriented
markets, where there is
strong demand for
products with local
underlying investments, he
says.
For BlackRock’s iShares,

South Korea is one of the
markets that has shown
the strongest growth in the
preceding eight months,
with “a lot of institutional
usage” in its US-listed
products, says Jane Leung,
the company’s Hong Kong-
based head of Asia Pacific,
citing a $400m inflow from
a single insurer.
Ms Leung also believes

that investor education is
crucial for the growth of
the industry in Asia, where
the development of

onshore products is still in
a “very nascent” stage.
“It does take time for

liquidity to build,” she
says, citing the flagship
iShares FTSE A50 China
Index ETF in Hong Kong
as an example. That fund,
which was launched in
2004, “didn’t start taking
off until four to five years
later in terms of liquidity
and trading volume”.
BlackRock is also patient

about gaining steam with
its recently launched dim
sum bond ETF. The
iShares RMB Bond Index
ETF, which went public in
Hong Kong in June, is the
first offshore renminbi
bond ETF in Asia. The
launch generated much
talk in the industry amid
concerns over the low
liquidity of the offshore
renminbi bond market.
Ms Leung says the

trading volume of the
product has been low so
far but that is “expected”
as the fund is targeting
retail assets. “We’re going
through a lot of education
with the public in terms of
how this product works.
We expect it will take time
to build both the liquidity
and education for this
fund.”
In Asia, about 80 per

cent of ETF assets are
sourced from institutional
investors, with the rest
from the retail public,
industry participants
estimate.
DeAWM’s Mr Montanari

believes it will take at
least five to 10 years before
ETFs gain traction among
retail investors in Asia.
While making “huge
efforts” in educating
investors, he believes it is
“too soon” to target Asian
retail assets right now.
Vanguard, one of the

US’s biggest ETF
providers, is nonetheless
upbeat about its end goal
of penetrating the Asian
retail market with its low-

cost strategy. It listed its
first product in Hong Kong
in May, the Vanguard
FTSE Asia ex-Japan Index
ETF.
“We haven’t been here

that long, but we expect
that history will prove us
right: people will be more
and more fee-sensitive . . . it

tends to happen when the
market gets more mature,”
says Shelly Painter,
Vanguard’s Hong Kong-
based regional managing
director, pointing to the
company’s success in
attracting retail inflows in
the US. It considers
Japan, Hong Kong and

Singapore as core retail
markets, while China and
Taiwan offer more
opportunities in the
institutional space, she
says. “The industry is so
new in China, you’ll
probably see a quick shift
to ETFs from mutual
funds.”

Education
key to Asia
growth, say
providers

‘We haven’t been
here long but we
expect history to
prove us right:
people will be ever
more fee-sensitive’

$7.3m for allegedly market-
ing leveraged ETFs to small
investors without proper
due diligence. The broker-
ages were also ordered to
pay a total of $1.8m in resti-
tution to investors.
Also in May, brokerage

RBC Capital Markets
agreed to reimburse Massa-
chusetts investors up to
$2.9m and paid a $250,000
fine to state regulators for
selling leveraged ETFs to
inappropriate investors and

failing to train and super-
vise sales staff.
That was followed in Sep-

tember by the federal court
of Manhattan dismissing a
class-action lawsuit against
specialist ETF provider Pro-
Shares after thousands of
investors alleged the pro-
vider did not include warn-
ings about the products
being inappropriate for
most retail investors and
did not outline the risks of
holding the products for
longer than a day.
In May this year, Direx-

ion, another ETF specialist,
settled a similar $8m class
action lawsuit. Direxion did
not, however, admit any
wrongdoing in the settle-
ment.
Andy O’Rourke, manag-

ing director and chief mar-
keting officer at Direxion,

It takes a brave company to
launch an inverse or lever-
aged exchange-traded fund.
The products attracted
severe criticism following
the 2008 financial crisis and
have been the subject of a
number of multimillion dol-
lar lawsuits and regulatory
fines in the US over the
past couple of years.
They were even accused

by a Federal Reserve econo-
mist in August of contribut-
ing to market volatility dur-
ing the financial crisis and
European sovereign debt
crisis in 2011.*
But for the founders of

Boost ETP, a UK-based bou-
tique ETF provider that has
launched 36 such products
since starting up two years
ago, leveraged and inverse
ETFs have been unfairly
maligned.
“The products have done

exactly what they said they
were going to do,” says Nik
Bienkowski, co-chief execu-
tive and co-founder of
Boost. “Five or six years on,
the products are still the
same but the information
and education supporting
them is much better.”
Leveraged and inverse

ETFs are sophisticated
products that were designed
as short-term trading
instruments, rather than
for use by buy-and-hold
investors. Leveraged ETFs
make use of derivatives and
debt to provide professional
investors with returns of up
to three times an index, but
they can also deliver up to
three times the losses.
Inverse ETFs, meanwhile,

are designed to move in the

opposite direction to an
index. These can also make
use of leverage to amplify
the gains or losses. Profes-
sional investors often use
them for just a few days at
a time to bet on a particular
movement in the market.
But the problems

emerged for these products
when not-so-sophisticated
investors piled into them,
buoyed by the promises of
three times the returns of
traditional passive prod-
ucts. Many of these inves-
tors held on for too long
and watched in horror dur-
ing the financial crisis as
their expected magnified
gains turned into magnified
losses.
The problem became

more acute thanks to the
requirement for these prod-
ucts to be rebalanced daily,
meaning that the underly-
ing assets need to be
bought and sold to ensure
the funds replicate the cor-
responding index. The
result is that the products
do not perform well during
periods of choppy markets.
“The 2007-9 period was

the worst time for these
products to launch as it was
so volatile,” says Mr
Bienkowski. “These are not
the best funds to buy dur-
ing volatile periods, unless
you are checking on them
frequently. But that’s when
they were launched in the
US.”
Over the past few years

there have been a number
of US lawsuits and actions
by regulators where inves-
tors claim they were not
given enough information
about how these products
would perform and how
they should be managed.
In May last year, the

Financial Industry Regula-
tory Authority fined Wells
Fargo, Citigroup, Morgan
Stanley and UBS a total of

says: “The court cases are
behind us. There was never
a court ruling against the
products. Certainly some
people are realising that
these products aren’t for
them. Other people can
move forward knowing
that.”
While the providers of

inverse and leveraged ETFs
feel the reputation of their
products has been unfairly
damaged as a result of the
legal cases, they have
responded with more promi-
nent educational drives.
Boost provides factsheets

and other educational mate-
rial about the products on
its website to be used by
financial advisers if their
clients ask about them.
Meanwhile, Direxion has

an online course on its web-
site that takes 45 minutes to

complete and offers an
introduction to the funds.
“We have never had any

interest in seeing anyone
use them who should not be
investing in them,” adds Mr
O’Rourke. “If they do not
understand them, almost
certainly they will have a
bad time and are more
likely not to use them
again.”

Domenick Pugliese, a
partner in the corporate
practice of Paul Hastings,
adds: “The sponsors of
these products have done a
pretty good job of describ-
ing in their prospectuses
the pros and risks of the
products. The prospectuses
are clear.

Exchange traded funds

When it comes to exploring the
intricacies of the exchange traded
fund industry, it is all too easy to
get bogged down in the details of
who is winning and who is losing
market share.

At first glance, the data for 2013
paint a similar picture to previous
years, revealing iShares as the
provider flexing the most muscle in
terms of ETF assets globally with
over $820bn, according to figures
from ETFGI, a consultancy that
monitors trends in the industry.

With almost a 41 per cent share
of the global ETF market, the
BlackRock division is comfortably
ahead of its closest competitor,
SPDR ETFs, which has $346bn of
global assets.

It has also been a year in which
iShares, the world’s largest ETF
provider, got even bigger following
its acquisition of the ETF division
of Credit Suisse in January.

As a result of the deal, iShares
now commands 49.7 per cent of the
European market.

While iShares is some way ahead
of its competitors, a deeper delve
into the figures reveals that players
both large and small are embroiled
in a fierce battle for assets.

According to the ETFGI figures,
Vanguard topped net inflows on a
global basis to the end of July,
registering some $36.2bn. This
surpassed net new assets pulled in
by iShares, which registered
$32.5bn during the same period.

iShares has also seen its heels
nipped at in Europe. Although it is
still ahead of the pack with $10.6bn
of net new assets in Europe so far
this year, Source and Vanguard
were the next two providers to win
the biggest amount of assets with
$1.9bn and $1.4bn respectively.

However, it seems that placing
too much emphasis on where the
providers fall in the rankings is
unlikely to provide any clues as to
who will win the battle for assets
over the longer term.

“Everyone seems to focus on
where one provider ranks compared
with another, and they forget that
growth in the size of the ETF
market overall is the main factor
that will drive expansion,” says
Simon Klein, head of exchange
traded products, Emea and Asia at
Deutsche Asset & Wealth
Management.

Deutsche is currently Europe’s

second largest ETF provider with
$48.3bn of assets, according to
ETFGI figures.

“If the market as a whole is
expanding, then all providers’
businesses will expand accordingly.
Especially in Europe, there is a lot
of scope for the ETF market to
expand,” Mr Klein adds.

“A rising tide lifts all boats, so all
providers should see their
businesses grow.” Deutsche, which
last year moved its db X-trackers
unit into its asset and wealth
management arm, has also
benefited from strong investor
demand for physical ETFs.

According to ETFGI figures,
physical ETFs saw net inflows of
$12.6bn to the end of July,
compared to outflows of $2.7bn
from synthetic products.

Mr Klein says that “the move into
Deutsche Asset & Wealth
Management has tied in nicely with
our move to be a provider of
physical ETFs. The retail and
wealth markets in particular have
shown a preference for [physical]
replication, and we’re well
positioned to serve that demand.”

Strong preference for physical
ETFs has also led Lyxor, Europe’s
third-largest provider, to increase
the number of physical products
within its arsenal. The subsidiary
of Société Générale announced last
September that it would focus its
future product development efforts
on physical ETFs. As one of
Europe’s largest synthetic outfits,
Lyxor is no doubt hoping to see
assets flow into its new physical
range, particularly after synthetic
products haemorrhaged $2.7bn this
year to the end of July.

While providers have tweaked
their product line-ups in a bid to
win a greater share of business,
Lisa Kealy, financial services
partner at Ernst & Young, expects
most ETF assets to remain mainly
with the top five players.

“It is low margin, high volume, so
from a profitability perspective
scale is critical,” says Ms Kealy.

However, there may still be room
for new entrants such as Boost, the
leveraged provider launched in 2012
by former ETF Securities managing
partners Hector McNeil and Nik
Bienkowski. Although scale will
continue to be a critical factor for
success, new entrants providing
niche products “are the exception
to the rule”, says Ms Kealy.

Asset managers that do not
currently have an ETF arm, or are
losing assets to established players,
might think of launching an ETF
range to be defensive or compete,
adds Ms Kealy.

While new entrants can be
expected, Deborah Fuhr, managing
director at ETFGI, says the real
challenge for new ETF players will
be cracking distribution.

“You have to have good products
and distribution, and the ETF
ecosystem has to support you. It is
a challenging environment if you
are not a bank or broker,” says Ms
Fuhr. “If you are an asset manager
you can talk and educate, but at
the point of sale clients will still go
to a bank or a broker.”

Fierce battle for
assets continues

US financial advisers are now
as likely to allocate new
money from their clients to
exchange traded funds as
traditional mutual funds, clear
evidence of how ETFs are
progressing into mainstream
investment products used by
retail investors.

Almost three-quarters (73
per cent) of US advisers now
use ETFs, compared to 46 per
cent in 2007, according to a
recent report by Cogent
Research, a consultancy.

“ETFs are popular as they
help to lower costs,” says
Meredith Rice, senior product
director at Cogent. She
highlights the shift among US
advisers to a fee-based model,
where they are paid based on
the value of clients’ assets, as
focusing attention on costs.

Fran Kinniry, a principal
with Vanguard, the world’s
fourth largest fund manager,
says there has been a change
in the willingness of financial
advisers to use ETFs.

“Fund fees have become the
number one issue for financial
advisers to consider because
of the low returns that are
expected from stocks and
bonds in the next few years,”
says Mr Kinniry.

He adds that financial
advisers in the US, UK,
Canada and Australia are now
working to a fiduciary
standard as a result of
regulatory reforms so they are
required to invest clients’
money as carefully as their
own.

Mr Kinniry says this was a
“significant secular change”
and is likely to become a
global phenomenon.

Sweden has just announced
that it will examine fund
commissions and fees while
the Netherlands is expected to
ban “retrocession” payments
(inducements) to advisers for
asset management products
from January 2014.

Germany’s financial
regulator is also considering

its position on commission
payments and a Europe-wide
ban could follow the Mifid II
review.

Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of
the State Street Global
Advisors’ UK intermediaries
business group, says Europe
is heading in the same
direction as the US but there
are still fundamental
differences in the engagement
of financial advisers with
ETFs on both sides of the
Atlantic.

“There are still a lot of
hurdles to overcome before
ETF usage among financial
advisers in Europe reaches
the same level as in the US.
Building a unified retail
investor base for ETFs will be
much harder to achieve in
Europe than in the US,”
cautions Ms Hope-Bell.

The UK was the first big

market in Europe to introduce
a ban on commission
payments under the Retail
Distribution Review which
came into force at the start of
2013.

Mark Johnson, head of UK
sales at BlackRock’s iShares
unit, says he expects RDR to
be a “game changer”.

“We are already seeing
growing numbers of financial
advisers in the UK using
ETFs either in model
portfolios or by outsourcing
investment decisions to
discretionary fund managers
who use ETFs in their
portfolios,” says Mr Johnson.

That view is echoed by Ms
Hope-Bell.

“We are seeing financial
advisers’ interest in ETFs
growing via their increasing
use of model portfolios and
the trend for outsourcing of
portfolio management to
discretionary fund managers
who build ETF-only portfolios
or portfolios that mix ETFs
and traditional actively

managed mutual funds,” she
says.

UK investment managers
that are pitching for financial
advisers to outsource client
funds to ETF-only portfolios
include Evercore Pan-Asset
Management, SCM Private,
7IM and WorldTrack.

BlackRock recently
launched a UK version of its
iShares “connect” service,
which links financial advisers
to investment strategists that
make use of ETFs in their
portfolios. SCM Private, JM
Finn, Quartet and Thurleigh
Investment Managers have
signed up in the initial phase
of the UK “connect” rollout.

In the US, iShares is
tracking 110 ETF strategists
with $64bn in ETF assets.
This number is expected to
grow further as a three-year
record is required for
inclusion and new entrants
are continuing to join.

Edward Allen, a portfolio
manager at Thurleigh, the UK
wealth manager which uses
ETFs mainly for asset
allocation purposes, says: “We
are very focused on the cost
of managing money. Spreads
[dealing costs] on the largest
ETFs have become
vanishingly thin so they offer
very efficient trading and it is
possible to move substantial
chunks of capital in and out
of different asset classes with
ease.”

Ms Hope-Bell cautions that
one possible unintended
consequence of RDR may be
the emergence of an “advice
gap” if some retail investors
do not have sufficient assets
to justify paying a fee to a
financial adviser.

“This is potentially an
important issue for high street
banks and there is a great
deal of work to do in raising
the awareness of ETFs in this
category,” she says.

Mr Johnson notes that bank
distribution models in
continental Europe are
already being transformed by
ETFs. “We are seeing product
structures in banks
developing new investment
solutions with ETF-only
portfolios or using ETFs in
blend with index-based
products and active mutual
funds,” he says.

FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013 21

Smart beta exchange traded
funds have pulled in signifi-
cant assets this year, but
concern is brewing over
misuse of the “smart beta”
label as a marketing tool.
Recent estimates suggest

close to $6tn of institutional
assets could enter the smart
beta sector over the next
five years, and asset man-
agement companies want a
slice of the action.
US fund house Charles

Schwab launched six new
low-cost fundamentally
weighted ETFs last month,
HSBC Global Asset Manage-
ment created a suite of
alternative weighted indices
in July, and Deutsche Bank
recently stated the impor-
tance of smart beta strate-
gies to its asset growth.
But the rising popularity

of the smart beta label,
which refers to strategies
aiming to provide a better
risk/return trade-off than
traditional market-capitali-
sation weighted indices, has
led to its misappropriation,
critics fear.
Nick Blake, head of retail

at US passive fund house
Vanguard, says: “Unfortu-
nately within what is
known as the smart beta
sector, there are some prod-
ucts attaching themselves
to the label because it is
fashionable.
“We are not anti this

stuff, we just want inves-
tors to be clear what they
are buying when these
terms are used – it is a
lovely marketing label.”
Mr Blake is not alone in

recognising the “fad mar-
ket” reputation smart beta
has gained.

Jan Kvarpil, portfolio spe-
cialist at ING Investment
Management, says smart
beta strategies are cur-
rently the “hot topic” of the
moment within the ETF
industry, while Alan Miller,
chief investment officer of
SCM Private, a wealth man-
ager that invests solely via
ETFs, describes smart beta
as the industry’s “latest
fashion”.
Even some of the best-

known providers of smart
beta products want to dis-
tance themselves from the

term. BlackRock prefers to
use “new beta”, rival US
passive fund provider State
Street opts for “advanced
beta”, while European ETF
house Source touts “beta
plus” funds.
Worryingly, Mr Miller

estimates that 50 per cent of
so-called smart beta ETFs
do not involve more intelli-
gent investment processes,
but instead use “smart mar-
keting” to justify high fees
under the guise of smart
beta when they are rela-
tively simple utility, value
or small-cap focused prod-
ucts.
“Of course there are some

[smart beta ETFs] based on
logic, common sense and a
long back-test, but as the
smart beta bandwagon

grows, these are set to
become the minority rather
than the rule,” Mr Miller
says.
Vanguard’s Mr Blake is

more concerned by some of
the niche strategies being
funnelled into smart beta
products. “There are some
very active bets going after
a particular slice of the
market, such as indices
around land mass,” he says.
He adds: “The more

minute the size of the mar-
ket, the greater the risk.
This whole concept of smart
beta is probably a more
transparent version of the
active quant strategies
which blew up at the time
of the [financial] crisis.”
Even proponents of the

smart beta industry
acknowledge that certain
strategies are a source of
concern. Richard Hannam,
head of global equity beta
solutions at State Street,
says some ETFs in the
smart beta universe are “a
bit of a black box”.
But he believes investors

should be able to distin-
guish between dubious
strategies and those that
make sense.
He says: “Just because

someone has partnered
with an index provider [to
create a smart beta ETF], it
does not mean the investor
should suspend belief. It
should be very easy to see
what the rules are and how
they work. If it isn’t, we
would be concerned.”
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at
Source, adds that the smart
beta label still has merit.
“Any concept can be
hijacked and turned into a
gimmick, but as a concept
smart beta has a niche to
fill in between pure beta

and alpha strategies,” he
says.
Demand for this niche

has translated into strong
flows for some of the estab-
lished players in the smart
beta ETF sector. Black-
Rock’s four US-domiciled
minimum volatility ETFs,
for example, have gathered
more than $2.6bn of new
assets this year, compared
to $745m over the same
period in 2012.

Mr Lytle similarly says
that smart beta type prod-
ucts accounted for 50 per
cent of Source’s inflows last
year. “Clients clearly value
receiving more than just
pure beta exposure in the
ETF format,” he says.
And there is widespread

consensus that these strong
asset flows are set to last.
Bruno Poulin, chief exec-

utive of French ETF house
Ossiam, expects the wider

ETF market to grow at an
annual rate of 30 per cent,
but he believes smart beta
assets under management
can grow 60 per cent a year.
Although some fund

groups have made signifi-
cant headway in accumulat-
ing assets in smart beta
strategies, it is not too late
for other players to enter
the sector.
Nizam Hamid, an inde-

pendent index consultant

currently working at FTSE
Group, says: “There are
always new research tech-
niques and different ways
of looking at particular fac-
tors – [smart beta] is not a
dead area.”
The consultant adds: “I

don’t think this is a fad,
and I don’t think it will die
away. Smart beta has
opened a whole world of
opportunities for people to
look at different strategies.”

The fee war effectively
started by Vanguard has
drawn in iShares and State
Street, but rather than esca-
lating, it now appears
headed for a stalemate.
“The race to the bottom

will ultimately reach some
sort of bottom, and in terms
of the plain vanilla cap-
weighted beta space, it’s
very near the bottom,” says
Ben Johnson, director of
passive fund research at
Morningstar.
In the US, where price

competition has been
fiercest, exchange traded
funds’ asset-weighted total
expense ratios averaged 0.27
per cent at the end of July,
down 6 basis points from
three years earlier but just
1 basis point lower than a
year earlier, according to
data from ETF consultancy
ETFGI.
Vanguard has harnessed

the discount trend as much
as anyone, garnering indus-
try-leading first half inflows
of $28.8bn and ranking a
close second last year to

market share leader
iShares, despite having
fewer than a quarter as
many ETFs listed.
The company has histori-

cally kept fees low through
its non-profit mutual owner-
ship structure, unique in
the ETF industry. Last
year, however, it went on
the pricing offensive by
switching 22 of its index
funds to lower-cost bench-

marks from FTSE Group
and the University of Chi-
cago’s Center for Research
on Security Prices (CRSP), a
largely unknown provider.
Aside from passing on

savings from its growing
asset base and improved
index tracking, Vanguard’s

fee-cutting knife drawer is
now all but empty, says
Daniel Wiener, editor of the
Independent Adviser for
Vanguard Investors news-
letter.
“It’s clear that whatever

they’re paying CRSP is
almost next to nothing, if
not nothing, because in
essence they’re putting
CRSP on the map,” says Mr
Wiener, who is also chair-
man and chief executive of
advisory firm Adviser
Investment Management.
“It’s pretty hard to cut your
costs below nothing.”
He says Vanguard will

never abandon its licensing
contracts with Russell
Indexes and S&P Dow Jones
Indices because of their for-
midable brand recognition.
Long a fee war holdout,

iShares responded to Van-
guard’s ETF market share
ascent with the launch of a
buy-and-hold “core” ETF
series, including some
funds that undercut corre-
sponding Vanguard ETFs
on price. State Street Global
Advisors, the second-big-
gest provider, has also been
shaving fees strategically.
In July, it undercut three
iShares broad market ETFs
on price by switching its
ETFs’ benchmark indices,
while simultaneously
launching a small-cap ETF
also drastically underpric-
ing an iShares ETF track-
ing the same index.
More extensive cuts, how-

ever, seem unlikely in part
because both iShares and
SSgA lack Vanguard’s non-
profit structure.
Moreover, the financial

advisers that flocked to
ETFs initially for their low
expense ratios are begin-
ning to recognise that ETF
costs also take the form of
bid-ask spreads and track-
ing error, says Dave Mazza,
head of ETF investment
strategy at SSgA.
“Now that investors, and

particularly advisers, have
been using ETFs for some
time, and there has been
compression on the expense
ratio side, what they’re say-
ing is . . . the overall total
cost of ownership for my
client may be worse even
though the headline
[expense ratio] number
looks better,” he says.
Rather than discounts,

increasingly ETF providers
are touting fuller service
offerings, be it through
adviser outreach, educa-
tional campaigns or user-
friendly websites. “The
resounding chorus has been
there’s a need for greater
education, and that doesn’t
come at zero cost,” says
Deborah Fuhr, managing
partner at ETFGI. “ETFs
are already very cost-effi-

cient, and if you’re going to
pay for education and other
things, you need to leave
some margin in there for
marketing and other sales
support.”
Eating costs is certainly

within the realm of possibil-
ity. Mutual fund managers
have been subsidising
money market funds for
years amid rock bottom
interest rates. Charles
Schwab, one of the bigger
money fund backstoppers,
is by all accounts also bank-
rolling its low cost ETF
suite, having pared its aver-
age overall TER to an
industry low of 7.2 basis
points.
Schwab is a special case,

however, because those
drastic discounts can be off-
set by other means, such as
the brokerage volume the
ETF traffic helps generate,
says Marie Chandoha, presi-

dent and chief executive at
Charles Schwab Investment
Management. “We are part
of a large organisation that
makes money in a number
of ways; not every company
can say that,” she says. “As
a result, we are able to take
risks, make bets, try new
things and make trade-offs
to benefit our clients and
our bottom line.”
Still, Schwab’s synergies,

no less than iShares’ econo-
mies, have their limits, and
once they are reached, the
fee war will end, though the
performance war will rage
on. “It’s an evolving indus-
try, and that’s usually
where it evolves to: price
gets standardised,” says
Richard Keary, principal of
the consulting firm Global
ETF Advisors. “Then it’s
about quality and perform-
ance, which probably is
where it should be.”

Performance will replace
price as weapon of choice

In an industry that increas-
ingly stands accused of
being stuck in a rut, the
Winkle wrinkle ETF took
many by surprise.
Named for the brothers

behind it, the Winklevoss
twins, the proposed
exchange traded product is
no regular equities tracker.
Instead, the pair filed

paperwork with US regula-
tors for an ETF that would
track the arguably illiquid,
crypto-currency known as
Bitcoin.
This ETF looks unlikely

to reach the market
because of regulatory con-
straints among other prob-
lems, but it is a novel idea
in an industry said to be
seeing less and less product
innovation.
Detlef Glow, head of

Emea research at Lipper,
attributes a fall-off in inno-
vation to the industry
maturing. There are now
“fewer white spots” offering
the opportunity to create
pioneering products, he
says. “The more mature the
industry becomes, the less
innovative in terms of prod-
ucts it will be,” he adds.
The result is fewer new

funds – 238 ETFs and ETPs
were launched globally in
the first half of 2013, com-
pared to 553 during the
same period in 2010, figures
from consultancy ETFGI
show.

Of the products launched,
many focused on traditional
asset classes – more than
half were equity ETFs,
according to ETFGI.
Providers say they are

simply meeting investor
demand. Equity products
are hugely popular – the
SPDR S&P 500 continues to
be the best-selling ETF glo-
bally.
Innovation, says Reginald

Browne, managing director
of the ETF team at Knight
Equity Markets, is all well
and good, but there has to
be investor demand for the
product – and the asset
class.
For this reason, even if

the Bitcoin ETF were
launched it is doubtful
investors would snap it up,
says Mr Browne. “Largely

the Bitcoin is a relatively
new asset class and I’m not
sure now is the time for an
ETF to come out,” he adds.
Michael John Lytle, chief

development officer at
Source, says if there is not
“explicit client demand” for
an ETF, it is likely to fail.
“The investment land-

scape is littered with good
ideas that were too far
ahead of their time or that
were not delivered in a
form that was compelling to
investors,” he adds.
However, investors

appear to be warming to
asset classes other than
equities. Fixed-income ETFs
– often considered more
groundbreaking in an
industry that has tradition-
ally focused on equities –
saw some of the highest
inflows of new products
this year, says ETFGI.
The Vanguard Total

International Bond and the
BMO Mid-Term US IG Cor-
porate Bond Index ETFs
both featured among the 10
best-selling new ETFs glo-
bally in the seven months
to July.
Although fixed income

products account for only
15.5 per cent of new ETFs
and ETPs so far this year,
Mr Glow expects more in
the coming years.
Mr Lytle adds: “There is

also a lot of room for inno-
vation in fixed income both
because of the breadth of
the asset class and the
potential to tap into tradi-
tional fixed-income inves-
tors who are not yet using
ETFs.”
Another asset class that

Source has looked at is mas-
ter limited partnerships. An
MLP is a corporate struc-
ture that is publicly traded
and derives most of its cash
flows from real estate, natu-
ral resources and commodi-
ties. Source’s US Energy
Infrastructure MLP, which
launched this summer, has
seen moderately strong
interest, raising more than
$115m in its first two
months.
Elsewhere, Stephen

Cohen, chief investment
strategist for BlackRock
fixed income and iShares
Emea, says there are oppor-
tunities for innovation
within smart beta – ETFs
based on alternative indices
and which apply different
weighting methods to
stocks.
“Investors are investing

in new beta ETFs, such as
minimum volatility ETFs,
to enhance risk-return,” he
says. In Europe, Mr Cohen
says four iShares minimum
volatility ETFs, launched at
the end of 2012, gathered
more than $256m in the six
months to June.
He adds: “New beta strat-

egies in the equity and
income space, as well as
building block completion
in the fixed-income space,

bring the biggest opportuni-
ties for product develop-
ment at the moment.”
At Amundi, currency-

hedged products are under
the spotlight, says Valerie
Baudson, managing director
ETF and index solutions. Its
Japan Topix Eur Hedged
Daily ETF has had inflows
of €500m since being
launched last October.
“My conviction is the cur-

rency-hedged ETF, which

has been very successful,
will remain a growing area
of innovation,” says Ms
Baudson.
Her views are echoed by

Manooj Mistry, head of
exchange traded products
for Emea at Deutsche Asset
& Wealth Management.
DeAWM has a number of
currency-hedged ETFs,
including a euro-hedged
MSCI Japan ETF. It plans
to roll out more of them

over the coming months.
Mr Mistry believes the

industry is still seeing
plenty of innovation, citing
the example of DeAWM’s
MSCI Pakistan ETF,
launched last summer.
“The innovation here is
that you are opening up
quite a difficult market to
access,” he says.
He adds: “[The industry]

doesn’t have the same rate
of growth in the products as

we had in the early stages
of the market, but I think
we will still see new prod-
ucts being brought out.”
But are new products

really innovative? Mr Glow
is not convinced. “The ques-
tion now is what do you
call an innovation? So a
gold short ETF, is that a
product innovation? It is a
new product, but it is not
innovation as you would
expect,” he says.

Genuine novelty is ever harder to come by

matures, a Bitcoin
ETF may be a leap

are not innovations



24 FINANCIAL TIMESMONDAY SEPTEMBER 9 2013

Believe it or not, there used
to be a time when the $2tn
exchange traded fund
industry did little to attract
the kind of scrutiny that
has been piled on it by glo-
bal regulators in recent
years.
Compared to their hedge

fund and active manager
counterparts, the traits of
transparency, liquidity and
low costs vaunted by ETF
providers made them seem
like the good guys.
Fast forward a few years

on from the start of the
financial crisis, and it is
probably easier to count on
one hand the number of
regulators that have not
taken a swipe at ETFs in
one way or another.
Despite some unwanted

attention, many believe it
was only a matter of time
before regulators started to
take more interest in what
was going on under the
bonnet of the ETF industry.
“Globally, over the past

few years regulators have
taken a very close look at
the way ETFs are created,
managed, traded and sold,”
says Scott Ebner, global
head of product develop-

ment at State Street Global
Advisors.
“Given the growth of the

industry, and the number of
products now available to

investors, it is not surpris-
ing that regulators are tak-
ing a closer look to ensure
products are sound and well
understood by investors.”
The Financial Stability

Board, set up after the
financial crisis, and which
represents central banks
and regulators, was one of
the first regulatory bodies
to lay into the ETF industry
in 2011.
The FSB said it had con-

cerns about “a number of
disquieting developments”
in the ETF industry, which
it said “call for closer scru-
tiny”.
It claimed that by stray-

ing from their traditional
plain vanilla focus, ETFs
had moved into credit,
emerging markets and com-
modities – typically areas
where liquidity is thinner
and transparency lower.
The increased popularity

of synthetic ETFs, as well
as the more intensive
recourse to securities lend-
ing by providers of physical
ETFs “raises new chal-
lenges in terms of counter-
party and collateral risks”,
added the FSB.
Not long after the FSB,

the International Organiza-
tion of Securities Commis-
sions launched a global
study to examine the sys-
temic risks posed by ETFs.
For its part, the Bank of

England’s Financial Policy
Committee also flagged up
the products as a signifi-
cant source of concern.
Patrick Dunne, head of

global markets and invest-
ments at iShares, says:
“ETFs have become more
prominent in recent years,
and it is appropriate for reg-
ulators to make sure they
fully understand invest-
ment vehicles that are
becoming more and more
popular with investors.”

The US Federal Reserve is
among the latest to take
aim at ETFs. It warned in
August that trading activity
by leveraged ETFs during
periods of high volatility
could trigger a crash in the
US stock market.
Ted Hood, chief executive

officer of Source, adds that
an industry trusted to take
investors’ money in order to
generate returns should

expect some degree of scru-
tiny.
“The industry continues

to grow and you cannot
complain about scrutiny.
You have to accept it if you
are trusted to take people’s
money,” says Mr Hood.
“The industry will do fine

and it’s better to have peo-
ple buying products who
know more about the prod-
ucts than they did three
years ago. We feel more
comfortable with clients
that have looked under the
hood and know what they
are buying.”
Many ETF providers

accept that regulators will
want to delve deeper into
the inner workings of the
industry, but those doing
the scrutinising have failed
to explain their motives,
says Mr Hood.
“What is lacking is the

policy saying who regula-
tors are trying to protect,

and what it is they are try-
ing to achieve,” says Mr
Hood.
“Are they saying they do

not want investors to buy
into certain asset classes or
have money locked up?”
ETF providers in Europe,

particularly those offering
synthetic products, have
arguably received the most
scrutiny.
Last year, the Paris-based

European Securities and
Markets Authority con-
ducted a widespread review
of the industry after con-
cerns that more complex
ETFs, such as those
employing derivatives,
could pose a risk to retail
investors, along with jeop-
ardising the reputation of
the European mutual fund
Ucits brand.
Mr Dunne says that “cer-

tain concerns raised by reg-
ulators” over products car-
rying different risks to
physical products “may be
legitimate”.
However, rather than

introducing a complete
overhaul of sales and trad-
ing practices of synthetic
ETFs as many were expect-
ing, the final Esma guide-
lines were presented as
measures addressing the
entire Ucits universe.
The toughest demand

made of ETF providers was
a change to their practices
around disclosure and secu-
rities lending, and introduc-
ing product identifiers.
While the uncertainty in

the run-up to the Esma
guidelines caused a number
of synthetic providers to
bleed assets, some believe
the process may have been
worth it.
Lisa Kealy, a partner at

Ernst & Young, says:
“Many feel the regulatory
scrutiny has been a cleans-
ing process for ETFs.”

Watchdogs on the scent of the money
Regulation
David Ricketts
says it was only a
matter of time
before a maturing
and complex sector
attracted scrutiny

Taking aim: the Fed warned in August that trading by leveraged ETFs could trigger a crash in the US stock market Bloomberg

‘As the industry
continues to grow
you cannot
complain about
scrutiny. You have
to accept it if you
are trusted to take
people’s money’

Investment Funds.
Compiled with the assistance of the
IMA. The Investment Management
Association, 65 Kingsway, London
WC2B 6TD. +44 (0)20 7831 0898. All
funds within this section, whether
OEICs or unit trusts are authorised in
the UK by the Financial Services
Authority. The prices quoted should
only be used as a guide.
OEIC: Open­Ended Investment
Company. Similar to a unit trust but
using a company rather than a trust
structure.
Share Classes: Separate classes of
share are denoted by a letter or
number after the name of the fund.
Different classes are issued to reflect a
different currency, charging structure
or type of holder.
Buying price: Also called offer price.
The price at which units in a unit trust
are bought by investors. Includes

manager’s initial charge.
Selling price: Also called bid price.
The price at which units in a unit trust
are sold by investors.
Single price: Based on a mid­market
valuation of the underlying
investments. The buying and selling
price for shares of an OEIC and units
of a single priced unit trust are the
same.
Exit Charges: The letter E denotes
that an exit charge may be made
when you sell units, contact the
manager/operator for full details.
Time: The time shown alongside the
fund manager’s/operator’s name is the
time of the unit trust’s/OEIC’s
valuation point unless another time is
indicated by the symbol alongside the
individual unit trust/OEIC name.
The symbols are as follows: ✠ 0001
to 1100 hours; ♦ 1101 to 1400 hours;
▲1401 to 1700 hours; # 1701 to
midnight. Daily dealing prices are set
on the basis of the valuation point, a
short period of time may elapse before

prices become available.
Yield: Funds comprising mainly of
bonds normally quote a gross
redemption yield after all charges but
before tax has been deducted. Funds
mainly made up of equities normally
quote a yield representing the
estimated annual payout net of tax for
basic rate taxpayer. For further
information contact the management
company.
Historic pricing: The letter H denotes
that the managers/operators will
normally deal on the price set at the
most recent valuation.
The prices shown are the latest
available before publication and may
not be the current dealing levels
because of an intervening portfolio
revaluation or a switch to a forward
pricing basis. The managers/operators
must deal at a forward price on
request, and may move to forward
pricing at any time.
Forward pricing: The letter F denotes
that that managers/operators deal at

the price to be set at the next
valuation. Investors can be given no
definite price in advance of the
purchase or sale being carried out.
The prices appearing in the newspaper
are the most recent provided by the
managers/operators. Scheme
particulars, prospectus, key features
and reports: The most recent report,
scheme particulars, prospectus and
key features document may be
obtained free of charge from fund
managers/operators.

I have no insideknowledge on whetherJanet Yellen or Larry
Summers is most likely to
be given the job as the next
chairman of the Federal
Reserve. It is not an
exaggeration to suggest,
however, as many
commentators have already,
that this is probably the
most important
appointment that President
Obama is likely to make in
his second term.
If the media are to be

believed, the White House
is pushing the claims of
the imperious Mr Summers
over those of Ben
Bernanke’s deputy, even
though the former will face
the tougher ride at Senate
confirmation hearings.
It would be fascinating

to listen in on the
president’s discussion of
the issue. History has
spoiled us – no, make that
appalled us – by allowing
us to listen in, courtesy of
the Nixon tapes, on the
discussions that went on in
the White House about its
relationship with Arthur
Burns, the chairman of the
Fed during the Nixon era,
and the man widely
blamed since for letting
inflation get out of hand in
the aftermath of the
Vietnam war.
At the time of his

nomination in 1969, Mr
Burns had a secure
reputation as an academic
economist. But he was also
a longstanding Republican
sympathiser who had
known Mr Nixon for a
number of years, and had
given him advice in the
run-up to the 1960 election
campaign that Nixon lost.
According to Mr Nixon, Mr
Burns had called him in
March 1960 to warn him
that the economy was
likely to dip before the
election in November and
“urged [him] strongly that
everything possible be
done to avert this
development”.
After Mr Nixon had

successfully nominated Mr
Burns, he took a typically
poor stab at humour
during the welcoming
ceremony in the White
House. He noted that while
“as you all know” the Fed
was independent of the
White House, the president
also had strong views on
the economy, which he
intended to convey to the
chairman in forceful terms.

He concluded: “I respect
his independence. However
I hope that independently
he will conclude that my
views are the ones that
should be followed.”
This clumsy opening

turned out to be anything
but a joke. Over the next
three years Mr Burns was
subjected to a series of
subtle and not so subtle
attempts to cajole him into
following the president’s
wishes on the economy –
those pressures increasing
as his re-election campaign
in 1972 approached. It
included blocking Mr
Burns’ recommendations
on new members of the
Fed’s open market
committee, leaking
unhelpful stories to the
media, and threatening
him that he would not be
re-elected, while urging
him to loosen monetary
policy all the time.
Although Mr Burns and

other economists of the
day, including Milton
Friedman, warned Mr
Nixon about the risks of
loosening monetary policy
prematurely, in due course

the Fed did just that, with
disastrous consequences.
In the end it was left to

Paul Volcker, Fed
chairman under President
Jimmy Carter from 1979, to
wring inflation out of the
US economy, which then
ushered in a long period of
economic advance, albeit at
a huge cost in terms of
unemployment. At least
one recent academic study
has sought to defend Mr
Burns against some of the
harshest critics, arguing
that the policy measures
the Fed adopted at the
time were not
unreasonable, given the
unprecedented conditions
and the state of economic
understanding at the time.
The blame for the
hyperinflation of the 1970s
cannot be laid solely at the
Fed’s door.
The challenges facing the

Fed today are also
however, undeniably,
unprecedented, even if
they are of a completely
different nature. No central
bank has ever had to steer
an economy out of a
financial crisis on the scale
of 2008. None has ever
presided over such an
enormous programme of
asset purchases as the
world’s central banks

currently have in place.
None has had to test the
limits of monetary policy
in a zero interest rate
environment in real life, at
a time when
unemployment remains
high by historical
standards and outstanding
debt is at unprecedented
levels. The new chairman
will to some extent

inevitably be flying blind
in this tricky environment.
In a recent issue of The

New York Review of
Books, Mr Volcker makes a
strong case for the
importance of the central
bank acknowledging the
limitations of monetary
policy and effectively
warns the central bank
against the dangers of

being dragged by the
ambiguities of its dual
mandate into going soft on
inflation. Few presidents,
fortunately, have displayed
such crude and obsessive
political instincts as Mr
Nixon – it is certainly hard
to think of Mr Obama
talking about “goosing the
money supply” – but we
all have to hope that the

next chairman, in addition
to possessing good
judgment and effective
communication skills, will
be as sensitive to the
subtler modern risks of
political pressure as his or
her hapless predecessor
proved not to be.

So while we might obsess over the pursuit of happiness, knowing how unhappiness works is... important for our well-being, too. In an op-ed for the New York Times, American Enterprise Institute president Arthur C. Brooks explains the difference:  As strange as it seems, being happier than average does not mean that one can’t also be unhappier than average. One test for both happiness and unhappiness is the Positive Affectivity and Negative Affectivity Schedule test. I took the test myself. I found that, for happiness, I am at the top for people my age, sex, occupation and education group. But I get a pretty high score for unhappiness as well. I am a cheerful melancholic.
