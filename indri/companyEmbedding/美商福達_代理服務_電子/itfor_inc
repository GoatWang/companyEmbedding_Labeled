Every day, you’re surrounded by silent skin agers caused by a combination of sun and pollution that pose a constant threat to healthy-looking skin. These atmospheric aggressors include UVA/UVB rays, Infrared (IR-A), and ozone (O3) pollution. They induce free radical damage which visibly manifests as fine lines, wrinkles, sagging skin, and discoloration.

Rest assured how you treat everyone in a business is noticed and it has meaning.

Although he had been rude to my receptionist on the phone when trying to make an appointment and had refused to expand on what he was selling, I agreed to see a very persistent advertising salesman, mainly to stop him bugging the receptionist.
When he was led into my office, he turned on his 'salesman's pitch', all sugar and spice, he was very polite, incredibly attentive and his product was quite good. Even though I was wary because my staff had said he had been quite rude, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided to buy from him.
After he had left several of my team came in and complained about how he had treated them when he had come into the office for his appointment. He was hostile, overly familiar and totally inappropriate. That was it for me. I didn't care how good his product was, I didn't want anything to do with him or his company. I rang him and told him, only to receive a torrent of abuse before he slammed down the phone.
If I am not sure about a person I always ask my team what they think. I ask them how the person acted when making their appointment, how they treated the staff. I put a lot of stock in how people treat my staff and I make no allowance for arrogance.
Many a sales deal has been killed because rude sales people treat only the decision maker with respect. My philosophy is to treat everyone in a business as a decision maker because, in reality, they all influence the outcome in some shape or form. It all comes back to respect and we soon see through someone who only turns on the charm when they get in front of the boss to sell them something.

Expect your online sales to rise with the help of these tools.

In the United States, ecommerce accounts for 8.5% of total revenues in retail, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. Experts expect online sales to continue rising, with Forrester predicting that ecommerce's average annual growth rate of 9.32% will hold steady through 2020.
If you want to make the most of your brand's presence online, however, you have to be active on, and optimized for, multiple channels. Price comparison engines, social commerce options, mobile apps, multi-site product aggregators and marketplace platforms are all enormous drivers of sales. The 18 largest marketplaces alone account for some 44% of the world's ecommerce sales, according to data from Digital Commerce 360.
But none of this matters if your brand can't provide a consistent, unified customer experience across all those of those channels. Keeping it all in sync is hard from many perspectives, including order fulfillment, branding assets, product information, shipping logistics and inventory management.
Trying to do it all alone, or even with a dedicated team, can spread merchants too thin. These tools can help.
 Create a Seamless Omni-Channel Presence
BigCommerce provides a single hub for all your sales channels. In addition to its ecommerce website management tools, the platform integrates with Google Shopping, Amazon, Facebook, eBay and Pinterest. It connects your inventory to all your marketplaces, social media and point of sale solutions. You can manage sales across all channels with automatic syncing, allowing you to optimize inventory, avoid errors and skip cumbersome manual data entry.
BigCommerce's integrations with multiple POS systems like Square and ShopKeep mean you can also use it to sell in person. Merchants can save time, because everything is managed from a central location, making it easier to manage the backend of ecommerce, so you can focus on other aspects of running your business.
 Provide Stellar Multi-Channel Support
When you connect with customers on multiple channels, it can be difficult to keep up with customer service and support. Freshdesk makes it easy to manage all your customer support conversations from one place, regardless of which channel the customer chooses to use to initiate a support request.
Freshdesk includes email ticketing, a built-in phone channel (that saves you from upfront costs and hardware installations associated with a traditional call center), live chat, and a feedback widget that can be installed anywhere your customers are looking for help. It also includes channels for social media support, available for Facebook and Twitter, so you can keep track of when customers are mentioning you there, and address their questions and concerns. The central platform saves time and effort, and helps improve customer satisfaction.
 Engage With a Branded Mobile App 
Since more internet traffic comes from mobile devices than desktops these days, it makes sense to connect with customers via mobile. Shopgate makes it easy for ecommerce companies to create branded mobile apps for customers. This platform allows you to create mobile websites, apps for iPhone and iPad, and Android apps, too. It's great for incentivizing loyalty via coupons, QR codes in ads and push notifications for daily deals.
You can create a custom app with absolutely no coding knowledge, saving time and money compared to hiring a mobile app developer to handle it for you. Plus, Shopgate integrates with 60 leading ecommerce platforms like Volusion, Magento, Shopify and the aforementioned BigCommerce, so you can sync it with your existing store with just a few minutes of setup time.
 Feed the Comparison Shopping Engines
GoDataFeed makes it easy for merchants to market their products on comparison shopping engines including Bing, Google Shopping, Facebook and Shopzilla. Merchants often see up to 20% of their online traffic coming from these comparison engines, so it's important to include them as part of your strategy. But, manually handling all of it can be time consuming, and leaves a lot of room for error.
With GoDataFeed, however, the process is simplified, since it provides a single point of integration to push out your product catalog and automates daily feed submissions to more than 200 shopping channels. Built-in analytics allows you to measure clicks, conversions, and revenue across channels or by SKU.
 Streamline Asset Management
A brand management platform, Bynder simplifies your digital asset archives. Using a single dashboard, you can develop, edit, find and use the latest versions of your content - including logos, banners, product images and video content. This way, your branding efforts will always be consistent, because you use this library as the one source that everything flows from.
The built-in project management module makes it easy for your marketing, content and branding teams to work fully aligned with one another, tracking progress and workflows. It features real-time collaborative edits, and provides a central location for all your company's guidelines. Bynder allows you to tag assets and publish them with embed codes, for easier organization and management.
Conclusion
Ultimately, multi-channel ecommerce merchants who are looking to simplify their operations and increase efficiency should look into using one or more of these tools to help. They'll make it easier for you to maximize your customer acquisition efforts and streamline fulfillment, while leaving you enough time for customer service and strengthening relationships with suppliers and customers.

          											Evaluation / Benchmarking
        										











With a focus on exacting precision, Dorman analyzes both original parts and individual components at the beginning of its design process.
Dorman’s analysis establishes a complete product baseline that enables it to identify OE design flaws as opportunities for design improvements.
These steps assure that every Dorman Window Regulator released to the market delivers on its promise of proper fit, form and long lasting function.













                                                    Rigorous Quality Testing
                                                










3-Dimensional Coordinate Measuring

The 3-dimensional coordinate measuring of the doors helps minimize the risk of damage to the replacement Regulator by eliminating the need to alter the product during installation.
No bending, twisting or adjusting is required. Dorman’s Regulator achieves a perfect fit right out of the box.










Tensile Testing

Tensile testing is used to evaluate individual elements of the part assembly.
This test measures the strength of the cable and the amount of force needed to unsecure the cable from its mounting or for the cable to fray.










Material Hardness Testing

Extensive testing verifies that the correct material is being used for the application.
If a material tests poorly, the Dorman Engineering team continues testing to determine if the failure is design or material related and makes the adjustments necessary to resolve the problem and provide a best in class product.










Motor Dyno Testing

This certifies motor performance of original Window Regulator and Dorman's redesigned Window Regulator.
Verifies that the original part meets or exceeds the declared horsepower rating and the Dorman part meets or exceeds our standards for performance.










Cycle Testing

Cycle testing validates the durability and performance of every Dorman Regulator and Motor over extended cycles.
Each Regulator is installed in its corresponding door and tested for 10,000 cycles which is equivalent to three to four years of normal use.










On-Vehicle Testing

Each and every Dorman Window Regulator is tested on a vehicle to ensure a trouble-free installation, excellent performance and operational durability.
This real-life testing assists in creating step-by-step installation instructions, and gives insight into future product enhancements.

OE Problem:
Plastic inserts used in original window slide becomes brittle and cracks over time, allowing cable ends to tear free.




Dorman replaced the original plastic with a nylon material, which improved the durability and eliminated the premature pull-out of the Window Regulator cable.












                                                        Cable Slides
                                                    








OE Problem:
Original cable guide relies on a rectangular design that commonly breaks, causing the cable to pull free.




Dorman redesigned the rectangular cable end to a cylindrical design with robust material to prevent breakage.












                                                        Mounting Brackets
                                                    








OE Problem:
Originally designed as a flat, stamped steel piece that had the tendency to bend under limited regulator stress.




Dorman replaced the original steel with a thicker, more durable metal, and re-engineered the bracket in a rolled-edge design for additional strength. This allows the bracket to withstand greater wear stress than the original design.












                                                        Metal Arms
                                                    








OE Problem:
These metal arms were originally designed with 2.0mm steel and had the tendency to bend and twist under normal use.




Dorman redesigned the metal arms with an improved grade of metal at an increased thickness to prevent the bending and twisting that was previously an issue with this Window Regulator style.
