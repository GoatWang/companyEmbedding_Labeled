History[edit]
FDM was founded as Brighton-based IT services provider FDl in 1991, founded by present-day CEO, Rod Flavell and Julian and Jaqueline Divett. The company focused on IT recruitment until acquiring Mountfield Software in 1995. In 1998 the name changed to FDM Group to reflect this acquisition and the company began hiring, training and placing their own Consultants on-site with their clients.[2]
In April 2005, FDM Group floated on the Alternative Investment Market, raising £3m net for the company.[3] By 2010, the company completed a management buyout to once again bring the company private.[4] In June 2014, FDM again had a floatation, this time valued at £308m on the London Stock Exchange. FDM Group remains publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange today.[5]
In 2015, the company opened new offices in the city centres of Leeds[6] and Glasgow.[7]
Training and initiatives[edit]
FDM Group’s model involves recruiting recent university graduates, returners to work and ex-forces to turn into consultants for their clients. Individuals go through 12–16 weeks of training in one of FDM Group’s academy facilities before signing a two-year contract with the company to work as a consultant. As consultants, the employees work on the site of their clients which include mostly the banking and finance industry.[8]
FDM Group has a Women in IT initiative focused on hiring and inspiring women to pursue jobs in STEM fields. As part of their efforts, they have sponsored the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 everywoman in Technology Awards in London.[9][10]
FDM Group also has an ex-forces initiative, which began in their New York academy as the Veterans Initiative. Through this, they have partnered with the British Forces Resettlement Services[11] and signed the Ministry of Defence Armed Forces Corporate Covenant[12] as well as a US Army Memorandum of Agreement with the Army PaYS Programme.[13] In New York, FDM Group has sponsored the Wall Street Rocks charity concert[14] and marched in the Veterans Day Parade to further support the cause of helping veterans find jobs.[15]

History[edit]
FDM was founded as Brighton-based IT services provider FDl in 1991, founded by present-day CEO, Rod Flavell and Julian and Jaqueline Divett. The company focused on IT recruitment until acquiring Mountfield Software in 1995. In 1998 the name changed to FDM Group to reflect this acquisition and the company began hiring, training and placing their own Consultants on-site with their clients.[2]
In April 2005, FDM Group floated on the Alternative Investment Market, raising £3m net for the company.[3] By 2010, the company completed a management buyout to once again bring the company private.[4] In June 2014, FDM again had a floatation, this time valued at £308m on the London Stock Exchange. FDM Group remains publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange today.[5]
In 2015, the company opened new offices in the city centres of Leeds[6] and Glasgow.[7]
Training and initiatives[edit]
FDM Group’s model involves recruiting recent university graduates, returners to work and ex-forces to turn into consultants for their clients. Individuals go through 12–16 weeks of training in one of FDM Group’s academy facilities before signing a two-year contract with the company to work as a consultant. As consultants, the employees work on the site of their clients which include mostly the banking and finance industry.[8]
FDM Group has a Women in IT initiative focused on hiring and inspiring women to pursue jobs in STEM fields. As part of their efforts, they have sponsored the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 everywoman in Technology Awards in London.[9][10]
FDM Group also has an ex-forces initiative, which began in their New York academy as the Veterans Initiative. Through this, they have partnered with the British Forces Resettlement Services[11] and signed the Ministry of Defence Armed Forces Corporate Covenant[12] as well as a US Army Memorandum of Agreement with the Army PaYS Programme.[13] In New York, FDM Group has sponsored the Wall Street Rocks charity concert[14] and marched in the Veterans Day Parade to further support the cause of helping veterans find jobs.[15]
