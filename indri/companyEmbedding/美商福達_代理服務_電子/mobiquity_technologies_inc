	Mobiquity Technologies, Inc., a New York
	corporation (OTCQB: MOBQ). Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mobiquity Networks, Inc. has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising
	technology company focused on Driving Awareness and Foot-traffic throughout its indoor mall-based beacon network, into a next generation
	mobile location data and marketing company. The Company provides precise unique, at-scale location based data and insights on consumer’s
	real world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research. With our combined exclusive data sets of shopping malls, premium
	outlets and cinemas beacon data, and first party location data via our advanced Software Development Kit (SDK) utilizing multiple
	geo-location technologies; Mobiquity Networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection
	and analysis. This should create several additional revenue streams, including, but not limited to; Push Notification Campaigns,

	Ace Marketing is our legacy marketing and
	promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers. While Ace Marketing currently represents
	substantially all of our revenue, we anticipate that activity from Ace Marketing will represent a diminishing portion of corporate
	revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our Mobiquity Networks business.


	 


	GOING CONCERN - The accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company's continued existence
	is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing to advance its new technology revenue
	stream. The Company has incurred losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has an accumulated
	deficit of $57,467,240. The Company has had negative cash flows from operating activities of $995,300 for the three months ended March
	31, 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management has plans
	to address the Company’s financial situation as follows:


	 


	In the near term, management
	plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the Company’s business plan related to the Bluetooth-enabled
	iBeacon compatible technology. Management will continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the Company’s
	financial obligations. There is no assurance, however, that lenders and investors will continue to advance capital to the Company
	or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential
	inability to achieve profitability raises doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	In the long term, management
	believes that the Company’s projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the Company that will
	be used to finance the Company’s future growth. However, there can be no assurances that the Company’s efforts to raise
	equity and debt at acceptable terms or that the planned activities will be successful, or that the Company will ultimately attain
	profitability. The Company’s long-term viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt or equity funding
	to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations, and the ability of the Company to achieve adequate
	profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations.


	 


	PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mobiquity Technologies, Inc., formerly known as Ace Marketing & Promotions,
	Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mobiquity Networks, Inc., Ace Marketing, Inc., (which has had its name changed to Ace
	Marketing & Promotions, Inc. and Mobiquity Wireless S.L.U.). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
	in consolidation.

	The Condensed Consolidated
	Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2017, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017
	and 2016 and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared
	by us without audit, and in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and, therefore, they do not include all information and
	footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects our financial position as of
	March 31, 2017, results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and cash flows for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations and cash flows for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. We have evaluated
	subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-Q with the SEC, and determined there have not been any events that have occurred
	that would require adjustments to our unaudited Condensed Financial Statements.


	 


	The information contained
	in this report on Form 10-Q should he read in conjunction with our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial
	statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.


	 


	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS- The
	Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
	on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability,
	as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that
	market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes
	a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques,
	are assigned a hierarchical level.


	 


	The following are the
	hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:


	 




	 




	·





	Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.





	 



	·




	Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.





	 



	·




	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.





	 


	The carrying amounts
	of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable &
	accrued expenses, certain notes payable and notes payable - related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity
	of these instruments.


	 


	The Company accounts
	for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 2.

	Embedded Conversion Features




	 



	The Company evaluates
	embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 "Derivatives and Hedging" to determine whether the
	embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with
	changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the
	instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" for consideration of any beneficial
	conversion feature.


	 



	Derivative Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	Company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting

	related to four convertible notes issued and outstanding totaling $1,200,000 which included a ratchet provision in the
	conversion prices which range between $.05-.30. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized
	as derivative liabilities in the Company’s balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair
	value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. The Company has
	estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial
	lattice model as of March 31, 2017. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter, which resulted in
	a gain of $462,193 and derivative expense of $1,038,439 during the three and months ended March 31, 2017. As of March 31,
	2017, the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated $1,797,007, using the following assumptions: estimated 0.1 to 0.5-year
	term, estimated volatility of 211.09% to 338.04%, and a discount rate of 0.00% to 0.92%.

	Cash and cash equivalents
	include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of March 31, 2017 and December 31,
	2016. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified
	as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.


	 


	The carrying amounts
	of financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and promissory note, approximated
	fair value as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments and
	their market interest rates. No instruments are carried at fair value.


	 


	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

	-

	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months
	or less, as well as bank money market accounts, to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the balances
	were $921,828 and $213,184, respectively.


	 


	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT
	RISK

	-

	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
	risk, consist principally of trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.


	 


	Concentration of credit
	risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer
	base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the United States. The Company routinely addresses the financial
	strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited.


	 


	The Company places
	its temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, the Company maintains bank account balances,
	which exceed FDIC limits. As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the Company exceeded FDIC limits by $632,031 and $0, respectively.


	 


	REVENUE RECOGNITION
	— The Company recognizes revenue, for all revenue streams, when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance
	with ASC 605,

	"Revenue Recognition".

	The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria
	have been met:


	 




	 



	·




	Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;

	·




	Collection is reasonably assured.





	 


	ACE MARKETING —
	Ace Marketing's revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete.
	In general, title passes to our customers upon the customer's receipt of the merchandise. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis
	since Ace Marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership, latitude in selection of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit
	risk. Advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits. Ace Marketing records all shipping and handling fees
	billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold, when incurred. Additional source of revenue, derived from
	emails/texts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements. Revenue from this advertising method is recognized
	at the time of service provided.


	 


	MOBIQUITY NETWORKS – Revenue is recognized
	with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale. The customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign
	with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign, which are normally in short duration
	periods. The second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data. Revenue from data can occur in two ways; the first is
	a direct feed, which is billed at the end of each month. The second way is through the purchasing of audience segments. When an
	audience segment is purchased, we bill the buyer upon delivery, which is usually 1-2 days for the order date.

	ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
	ACCOUNTS - Management must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable. Management specifically analyzes accounts
	receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and
	changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of March 31, 2017, and
	December 31, 2016, allowance for doubtful accounts were $104,611 and $104,611, respectively.


	 


	INVENTORY - Inventory
	is recorded at cost (First In, First Out) and is comprised of finished goods. The Company maintains an inventory on hand for its
	largest customer's frequent order items. All items held are branded for the customer, therefore are not available for public distribution.
	The Company has an agreement with this customer, for cost recovery, if vendor relationship is terminated. There have been minimal
	reserves placed on inventory, based on this arrangement. As of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the Company has reserved
	against $31,676 and $31,676, respectively.


	 


	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
	- Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is expensed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
	lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
	lives of the related assets or the remaining term of the lease. The costs of additions and improvements, which substantially extend
	the useful life of a particular asset, are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense. When assets are sold
	or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account and the gain or loss on disposition
	is reflected in operating income.


	 


	LONG LIVED ASSETS -
	Long-lived assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances
	indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized
	based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar
	assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
	from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value
	of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted
	at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. The company recognized $223,487 impairment losses
	for the period ended December 31, 2016 and $12,127 for the period ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	WEBSITE TECHNOLOGY
	- Website technology developed during the prior years were capitalized for the period of development and testing. Expenditures
	during the planning stage and after implementation have been expensed in accordance with ASC 985.


	 


	ADVERTISING COSTS

	-

	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, there were advertising
	costs of $0 and $0, respectively.


	 


	ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK
	BASED COMPENSATION. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense
	over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Sholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of the awards,
	which involves certain subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their
	vested stock options before exercising them ("expected term"), the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock
	price over the expected term ("volatility") and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed
	("forfeitures"). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stock-based compensation,
	and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 6 "Stock Option Plans"
	in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

	in

	this report for a more detailed discussion.


	 


	BENEFICIAL CONVERSIONS
	- Debt instruments that contain a beneficial conversion feature are recorded as deemed interest to the holders of the convertible
	debt instruments. The beneficial conversion is calculated as the difference between the fair values of the underlying common stock
	less the proceeds that have been received for the debt instrument limited to the value received.


	 


	FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
	- The Company's functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We own a subsidiary in Europe. Our subsidiary's functional
	currency is the EURO. All transactions initiated in EUROs are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30,

	from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity as a component
	of comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but reported
	as other comprehensive income.


	 


	INCOME TAXES - Deferred
	income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities
	for which income tax or tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years. A valuation allowance is established to reduce
	deferred tax assets, if it is more likely than not, that all or some portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized.
	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


	 


	We have reviewed the
	FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness
	dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter
	previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material
	impact on the corporation's reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject
	to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.


	 



	NOTE 2: LOSS PER SHARE




	 



	Basic loss per
	common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
	period. Dilutive loss per share gives effect to stock options and warrants, which are considered to be dilutive common stock
	equivalents. Basic loss per common share was computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common
	stock outstanding. The number of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise of certain options and warrants that
	were excluded from the diluted loss per common share calculation was approximately 66,183,884 because they are anti-dilutive
	as a result of a net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

	Between August and December 2015, the Company borrowed $3,675,000 from accredited investors. These loans are due and payable the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the completion of an equity financing of at least $2,500,000. Upon the sale of the unsecured promissory notes, the Company issued $1 of principal, one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share through August 31, 2017. Accordingly, an aggregate of 3,675,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a like amount were issued in the last six months of 2015. Each noteholder has the right to convert the principal of their note and accrued interest thereon at a conversion price of $0.30 per share or at the noteholder’s option, into equity securities of the Company on the same terms as the last equity transaction completed by the Company prior to each respective conversion date.





	 





	The
	Company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to
	derivative accounting

	related to four convertible notes issued totaling $1,200,000 which included a ratchet provision
	in the conversion price of $.05 or $.30 or a price equal to the last equity transaction completed by the Company as part of
	a subscription agreement

	. The notes have maturity dates ranging from May 31,
	2017 – September 28, 2017. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as
	derivative liabilities in the Company’s balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair
	value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. The Company
	has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a
	multinomial lattice model as of March 31, 2017. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter,
	which resulted in a gain of $462,193 and derivative expense of $1,038,439 during the year ended March 31, 2017. As of
	March 31, 2017, the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated $1,797,007, using the following assumptions: estimated
	0.1 to 0.5-year term, estimated volatility of 211.09% to 338.04%, and a discount rate of 0.00% to 0.92%.

	In April 2016 through
	the filing date of this Form 10-K, the Company issued and sold 12% unsecured promissory notes in the principal amount of $1,025,000,
	convertible at $0.20 per common share. Upon conversion, the note holders would receive 100% warrant coverage, exercisable at $0.20
	per common share over a period of five years with cashless exercise provisions. These notes automatically convert in the event
	at least $5 million is raised in an equity financing. Prior to the mandatory conversion date, note holders have the option to convert
	the principal and accrued interest also on the same terms as the mandatory conversion and the Company has the option to prepay.
	The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter, which resulted in a gain of $1,507,450 and initial derivative
	expense of $565,780. As of December 31, 2016, the fair market value of these derivatives aggregated $126,275, using the following
	assumptions: estimated 0.3 year term, estimated volatility of 279%, and a discount rate of 0.51%.


	 


	The Company raised
	$700,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from the sale of secured promissory notes in the principal amount of $700,000 from six accredited
	investors. Each Note was scheduled to be repaid on October 31, 2016, extended to December 15, 2016 but payment was not made. In
	lieu of interest on the Note, 4,900,000 restricted shares of common stock were issued to the Note Holders. At the option of the
	Note Holder, each Note shall be convertible at the lower of $.20 per common share or into securities on the same terms of the next
	completed equity offering of at least $10 million in gross proceeds. In the event the Note is converted into common stock, 100%
	warrant conversion shall be provided to the Note Holder for each share of common stock issued upon conversion. These warrants will
	have a term of three years and shall be exercisable at $.20 per common share. Prior to this offering, Thomas Arnost, Executive
	Chairman, has a secured interest in the amount of $322,000 in the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Mr. Arnost has agreed
	that the investors in this offering will have a pari passu first secured interest with Mr. Arnost in all assets of the Company
	and its subsidiaries. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter, which resulted in a gain of $11,071.
	As of December 31, 2016, the fair market value of these derivatives aggregated $42,945, using the following assumptions: estimated
	volatility of 279.0%, and a discount rate of 0.51%.


	 


	In February 2017, The Company debt holders converted $3,672,000

	February 28, 2017, the Company entered
	into an agreement with two non-affiliated persons to provide $1.6 million of short term secured debt financing in three monthly
	tranches. The Company will issue in connection with each tranche, a six-month secured convertible promissory note. In connection
	with this transaction, the Company agreed to issue an origination fee of 3,200,000 warrants. Alexander Capital L.P. acted as Placement
	Agent and Advisor for this transaction.


	 


	In February 2017,
	the Company reported that all of its Series AA preferred stock and substantially all of its outstanding debt both secured and
	unsecured (approximately $12.1 million) have been converted into equity securities of the Company as outlined below. It
	should be noted that the capital transactions below were based on a premium to the average closing sale price of $0.045 per
	share during the 60 day period prior to February 08, 2017. The Company had outstanding 1,122,588 shares of newly designated
	Series AAA preferred stock and $1,350,000 of convertible notes. The convertible notes consist of $1,200,000 of secured notes
	and $150,000 of unsecured notes. Of the 1,122,588 shares of Series AAA preferred stock outstanding, 240,000 Series AA
	preferred stock with an original cost basis of $2.4 million were converted into Series AAA preferred stock. The remaining
	882,588 shares of Series AAA preferred stock were issued in exchange for the conversion of principal and accrued interest of
	approximately $11,854,038 of unsecured debt. This conversion resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,706,197.
	The terms of the Series AAA preferred stock can be summarized as follows:


	 


	The price of
	each preferred share shall be, at the option of the holder, convertible into 100 shares of Common Stock. If the preferred shares are converted, the subscriber will then receive 100%
	warrant coverage, with each warrant exercisable at $.05 per share with a cash payment to the Company through the close of
	business on December 31, 2019. The preferred shares have no voting or other preferences except as required by law other than
	the right of conversion described above and a liquidation preference equal to $.01 per share.


	 


	Thomas
	Arnost, our Executive Vice Chairman, and another principal stockholder agreed to convert letters of credit in the principal
	amount of $2,700,000 and $322,000 of secured debt into shares of common stock at the then marketing price of $.05 per share.
	Accrued interest on these obligations were either previously converted into our common stock or were upon conversion of
	the principal, converted into common stock at the fair market value of our common stock at each interest accrual date.
	At conversion date the balance of the letters of credit of $456,503 was recorded as Subscription receivable to be paid in the
	second quarter of 2017.

	NOTE 6: STOCK OPTION PLAN




	 



	In the first quarter
	of 2016, the Board approved and stockholders ratified a 2016 Employee Benefit and Consulting Services Compensation Plan covering
	10,000,000 shares (the “2016 Plan”) and approving moving all options which exceeded the 2009 Plan limits to the 2016
	Plan.


	 


	All stock options under
	the Plans are granted at or above the fair market value of the common stock at the grant date. Employee and non-employee stock
	options vest over varying periods and generally expire either 5 or 10 years from the grant date. The fair value of options at the
	date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants, the Company will take into consideration
	payments subject to the provisions of ASC 718 "Stock Compensation", previously Revised SFAS No. 123 "Share-Based
	Payment" ( "SFAS 123 (R)"). The fair values of these restricted stock awards are equal to the market value of the
	Company's stock on the date of grant, after taking into certain discounts. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility
	of our stock and other contributing factors. The expected term is based upon observation of actual time elapsed between date of
	grant and exercise of options for all employees. Previously, such assumptions were determined based on historical data.

	In April 2011, we
	entered into our agreement with Simon Property Group, which agreement was amended first in September 2013 and then in
	July 2014. This second amendment provides for us to expand our location-based mobile mall network footprint to about 195
	current Simon malls across the United States. Our agreement with Simon currently expires December 31, 2017. Simon is entitled
	to receive fees from us equal to the greater of a pre-set per mall fee or a percentage of revenues derived from within the
	Simon Mall network. The revenue share agreement in which Simon participates will exceed the minimum annual mall fees if the
	Company has generated revenues within the Simon network of about $15 million or more in a calendar year. Our agreement with
	Simon requires the company to maintain letters of credit for each calendar year under the agreement represented by the
	minimum amount of fees due for such calendar year. For 2015, the minimum fees of $2.7 million has been secured through two
	bank letters of credit, one of which was issued in the amount of $1,350,000 utilizing the funds of a non-affiliated
	stockholder and the second letter of credit was obtained in the same amount through the funds of Thomas Arnost, our Executive
	Chairman. In the event Simon draws down upon either letter of credit, we have until the next minimum payment due date
	(approximately 90 days) after the draw down to obtain replacement letters of credit. Each person who secured our letters of
	credit has the opportunity to notify us that they wish to turn the cash funds securing the letters of credit over to us and
	to convert such funds into Common Stock currently at a conversion price of $.20 per share. Also, each person who issued the
	letter of credit is receiving quarterly, while the letters of credit are outstanding, options to purchase 125,000 shares of
	Common Stock, exercisable at the prevailing market price per share on the date of grant and interest at the rate of 8% per
	annum on the monies that they have had to set aside in their bank accounts and are unable to have access to such monies. In
	April, July, October, 2016 and January 2017, Simon drew down on each bank letter of credit for an aggregate of $1,121,748
	owed to each letter of credit provider. During the first quarter of 2017, the Letter of Credit holders converted the entire
	$2,700,000 into 54,000,000 shares of Common Stock.


	 


	Pursuant to a master
	agreement effective August, 2015, we entered into an agreement with PREIT pursuant to which we have the right to install our Mobi-Beacons
	and to send information across the air space of the common areas of our PREIT mall network, which will include approximately 27
	malls in select states in the United States. Our right to install our Mobi-Beacons to market and sell third party paid advertising
	in the interior common areas of these malls is exclusive. Under our agreement between us and PREIT, PREIT is entitled to an agreed
	upon revenue share over the four-year term of the agreement. In the event the net revenue share as defined in the agreement is
	not attained for any measurement period, also as defined in the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon 90 days
	prior written notice. PREIT may also terminate the agreement if it determines that Mobiquity’s installed equipment is not
	adequate and/or provides a negative user experience for the visitors to the PREIT malls. The agreement also provides for PREIT
	to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon changes in its beneficial ownership in the
	malls.



	 



	Pursuant to a master agreement entered
	into in 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rouse pursuant to which we have the right to install our Mobi-Beacons to send information
	across the air space of the common areas of our Rouse mall network, which will include approximately 30 malls in select states
	in the United States. Our right to install our Mobi-Beacons to market and sell third party paid advertising in the interior common
	areas of these malls is exclusive. Under our agreement between us and Rouse, Rouse is entitled to an agreed upon revenue share
	over the four-year term of the agreement. In the event the net revenue share as defined in the agreement is not attained for any
	measurement period, also as defined in the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice.
	Either party may also terminate the agreement due to a material breach which is not cured within 30 days of written notice. Also,
	Rouse upon at least 60 days written notice to us prior to the end of the second contract year, may terminate the agreement with
	respect to any participating property for any reason at the end of the second contract year. The agreement also provides for Rouse
	to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon changes in its beneficial ownership in the
	malls.


	 


	In February 2012, the Company entered into

	NOTE 8: SEGMENT INFORMATION




	 



	Reportable operating
	segment is determined based on Mobiquity Technologies, Inc.'s management approach. The management approach, as defined by accounting
	standards which have been codified into FASB ASC 280, "Segment Reporting," is based on the way that the chief operating
	decision-maker organizes the segments within an enterprise for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their
	performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.


	 


	While our results of
	operations are primarily reviewed on a consolidated basis, the chief operating decision-maker also manages the enterprise in two
	operating segments: (i) Ace Marketing and Promotions, Inc. captures Branding & Branded Merchandise (ii) Mobiquity Networks
	represent our Mobile Marketing.


	 


	Corporate management
	defines and reviews segment profitability based on the same allocation methodology as presented in the segment data tables below:

	Company Overview




	 



	Mobiquity Technologies,
	Inc., a New York corporation (the “Company”), is the parent company of two operating subsidiaries; Mobiquity Networks,
	Inc.(“Mobiquity Networks”) and Ace Marketing & Promotions, Inc. (“Ace Marketing”). The Company’s
	wholly-owned subsidiary, Mobiquity Networks has evolved and grown from a mobile advertising technology company focused on Driving
	Awareness and Foot-traffic throughout its indoor mall-based beacon network, into a next generation mobile location data and marketing
	company. Mobiquity Networks provides precise unique, at-scale location-based data and insights on consumer’s real world behavior
	and trends for use in marketing and research. With our combined data sets of shopping malls, premium outlets and cinemas beacon
	data, and first party location data via our advanced Software Development Kit (“SDK”) utilizing multiple geo-location
	technologies, Mobiquity Networks provides one of the most accurate and scaled solution for mobile data collection and analysis.
	Mobiquity Networks is seeking to create several new revenue streams from the mobile data collection and analysis, including, but
	not limited to; Push Notification Campaigns, Mobile Audiences & Segments, real-time

	Data
	Provision,

	Attribution Reporting and Custom Research. The Company is also attempting to reduce expenses by renegotiating
	certain Mall Developer Agreements.


	 


	Ace Marketing is our
	legacy marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers. While Ace Marketing
	currently represents substantially all of our revenue, we anticipate that activity from Ace Marketing will represent a diminishing
	portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our Mobiquity
	Networks business. We believe that our Mobiquity Networks business represents our greatest growth opportunity going forward.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies




	 



	Our discussion and
	analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  The preparation of financial statements
	requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
	our estimates including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical
	experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe
	that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial
	statements.

	Revenue Recognition
	-

	Ace Marketing’s revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process
	is complete. In general, title passes to our customers upon shipment of the merchandise. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis
	since Ace Marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership, latitude in selection of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit
	risk. Advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits. Ace Marketing records all shipping and handling fees
	billed to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold, when incurred. Additional source of revenue, derived from
	emails/texts directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements. Revenue from this advertising method is recognized
	at the time of service provided.


	 



	Revenue Recognition

	– Mobiquity Networks. Revenue is recognized with the billing of an advertising contract or data sale. The customer signs
	a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising
	campaign, which are normally in short duration periods. The second type of revenue is through the licensing of our data. Revenue
	from data can occur in two ways; the first is a direct feed, which is billed at the end of each month. The second way is through
	the purchasing of audience segments. When an audience segment is purchased, we bill the buyer upon delivery, which is usually 1-2
	days for the order date.


	  



	Allowance For Doubtful
	Accounts

	. We are required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations, as to the realizability
	of our accounts receivable. We make these assessments based on the following factors: (a) historical experience, (b) customer concentrations,
	customer credit worthiness, (d) current economic conditions, and (e) changes in customer payment terms.


	 



	Accounting For Stock
	Based Compensation

	. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as
	expense over the requisite service period. The company uses the Black-Sholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of the
	awards, which involves certain subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain
	their vested stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the company’s
	common stock price over the expected term (“volatility”) and the number of options for which vesting requirements will
	not be completed (“forfeitures”). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value
	stock-based compensation, and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations.


	 



	Plan of Operation




	 



	Mobiquity Networks
	derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above. All of the products used to derive revenue for the Company are
	reliant on the collection of data. To achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward, we have developed a strategy to
	increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection. One strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on
	a monthly basis (“MAU”), and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations (Places) available to
	see our MAU’s visit over the same time period. We are currently seeing approximately 13,000,000 unique mobile devices by
	the MAU on a monthly basis and roughly 20,000,000 unique devices for the first 100 days of 2017. The ability to see and collect
	the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary Software Development Kit (SDK) into
	third party mobile applications (Apps). To continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis, we
	need to have our SDK installed in more third party Apps. We believe our unique offering to potential App partners gives us a competitive
	advantage over others in the industry. The task of partnering with third party Apps for installation of our SDK is handled internally
	by our business development team.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017,
	we had approximately 200,000 Places in our proprietary Places database, and that number should increase to over 4,000,000 Places
	by the end of the second quarter 2017, thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect. We have been able to steadily
	increase the number of locations available in our Places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies.
	The task of growing our Places database is handled by our internal technology team. The Company currently utilizes both internal
	and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings. Management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the
	last three quarters of 2017 as working capital permits.

	The following table

	indicative of the results expected for any other interim period or any future fiscal year. In addition, we note that the period-to-period
	comparison may not be indicative of future performance.

	We generated revenues
	of $434,119 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $517,232 in the same period of the prior year. As our Mobiquity revenue streams
	from collection of data and analysis is fairly new, at the current time, revenues Mobiquity Networks are $81,787 of our consolidated
	revenues. In 2017, we anticipate our revenues increasing in our Mobiquity Networks subsidiary due to the implementation of our
	new revenue business model.


	  


	Cost of revenues was
	$430,568 or 99% of revenues in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $561,589 or 109% of revenues in the same fiscal period of
	the prior year. Cost of revenues includes purchases and freight costs associated with the shipping of merchandise to our customers.
	The change in cost of revenues of $131,021 in 2017 is related to volume and product mix of the products our customers purchased
	along with the establishment of our Mobiquity devices.


	 


	Gross profit was $3,551
	for the first quarter of 2017 or 1% of net revenues compared to $(44,357) in the same fiscal period of the prior year or (109)%
	of revenues. Gross profits will vary period-to-period depending upon a number of factors including the mix of items sold and the
	volume of product sold. Also, it is our practice to pass freight costs on to our customers with low to no profit margin. As advertising
	revenue from the use of our Mobiquity devices increases, it is expected that our margins will increase significantly. As our mall
	network has only recently been constructed and is currently being expanded, at the current time, revenues from the use of our Mobiquity
	devices are not a material portion of our consolidated revenues.


	 


	Selling, general, and
	administrative expenses were $1,860,195 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2,521,308 in the comparable period of the prior
	year, a decrease of approximately $661,113. Such operating costs include payroll and related expenses, commissions, insurance,
	rents, fee payments to Simon Property Group, Macerich malls and GGP malls professional (consulting) and public awareness fees.


	 


	The net operating loss
	for the first quarter of 2017 was $1,856,644 as compared to $2,565,665 for the comparable period of the prior year. The change
	in operating loss is attributable to reductions in salaries, rents commissions and non-cash stock based compensation.


	 


	No benefit for income
	taxes is provided for in the reported periods due to the full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. Our ability to
	be profitable in the future is dependent upon the successful introduction and usage of our proximity marketing services.

	The Company had
	cash and cash equivalents of $921,828 at March 31, 2017. Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 was $995,300. This resulted primarily from a net loss of $6,285,148, offset by stock based payments of $273,092 a
	decrease in accounts receivable of $80,927 and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $20,033 and an decrease of
	accounts payable and accrued expenses of $249,097 and the non-cash items of the change in fair value of derivative
	liabilities of $462,193, derivative expense of $1,038,439 and the loss on settlement of debt of $2,706,197 and amortization
	of debt discount of $643,363. Net cash was provided by financing activities of $1,703,944 from the sale of the Company's
	Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $311,250, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $95,834 and net
	proceeds from the issuance and extinguishment of notes of $1,300,000.


	 


	The Company had cash
	and cash equivalents of $178,466 at March 31, 2016. Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016
	was $2,241,724. This resulted primarily from a net loss of $2,976,353, offset by stock based payments of $183,785 a decrease in
	accounts receivable of $37,908 and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $13,055 and an increase of accounts payable
	and accrued expenses of $58,363 and a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The Company had an increase in
	investing activities of $4,430 with the purchase of equipment. Net cash was provided by financing activities of $400,000 from the
	sale of the Company's Preferred Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	Our Company commenced
	operations in 1998 and was initially funded by our three founders, each of whom has made demand loans to our Company that have
	been repaid. Since 1999, we have relied primarily on equity financing from outside investors to supplement our cash flow from operations.

	We anticipate
	that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to finance our accounts receivable and inventories, hire additional
	sales persons, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. The primary sources of funding for such requirements will be cash
	generated from operations, raising additional capital from the sale of equity or other securities and borrowings under debt facilities
	which currently do not exist. We believe that we can generate sufficient cash flow from these sources to fund our operations for
	at least the next twelve months. In the event we should need additional financing, we can provide no assurances that we will be
	able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.

	First Quarter 2017 Loan Agreements and Certain Transactions




	 



	Prior to the February
	28, 2017 sale of secured debt, the Company’s holders of all of its Series AA preferred stock and substantially all of its
	outstanding debt both secured and unsecured (approximately $14.5 million) have been converted into equity securities of the Company
	as outlined below. It should be noted that the capital transactions below were based on a premium to the average closing sale price
	of $0.045 per share during the 60 day period prior to February 08, 2017.


	 


	On February 28, 2017,
	the Company entered into an agreement with a two non-affiliated persons to provide $1.6 million of short term secured debt financing
	in three monthly tranches, with the first monthly tranche in the amount of $600,000. The Company will issue in connection with
	each tranche, six-month secured convertible promissory note(s). Each note is initially convertible at $.05 per share. Any prepayment
	of the note requires the payment of a 25% premium and guaranteed interest for the entire six-month note. In the case of default,
	the amount owed by the Company will become 130% of the outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon. The Conversion Price
	will rest in the event that the note is unpaid and in default on the sixth month anniversary date of the issuance of the note.
	In connection with this transaction, the Company agreed to issue an origination fee of 1,600,000 shares of restricted common stock.
	Alexander Capital L.P. acted as Placement Agent and Advisor for this transaction.


	 


	As of April 5, 2017,
	the Company has outstanding 191,421,390 shares of common stock, 1,122,588 shares of newly designated Series AAA preferred stock
	and $1,350,000 of convertible notes. The convertible notes consist of $1,200,000 of secured notes and $150,000 of unsecured notes.
	Of the 1,122,588 shares of Series AAA preferred stock outstanding, 240,000 Series AA preferred stock with an original cost basis
	of $2.4 million were converted into Series AAA preferred stock. The remaining 882,588 shares of Series AAA preferred stock were
	issued in exchange for the conversion of principal and accrued interest of approximately $11,854,038 of unsecured debt. The terms
	of the Series AAA preferred stock can be summarized as follows:


	 


	The price of each preferred
	share may be convertible into common stock with an equivalent purchase price of $.10 per common share. If the preferred shares
	are converted, the subscriber will then receive 100% warrant coverage, with each warrant exercisable at $.05 per share with a cash
	payment to the Company through the close of business on December 31, 2019. The preferred shares have no voting or other preferences
	except as required by law other than the right of conversion described above and a liquidation preference equal to $.01 per share.


	 


	Thomas Arnost, our
	Executive Vice Chairman, and another principal stockholder agreed to convert letters of credit in the principal amount of $2,700,000
	and $322,000 of secured debt into shares of common stock at the then marketing price of $.05 per share. Accrued interest on these
	obligations were either previously converted into our common stock or were upon conversion of the principal, converted into common
	stock at the fair market value of our common stock at each interest accrual date.


	 


	The Company also raised
	an additional $407,084 from the exercise of outstanding warrants and new subscriptions. For these transactions, the Company issued
	8,141,667 shares of common stock.

	Transactions with Thomas Arnost, Executive Chairman




	 



	In December 2013, Thomas
	Arnost, a director of Mobiquity, purchased from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, the Company’s outstanding convertible promissory
	note in the amount of $350,000. Subsequently Mr. Arnost and the Company agreed to fix the conversion price of the note at $.30
	per share, extend the due date of the Note to June 12, 2014, which was subsequently extended to December 22, 2014 and again extended
	to December 31, 2015, subject to Mr. Arnost’s right to call the note at any time in his sole discretion, and increase the
	interest rate to 15% per annum. In December 2015, Mr. Arnost extended the due date of the note to December 31, 2016 and the Company
	agreed to lower the conversion price to $.20 per share.


	 


	Our agreement
	with Simon Properties requires us to maintain letters of credit for each calendar year under the agreement represented by the
	minimum amount of fees due for such calendar year. For 2015 and 2016, the minimum fees of $2.7 million has been secured
	through two bank letters of credit, one of which was issued in the amount of $1,350,000 utilizing the funds and the second
	letter of credit was obtained in the same amount through the funds of Thomas Arnost, our Executive Chairman. In the event
	Simon draws down upon either letter of credit, we have until the next minimum payment date (about 90 days) after the draw
	down to obtain replacement letters of credit. Each person who secured our letters of credit has the opportunity to notify us
	that they wish to turn the cash funds securing the letters of credit over to us and to convert such funds into our common
	stock. In February 2017, Thomas Arnost agreed to convert his $322,000 of secured debt and both Mr. Arnost and SNW JR
	Properties agreed to convert their letters of credit and any accrued interest at a conversion price of $.05 per share as to
	the principal amount and at market price for interest accrued at each respective interest accrual date. A total of 36,541,960
	shares were issued to Mr. Arnost and 27,738,260 shares were issued to SNW JB Properties.



	 







	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
	MARKET RISK




	 



	Market risk is
	the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
	and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our short term money market investments.
	The Company does not have any financial instruments held for trading or other speculative purposes and does not invest in derivative
	financial instruments, interest rate swaps or other investments that alter interest rate exposure. The Company does not have any
	credit facilities with variable interest rates.



	 







	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 



	We maintain disclosure
	controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
	to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Under the supervision
	and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the
	design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based
	on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	as of the end of the period covered by this report.


	 


	There were no
	changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have
	materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Hofstra University

                  Hofstra University is a private, nonsectarian institution of higher learning located in the Village of Hempstead, New York, United States, about 7 miles (11 km) east of New York City. It originated in 1935 as an extension of New York University (NYU) called "Nassau College – Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead, Long Island";[4] in 1937, the institution separated from NYU and gained independence as Hofstra College,[5] and in 1963, Hofstra College gained university status. Comprising ten schools, including a School of Medicine and a School of Law, Hofstra is noted for a series of prominent Presidential conferences, as well as being selected to host a United States Presidential Debate in 2008 and 2012. The university organizes a wide range of other international academic conferences (many under the aegis of the Hofstra Cultural Center), holds an annual Shakespeare festival in its own replica of the Globe Theatre, and has both an arboretum and bird sanctuary.
