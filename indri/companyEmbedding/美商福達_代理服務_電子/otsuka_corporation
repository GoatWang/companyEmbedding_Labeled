Product Features
POCARI SWEAT
Easily replenish water and ions
This health drink lets you easily replenish the fluids and ions (electrolytes) lost while sweating.
Perfect when playing sports or after a hot bath
POCARI SWEAT is quickly absorbed by the body as it is a solution that approximates the electrolyte concentration in the human body. It is the perfect beverage for those that have been perspiring while playing sports, working, or taking a hot bath. It can also hydrate you first thing in the morning.

We are a dynamic, growing organisation with a diverse group of motivated employees, all working together in an environment that fosters creativity. You won’t see our values written on the walls of our offices; however, when you walk in the door, you will feel them in the environment and in our people.
Otsuka’s success is built on a culture of unconventional creativity, innovation and collaboration. By encouraging our people to follow these ideals, we help to unlock their true potential as they strive to deliver new products for better health worldwide and create the healthcare solutions of tomorrow.
Our non-conformist attitude means that we avoid generic approaches to product development, instead focusing our energy on creating original products and, in doing so, making a real difference to the lives of patients.
To make this happen requires passion and perseverance, characteristics that have been associated with Otsuka throughout the company’s history since its birth in 1921. The Otsuka workplace is never static, employing over 47,000 people globally. In Europe, the company is currently undergoing rapid growth and development. The health and wellbeing of patients is the primary focus of our 600 employees in Europe, and everything we do as a company is geared towards achieving this goal.
A key to our success in Europe has been following the philosophy of ‘Jissho-Shugi’, which means ‘earning responsibility by consistently delivering results’. We empower and motivate our employees to work not only as valued individuals who can follow their dreams, but also as part of a team, both within Otsuka and in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies that share similar values. It is the drive, diversity, creativity and unconventional thinking of our people in Europe that make things happen. We want all of our employees to be empowered to carry out their roles as part of Otsuka’s global family.
In keeping with the ethos of our late Chairman, Mr Akihiko Otsuka, our main European regional office is based just outside London in a rural, countryside setting. It was always Mr Otsuka’s belief that it was most beneficial to take the road less travelled and, although they lack convenience, outlying areas give you more time to ponder things.
By striving to think differently, by challenging established ways of thinking, and by exploring paths of discovery that nobody else has thought of, Otsuka will continue to push the boundaries of possibility, enabling us to provide treatments and carer support to help people enjoy the best possible quality of life.
In the words of our President, Mr Higuchi, ‘Our ultimate goal is to become an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide’.Ole Vahlgren CEO & President, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe            Find out about 'Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide'Find out more about Otsuka's global newsOtsuka in EuropeAffiliate officesDeveloping marketsChoose a countryAustriaBelgiumBulgariaCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceDeutschlandGreeceHungaryIcelandIrelandItalyLatviaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaNetherlandsNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUK  AustriaOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.GallionsWexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomBelgiumOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.Gallions Wexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomBulgariaOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.Gallions Wexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomCroatiaOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.GallionsWexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomCyprusOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.GallionsWexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomCzech RepublicOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.GallionsWexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomDenmarkOtsuka Pharma Scandinavia ABBirger Jarlsgatan 27SE-111 45 StockholmSwedenTelephone+46-8-54528660Fax+46-8-54528669info@otsuka.seEstoniaOtsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.GallionsWexham SpringsFramewood RoadWexhamSL3 6PJUnited KingdomFinlandOtsuka Pharma Scandinavia ABBirger Jarlsgatan 27SE-111 45 StockholmSwedenTelephone+46-8-545 286 60Fax+46-8-545 286 69info@otsuka.seFranceOtsuka Pharmaceutical France SASL’Atria1-15 avenue Edouard Belin92508 Rueil Malmaison cedexFranceTelephone+33 (0)1 47 08 00 00Fax+33 (0)1 47 51 88 09http://www.otsuka.frN°de Siret  453 720 336 00032S.A.S. au capital de 6 000 000 €R.C.S.
