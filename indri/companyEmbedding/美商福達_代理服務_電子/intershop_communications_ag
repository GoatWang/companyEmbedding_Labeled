Company History[edit]
Intershop was founded in 1992 as "NetConsult" by Stephan Schambach, Karsten Schneider, and Wilfried Beeck. The Company in 1995 created the first German WWW-based online store.[3] Also in 1995, they created "Intershop Online, the first standard software for e- commerce applications",[4] marketed in the U.S. one year later [5] (see also Online shopping) and continued to be one of the leading software developers for this early time of the market.[6]
Beyond that it is known as one of the prime German examples of the so-called "New Economy bubble" (company value rose to 11 billion USD in 2000 only to fall to penny stock levels in very short time[4]). At one point, a profit warning by Intershop caused widespread losses for other tech companies; for example, even SAP's stock fell by 8%.[7] The company hardly survived the crash but was able to keep operating and to continue development of its products. In the process, about 30 spin-offs were founded, including Pixaco (later acquired by Hewlett-Packard), and Demandware,.[4]
It now is a major player in its segment again, having gained new customers as well as strong partners.
Products[edit]
The newest product is the e-commerce solution Intershop Commerce Suite released in March 2015. Intershop Commerce Suite is an enterprise e-commerce solution for modeling sales processes to suit a business model or organizational structure. Using this single platform, businesses can showcase their brands and market their products worldwide. It includes selling to B2C, B2B, using partners for selling and the integration of suppliersIt comes in components covering specific fields of challenges for organizations that look to sell online, among others:

Omni-Channel Management
Product Information Management
Marketing and Merchandizing
Transaction Management
Analytics and Reporting
