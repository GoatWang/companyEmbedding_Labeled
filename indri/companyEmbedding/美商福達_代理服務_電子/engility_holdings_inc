February 20, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHANTILLY, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Engility 
      Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EGL), today announced it has been awarded a $27.6 
      million contract to provide product and technical support for the 
      development and testing of the Naval Avionics Platform Integration 
      Emulator (NAPIE) systems for U.S. Navy platforms. NAPIE systems enable 
      rapid integration of cutting-edge prototype technologies, such as 
      sensors or algorithms, into existing platforms. The work will be done 
      for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Systems Division, Naval Air Warfare 
      Center, Aircraft Department (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD.
    


      Under this contract, which represents a continuation of previous work, 
      Engility will provide program management, engineering services, system 
      architecture, guidance quality analysis, test planning, flight test data 
      analysis, and field support to the NAWCAD/ATC Systems Division. Work 
      under this cost-plus-fixed-fee award will be performed over five years.
    

      NAPIE systems include the core computing elements (computer hardware and 
      software) along with equipment such as data recorders, test engineer 
      consoles and various electrical, electronic, avionic and mechanical 
      components. Engility engineers, through the development of the rugged, 
      airborne based NAPIE systems, help existing platforms meet stringent 
      military standards and qualify for Navy test authorizations and Federal 
      Aviation Administration approval.
    

      “This contract award is the result of Engility’s nearly 20 years of 
      experience working with the design, development and technical aspects of 
      the NAPIE systems,” said Engility President and CEO Tony Smeraglinolo. 
      “Our exceptional past performance and our resulting knowledge of system 
      requirements create efficiencies for the government while enabling 
      mission success for our customer. It is an honor to continue to support 
      the NAWCAD and its important missions.”

Location Profile: Charleston, SC






Our Charleston, SC office hosts more than 150 employees who support the Navy Space and Warfare System Center, Atlantic (SPAWAR) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Department of Defense and Federal/Civilian teams are co-located in the same facility, allowing them to share services and have a relationship that benefits both the team and the customers. In the past six years, this team has helped the VA drop the backlog of disability claims below 100,000 (compared to a high in 2013 of 611,000). This reduction was possible due in part to the ability to process disability claims electronically from start to finish – more than 99.8 percent of department’s pending disability claims inventory is now fully electronic using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS)VBMS. The team was awarded a gold American Business Award in 2015 for Product Management Department/ Team of the Year. When the team isn’t working, they volunteer their time at the local VA Medical Center; they were awarded the Above and Beyond Award by the Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve in 2015.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
Time shown in Eastern Time unless otherwise specified.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.
