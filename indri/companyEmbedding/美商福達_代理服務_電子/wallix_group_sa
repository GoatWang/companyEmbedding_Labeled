        THIS AWARD DEMONSTRATES:
      

        - FURTHER VINDICATION OF WORLDWIDE COMPANY STRATEGY
        - EASINESS AND OPENNESS OF WAB SUITE FOR IDENTITY ACESS MANAGEMENT
      

        THIS AWARD REINFORCES CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND IS THE SECOND MAJOR INDUSTRY AWARD GIVEN TO ADMINBASTION IN 2016
      

        WALLIX, the security software company offering privileged access management solutions for large and medium enterprises, public organisations and cloud service providers, today announced that it has been named the winner of the IDAM Product of Year at this year's Cyber Security Awards, the independent business awards program judged by members of the press and industry analysts.
      

        Now in its third year, the Cyber Security Awards is an independent event this year held in West London that has no affiliation to any magazines, organisations, or products. As a result, the judges are able to make all their decisions based on merit alone. The Cyber Security Awards team, reviews the industry, looking for the best possible Cyber Security applicants. They encourage all those, who are committed to progressing the industry, to apply every year.
      

        Receiving the IDAM product of the year 2016, WALLIX has demonstrated the advantage of managing in a comprehensive and single management console user accounts, accounts privileges and access of information systems and business applications. The responsiveness and performance of operational teams are in this case optimized while costs reduced.
        Bruce Jubb, Regional Director for UK. Ireland & Nordics said, 'as the threat landscape continues to shift on a daily basis, our focus on being the best at managing privileged user accounts has again been recognised and supports feedback from our customers. It also reinforces the recognition from SC Magazine earlier this year.'
        Commenting on the success, CEO, Jean-Noël de Galzain, explained, 'this is a massive achievement for all of the WALLIX team and recognition of the international and strategic vision we have for our WAB Suite.'

CLARANET CHOOSES WALLIX TO SECURE ITS e-HEALTH SERVICE OFFERING







CLARANET CHOOSES WALLIX TO SECURE ITS e-HEALTH SERVICE OFFERING   (02/05/2017 18:00)

WALLIX GROUP, a software company providing cyber security and governance solutions for information systems access (Privileged Access Management - PAM), chooses WALLIX ADMINBASTION Suite to secure data access for e-health clients and meet the compliance requirements of the French Ministry of Health's HDS accreditation for data host providers.


A two-pronged challenge


        HDS-accredited since 2010, Claranet is Europe's leading supplier of hosting services and managed hosting services for critical applications as well as one of the leading hosted services provider for the health sector in France through its Claranet e-Santé offer - a positioning that requires the implementation of traceability systems for e-health platforms access.
      

        It also manages the outsourcing and remote access requirements of the IT divisions of clients that range from hospitals to SaaS platforms, software editors, medical device providers and start-up companies.
      

Wide-scale deployment of Bastion from WALLIX


        A trusted provider for health care sector clients, Claranet uses Bastion from WALLIX to guarantee ironclad secure access to hybrid cloud environments for administrative teams and users from the private and public sectors - an invaluable solution that allows both Claranet and its clients to safely access and manage their platforms.
      

        Today, access to all of the e-health platforms hosted by Claranet migrates via Bastion, accounting for around 700 servers, more than 500 users, 120 clients and approximately 70 same-time connections.
      

        As well as the flexibility it offers administrators, Bastion also helps to heighten awareness amongst users of best practices for data protection and simplifies information systems governance.
      

'Bastion has become the reference for the e-health sector. It is a trusted product that reassures our clients. Today, Claranet is a hosted provider that is recognized for offering its clients maximum security and traceability for user connections and events on e-health platforms. Bastion helps us achieve our targets and has proven its worth for audits, the detection of intrusions and with requests from France's data protection agency, the CNIL. We are very pleased with the e-health offer and, down the line, will be looking to extend Bastion to Claranet Web and then to the rest of our park' said Emmanuel Novice, eHealth Market Director for CLARANET.
      

'We are delighted to be able to work alongside such a recognized provider on their e-health offer. This collaboration is confirmation of the successful technological ramp-up of our solution for a sector that remains central to our development.

WALLIX GROUP, a software company providing cyber security and governance solutions for information systems access (Privileged Access Management - PAM), chooses WALLIX ADMINBASTION Suite to secure data access for e-health clients and meet the compliance requirements of the French Ministry of Health's HDS accreditation for data host providers.


        Paris - 4/28/2017
      

A two-pronged challenge


        HDS-accredited since 2010, Claranet is Europe's leading supplier of hosting services and managed hosting services for critical applications as well as one of the leading hosted services provider for the health sector in France through its Claranet e-Santé offer - a positioning that requires the implementation of traceability systems for e-health platforms access.It also manages the outsourcing and remote access requirements of the IT divisions of clients that range from hospitals to SaaS platforms, software editors, medical device providers and start-up companies.
      

Wide-scale deployment of Bastion from WALLIX


        A trusted provider for health care sector clients, Claranet uses Bastion from WALLIX to guarantee ironclad secure access to hybrid cloud environments for administrative teams and users from the private and public sectors - an invaluable solution that allows both Claranet and its clients to safely access and manage their platforms. Today, access to all of the e-health platforms hosted by Claranet migrates via Bastion, accounting for around 700 servers, more than 500 users, 120 clients and approximately 70 same-time connections. As well as the flexibility it offers administrators, Bastion also helps to heighten awareness amongst users of best practices for data protection and simplifies information systems governance.
      

'Bastion has become the reference for the e-health sector. It is a trusted product that reassures our clients. Today, Claranet is a hosted provider that is recognized for offering its clients maximum security and traceability for user connections and events on e-health platforms. Bastion helps us achieve our targets and has proven its worth for audits, the detection of intrusions and with requests from France's data protection agency, the CNIL. We are very pleased with the e-health offer and, down the line, will be looking to extend Bastion to Claranet Web and then to the rest of our park' said Emmanuel Novice, eHealth Market Director for CLARANET.
      

'We are delighted to be able to work alongside such a recognized provider on their e-health offer. This collaboration is confirmation of the successful technological ramp-up of our solution for a sector that remains central to our development. Thanks to WALLIX ADMINBASTION, Claranet has a custom-fit resource that is perfectly suited to its data security needs, is easy to use, needs no intermediary agent and can be adapted to their infrastructure - all benefits which allow them to focus on their core business' said Xavier Lefaucheux, VP Sales for WALLIX Group.
