For HAYNE, it is essential that every technology provider we work with shares our ethos in terms of quality and punctual delivery. Every partnership must represent a meaningful addition to our range. HAYNE thoroughly examined what LucaNet has achieved so far, and also the functionalities, performance and future development plans it had to offer. We were impressed by what we saw.

 Free Limit Reached. The Content is Temporary Locked! 



Why my account is limited to only few analytic runs? 

								To execute equity pricing pattern simulations, real time valuations, recommendations, instant reporting, and portfolio analytics such as mean-variance optimization takes huge amount of 
								computing resources. Since we are a small company we cannot afford to have
								hundreds of servers in our cluster. To be fair to all of our users with free accounts, 
								we have restricted analytics execution to few times.  Please upgrade 
								your account to be able to remove usage restrictions and unlock all the features and tools used by professional money mangers.
								
I don't want to upgrade at this time. Are there any other options? 
	
								Yes, just show us your support and love and we will temporary re-enable the content. 
								To instantly unlock the content for few additional page views, use one of the social buttons below. 
								We thank you for your continued support and appreciate your loyalty as we try to make this service accessible and affordable to all investors.

 Free Limit Reached. The Content is Temporary Locked! 



Why my account is limited to only few analytic runs? 

								To execute equity pricing pattern simulations, real time valuations, recommendations, instant reporting, and portfolio analytics such as mean-variance optimization takes huge amount of 
								computing resources. Since we are a small company we cannot afford to have
								hundreds of servers in our cluster. To be fair to all of our users with free accounts, 
								we have restricted analytics execution to few times.  Please upgrade 
								your account to be able to remove usage restrictions and unlock all the features and tools used by professional money mangers.
								
I don't want to upgrade at this time. Are there any other options? 
	
								Yes, just show us your support and love and we will temporary re-enable the content. 
								To instantly unlock the content for few additional page views, use one of the social buttons below. 
								We thank you for your continued support and appreciate your loyalty as we try to make this service accessible and affordable to all investors.
