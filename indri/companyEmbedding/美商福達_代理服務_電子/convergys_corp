The combined communications software assets of Convergys IM, NetCracker, and NEC create the largest and most comprehensive end-to-end BSS/OSS offering in the industry."This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to bringing the most innovative software solutions to service providers around the globe," said Dr. Nobuhiro Endo, President of NEC. "The rapid integration of the Convergys IM business into NetCracker will optimize business operations and leverage powerful new synergies with NEC."The need for advanced BSS solutions is being driven by the fast emerging Gigabit society that demands access to content and connectivity anytime, anywhere, on any device. Service providers must have the ability to monetize the surging data traffic and - at the same time - meet customer demands for quality and a compelling user experience. This requires a new approach to BSS, one that is driven by productized and flexible platforms, real-time rating and charging, and new cost models that leverage managed services and the cloud infrastructure."With a track record of delivering customer success that spans two decades, we know what it takes to make BSS/OSS transformation possible," said Andrew Feinberg, President and CEO of NetCracker Technology.
