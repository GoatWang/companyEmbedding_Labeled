Product Detail Information
Features
As one of the leading engine builders in the world, the Engine and Machinery. Division of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (HHI-EMD) has been manufacturing a wide range of pumps for more than 30 years.
On 9th of May in 2007 HHI-EMD added LNG marine pumps to the Hyundai Pumps. Product Line in a License and Technical Assistance Agreement with Carter Cryogenics Company LLC (JC Carter), the inventor of the submerged motor cryogenic pump, and SNECMA, a leading company in aero and space engine.
Hyundai - JC Carter - SNECMA LNG marine pumps meet customer s design requirements as well as the applicable standards, codes, rules and regulations. Our Quality system has been evaluated and registered in accordance with ISO Standards,and is certified to ISO 9001.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. manufactures cargo pumps developed jointly by SNECMA and Carter Cryogenics Company (JC Carter). The design is based on :

40 years experience of JC Carter in LNG Carrier cargo pump
The application of proven Space Technology to LNG cargo pumps

The cargo pump is a vertical submerged motor centrifugal pump, with very low NPSH capability, designed in compliance with IGC and IEC norms, as well as with API 610.
The pump rotates in the counter clockwise direction viewed from the pump inlet and is driven by theelectric motor, a form wound, squirrel cage, 6,600 V, 4 pole, driver designed to operate in cryogenic fluid.

Features
HHI -JC CARTER-SNECMA LNG Cargo pump offers the following advantages:

Designed for utmost NPSHr performance, which provides the highest storage availability and safe ultimate stripping capability.
Optimized hydraulic design for the best efficiency.
Highest reliability and availability with minimum maintenance over a design life of 40 years.


Hydraulic Coverage
Flow rate and head rise nominal capabilities are shown in the chart. Applications below this domain can be met by existing JC Carter LNG cargo pumps. HHI - JC CARTER -SNECMA canstudy applications above this domain to fulfill your needs. The safe continuous operating domain ranges from 30% to 120% of the reference flow rate chosen in this operating domain.

Materials

Shaft : 17.4 PH Stainless steel
Standard Bearings : Stainless steel
Inducer & Impeller : Aluminum alloy
Housings : Aluminum alloy
Seal Stators : Bronze-based material




The main flow channel is comprised of :







A suction stage, comprising successively an inducer and deswirler
A single-stage centrifugal stage, comprising successively the impeller and the axial diffuser




The secondary flows are designed to provide :




A proper cooling of the two bearings
A proper cooling of the electric motor
A proper operation of the Active Axial Balancing System





Axial stage design choice
Spiral & variable pitch increases the impeller inlet pressure and improves the suction performance. Inducer is derived from space turbo-machineries. The combination of the suction stage and the centrifugal stage insures optimized performance over a wide range of flow rates and tank liquid levels. HHI-JC CARTER-SNECMA Cargo pumps bring benefits to customers with excellent tank stripping, less BOG and considerable power reduction.

Maintenance
Optimized maintenance has been achieved due to the strong emphasis on maintenance aspects at design stage. All maintenance can be performed with pump facing in its normal orientation. Straightforward access to rotating parts and bearing : both bearings can be changed without any tilting once the pump inlet is facing upward.

Spray Pump




A vertical, 3560 rpm centrifugal pump, with integral 440 V, 3 Phase, 60 Hz, 2 Pole, submersible 35 kW electrical motor.
The pump is configured, with a balance drum, as a fixed, in-tank, stripping and spray pump. JC CARTER has supplied more than 160 of these pumps for LNG carriers.







Emergency Pump







A vertical, 3560 rpm centrifugal pump, with integral 440 V, 3 Phase, 60 Hz, 2 Pole, submersible 200 kW electrical motor. The pump is configured, with a balance drum, as a removable, in-tank emergency pump.

Optimized design for 16"diameter and can be installed in 24" or 16" pump columns.
Benefits : 

Reduced column cost if adapted to pump diameter 16"
Reduced size and weight, easier to handle







Fuel Pump




A vertical, centrifugal pump, with integral 440 V, 3 Phase, 60 Hz, 2 Pole, submersible 10 kW electrical motor.

The pump is configured, as a fixed, in-tank, gas fuel supply pump

A dedicated fuel pump (15 ㎥/h at 140 to 230 m) with latest inducer design to ensure good pump behavior with lowest LNG level despite wave induced motion during sea voyages.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
