It can mimic the appearance of granite, marble, stone, and other naturally occurring materials, and can be joined nearly invisibly by a trained craftsman. Typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops, solid surface can also be cast into a variety of shapes, including sinks, shower pans and bathtubs. Sheet goods can also be heated and bent into three-dimensional shapes using a process called thermoforming, which adds to the versatility of the product. Color and design flexibility are key factors when choosing engineered composites over natural stone.      Application        Related Items Click Here for more details!Contact SupplierClick here to send inquiry!Packaging & Shipping About Packing   Packing: Export Standard Carton With Pallet  1.

	What is HI-MACS®?

	HI-MACS® is an outstanding material. A delicate composition of acrylic, minerals and natural pigments that combine to create a smooth,
	non porous, thermoformable and visually seamless surface.

	 

	The material meets the highest standards for quality in all aspects: material performance, fabrication, functionality and hygiene.
	Thanks a large part to this quality and the outstanding flexibility in fabrication and design, HI-MACS® offers countless advantages
	over conventional materials.

	 

	HI-MACS®. Because Quality Wins.
