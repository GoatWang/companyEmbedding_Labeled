Company Overview

Considering peers, relative outperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a leading position.


Shenzhen Hirisun Technology Incorporated Class A currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (10.06) than its peer median (3.50).


300277-CN‘s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P/E or Price/EBITDA are not meaningful to make this analysis between operating advantage (ROE) and growth expectations (as suggested by P/E or P/EBITDA).


300277-CN has relatively low profit margins and median asset efficiency.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


Over the last five years, 300277-CN‘s return on assets has eroded from above median to below median among its peers suggesting declining relative operating performance.


The company’s relatively low gross and pre-tax margins suggest a non-differentiated product portfolio and not much control on operating costs relative to peers.


300277-CN‘s earnings and EBITDA are both negative which suggest that P/E or Price/EBITDA are not meaningful for an analysis between historical growth (using annualized three-year revenue growth) and investor growth expectations (as suggested by P/E or Price/EBITDA) .


The company’s relatively low level of capital investment and below peer median returns on capital suggest that the company is in maintenance mode.


300277-CN‘s operating performance may not allow it to raise additional debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
300277-CN would seem to have a hard time raising additional debt.

With debt at a relatively low 1.39% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 2.04%), and relatively tight interest coverage level of -18.88x, 300277-CN would have a hard time raising much additional debt. Thus, the company is classified as having Limited Flexibility when it comes to raising more debt.


All 4 peers for the company have an outstanding debt balance.

	Shenzhen Hirisun Technology Inc operates within the Computer integrated systems design sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Shenzhen Hirisun Technology Inc with three other
	
			companies in this sector in China:
		
	Beijing Tongtech Co Ltd
	
		(2016
	sales of 325.51 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$48.39  million]
		of which 60%
		was Telecom),
	
	Boomsense Technology Co Ltd
	
		(361.83 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$53.79  million]
		of which 100%
		was System Integrated), and
	
	Shenzhen Anche Technologies Co Ltd
	
		(318.18 million Chinese Renmimbi [US$47.30  million]
		of which 90%
		was Manufacturing).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Shenzhen Hirisun Technology Inc were 318.47 million Chinese Renmimbi (US$47.34 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
			a
			
			decrease of 22.4%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 410.42 million Chinese Renmimbi.
	
		The sales level in 2016 was fairly close to the level five years ago: in 2011, Shenzhen Hirisun Technology Inc had sales
		of 350.47 million Chinese Renmimbi.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 23.3% decline
		in Computer Application Services, from 408.39 million Chinese Renmimbi to 313.16 million Chinese Renmimbi.
		.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Property Leasing (up 147.3% to 5.38 million Chinese Renmimbi)
