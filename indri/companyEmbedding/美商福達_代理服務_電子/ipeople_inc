iPeople, Inc.: Price momentum supported by strong fundamentals 
May 11, 2016 by CapitalCube 


iPeople, Inc. relative valuation is UNDERVALUED and it has a fundamental analysis score of 91.
Our analysis is based on comparing iPeople, Inc. with the following peers – DFNN Inc., ISM Communications Corporation, F&J Prince Holdings Corp. Class A and Paxys Inc. (DFNN-PH, ISM-PH, FJP-PH and PAX-PH).
iPeople, Inc. has shown excellent performance overall, both over the last one year as well as over the last month. In fact, iPeople, Inc.’s price momentum over the last month, at 10.94% has been better than that over the last year, which was 4.68%. Also from a peer group perspective, iPeople, Inc. has performed better, since the peer group performance was -0.39% over the last month.

Company Snapshot

From a peer analysis perspective, relative outperformance last month is up from a median performance last year.


iPeople Inc. currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (2.23) than its peer median (0.91).


IPO-PH‘s operating performance is relatively good compared to its peers. The market currently does not expect high earnings growth relative to its peers but seems to expect the company to maintain its relatively high rates of return.


IPO-PH has a successful operating model with relatively high net profit margins and asset turns.


The company’s year-on-year change in revenues and earnings are better than the median among its peer group.


IPO-PH‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years suggest that its relatively high operating returns are sustainable.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While IPO-PH‘s revenues in recent years have grown faster than the peer median, the market gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median suggesting that the market has some questions about the company’s long-term strategy.


The company’s level of capital investment suggests it might be under-investing in a business with above median returns.


IPO-PH has the financial and operating capacity to borrow quickly.


Our analysis rates iPeople, Inc. as UNDERVALUED relative to its peers.


Share Price Performance
From a peer analysis perspective, relative outperformance last month is up from a median performance last year.
While IPO-PH‘s change in share price of 4.68% for the last 12 months is in line with its peer median, its more recent  30-day share price performance of 10.94% is above the peer median. This suggests the company’s performance has improved more recently relative to peers.

The Leadership team has a strong vision for the future and is dedicated to doing what needs to be done to improve the customer experience, and proves so daily. The company is understanding and supportive of it's employees and listens to all feedback. The energy is positive and this is a great place to be.ConsCompany is smaller, less than 50 employees - so everyone is really familiar with everyone else. Can at times feel like high school.Advice to ManagementContinue to trust your gut and do what is necessary to propel the company into the future, your employees trust you and are excited about what the future holds!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Interface People Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interface People 2016-10-17 15:11 PDT Aug 17, 2016 Helpful (3)"An Overall Solid Company"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Software Developer in Lewisville, TXFormer Employee - Software Developer in Lewisville, TXRecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOPros- Great people and great culture- Company goes out of its way to treat employees- Flexibility in schedule when life events come up- Paid paternity leave, amount of PTO is above industry standard- Benefits are ridiculously good- Casual dress- Autonomy as a developer(with product owner approval)I overall really enjoyed my time at IPeople. The company has a great vibe to it and everyone is friendly. I got the vibe that most people were there because they really enjoyed the company. One of the things I liked is that developers have a lot of autonomy in shaping the product, if you have and idea, you can take it to the product owner and if they agree, you can code it into the product.The company regularly stocks the kitchen with snacks, sodas, fresh fruit, etc. They also have pizza on most Wednesdays. This was a huge perk and a sign that the company wanted to go above and beyond to keep employees happy.The company is very flexible and understanding when family events come up, they will work with you and give you time off as needed for doctors appointments, etc.They are pretty much the only company that offers paid paternity leave in addition to your already given PTO, this is a big deal. My son was born during my time a IPeople and the company was really accommodating about me taking time off and happily welcomed me back.The amount of time off with this company is great. You get your standard couple weeks off, then on top of that the company pays employees to take time off during Thanksgiving and Christmas. They did change this for 2016 to make it so you chose either holiday instead of both but this was actually one of the major things that made me accept my offer.Dress is casual, you'll see most people wearing jeans, shorts, flip flops, etc.... pretty much anything goes.Advice to those considering Interface People: If you're on the fence and here because your are considering interviewing or joining IPeople, do it. Its a great company, it does have flaws but I've overall liked working here.Cons- Leadership sometimes feels disorganized- At times it feels like we ship software without proper QA- The normal downsides of working for a small company(wearing many hats, etc.)One of the things I struggled with was the fact that there wasn't a barrier between leaderships decision making and the development teams. Some people like this but it took away from development time. Leadership would include developers into decision making meetings where it felt like they already had their mind made up. The better solution would be that leadership makes these decisions and then relays that through the product owner, scrum masters, etc. Developers should only be included in meetings where they are a technical resource, not business decision meetings. Some people may actually like that they are part of the day to day business but I just wanted to code.I wish we had a legit QA person. Some teams had a QA person but they also had other duties. Our team unfortunately did not have a QA person, the expectation is that developers QA their own stuff before committing and unit tests were being written.... which is true, we did that but a dedicated QA would catch so many things that we just don't think to try.Advice to ManagementEmbrace the Agile/Scrum process and fully understand what continuous deployment means. Don't spend every sprint review focusing on what the product doesn't have.Separation of concerns does't just apply to software itself, it applies to employees. Let developers be developers, not QA, not delivery, not support, etc.Keep up the employee appreciation.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Interface People Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interface People 2016-08-17 07:19 PDT Aug 16, 2016"A changing company adapting to the times, with some deliberation"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Lewisville, TXCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Lewisville, TXRecommendsNeutral OutlookI have been working at Interface People full-timeProsPeople who careFlexible with time and duties outside of workTrust is finally being built between upper level management and employeesConsPay is low compared to marketStill struggling to find niche in the marketAdvice to ManagementContinue to trust your employees, but offer guidance.

If you don't drink the company kool-aid, you're in for a tough time. You'll see favoritism and upper management that is totally disconnected from the day to day operations.Instead of listening to what the clients want or expect from the products, management determines what features should be worked on. Several products are riddled with "You what would be cool?" ideas that are not based on market research.30+ people have left or been laid off since 2013, which is a lot for a company this small. Most have not been replaced, so more work falls on fewer and fewer people.Sales promises clients custom work on short timelines, leaving employees running to put out fires instead of devoting time to improving the product line.The product codebase is based on older technology (Winforms, Webforms, Silverlight 4). The codebase needs to be upgraded, but the lack of available personnel complicates this.Low pay compared to market.Advice to ManagementFocus on projects and products that bring money in, and shelve your pet projects like Trax and Sharepoint.You assumed employees left for more money, but that's only part of it. People left because they saw this place go from a fun innovative place to a grueling treadmill of fighting issues while their concerns and requests for help fell on deaf ears. It's hard enough to deliver products on short timelines, but then to receive little to no support from directors, it's an untenable situation.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Interface People Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interface People 2015-04-27 19:20 PDT Apr 25, 2014 Helpful (6)"Smart Developers, Bad Managers"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Support in Lewisville, TXCurrent Employee - Support in Lewisville, TXDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Interface People full-timeProsThis company has great benefits - health insurance, 401K, and even a stocked break room with snacks and drinks for employees. It's also a big plus that the dress code is very casual. Even flip-flops are okay here.ConsCompany policies are not applied equally, regardless of whether or not they are in the Employee Handbook. If you can simply get the owners, the VP (a salesperson) on your side, then you're worry-free. Rules are changed frequently, faster than an updated Employee Handbook can be printed. If you don't like a rule, just wait a few minutes; they change faster than the weather here in Texas. And be careful what you say to others because the owners have some loyal followers.Advice to ManagementJust because someone is a smart developer, programmer or salesperson, does not mean they make a good manager. Some people should never be promoted to leadership positions and there are others that just need proper coaching and training. Quit letting a self-motivated person make your business decisions. Listen to your employees - all of them - not just a select few.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Interface People Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interface People 2014-04-25 12:04 PDT Mar 30, 2014 Helpful (1)"Best job I have ever had..."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Computer Programmer in Lewisville, TXCurrent Employee - Computer Programmer in Lewisville, TXRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Interface People full-time (More than 5 years)ProsExcellent people, excellent facilities.Management actually listens to employees.A very friendly work-environment.I hope to still be working here the day I retire.ConsSome products are released before they are ready.
