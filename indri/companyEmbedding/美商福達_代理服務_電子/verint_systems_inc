Verint Systems is a Melville, New York-based analytics company which was founded in 2002. The company sells software and hardware products for security, surveillance, and business intelligence.[1] Their products are designed to assist clients in data analysis, specifically large data sets.[2]
Verint has more than 10,000 clients in 150 countries,[3] and has approximately 2,800 employees in various locations internationally.[citation needed] The company was previously a majority-owned subsidiary of Comverse Technology[4] and it was formerly known as Comverse Infosys.[5] As with Comverse, approximately half of Verint's employees have been located in Israel.[5] In February 2013, Verint Systems became independent of Comverse, having bought out the latter's stake in it.[6]

History[edit]
Founding, early years[edit]
Verint started as Comverse Technology's Comverse Infosys business unit, which was created in 1999[7] although it was also incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Comverse Technology.[dubious – discuss] Verint's initial focus was on the commercial call recording market, which at the time was transitioning from analog tape to digital recorders. On June 7, 1999, the company released an Internet Call Waiting service.[8]
Expansion and name change[edit]
In 1999, Comverse Infosys was combined with another division of Comverse focused on security and the communications interception market. In 2001, Verint expanded into video security by combining with Loronix Information Systems, Inc., which had been previously acquired by Comverse.[citation needed] In 2002, Comverse Infosys changed its name to Verint Systems Inc.[9]
IPO, acquisitions[edit]
In May 2002, Verint completed an IPO and became a public company, although it was still majority owned by Comverse Technology. Since 2006 Verint has acquired several other companies such as MultiVision Intelligent Surveillance Limited, a networked video security business; CM Insight Limited, a UK-based, customer management company; Mercom Systems Inc., a interaction recording and performance evaluation company; ViewLinks Euclipse Ltd., an Israeli-based provider of data mining and link analysis software; and Witness Systems, Inc. a workforce optimization company.[10]
In July 2008[11] Amit Bohensky founded Focal-Info,[12] a software company focused on web data extraction and analytics. The following month Focal-Info had been bought by Verint for an undisclosed amount, with Bohensky hired back on to lead Focal-Info's "extendend activity" within Verint.[13][14] A subsequent acquisition was of Iontas, in early 2010, a provider of desktop analytics solutions.[10]
Beginning with a stock options backdating scandal in 2006, parent company Comverse Technology suffered a series of financial reporting problems, losses and layoffs, with one consequence that both Comverse and Verint were delisted from the NASDAQ stock market in 2007 and ended up on the Pink Sheets.[15] In July 2010, Verint was relisted on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol VRNT.[16] By that year, there was considerable talk that Comverse Technology would sell its remaining interest in Verint, with some private equity firms mentioned as possible buyers.[4][17] In September 2011, Verint acquired Global Management Technologies Corporation, paying around $25 million for it.[18]
Full independence[edit]
In August 2012, Verint announced that it would buy out Comverse Technology's stake in it, in a transaction valued at around $800 million.[19] An FBR Capital Markets analyst said the move "finally eliminates a major overhang on the name by removing Comverse's majority ownership stake."[19] The deal was finalized in February 2013.[6]
On February 3, 2014, Verint Systems completed acquisition of KANA Software Inc. from Accel-KKR for $514.2 million.[20]
On November 16, 2016, Verint Systems completed acquisition of the customer experience software company OpinionLab for an undisclosed amount.[21]
Products[edit]
Verint's products include speech analysis software (used to analyze call center recordings) and IP surveillance cameras and "smart" video surveillance analysis software.[22][23][24]
Verint's RELIANT software provides law enforcement agencies with the ability to monitor and analyze voice, video, and data for a "vast number of targets" on all types of large, complex computer networks, in order to collect evidence for CALEA wiretaps.[25] Multiple national governments including the U.S., U.K., and various European, Asian, and Pacific nations have purchased millions of dollars in Verint surveillance software and equipment.[26][27][28][29]
On January 27, 1997, Comverse Technology Inc. announced the formation of a new private equity fund in partnership with Quantum Industrial Holdings Ltd.[30]
Verint has also received millions of dollars in government contracts to outfit airports, shipping ports, and government facilities with intelligent video surveillance systems with tracking, biometrics, and video analysis features. For example, Unisys chose Verint as a subcontractor on its contract with the Transportation Security Administration, to install video surveillance devices in secure areas of airports across the U.S.[31]
In July 2009, AMR Research ranked Verint 20th in its list of the top 50 global enterprise application vendors.[32] During the latter portion of the decade of the 2000s, the company has won several awards from CRM Magazine.[33]

Verint's Customer Engagement Product CategoriesWorkforce OptimisationVerint workforce optimization solutions work across the enterprise, helping organizations gain deeper visibility into organizational performance and customer needs. By leveraging this intelligence, your business can better engage customers, deliver a more consistent customer experience, and gain valuable insight for continually refining products, services, processes, operations, and staffing.Quality ManagementVerint offers quality management and quality monitoring solutions to meet a wide range of contact center needs. From simple to sophisticated, contact centers around the world rely on our quality management solutions to help them increase revenue, enhance customer satisfaction, and manage performance, processes, and costs.Call RecordingOrganizations around the globe rely on Verint recording solutions for full-time and compliance recording. We offer recording solutions for call centers, contact centers, and trading rooms of all sizes, whether they use traditional time-division multiplex (TDM) recording, Internet protocol (IP) recording, session-initiated protocol (SIP)—or a combination of these.Workforce ManagementHaving the right number of employees—with the right skills—in place at the right time is a critical link in delivering superior customer service and managing costs. Verint offers enterprise workforce management (WFM) solutions to help organizations strike the optimal balance between workload and staffing—in contact centers and across the enterprise, including branches and back-office operations.Performance ManagementManaging performance and productivity is no easy task, given the multiple functions, disparate systems, and complex processes typical of the enterprise customer service environment. Verint Performance Management provides a single, standardized framework for efficiently tracking, managing, and improving individual and team performance across your enterprise, from contact centers and branches to back-office operations.Desktop and Process AnalyticsThe cost and quality of customer service depend heavily on employee efficiency and accuracy. Work can slow to a crawl when systems are cumbersome, applications are complex and unintuitive, or business processes are flawed. Verint Desktop and Process Analytics can provide insight into how employees use applications and systems to perform their work in contact centers, branches, and back-office operations.eLearningBuilding and keeping employee skills sharp can be a continual challenge for many organizations, particularly as products, services, processes, and staffing change over time. That's why Verint offers Web-based eLearning and Lesson Management functionality that can deliver training right to the employee desktop.CoachingVerint Coaching is a practical solution to help contact centers and back-office operations make employee coaching a part of daily operations. It provides out-of-the-box workflow for assigning, delivering, and tracking employee coaching, helping organizations offer employees better guidance on developing and enhancing their skills.Speech AnalyticsNothing can tell you more about your business than the voice of your customers, but the sheer number of recorded customer conversations in your contact centre can easily exceed your ability to review and analyse them. With Verint Speech Analytics, you can glean valuable intelligence from thousands — even millions — of customer calls quickly, so you can take action quickly.Text AnalyticsCollecting, analyzing, and acting on what your customers say is critical for improving satisfaction—and for ensuring the ongoing success of your organization. With Verint Text Analytics, you can capture feedback from multiple channels, interpret it in the context of business objectives, and empower your organization to drive change.Enterprise Feedback ManagementThe relationship you have with customers and employees is constantly evolving. To stay ahead of the competition, progressive organizations actively listen—they gather, analyze, and act on feedback that helps enhance products, improve loyalty, and increase revenue. With Verint Enterprise Feedback Management, organizations can centralize customer and employee feedback across IVR, email, Web, SMS, and mobile channels, then take action quickly.Engagement AnalyticsToday’s customers use multiple communication channels—often simultaneously—to interact with your business. With Verint Engagement Analytics, you can capture, analyze, and correlate massive amounts of data on customer interactions, journeys, and profiles to help enhance customer and employee engagement and drive better business strategies.Time and AttendanceVerint Time and Attendance provides an automated, accurate means for collecting, approving, and reporting on employee time across your enterprise, helping you manage staff time more effectively while facilitating compliance with labor laws. It provides real-time data that organizations can use to control labor costs, improve workforce productivity, and enhance customer service.
