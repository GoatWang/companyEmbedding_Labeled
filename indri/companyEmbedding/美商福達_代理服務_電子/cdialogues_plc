LSE:CDOG: Pre-Close Trading Update and Notice of Results

RNS Number : 7971M CDialogues PLC 25 January 2016

CDialogues plc
("CDialogues", the "Company" or the "Group")
 
 
Pre-Close Trading Update and Notice of Results
CDialogues plc (AIM: CDOG), the provider of mobile marketing solutions to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), provides a trading update for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015.
 
Further to the announcements made on 17 November 2015 and 18 September 2015, CDialogues reports that revenues for the full year are expected to be approximately €8.8 million (2014: €9.9 million). During 2015, CDialogues operated mobile marketing projects in six countries across the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
 
EBITDA for the period is expected to be approximately €2.0 million (2014: €2.9 million). The EBITDA margin decreased due to lower revenue during the second half of 2015 and the continued investment in business and product development. 
 
Free Cash Flow for the year exceeded €1.4 million (2014: €1.2 million) further enhancing the Company's cash position to €3.6 million as of 31 December 2015 (31.12.2014: €2.4 million). The Group therefore maintains a strong balance sheet to fund future growth.  
 
Outlook
 
Subscription-based recurring revenues, which provide greater scalability and visibility for the business, accounted for more than 75% of the total revenues during 2015 as a whole and therefore provide the Company with a strong basis for the current year. 
 
Furthermore, the Company has identified a pipeline of potential new projects, a number of which are currently undergoing preparations for launch in the coming months. The Board therefore believes that CDialogues should benefit from these during 2016, as the Company adds new capabilities to its product suite and widens its customer footprint.
 
Notice of Results 
 
CDialogues will announce its full year results for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015 on Monday 11 April 2016.
 
Pale Spanos, Chief Executive Officer, commented: "During 2015, the Company continued to develop its operations and remains focused on growing its customer base and geographic reach. Investment in products and new business opportunities ensure that the Company has a strong foundation for growth and new project launches in the coming months."

About CDialogues
 
CDialogues provides mobile marketing solutions enabling MNOs to retain and acquire market share, increase average revenue per user (ARPU) and reducing subscriber churn.
 
The Company's products and services deliver fully managed solutions, utilizing advanced Data analytics techniques combined with Linguistic engineering marketing, to build awareness and multiply sales and opt-ins of promotional offerings and other mobile content being offered by the MNOs.
 
The solutions designed by the Company, are tailored and served with the appropriate Linguistic format, to each individual mobile network subscriber typology and geography it operates in, using its proprietary software and scalable infrastructure.
 
The majority of CDialogues' revenues are derived from a recurring subscription-based revenue model, which has been pioneered by the Company. As a result, the Company benefits from incremental cash flow growth from each new campaign customer and mobile network subscriber. 
 
The Company's near-term focus is on growing both its customer base and expanding its geographic footprint in selected markets in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia, where mobile device penetration and mobile network usage is growing rapidly.
 
CDialogues has been profitable and cash flow positive since commercial operations began in early 2012.
