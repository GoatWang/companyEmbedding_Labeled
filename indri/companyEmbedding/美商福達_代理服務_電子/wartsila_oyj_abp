Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]

Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]

CEO review
2015 was in many ways a successful year for Wärtsilä. Net sales and profitability grew steadily from the previous year as a result of the company’s well-positioned offering, its growing Services business, and the focus on continuous improvement. Given the developments in our market environment, we can be pleased with our performance.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

        Wärtsilä launches new long life seal ring for use with Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants
      

        Wärtsilä Corporation, Trade press release, 9 October 2013 at 11 am EET
      

        Wärtsilä, the marine industry's leading solutions and services provider, has launched its new Bio Seal Ring product for maritime stern tube seal applications. The Wärtsilä Bio Seal Ring is the first seal on the market that works with Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants (EAL), sometimes known as bio-degradable oils, for a lifetime of at least five years. Conventional seal rings are recommended to be changed at two and a half year intervals.
      

        The benefits offered by the Wärtsilä Bio Seal Ring to ship owners and operators are both environmental and economic. The extended operating life expectancy has a significantly positive impact on dry-dock scheduling and related costs. The unique features of the Wärtsilä Bio Seal Ring have been achieved through improvements in the material formula by including new additives. The product has been tested extensively and proven in the Wärtsilä Seals and Bearings' R&D facility.
      

        This solution is suited to fixed pitched propeller systems. Wärtsilä recommends that ship owners consult with the propulsion original equipment manufacturers to confirm EAL compatibility for controllable pitch propeller systems.
      

        The new product enables compliance with the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Vessel General Permit 2013 legislation which comes into force on 19th December 2013. From this date all commercial vessels over 79ft operating in US waters will be required to use EALs in all oil to water interfaces unless deemed technically infeasible to do so. At least 10 - 20 % of all merchant vessels trade and tonnage wise in the world operate in US waters.
      

        "The new Wärtsilä Bio Seal Ring represents the latest development in this field. It conforms with the latest EPA legislation relating to the use of EALs within stern tube seals. On the global scale, the introduction of this product is fully in line with the marine sector's rapidly developing move towards greater environmental sustainability," says Mr Ryu Onishi, Managing Director, Seals and Bearings Wärtsilä Japan.
      

        In addition to new shipbuilding applications, the Wärtsilä Bio Seal Ring can also be retrofitted to existing vessels. The first deliveries of the product will take place in October of this year.
