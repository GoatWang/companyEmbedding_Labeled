Why my account is limited to only few analytic runs? 

								To execute equity pricing pattern simulations, real time valuations, recommendations, instant reporting, and portfolio analytics such as mean-variance optimization takes huge amount of 
								computing resources. Since we are a small company we cannot afford to have
								hundreds of servers in our cluster. To be fair to all of our users with free accounts, 
								we have restricted analytics execution to few times.  Please upgrade 
								your account to be able to remove usage restrictions and unlock all the features and tools used by professional money mangers.
								
I don't want to upgrade at this time. Are there any other options? 
	
								Yes, just show us your support and love and we will temporary re-enable the content.
