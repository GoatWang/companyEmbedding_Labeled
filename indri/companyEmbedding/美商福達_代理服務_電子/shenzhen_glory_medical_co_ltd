	Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd operates within the Engineering services sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd with three other
	
			companies in this sector in China:
		
	Top Resource Conservation & Environment Corp
	
		(2016
	sales of 1.69 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$250.87  million]
		of which 62%
		was Gas Industry),
	
	Bestway Marine & Energy Technology Co Ltd
	
		(1.61 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$238.68  million]
		of which 46%
		was Services), and
	
	China Design Group Co Ltd
	
		(1.99 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$295.87  million]
		of which 73%
		was Survey and Design service).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd were 1.94 billion Chinese Renmimbi (US$288.46 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
				an
			
			increase of 18.0%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 1.64 billion Chinese Renmimbi.
	
			This was the fifth consecutive year of sales increases at Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd
		(and since 2011, sales have increased a total of 457%).
	
		Sales of Construction Project Income saw an increase
		
			that was more than double the company's growth rate: sales were up
		283.7% in 2016, from
		64.25 million Chinese Renmimbi to 246.53 million Chinese Renmimbi.
		Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd also saw significant increases in sales in
						Medical Consumables (up 27.3% to 1.02 billion Chinese Renmimbi)
					
				.
			
			Not all segments of Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd experienced an increase in sales in 2016:
			sales of Management Service fell 75.2% to 7.32 million Chinese Renmimbi.
			
				(However, this segment's sales were only a very small portion of the company's overall sales).
			Shenzhen Glory Medical Co Ltd also experienced decreases in sales in
						Medical Professional Engineering (down 9.4% to 449.06 million Chinese Renmimbi)
					
						and
					Medical Equipment Sales (down 25.3% to 125.87 million Chinese Renmimbi)
					
						and
					Design Service (down 20.1% to 23.80 million Chinese Renmimbi)

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
