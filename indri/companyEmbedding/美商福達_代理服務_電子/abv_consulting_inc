(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement On Forward-Looking Information."  Business Overview  ABV Consulting, Inc. is in the business of providing merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors, as well as providing additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations as needed. While we do not directly produce alcoholic beverages, we provide services to help businesses in the industry improve their marketing, sales and operations. The Company was founded by Andrew Gavrin, a seasoned businessman who has worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past 5 years after working as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies. Mr. Gavrin recognized the opportunity for a robust independent third party company that could help craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing, promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following 3 years as a strategy consultant.  In March 2016, we entered into an agreement with one of the country's oldest craft brewers to assist in the brewery's marketing strategy. Our efforts during the first quarter of 2016 were primarily focused on securing this engagement, and once signed, providing exceptional work for our client, in order to ensure continuing engagements with the client and referrals to other craft brewers. In addition, we have focused our efforts on social media engagement. We now have almost 11,400 Twitter followers and almost 700 Facebook fans. Through social media, we are continuing to push our message that we are in perfect position to provide marketing support to the growing craft beer industry. We are showcasing our expertise in the industry by highlighting and providing input on key industry issues, offering marketing and sales support ideas, and networking with key opinion makers.  In the first quarter of 2016, we have also maintained our relationship with a start-up cidery in Philadelphia which is expected to commence operations in the back half of 2016. We have held discussions regarding supporting a large festival in the third quarter of 2017, and have continued to hold discussions with breweries and retailers across the country. In May 2016, we will be attending the national Craft Brewers Conference in Philadelphia with the hope of building relationships with additional craft breweries. We will continue delivering for our client under our engagement, will look to expand this relationship and use this as a reference for additional clients, and will continue our aggressive social media campaign.  Despite our efforts to implement our business plan, we have not generated any revenue since inception. As a result, we consider acquiring a business which is either a company that has recently commenced its operations and is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital or is seeking to expand into new markets. Alternatively, a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in an initial public offering.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Use of Estimates in Financial Statements  The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the period covered by these financial statements include the valuation of deferred tax asset and imputed compensation costs.  Emerging Growth Company  We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. Upon becoming a public company, we will be required to comply with certain of these rules, which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Though we will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an "emerging growth company" as of the following December 31, or if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, we would cease to be an "emerging growth company" immediately.  Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an "emerging growth company." At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.  Fair value measurements and Fair value of Financial Instruments  The Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  Level 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  The Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820.  Due to the short-term nature of all financial assets and liabilities, their carrying value approximates their fair value as of the balance sheet date.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605, "Revenue Recognition". In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  The Company recognized revenues from two primary sources:  1. Consulting Services: The marketing and pro bono efforts actively taken by the Company to date have been with the goal of securing clients who will be paying the Company to perform consulting services for them. These clients are expected to be brewers, distributors and retailers.  a. The Company is actively promoting its ability to assist potential clients in a range of services in their marketing, promotion, merchandising and sales efforts. These can include everything from developing a brand from scratch to creating a cohesive marketing strategy to developing a one-off promotion or merchandising concept for a client to executing a series of samplings or promotions.  b. The revenue generated will be dependent on the type of work performed. For a larger strategy project, the Company anticipates charging a client by the hour, whereas for a one-off promotion, a set price will likely be the pricing structure. To provide staffing for implementation of an idea, the Company expects a per event cost structure.  2. Proprietary Events: Based on the success of the charitable beer festival which the Company developed, managed and executed early in 2014, we believe that there is an opportunity to create proprietary events which could generate revenue for the Company. The Company would manage all of the aspects of the event - from the theme to the logistics to the marketing to the staffing and execution, and in turn, would receive all of the revenue from such events.  In addition to the two primary sources of expected revenue outlined above, the Company believes that there will be additional sources, though currently unplanned for, opportunities for revenue. These could include online advertising revenue from other companies looking to attract a similar customer base, providing training on Craft beer to the general public, and licensing custom merchandising pieces for breweries, as well as other opportunities that are yet unforeseen.  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update "ASU" 2014-15 on "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern". Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans,  The amendments in this Update are effective for public entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The effect of adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.  Results of Operations  For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  We have conducted minimal operations during the three months ended March 31, 2016, and we have not generated revenues during this period. We had net losses from operating of $16,160 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to $17,247 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we experienced general and administrative expenses of $3,171 and professional fees of $12,989 for total expenses of $16,160. These expenses consist of professional fees for Legal and Accounting fees. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we experienced general and administrative expenses of $3,175 and professional fees of $14,072 for total expenses of $17,247.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. We have been funding our operations through the sale of our common stock.  Our primary uses of cash have been for legal, accounting and audit fees. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity in the near term:  ? Development of a Company website  ? Exploration of potential marketing and advertising opportunities, and  ? The cost of being a public company  Our net revenues are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. At March 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $ 2,365. Since inception, we raised $68,300 from the sale of common stock and $35,000 in notes from our President and CEO to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We may be required to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations. We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations, without further financing, for up to 12 months. Other than working capital, we presently have no other alternative source of working capital. We may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations. We may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We do not anticipate we will be profitable in 2016. Therefore, our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.  We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly.  Going Concern  As of March 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $128,405 and used cash in operations of $6,148 for the three month ended March 31, 2016. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for professional fees and general and administrative expenses associated with our operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plan provides the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  We do not have any contractual obligations at this time.

create a Craft beer culture in the United States and around the world. Hey, we
never said we weren't ambitious. At ABV, we truly believe that we are at a
tipping point in the beer industry. Craft beer is not a fad. It is here to stay.

sold. We want to change that...  read more. With years of experience marketing and selling
Craft beer, we understand what is needed to open people's eyes to these more
flavorful artisinal brews. Whether our client is a large Craft brewer, a
distributor, a bottle shop, a start-up cidery, a regional chain of bars or even
a charitable organization looking to use Craft beer to drive excitement with
their members, we can help. While we can draw on our experience consulting in
fields from consumer products to pharmaceuticals, we are unlike a typical
marketing agency. We have a keen understanding of the world of Craft beer. We do
not need to be brought up to speed. Our solutions will be tailored specifically

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders as described below in the sections. 
We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common
stock for the selling security holders.


The primary source of competition will come from the manufacturers and 
distributors directly. Those that have the resources and inclination to 
handle these tasks in-house will not need our services. Developing and 
executing such promotions and other marketing techniques is typically one 
of their responsibilities. However, because many do not have the time, 
money or people to do so, they use outside companies such as: 

· Large National and local marketing agencies, such as Digitas 
  (http://digitas.com), Interpublic (http://intercomagency) and Omnicom 
  (http://omnicomgroup.com)  

· Alcoholic beverage sampling companies, such as HausPromotions 
  (http://hauspromotions.com) and CEA (http://classieentertainmentagency.com)
  
·  Local merchandising companies  

The large marketing agencies do not have an expertise in Craft beer, and 
are often too expensive for much of our target market to engage. While the 
sampling companies do have expertise in the alcoholic beverage industry, 
they are geared primarily towards the mass brewers - Anheuser Busch, Miller,
Coors, Crown Imports and Heineken - and other image-driven wine and spirits
companies. As a result, they do not generally have expertise in the 
education needed to effectively promote Craft beers. Local merchandising 
companies are too small to identify and are not widely spread throughout 
all of the major markets. In between these competitors, there is a niche 
area that we plan to fill.


Company Description
We were incorporated on October 15, 2013 under the laws of the state of 
Nevada. We are in the business of providing merchandising and consulting
services to Craft beer brewers and distributors, as well as providing 
additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers 
and


 other organizations as needed. While we do not directly produce 
alcoholic beverages, we provide services to help businesses in the industry
improve their marketing, sales and operations. Our business activities thus
far have been concentrated in and around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
market. 

The company was founded by Andrew Gavrin, a seasoned businessman who has 
worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past 5 years after working 
as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies. 
Mr. Gavrin recognized the need for an independent third party company that
could help Craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing, 
promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following
3 years as a strategy consultant. His experience of developing strategies 
and watching a sales force and distributor implement them with limited 
success due to competing priorities led him to launch the Company. 
Mr. Gavrin began working on our business model in the summer of 2013 and 
formed the Company in October 2013. 

Alcoholic beverages are sold in the on-premise class of trade (bars, 
restaurants, taverns, and similar businesses where drinkers consume the 
alcohol immediately at the location) and the off-premise class of trade 
(grocery stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, package stores and 
other retail locations where drinkers purchase their alcohol to consume 
later outside of the property of the store). The three-tier alcohol 
beverage system in the United States mandates that - with some minor 
exceptions - alcohol beverage manufacturers such as breweries and wineries 
must sell their product through a distributor, who in turn sells it to the 
retailer. Manufacturers and distributors together market the brand in order
to sell it to consumers. Both tiers, manufacturers and distributors, have 
sales forces that have numerous priorities that include executing 
promotions for the brand in the on-premise class of trade, holding sampling
events (where legal) in both on-premise and off-premise locations and 
building displays of the product in the off-premise class of trade. Due to 
limited resources and competing priorities, these sales forces are not as 
effective as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party
that could assist in developing and executing these strategies. 

Based on the experience of Mr. Gavrin, who developed such strategies and the 
implementation plan for the country's largest craft brewer, we will develop 
and execute the following marketing techniques for alcohol beverage 
manufacturers and distributors:

· Providing general branding support, including marketing research, naming,
  and graphic design help  

· Building and merchandising displays of product in the off-premise class
  of trade  

· Executing sampling promotions, where legal, in the on-premise and
  off-premise class of trade  

· Developing and/or executing promotions in the on-premise class of trade  

· Manning sampling booths at local beer festivals

 ABV CONSULTING, INC. (OTCMKTS:ABVN) Files An 8-K Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant

Item 4.01Changes in Registrant’s Certifying
Accountant


Dismissal of Current Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm


On January 17, 2017, ABV Consulting, Inc. (ABV or the Company)
dismissed its independent registered public accounting firm,
Liggett Webb, P.A. (LW).


The reports of LW on the financial statements of the Company for
the past two fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 did
not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was
it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles, with the exception of providing a
qualification as to the Companys ability to continue as a going
concern in each of the Company’s financial statements for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.


The decision to change our independent registered public
accounting firm was recommended and approved by the Companys
board of directors.


During the Companys two most recent fiscal years, the subsequent
interim periods thereto, and through January 17, 2017, the date
of dismissal, (a) the Company and LW had no disagreements on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements,
if not resolved to the satisfaction of LW, would have caused LW
to make reference to the matter in their reports and (b) there
were no reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K.


On January 17, 2017 the Company provided LW with a copy of this
Current Report and has requested that it furnish the Company with
a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of
such letter is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K.


Appointment of New Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm


On January 17, 2017, the Companys board of directors approved the
engagement of Anthony Kam Associates Ltd. (AKAM) as our new
independent registered public accounting firm to audit and review
the Companys financial statements.


During the Companys two most recent fiscal years, the subsequent
interim periods thereto, and through January 17, 2017, the
engagement date of AKAM, neither the Company, nor someone on its
behalf, has consulted AKAM regarding either (i) the application
of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either
completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on the Companys financial statements, and either a
written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was
provided that the new independent registered public accounting
firm concluded was an important factor considered by the Company
in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or
financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the
subject of a disagreement as defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv)
of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in paragraph
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

 ABV Consulting, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ABVN) Files An 8-K Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets


On February 28, 2017, ABV Consulting, Inc. (the Company) closed
the share exchange (the Exchange) to the terms of that certain
Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement), dated February 24,
2017, by and between the Company, Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited, an
international company incorporated in Samoa with limited
liability (APSL), and shareholders holding 50% of the outstanding
equity interests of APSL and listed in Annex I to the Agreement
(the Sellers). In connection with the closing, on February 28,
2017, the Company filed Articles of Exchange with the Secretary
of State for the State of Nevada, which Articles of Exchange
became effective upon filing. See the Companys Current Report on
Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on
February 24, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference, for
a detailed description of the Agreement.


At the closing of the Exchange, the Company acquired 50% of the
outstanding equity interests of APSL from the Sellers, and the
Company issued to the Sellers, pro-rata based on each Sellers
ownership percentage of APSL prior to the Exchange, 1,980,000,000
shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.0001 per share
(representing approximately 99.72% of the Companys outstanding
common stock). As a result, the Sellers became stockholders of
the Company and APSL became a subsidiary of the Company. For
federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Exchange
qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
There exists no material relationship between the Sellers and the
Company, affiliates of the Company, the directors or officers of
the company or any associates of the directors or officers of the
Company.


APSL was incorporated in Samoa on January 11, 2016, for the
purposes of sourcing and developing tourism and
entertainment-related investment projects in Malaysia and
Southeast Asia in connection with the Peoples Republic of Chinas
broad One Belt, One Road regional investment and development
initiative, and for other purposes.


Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity
Securities.


The disclosure in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is
incorporated by reference into this Item. The Company claims an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), for the private
placement of the herein referenced securities, to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder
because, among other things, the transactions did not involve a
public offering, each of the recipients acquired the securities
for investment and not resale, and the Company took appropriate
measures to restrict the transfer of the securities in each
instance.


Item 5.01 Changes in Control of Registrant


The disclosure in Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is
incorporated by reference into this Item. Ms. Ping Zhang owns
5,000,000 common shares of the Company, which comprised 90.37% of
the Companys issued and outstanding stock immediately prior to
the closing of the Exchange. Following the closing of the
Exchange, Ms. Zhangs ownership of the Company was reduced to
0.25%. None of the parties to the Agreement are subject to any
agreement related to the election of directors of the Company,
and there are no arrangements known to the Company which may at a
subsequent date result in a change of control of the Company.


Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.


(a) Financial statements of business acquired.


The financial statements required by this Item, with respect to
the acquisition described in Item 2.01 herein, will be filed by
the Company by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K not
later than 71 days after the date on which this Current Report on
Form 8-K was required to be filed.


(b) Pro forma financial information.


The pro forma financial information required by this Item, with
respect to the acquisition described in Item 2.01 herein, will be
filed by the Company by amendment to this Current Report on Form
8-K not later than 71 days after the date on which this Current
Report on Form 8-K was required to be filed.
