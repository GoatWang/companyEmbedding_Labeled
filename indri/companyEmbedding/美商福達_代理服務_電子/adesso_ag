adesso AG: subsidiary evu.it assumes control of software company dynamicutilities and continues product development activities
Promising new range of products for the energy and water sectors

Dortmund, 14 March 2011 – evu.it GmbH, an adesso subsidiary, has purchased a 100% stake in Münster-based software company dynamicutilities GmbH, primarily from financial investors. Since 2009, dynamicutilities has been working on the dynamic.suite range of products which support business processes of the energy and water sectors. Based on Microsoft Dynamics NAV™, the products are particularly suitable for the mid-range market segment represented by regional and municipal utilities. The first module went on sale in 2010, and the completion of the entire suite is planned for 2011. Marketing has already begun – the products made their debut at the E-world software trade fair. 
The acquisition-price is € 250,000, while additional development costs in the vicinity of € 750,000 are expected before the products reach their break-even point. The company plans to make recoup its investment over the next few years by sales generated from the suite’s introduction and licensing the product to clients. These products are the first to possess a flexible modular and highly ergonomic structure for including all legally required market roles such as sales, networks, metering point operators and retailers. Municipal utilities can make particularly efficient use of the software solutions if the management of public services is once again entrusted to local authorities, as is likely, or if these utilities want to create new electricity and gas brands.evu.it GmbH has been active in this market for ten years. After the acquisition of dynamicutilities GmbH, the company will now become a sector-specific software development and consultancy organisation that focuses its activities exclusively on the SAP AG solution. The acquisition represents another success for adesso Group as it continues with its plans to add an own, sector-specific range of products to the service portfolio. The Executive Board

adesso AG Reports Earnings Results for the First Quarter of 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter and for the Full Year of 2017
May 26 17
adesso AG reported earnings results for the first quarter of 2017. For the quarter, the company increased its sales by 35 % (thereof 25 % organic) compared to the previous year for a total of EUR 75.7 million. Continued employee growth through new hires over the last 12 months, a positive market condition and numerous successful sales initiatives led to rising sales revenues in the IT Services segment in Germany and Switzerland. Operating earnings EBITDA grew by 37 % to EUR 5.2 million. Thereof EUR 1.1 million are to be allotted to smarthouse and UnitCon acquisitions. A stronger organic growth was slowed by higher investment in the insure product family. Pre-tax profit was EUR 3.3 million against EUR 2.7 million a year ago. Consolidated profit was EUR 2.2 million against EUR 1.5 million a year ago. Earnings per share grew compared to the previous year by 55 % to EUR 0.37.

The company provided earnings guidance for the second quarter and for the full year of 2017. Due to a low number of potential working days in the second quarter, lower sales and profit contribution is expected for that period.

For the full year, taking into account the good capacity utilisation in Germany and Switzerland, continued expansion in workforce and numerous promising sales opportunities for insure as well as FirstSpirit, the overall forecast for 2017 with sales between EUR 270 million and 300 million and EBITDA between EUR 23 million and 27 million can be confirmed.

'Münchener Verein' opts for adesso product in|sure General in the field of composite insurance 02.08.2017 / 11:50

"Münchener Verein" opts for adesso product in|sure General in the field of composite insurance
To be even better prepared for the increasing digitalisation of the insurance sector, "Münchener Verein Allgemeine Versicherungs-AG" (Münchener Verein) will be using the standard software package offered by adesso insurance solutions GmbH for its composite policies in future. After launching in|sure PSLife for portfolio and claims management for life insurance and in|sure Partner for partner management, with in|sure General, the insurance group is now introducing a further component of the in|sure comprehensive IT package. Apart from licence purchasing, the remit includes providing services for launching, migrating the entire contract portfolio, and a multiple-year maintenance contract. By the beginning of 2018, adesso insurance solutions GmbH will provide its solution for productive use in the field of accident insurance. All other areas of composite insurance will then follow successively.
The primary reasons that Münchener Verein decided for the in|sure standard software created by adesso insurance solutions GmbH were the need to address the requirements of its customers even more quickly and efficiently, the growing need for rapid product developments and launching them onto the market, and changes in customer behaviour due to digitalisation. The system provides all the right tools for a state-of-the-art, open architecture. "We consciously did not want to use a system partially or wholly developed in-house for claims and portfolio management, to enable us to concentrate on developing our own products," explained Dr Martin Zsohar, member of the board of the Münchener Verein insurance group and Chief Operating Officer (COO) responsible for digitalisation. "With in|sure we have found a standard product that allows us to serve the needs of our customers in terms of modern insurance products more quickly and flexibly than ever. And thanks to their comprehensive release capability, our systems are always up to date, both technologically and functionally."
in|sure General provides the full range of portfolio and claims management for composite insurance. The complete automation of all business transactions and the standardised representation of portfolio and claims information enable Münchener Verein Allgemeine Versicherungs-AG to design its core processes even more efficiently than before. With its open architecture model and flexible interface design, in|sure General can be easily integrated in the insurer's existing system landscape.
In 2016, the partner administration system in|sure Partner was successfully introduced at the Münchener Verein life insurance company. Using in|sure PSLife, the customer launched the first life insurance products according to plan.
 
Information on Münchener Verein
The origin of the insurance group is firmly based on the cooperative idea of creating an economic self-help organisation for trade and industry. It all began with the founding of "Münchener Verein Krankenversicherung a.G." as the insurance institution of the Bavarian Industry Federation in 1922. Today, the mutual insurance company also operates with its subsidiaries in the fields of life insurance and general insurance. Most recently, the company was presented with the "German Service Award 2017" and the "Insurer of the Year 2017" by the Deutsches Institut für Servicequalität (DISQ). For more information, please go to: www.muenchener-verein.de.

adesso insurance solutions GmbH houses the adesso Group's own product portfolio for the insurance market and develops software and services for handling technical business processes on behalf of customers.

Apart from the core applications for private health, composite and life insurers, the portfolio offers a partner management application (in|sure Partner), a product modeling application (in|sure Product Manager) and a system for software-supported migration (insure|MIGSuite).
