Market Share Versus Profits


Compared to the same period last year, AMAN-IL‘s change in revenue was close to the amount of its change in earnings.  It remains to be seen how the rest of its peer group’s results will turn out and if AMAN-IL‘s performance is a sign of any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector.  Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -7.99% and earnings by -10.48% compared to the previous period.

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s earnings rose year-on-year.  But this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations.  Gross margins went from 7.00% to 7.46% for the same period last year, while operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 4.10% to 4.72% over the same time frame.

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.


AMAN-IL‘s decline in gross margins has not produced any significant offsetting improvement in its working capital .  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the decline in gross margins are likely from operating issues and not trade-offs with the balance sheet.  Working capital days are currently 52.83 days, compared to last year’s level of 50.74 days.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
AMAN-IL‘s year-on-year change in operating cash flow of -27.45% is around its change in earnings.  This suggests that there are likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves for managing earnings this period.

Margins
The company’s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from 3.35% to 3.62% and (2) one-time items. The company’s pretax margins are now 2.49% compared to 2.32% for the same period last year.
