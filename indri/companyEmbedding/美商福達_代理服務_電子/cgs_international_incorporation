Message from the CEO



I wish to express my deepest gratitude and  appreciation for your various supports on Japan Display Inc (JDI).
I was appointed as Chairman, Representative  Director, and Chief Executive Officer of JDI on June 21, 2017. I will now lead  JDI and its group companies to provide more value to our customers,  shareholders, and all other stakeholders.
Looking at JDI business, we have developed,  designed, and manufactured "DISPLAY", and delivered it around the world.  DISPLAY can easily connect people and people with massive information. Five  years have passed since our foundation, and the year of 2017 should be the year  for us JDI to enter into another evolution.
Let me share three of our challenges to go;
  First, FULL ACTIVETM, ultra-narrow bezel display with LTPS (Low-Temperature  Poly-Silicon) technology, is ready to launch.
  Secondly, sales on non-mobile markets like  Automotive, Reflective Displays, and High Definition Displays for laptop PCs  will be focused. While we will continue to strengthen at the high-end  smartphone market, our technological expertise can be leveraged at the markets  above.
  Finally, vapor-deposition OLED development  will become our top priority, applying our highly efficient product engineering.  This is because smartphone market is moving with OLED from LCD rapidly and JDI  needs to lead this market. To keep up with this fast changing market, we will  plan and execute fundamental structural transformation, including corporate  culture.
No matter how fast our markets change, we  will continue to satisfy our customers through our top-notch technology,  production, quality. This is our goal to contribute our society.
Thank you very much for your continued supports.

June 2017Nobuhiro HigashiirikiCEO, Representative Director and Chairman

About CGS
 
Corporate Global Solutions (CGS) is a private investigative company based in Fredericksburg, VA, on the outskirts of Washington D.C.  Our home office in the United States is comprised of translators and professionals fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese working in tandem with highly-trained experts in Latin American investigations. These experts have over 20 years’ experience running investigations in Latin America, and work one-on-one with our teams of investigators who reside in Latin America.  Our veteran investigators oversee all investigative activities and frequently travel abroad to ensure that all goals, legal and contractual requirements and timetables are met. Our investigators and strategic partners are licensed and based throughout the world, allowing us to operate globally. Learn more about ourOperational Regions
 
Corporate Global Solutions was incorporated in 2007 by Philip Hayden, Ed.D.  Prior to its incorporation, all investigations were conducted under Philip Hayden and Associates (PHA), which was incorporated in 1999.  Dr. Hayden is the CEO and President of CGS and, as such, he provides oversight and direction to all investigations and has continued to provide a highly professional, valuable and tremendous quality of service to clients.
 

Background of Corporate Global Solutions and its Founder, Philip Hayden, Ed.D.

Dr. Hayden is the founder and owner of Corporate Global Solutions.  He is a retired Supervisory Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Since his retirement in 1999, Dr. Hayden has been a law enforcement consultant and is a court-certified expert witness in the areas of Police Procedures, Use of Force, Tactics, and Mental Mindset during high-risk situations and  investigative techniques.  As a Special Agent for the FBI in multiple major metropolitan areas, Dr. Hayden conducted extensive investigations and developed cases that resulted in several hundred arrests.
 
He designed and implemented the Law Enforcement Training for Safety and Survival (LETSS) Program within the FBI.  As the lead instructor for the LETTS program, he also managed its international law enforcement training component in over 37 countries and was the primary tactical and investigative instructor for new agent training.  He has also written many articles and instruction manuals for the FBI.
 
Dr. Hayden has combined all his knowledge and background experience in the military and the FBI to develop Corporate Global Solutions.  After his retirement, he worked as a private consultant for large companies, such as Kroll and Associates, McKinsey and Company and Volvo Automotive Company.  As a consultant, he conducted security assessments and crisis management exercises, designed security analysis programs for the United States Government, developed behavior modification techniques designed to enhance performance for high-level executives and was a Senior Consultant and Product Design Specialist for Volvo’s North American prototype police vehicle.  As a consultant with McKinsey and Company, he established a team to develop techniques for enhancing individual performance.
 
In addition to his service with the FBI, Dr. Hayden served as a platoon leader for the 173d Airborne in Vietnam.  While in Vietnam, he was seriously wounded.  He retired from the U.S. Army with the rank of Captain, achieving that rank in four years.  He is the recipient of the Purple Heart, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, Conspicuous Service Cross, Army Commendation for Valor, Bronze Star for Valor, and the Distinguished Service Cross.

A simple setup with an acceptable minimum of services. Main advantages: low cost and direct operation. Main disadvantage: you will be seen running the offshore company from your own home. (Hint: Your domestic government may not like it.)
This package is designed for those lucky individuals, who live and work in a country where they can afford to be seen as directly owning and managing their own offshore company. This setup presumes a direct, hands-on operation of the IBC by the company owner. (!) Note - if you live in, or bear a passport of a high-tax country with an aggressive and efficient tax revenue service , this setup may be unsuitable for you.
The annual administration fees for this package, starting from the second year: $650.
			This includes the $350 BVI government fee and the mandatory registered agent service.



(!) The bank account is not included in this package. We recognize that many clients will prefer to open bank accounts with their own bankers, in geographical proximity to their area of operation. If required, our professional fee for a bank account introduction starts at $600. A number of selected offshore banks is available.

A comprehensive, "bullet-proof" package. It includes our in-house professional directorship, secretarial and business administration service, plus the shareholding service for enhanced confidentiality. The business administration service includes a BVI street address and fax number for the company, handling of commercial documents and correspondence, and a basic consultation for one year.
This package comprehensively deals with the most crucial tax planning question: "by whom, and from where is the company actually managed?"
In this setup, the company can demonstrate that it operates "at arm´s length" from its actual owner – as opposed to being technically operated from the owners´ home. This package is designed for the most demanding business engagements - for those clients, who can not afford to cut corners.
The annual management fee for this package is $1950, starting from the 2nd year. This includes the $350 government annual license fee, registered agent, licensed director, shareholder and secretary, business administration services and basic consultation for 12 months.

Many choose to incorporate an offshore company which subsequently is owned by a foundation. Here the Belize foundation would be used to hold shares in a BVI BC. This way one can get the protection and continuity offered by the foundation and in the same time - engage in commercial activities. Useful to know, that Belize Foundation can be established having charitable or non-charitable purposes.
Why Foundation not Trust?
		There are rather similar functions and reasons for establishing a Foundation or a Trust, the difference is the legal structure. The main difference is that Trusts historically originate from common law countries, e.g., England, USA and India, therefore are mainly used by these countries. While Foundation is a product predominant and understandable by the Civil law countries, e.g., France, Germany, Russia, Spain. In reality one can even say, allegorically, that Foundations are Trusts for the countries who do not understand Trusts. 
		

		For more complex structures, additional Belize, Seychelles or BVI companies can be formed under the same Foundation at additional fee.

Much higher asset protection is best achieved when an IBC is used in combination with an offshore trust. Here the Belize trust would be used to hold shares in a BVI BC.
