  Signature Holdings Case Study 



















  About Signature Group Holdings 





Signature Group Holdings, Inc. is a diversified business and financial services enterprise that invests in the industrial and commercial marketplace, primarily in the United States. Signature focuses on generating strong, risk-adjusted return on equity while protecting shareholder capital. The company also supplies commercial, industrial and residential circuit breakers to the replacement market through its subsidiary, North American Breaker Company. Signature Group Holdings is based in Sherman Oaks, California.





  The Challenge 





As a consulting firm, Signature Holdings has a very small IT department. The company has a few dedicated network and systems engineers, but most of the staff members who support IT have other responsibilities. As a result, Signature works with several service providers for IT support, including Computer Technology Resources (CTR), a member of the Amazon Partner Network (APN).  When Signature decided to replace its outdated on-premises ERP system with Oracle E-Business Suite, the company turned to CTR for the implementation. Signature wanted a SOX-compliant environment that could be managed by a service provider and integrate into its existing infrastructure with minimum disruption. Signature also wanted a disaster recovery solution that would enable fast recovery.





  Why Amazon Web Services 





After reviewing options, Signature decided to implement the Oracle E-Business Suite for Signature on the cloud. “Oracle applications have a complex architecture, requiring multiple servers and disaster recovery,” says Karlo Vartan, Vice President of Finance and Information. “Planning and purchasing hardware would have been a huge upfront investment, which Signature wanted to avoid.” 
CTR works with several cloud providers and chose Amazon Web Services (AWS) for this project because of the maturity of AWS and the ability to customize Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, and other features. Security is a primary concern for Signature and SOX auditors perform security quarterly checks. “We were satisfied that AWS security features and capabilities would enable the company to pass the financial and technological audit says Vartan.” 





  Implementing Oracle on the AWS Cloud 





To set up Oracle financial modules on AWS for Signature, CTR provisioned an Amazon Virtual Private Network (Amazon VPC) to run the Oracle E-Business Suite (Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Oracle Asset Management and Procure-To-Pay) on two extra-large Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides high-performance, block-level storage for the instances. The storage volumes initially stored 300 GB of data, which has since grown to 600 GB over a period of 24 months. Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN), a database backup and recovery manager, interfaces with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to enable secure database backups.
For disaster recovery, the primary environment runs in the US East (Northern) Region and has a backup site in the US West (Northern California) Region. Figure 1 below demonstrates the Oracle applications on AWS. 








Figure 1. Oracle E-Business Suite on AWS for Signature Holdings





“Because of connectors between AWS and Oracle, we can launch an Oracle application from the AWS console or from an Oracle application,” says Sam Palani, Director of CTR’s Infrastructure & Cloud Solutions team. “For example, you can run backups from the AWS console, or if you’re in the Oracle system, RMAN actually creates and deletes Amazon S3 images as needed. It’s a pretty seamless process. Other cloud providers don’t have these types of connectors — it makes management on AWS much easier than other solutions.”





  The Benefits 





By using AWS, Signature was able to launch a complex financial system in six weeks. Oracle E-Business Suite has a much larger footprint than Signature’s legacy system, and running on AWS helped Signature avoid the time and resources of on-premises implementation. Vartan says, “When we look at the total cost of ownership for Oracle E-Business Suite over three years, AWS is about one-third the cost of an on-premises solution. The best part is that we’ve never had any downtime or system crashes running Oracle on AWS — we’ve had about 99 percent availability.”  
SOX auditors examine both the financial and technological aspects of the Oracle implementation on AWS, focusing on security, backup and disaster recovery. For the last three years, Signature and CTR has successfully passed the quarterly audits. 
When Signature wants to test a proof of concept using the Oracle ERP, it’s easy to create a sandbox by spinning up an instance with a subset of production data. “If Signature decides to go ahead with the project, the CTR team can merge the project into the production environment. If not, they can shut down the instance,” says Palani. “It avoids the overhead of tying up servers to test an idea or for development requests.” 
Signature uses production data for detailed reporting, and on the AWS Cloud, it’s easy to spin up an Amazon EC2 instance to run the report. “We run the instances in parallel so everyday business functions can continue without interruption,” says Palani. “We make sure that the data is synched between the instances so that the reporting was accurate.” 
“Running our Oracle applications on AWS gives us the agility and flexibility to focus on what we do best,” says Vartan. “From the very beginning, I knew that we had made the right decision in trusting AWS and CTR to manage our Oracle business applications. Running on the AWS Cloud and having CTR manage the underlying technology enables Signature to put our business at the forefront.”

 Product Reviews: 


Excellent product and support!
CloudBasic RDS AlwaysOn/Geo-Replicate for SQL Server HA/DR is an excellent product backed by great support. Using the pre-configured AMI we were up and running in minutes. Used CloudBasic to migrate SQL Server databases into RDS, followed by setting up cross-region Multi-AR RDS SQL replications for Disaster Recovery and Multi-AZ High Availability. It works well with RDS Multi-AZ, creates SQL Server read-replicas which can be used for reporting, data-locality and offloading of primary RDS SQL Servers. With help form the responsive CloudBasic support team we were able to migrate our databases with no down time. Setting up DR and HA was straightforward.
I strongly recommend the product and the CloudBasic advisory support team.

Does what it says on the box, easy to use, amazing support.
I found this tool when I was looking for a way to transfer databases between our development systems and our production systems. These comprised of a mix of in house physical SQL, EC2 SQL and and RDS. Cloudbasic Geo-replicate solved this problem.
The product improvements I asked for were implemented within days allowing me to extend our use of this product into our devops continuous delivery model.

Affordable SQL Server High Availability Solution
As a consultant I look for affordable and easy to maintain solutions for my customers. This SQL Server HA solution features a simple web interface. I did not have to worry about configuring server clusters, log shipping etc. I was able to setup a DB instance replication to a cross-region AlwaysOn RDS in minutes. I was pleasantly surprised that MSSQL Web Edition is also supported. I had to call for support related to DB issues on my end. I was assigned a dedicated support representative who proved to be very helpful. I did an extensive testing to ensure that this product is very reliable. With this product I am planning to scale up my Cloud Disaster Recovery implementation efforts.

Simple cross-region RDS replication solution
We were looking for a way to continuously replicate our RDS based SQL Servers from west to east coast, for disaster recovery and reporting purposes. We started from looking for a SQL Server log shipping and high availability based solution ..then found CloudBasic’s Geo-Replicate server. We launched the server from the market place, entered RDS source and destination information and within minutes were able to stream data. The secondary DBs seeded very fast, and … Read All

Easy setup. Various deployment scenarios.
We were looking to utilize AWS as a fail-over site for our on-premise SQL Server based applications. We turned to the AWS Market place to find solutions to help us speed up implementation. Found this product, and within minutes were able to steam SQL Server data to an RDS SQL Server on AWS. All we had to do is enter source and destination SQL server connection strings. Then selected if we wanted a one time migration of the SQL server or also… Read ALL

Works very well. Easy to use. Some minor issues need to be addressed.
We intended to use this software to do a one time migration of SQL databases from our co-located datacenter to AWS. Then figured it is very easy to setup continuous replication from East to West coast (AWS in California to AWS in Virginia). We currently use EC2 SQL Server Web edition in California, replicating to a small RDS Web Edition in Virginia… Read ALL

Powerful Yet Simple Replication Solution
The most important feature we were looking for was to be able to access the end point of the replica for our reporting. This product replicates between SQL servers manages by us. We have to ensure the destination SQL Server is used in read-only mode, but this gives us the flexibility to setup replication in various scenarios: on-prem to AWS, across AWS regions, zone-to-zone. It does seem that SQL Server Web edition is supported in all scenarios as well… Read All

CloudBasic SQL Migrate to RDS Solution
I used CloudBasic to Migrate my SQL2012 to an RDS 2012 instance. Install of CloudBasic was easy and once the connection strings were set on the CloudBasic Server webpage, my database connectivity was verified and the db migrated very fast to the RDS instance. CloudBasic is the easiest and fastest solution to replicate your data to an RDS instance for production and or testing. Thank You for making my job easier!!! Read all
