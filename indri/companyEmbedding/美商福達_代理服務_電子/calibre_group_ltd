For Matt, leadership is all about relationships.
“It’s about understanding and supporting people, aligning and developing their capabilities and potential, and giving them something to work towards.
“Our people are the most important element of our business. The fact that we recognise and embrace this is one of Calibre’s great strengths, along with our willingness to continually change and adapt.”
Matt has worked across a number of industries including over ten years in site-based operational roles, and has worked throughout Australia and on a number of key international assignments. He holds a bachelor of electrical engineering from Curtin University.
Outside of his role at Calibre, Matt can be found down at the beach supporting his boys, or writing and producing his own songs. A multifaceted musician, Matt plays guitar, bass, piano, a little harmonica, as well as sings. He is up to his third album.

With a strong emphasis on safety, communication and teamwork and the values of honesty and integrity, Mick is a leader who inspires others to put their best effort into achieving a common goal.

That’s why I aim to be visible, both through site visits and within our offices. I take part in safety interactions and communicate regularly with our teams through our newsletters, videos and face-to-face updates.
“Our people are our business, and within G&S we have an array of knowledgeable, talented and experienced employees. Our success as a business is attributed to their determination, passion and commitment.”
Consequently, one of Mick’s core focuses as MD is to ensure that G&S supports, encourages and grows its people, with their wellbeing at the forefront of all the business does.
“I am committed to making G&S a successful, sustainable and enjoyable company to work for, and some of my proudest moments at G&S have been witnessing the achievements of our people. Whether it’s seeing someone who started as an apprentice gain their trade or someone in a junior role progress through to management, it’s what makes my job rewarding and worthwhile.”
