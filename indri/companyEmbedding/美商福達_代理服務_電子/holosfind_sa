"Off-the-shelf" immunotherapies
that can work for the largest number of patients


Cellectis gene-edits “Chimeric Antigen Receptor” (CAR) T-cells from healthy donors into “off-the-shelf” immunotherapies product candidates that are designed to work for the largest number of patients. It’s the difference between being an off-the-shelf product and a service in which each treatment has to be custom-made. This same technology, developed by Cellectis, could help in designing therapies for many other diseases.
