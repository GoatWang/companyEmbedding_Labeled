Querix For Informix 4GL




 











Informix 4GL 的新生命





直接沿用4GL，繼續使用你習慣的程式語言。 



不需轉至其他程式語言。 



支援多項平台。 



支援N-Tier架構。 



提供 win-client、Web Client、Text mode(使用同一套程式碼連線使用)。



Querix 4GL Feature




1.Querix 4GL 是以原始的Informix 4GL為基礎，愛因斯坦說過”事情應該要儘可能的簡單，但不能過度簡化，我們深感認同，所以Querix 4G是簡單的、可讀性高、容易學習的， 而且仍然是現代商業應用程式運用的高層次語言。

                    2.把商業運作模式切割成3層(GUI Layer-application server、Compiler、Database Layer)，這代表著開發者可以專注在商業面的問題解決，只要把程式碼compile一次，就可以在不同的資料庫與作業平台上部署使用，這種層次的升產力允許複雜的商業模式，可以順利的被建立在最佳化的程式碼裡面，這樣的作法讓Querix 4GL成為市場上最有效率的開發工具。 

                    3.一次的開發，Querix的應用程式可以被部署到任何的作業平台上，可以導入為single-tier或是multi-tier的架構，可以在現今的thin-client系統上執行並聯結任何的資料庫系統，像 Windows desktops、standalone Java? 應用程式、browser applets或者是Web-based XML/HTML的應用程式。



可聯結多種資料庫




　　Hydra總共支援超過18種主要的作業系統以及主要的資料庫系統，它可以提供Informix-style SQL 和 Datatypes的轉換到想要連結的目標資料庫的樣式，以下列出的就是目前支援的資料庫系統：




Informix IDS/SE/OnLine




Oracle 8i/9i/10g




Microsoft SQL Server 




IBM DB2 




Pervasive




MySQL




PostgreSQL




其他可以透過ODBC連接資料庫，但這一部份不提供dynamic SQL及Datatype的轉換，像Adabas, Sybase和Xbase。

                                      Serial ESD protection
                                      Provides Virtual COM (COM port redirection), TCP Server/Client (Max. 32 connections), UDP,                                       Serial Tunnel (Pair connection), Modem Emulator, and RFC2217 application modes.
                                      Built-in Buzzer, RTC, and Watchdog
                                      Wide operating temperature range: -25 to +75°C
                                      Supports SNMP V1, V2c, V3, Trap and MIB-II protocols for network management
                                      Built-in Hardware-selectable Pull High/Low resistors and Terminal resistors for RS-422/485 ports
                                      Supports RS-485 Data Direction Control with Self-Tuner Technology







 








The iDS product range is the 3rd generation of Device Servers from ICPDAS. It is designed for rugged, industrial-level applications, and provides high performance, high reliability and high capacity.

The iDS product range provides a complete Ethernet service, as well as 1、2 and 4-port RS-232/RS-422/RS-485 interfaces that allow any existing serial devices to be connected to an Ethernet network.





Powerful Data Transparent Solution: Zero Data Loss
The iDS product range is equipped with an ARM-based high-performance CPU and large capacity RAM in order to accomplish the goal of “Zero Data Loss” when attempting to transfer a critical data stream. If a failure occurs on the Ethernet connection, the serial data will be queued and will be resent once the Ethernet is reconnected. Each device port provides 32 TCP connections that can be used to share the same information across the network from a single serial device.

Industrial–grade Design






The iDS product range provides a wide range of built-in features designed for easy deployment of the device into existing operating environments.

                                64-bit Hardware Serial Number

Easy web-based Configuration
The built-in web server allows the iDS product to be accessed and configured using a standard web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. The configurations include parameters of serial ports, SNMP, the mode of Serial-To-Ethernet service. In addition, the onboard Flash memory provides the capacity for future software upgrades.
                            





IT-friendly Management
                              All devices in the iDS product range support the SNMP protocol, which is a popular method within the IT industry for monitoring a device over the Ethernet. The iDS device can be configured to send SNMP-Trap alerts to the SNMP manager if user-defined errors or events are encountered. For example, alerts can be triggered by a warm/cold start events, or a password change, etc. An email alert and web-based event log page is also provided.
