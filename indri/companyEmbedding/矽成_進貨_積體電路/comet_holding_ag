A foil just 7.5 µm thin about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair must be welded onto the ebeam window.18 14 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS Trends and Technologies 3D, miniaturization, mobile communication, product safety, process and resource efficiency: With its technologies the COMET Group both responds to and actively shapes technological trends. Current trends MINIATURIZATION Ever more performance in ever smaller packages: Products and components are shrinking even while becoming more complex. The technologies of the COMET Group help safeguard the quality of products and processes. MOBILE COMMUNICATION The ability to communicate anywhere, anytime, has quickly become the norm, thanks to ever more capable mobile devices. The technologies of the COMET Group help manufacturers build these constant companions of our mobile lives more inexpensively and efficiently. 3D Whether in the 3D printing of components, the fabrication of 3D memory chips or the sterilization of threedimensional surfaces the technologies of the COMET Group help industry master the challenges of manufacturing and quality inspection. RELIABILITY, SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE The more industry pushes materials to their limits, the greater the importance of precise, reliable processes in production and quality inspection. The technologies of the COMET Group help find the most minute flaws in materials and components and make processes more competitive. ECO-FRIENDLINESS AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY Natural resources are limited. Energy-saving, resource-efficient production processes are therefore vitally important. The technologies of the COMET Group help protect the environment and conserve resources.19 15 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS Our core technologies X-ray technology In these times of lean manufacturing, the safety and reliability of components is an absolute must even the tiniest defects need to be found. That makes powerful technologies for non-destructive testing all the more critical. The COMET Group has succeeded time and again in setting new standards with its innovative, highquality x-ray sources, x-ray systems and 3D imaging software. Components requiring inspection are always getting smaller and more complex, such as in mobile communication. With state-of-theart, easy-to-use computed tomography systems, the COMET Group equips its customers to inspect even the most minute parts exactly and rapidly for defects, thus streamlining and safeguarding quality assurance in production processes. Radio frequency technology COMET s radio frequency (RF) technology is the basis for the manufacturing of advanced touchscreens and memory chips used in smartphones, tablets and other devices. The production of storage media requires ever more rapid and precise plasma deposition to power the development and fabrication of new 3D chip structures. That demands high-performance products like COMET s vacuum capacitors, impedance matching networks and RF generators. Similarly, resource-saving technologies such as solar cells and LEDs are only made possible by deposition processes using the latest radio frequency technology, which the COMET Group develops and markets. ebeam technology The innovative, compact ebeam technology from the COMET Group helps realize significant savings in resource consumption, such as when sterilizing beverage packaging. And the Group not only enables valuable resourcesaving alternatives to conventional manufacturing processes, but also helps make these processes more profitable. This is also the aim of additional ebeam applications now being developed by the COMET Group, including the treatment of seeds, curing of printing ink, conversion and improvement of materials, and sterilization of various surfaces.20 16 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS X-ray technology Accident prevention through highly advanced imaging The need for safety and security inspection is constantly rising. Everywhere, from passenger screening at airports to the construction of buildings, new measures and processes are being introduced to improve security and safety. This is also true in automotive manufacturing, where the key aim of greater vehicle safety is achieved mainly through improvements in technology and materials. Additionally, subsectors like the tire industry seek ways of optimizing manufacturing costs. One possible source of cost savings is in materials. But using less material, whether in tires or elsewhere, means the material that is used must stand up to greater stresses. This is where extremely reliable testing and examination of materials is indispensable, as even the smallest defects can have far-reaching consequences. Their effective elimination requires advanced, powerful imaging technologies that afford full insight into the quality attributes of the products tested. In developing such solutions, the COMET Group can draw on its decades of experience in x-ray and computed tomography. Thus, a CT system from YXLON allows tires to be scanned at power levels of up to 600 kv and imaged three-dimensionally. This CT inspection is possible even while the tires are under load during simulation of the forces and stresses of road use. The behavior of the material can thus be analyzed even during simulated driving a unique capability. It lets manufacturers achieve ideal combinations of product quality and material efficiency and contribute to traffic safety.21 17 COMET HOLDING AG GESCHÄFTSBERICHT 2014 TRENDS QUALITY AND EFFICIENT USE OF MATERIALS With Y.CT Tire from YXLON, tire makers achieve the ideal combination of quality and material efficiency. Stefan Moll President, X-Ray Systems ZERO DEFECTS VIEW INSIDE A TIRE 100 % All truck tires made worldwide must be x-rayed and inspected for defects by the manufacturer. On passenger tires too, final inspection is increasingly done radiographically. CT cross section of a truck tire22 18 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS Radio frequency technology Into the third dimension with RF technology from COMET Innovation in components for electronic devices from desktops and laptops to tablets, smartphones and, recently, phablets is hurtling along at a breathtaking pace. Gadgets are becoming ever faster, smarter, and above all more compact. But ultimately, even miniaturization in electronics runs into limits imposed by the laws of physics. This is now the case in conventional flat memory chips, where power densities have reached the maximum possible. Yet, Big Data and the Internet of Things demand continuing growth in storage capacity. A promising solution are novel 3D chips with vertically stacked memory structures, which far outperform conventional chips. Major companies like Samsung and Intel are working in overdrive on such models. Producing these highly complex chips also requires much faster and more exact vapor deposition methods. While the coating necessary for a conventional chip took four repeated deposition passes, a 3D chip needs as many as 17. To manufacture these next-generation chips competitively, the deposition techniques must be made significantly faster. That in turn necessitates powerful, reliable radio frequency solutions. This is where the COMET Group has much to offer its partners: In close collaboration with suppliers in the electronics industry, the company develops solutions and products to advance the fabrication of 3D integrated circuits. With new RF fast-tuning solutions pioneered by COMET, the development of 3D chips should take another big leap forward.23 19 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS 3D CHIPS DO MORE MORE DEMANDING FABRICATION RF SOLUTIONS FROM COMET Many times more power in the same space Credits: Intel 17 Up to 17 deposition passes are needed in the production of 3D chips, compared to four passes for conventional chips. 3D chips are the future of the electronics industry. And they require powerful, fast radio frequency solutions. Michael Kammerer, President, Plasma Control Technologies24 20 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS ebeam technology Fit for the future with blue technology The world s population is growing fast. Over 7 billion people now live on Earth. Every year, this number swells by about 78 million, while humanity wants ever better food, clothing, transportation and entertainment. The resources which the planet as an ecosystem can supply are finite, and the resource deficit is alarming. Time is short for finding a way out of this dilemma. But changes in individual consumer behavior or new laws are difficult to push through globally, and much too slow. The answer lies in revolutionary new technologies that help satisfy the growing consumer needs with fewer resources. Green technologies such as solar and wind energy are steps in the right direction. Yet, they are in many cases too expensive, even with government subsidies. More beneficial are socalled blue technologies, which not only help conserve resources but also boost productivity and are thus highly appealing economically as well. One such blue technology is ebeam, developed by the COMET Group. Thanks to converting to ebeam, COMET s partner Tetra Pak is able to significantly lower CO 2 emissions from the sterilization of beverage packaging, cut energy consumption and eliminate chemicals. What is more, ebeam also helps drive a vast improvement in productivity, leading to a compelling cost reduction of 30% for the consumer. In other words, ebeam is instrumental in lowering resource consumption and raising competitiveness. The future belongs to blue technologies like ebeam, predestined to play a key role in resolving the global bottleneck of resource overuse.25 21 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 TRENDS WE HAVE LIFT-OFF WITH TETRA PAK BLUE IS THE NEW GREEN Tetra Pak has launched the rollout The future belongs to blue technologies: They not only save the planet s resources but are attractive economically. Charles Flükiger, President, X-Ray & ebeam Technologies EBEAM SAVES COSTS 30% Using ebeam, Tetra Pak is able to lower costs to the end consumer by 30% in the sterilization of beverage packaging.26 27 23 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 PERFORMANCE Performance A record year in review SUPERIOR PRODUCT QUALITY THROUGH PROCESS EXCELLENCE To achieve the best ultra-high vacuum in the x-ray tube, the cleaned parts are assembled in a climate-controlled environment.28 24 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 PERFORMANCE To Our Shareholders Ronald Fehlmann, CEO, and Hans Hess, Chairman of the Board. In 2014 the COMET Group achieved record sales of CHF million, with sales growth of 17.2% in local currencies. Net income rose by 63.3% to CHF 26.3 million. These results put the Group in a stronger position than ever. The COMET Group delivered further organic growth in Consolidated net sales rose from CHF million to CHF million, surpassing the strong prior year by 15.3%, or 17.2% in local currencies. EBITDA operating earnings improved by 10.5% to CHF 39.8 million despite current strategic investment in future growth. The EBITDA margin was 13.8% (2013: 14.4%). Net income rose strongly, by 63.3 % to a new total of CHF 26.3 million, and earnings per share grew 60% to CHF Free cash flow was CHF 18.5 million (2013: CHF 10.7 million). The equity ratio increased to a very good 65.0%. Net debt fell to CHF 2.0 million. These results place the COMET Group on a stronger footing than ever. Strategy succeeds Growth in all three segments The consistent execution of the Group s strategy continued to bring rich rewards in The intensified marketing of existing products and technologies and the swifter development of high-growth business segments proved effective as the Group achieved growth in all regions and operating segments. The strongest advance in sales was made in the Plasma Control Technologies (PCT) segment, which leveraged its investment of the prior years and expanded its business with major customers in the US semiconductor market. Overall, the segment s sales rose 29.7% to an unprecedented CHF million (2013: CHF 81.5 million).29 25 COMET HOLDING AG ANNUAL REPORT 2014 PERFORMANCE With sales of CHF million, X-Ray Systems (IXS) also grew by a robust 10.9% (2013: CHF million). X-Ray & ebeam Technologies (XET) successfully broadened its customer base and pushed up sales to CHF 74.1 million (2013: CHF 68.7 million). An appreciable contribution to this came from the recently launched ebeam business, which boasted the highest growth rate in the Group. The Group as a whole grew in every region most notably in the USA, which now accounted for 36% of sales, the largest single regional share (Asia: 35.1%, Europe: 24.8%). Significant gains in profitability and company value The high sales and the continued strategic work to improve operating efficiency led to tangible profit growth. EBITDA earnings of the COMET Group increased from CHF 36.0 million to CHF 39.8 million. The largest contributor was the PCT segment, where earnings grew from CHF 10.7 million to CHF 18.3 million. IXS segment earnings rose slightly to CHF 16.1 million (2013: CHF 16.0 million). XET likewise remained solidly profitable (despite current investment in developing the ebeam business), generating EBITDA of CHF 7.3 million (2013: CHF 11.2 million). Besides the high sales, the Group benefited from positive tax effects of loss carryforwards in the USA. Net income of the Group rose markedly to CHF 26.3 million (2013: CHF 16.1 million). COMET also raised its economic profit severalfold and significantly boosted the value of the Group. Return on capital employed went from 10.8% to 15.6%, with capital costs of 9%. COMET Group more robust than ever The steady focus on global marketing of innovative products and technologies made the COMET Group even stronger than before. Critical headway was achieved in all core dimensions of Group strategy. The relationships with key accounts were deepened and new growth- driving projects started in, e.g., the semiconductor industry, security inspection and non-destructive testing. As well, new customers were acquired and design wins laid important foundations for future growth. Process efficiency continued to be improved. The product portfolio was bolstered with innovative solutions such as the new line of intuitive FeinFocus computed tomography systems, portable Smart Evo x-ray modules for pipeline inspection, and the sophisticated SmartCon vacuum capacitor. The Group also made extensive progress in its emerging businesses: In radio frequency (RF) generators, COMET developed new solutions for future use by the semiconductor industry. In the ebeam activities, development of the business is on track. The rollout of this technology with Tetra Pak was initiated with the delivery of the first ebeam-equipped beverage packaging systems to Japan. In Flamatt the unit began to implement a scalable manufacturing concept that in the medium term will allow the production of larger series of ebeam equipment. To expand market access for ebeam in Europe and North America, the business unit launched a collaboration with two system integration companies. Demanding environment Good prospects for growth As a result of its strategy, the COMET Group is ideally placed to exploit current market trends with its innovative customer solutions and further strengthen its leading position in the market. Important business drivers are the development of three-dimensional memory chips, the trend toward 3D rendering of x-ray im ages through CT, and also the treat ment of various surfaces with ebeam. COMET helps to power these trends with its technologies. The Board and management are convinced that, barring a deterioration in the economic environment, the Group will be able to continue to grow its value in the future. Despite the Swiss central bank s decision to end the franc s peg against the euro, COMET s expectation for 2015 based on the assumptions of EUR / CHF parity and an exchange rate of CHF 0.90 per US dollar is for sales of CHF million and an EBITDA margin of 13 15%. As a result of the non-recurring positive tax effect of CHF 6.1 million in 2014 and one-time net currency translation losses of about CHF 3 million in 2015, net income this year will be correspondingly lower than in Next to organic growth, COMET is also looking at acquisitions that can accelerate the strategic initiatives and open up attractive growth opportunities. Dividend increase At the next Annual Shareholder Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose a distribution of CHF per share to shareholders from distributable paid-in capital (2013: CHF 8.00 per share), exempt from Swiss anticipatory tax. This represents 32% of the Group s net income. Thank you! On behalf of the whole Board and management, we would like to thank COMET s shareholders for their trust. We also wish to express our gratitude to COMET s partners, customers and suppliers for the close working relationships and the strong confidence shown in our technology, our people and our business. A special thank-you goes to our almost one thousand employees worldwide, whose hard work and passionate commitment made the year s superb results possible.
