Epistar buoyed by blue/white LED products
PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENT:The chipmakers gross margin is expected to improve based in increased exports of higher-margin automotive and infrared applications
By Lauly Li  /  Staff reporter






Epistar Corp (晶電), the nation’s largest LED chipmaker, last month posted its highest monthly revenue for the past year, supported by better-than-expected orders for blue/white LED products.Epistar reported NT$2.23 billion (US$72.76 million) in revenue last month, a jump of 22.52 percent from February’s NT$1.82 billion, but flattish from the NT$2.23 billion a year earlier, a filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange showed.“Rising demand for blue/white LED chips was the main contributor for the monthly growth,” Epistar spokesman Rider Chang (張世賢) said yesterday by telephone.The monthly result brought the LED chipmaker’s consolidated revenue in the first three months of this year to NT$5.73 billion, falling 5.33 percent from NT$6.05 billion a year earlier, the company’s data showed.Despite the annual decline, gross margin is expected to improve, as Epistar adjusted its product portfolio during the January-to-March period to export more higher-margin automotive and infrared applications, Chang said.Gross margin last quarter is expected to be better than the previous quarter’s 18.36 percent on the back of a better product portfolio, he said.Epistar forecast that the April-to-June revenue would grow by a double-digit percentage from last quarter’s NT$5.73 billion, as the blue/white LED products enter the traditional peak season this quarter, Chang said.The company also forecast an increase in orders for its four-elements LED products this quarter, he said.Epistar’s production lines are expected to run at full capacity throughout this quarter, Chang said, adding that order visibility has reached to the beginning of next quarter.

Epistar and Lynk Labs Sign Equity Investment & Licensing Agreement




Epistar, Taiwan’s largest LED chip maker and Lynk Labs, industry’s leading AC LED technology company enter into strategic equity investment and licensing agreement to grow the AC LED market




Hsinchu, Taiwan – October 13, 2009 –Epistar Corporation, Taiwan’s largest LED epiwafer and chip maker has entered into a strategic equity investment and license
agreement with Lynk Labs Inc., the leading supplier of AC LED device, light engine and power supply technology. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


Lynk Labs has been building an LED technology patent and product portfolio since 2002 with a focus on AC LED technology. The portfolio includes fundamental core AC LED circuits that can be integrated at the chip level as well as drive methods and product or system level solutions. With over 50 patents filed to date and granted with the company’s first U.S. Patent, No. 
	
	
	7,489,086 entitled “AC light emitting diode and AC LED drive methods and apparatus" early this year, see http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/6/2/7, Lynk will soon be announcing more approvals in major international markets.







In March 2009, Epistar announced plans to enter the AC LED market with single-chip AC LED technology, see http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/6/3/5 . The company has been developing AC LED chips since 2004 and has also filed more than 10 patent applications in related fields. Last year, Epistar obtained a patent license from ITRI, the Taiwan-based Industrial Technology Research Institute also developing chip-level advancements in AC LED technology.


Through this strategic partnership, Epistar and Lynk will be sharing and leveraging technology, expertise from both companies to develop new AC LED technology, and IP and products including single-chip and system level solutions for the lighting industry according to Lynk Labs. “We’re honored to have Epistar as an investor and strategic partner. Having access to Epistar’s chip-level design and manufacturing expertise will allow us to advance AC LED technology as well as accelerate its adoption into all areas of lighting where AC LEDs can deliver an advantage” said Mike Miskin, Lynk Labs’ President/CEO.


AC LED technology based products continue to show advantages over DC in many applications when being integrated into the AC power infrastructure. “AC LED technology creates a new era in the industry and Lynk Labs has been the pioneer driving AC LEDs into the market for many years now” said Dr. B.J. Lee, Chairman of Epistar. “We are very pleased and excited about entering into this strategic partnership with Lynk Labs to join resources and bring to market next generation AC LED based technology products” said Dr. Lee.

Epistar Corporation Invests in LED Innovator Oree, Inc.


Collaboration will strengthen market penetration in Asia, Europe and US

Oree Inc., developer of LED planar illumination technology, announced today that it has secured an investment from Epistar Corporation, Taiwan’s largest manufacturer of LED chips. The funding is a demonstration of the strong strategic relationship between the two companies.

Oree has developed a differentiating technology that brings LED lighting to a new level of efficiency and practicality in terms of energy consumption and cost. Oree’s solid-state light source is thin and flat – about the size and shape of a credit card – and is ideally-suited for general lighting applications, decorative and architectural lighting, as well as backlighting for LCD panels. Oree is currently working with selected customers in Asia and Europe, and will be in high-volume production by early next year. 

As one of the world’s leading chip suppliers, Epistar Corporation is dedicated to partnering with companies that have novel and promising technologies. Epistar has been manufacturing chips for Oree since 2007. Continued collaboration will strengthen market penetration in Asia, Europe and the US for both companies.

“Oree has introduced a game-changing LED technology and brought some great talent to the market,” said BJ Lee, Chairman of Epistar Corporation. “I am excited about our shared vision."

 “By investing in Oree, Epistar has demonstrated confidence in the significant market potential of our technology,” said Eran Fine, founder and CEO of Oree. “This funding will help us meet our high-volume production goals, as well as expand our global reach.”

About Oree

Established in 2006, Oree pioneered the LED planar light source and is currently the leading developer of LED planar lighting. Oree’s technology addresses the needs of the lighting market, enabling thin and efficient illumination of large areas. Oree’s patented technology allows general lighting and backlight manufacturers to significantly increase system efficiency and dramatically reduce the cost of LED-based systems.

 In 1996, a handful of visionaries founded Epistar to usher in the LED era, decades before solid state lighting became today’s ubiquitous commodity and highly-anticipated lighting source. First-hand knowledge and insight led the ﬂedgling Epistar to pursue cutting-edge production and engineering innovation in epitaxy. And with accumulated expertise and expansive capacity, today Epistar sits ﬁrmly as the premier global supplier. Epistar has already worked with some of the most well-known brands around the world, popularizing LED applications on cell phone screens, laptops, television, and much more. Thus Epistar is able to inject the beneﬁts of solid state lighting into everyday life.

The singular vision that has powered Epistar from the beginning also contains insights into client-supplier relationship. Epistar has always believed that, in the tightly-interwoven LED industry, working closely with clients is critical to producing the highest quality end- products. That is why Epistar has developed a unique “Co-Activation Service Model,” working alongside clients as their partner, co-designing chips and production processes, while perfecting quality control. Through such close-knit partnerships, Epistar is able to truthfully gauge the diverse needs of downstream businesses and consumers, and in essence, satisfy every Epistar partner’s client.

Epistar’s pivotal role in LED’s full commercialization has guided the world into the solid state lighting era. Today that era is fast approaching full-bloom, and Epistar is more equipped than ever to take on increasingly challenging feats, to help illuminate the world in a better light.
