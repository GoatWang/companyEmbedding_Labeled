SUNNYVALE, Calif. & SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GSI 
      Technology (GSI) (NASDAQ: GSIT), a leader in high-performance 
      synchronous SRAM and low-latency DRAM products for the network and 
      telecom markets, and MoSys 
      (NASDAQ: MOSY), a leader in semiconductor solutions that enable fast, 
      intelligent data access for network and communications systems, today 
      announced a dual-sourcing product and technology partnership. The 
      partnership includes alternate sourcing of the GSI SigmaQuad™ 
      IVe SRAM family and the MoSys® Bandwidth 
      Engine® 2 and 3 families of ICs. These uniquely architected, highly 
      innovative product families provide the highest access rate solutions 
      available for next generation networking equipment. Additionally, the 
      companies plan to leverage the partnership and respective technologies 
      to enable expanded roadmaps of dual-sourced high-performance memory and 
      intelligent offload products. The leading-edge technologies available 
      from MoSys and GSI enable higher capacity and performance, ensuring that 
      next-generation systems can meet growing user expectations for an ever 
      faster and more intelligent network.
    


      This partnership provides customers with two sources of supply and a 
      path to an expanded roadmap of high-performance parallel and serial 
      memory products, as well as packet processor offload products, from two 
      technology leaders.
    

      “With strong memory expertise, backed by a deep understanding of end 
      customer application requirements, and a commitment to technology 
      leadership and innovation, GSI makes an excellent partner to support our 
      Bandwidth Engine products and roadmap. We are excited to extend our 
      portfolio with the performance-leading SigmaQuad products,” stated Len 
      Perham, CEO for MoSys. “We believe that establishing a platform that 
      allows for alternative sourcing of our respective high-performance 
      solutions, complemented by an aggressive product roadmap leading to even 
      more innovative and architecturally advanced solutions, will prove 
      highly valuable to the market as well as to our mutual customers. We 
      look forward to an ongoing, mutually-beneficial and cooperative 
      relationship with GSI.”
    

      “MoSys has taken a leadership position in developing highly efficient 
      serial interface technology for use with its high-performance Bandwidth 
      Engine solutions, and we are excited to add these innovative products to 
      our memory product portfolio,” stated Lee-Lean 
      Shu, president and CEO for GSI Technology. “The combination of 
      technology innovation, expertise and proven execution of both GSI and 
      MoSys creates an excellent platform for providing the capacity and 
      performance required in our customers’ current generation of networking 
      equipment, and establishes exciting leading-edge roadmap opportunities 
      for next generation systems.”
    

      GSI’s SigmaQuad IVe family of high-performance synchronous SRAM 
      products, which includes both separate I/O quad data rate and common I/O 
      double data rate devices, offers a variety of performance and feature 
      options tailored to high-performance networking and telecom 
      applications. In particular, the combination of sub-1ns random cycle 
      time, sub-6ns read latency, and high transaction rate capability 
      available in the IVe quad data rate devices provides a level of 
      performance that is essential for read-modify-write applications, such 
      as counters and statistics, in today’s 100G and 400G networking systems.
    

      MoSys’ Bandwidth Engine ICs are designed to minimize interface pin count 
      and maximize access and effective transaction rate for buffering, 
      look-up and statistics operations in high-speed systems. The design 
      includes a highly efficient serial data interface and protocol combined 
      with large, integrated high-performance memory and offload macro 
      functions for statistics, metering and atomic operations. The 
      architecture maximizes transactions per second both internally and 
      externally to increase packet processing performance while expanding 
      system features. The Bandwidth Engine devices are designed, built and 
      qualified for high-reliability, carrier-grade applications.

  GSI Technology (GSI) (NASDAQ: GSIT), a leader in high-performance synchronous SRAM and low-latency DRAM products for the network and telecom markets, and MoSys (NASDAQ: MOSY), a leader in semiconductor solutions that enable fast, intelligent data access for network and communications systems, today announced a dual-sourcing product and technology partnership. The partnership includes alternate sourcing of the GSI SigmaQuad™ IVe SRAM family and the MoSys® Bandwidth Engine® 2 and 3 families of ICs. These uniquely architected, highly innovative product families provide the highest access rate solutions available for next generation networking equipment. Additionally, the companies plan to leverage the partnership and respective technologies to enable expanded roadmaps of dual-sourced high-performance memory and intelligent offload products. The leading-edge technologies available from MoSys and GSI enable higher capacity and performance, ensuring that next-generation systems can meet growing user expectations for an ever faster and more intelligent network.  This partnership provides customers with two sources of supply and a path to an expanded roadmap of high-performance parallel and serial memory products, as well as packet processor offload products, from two technology leaders.  “With strong memory expertise, backed by a deep understanding of end customer application requirements, and a commitment to technology leadership and innovation, GSI makes an excellent partner to support our Bandwidth Engine products and roadmap. We are excited to extend our portfolio with the performance-leading SigmaQuad products,” stated Len Perham, CEO for MoSys. “We believe that establishing a platform that allows for alternative sourcing of our respective high-performance solutions, complemented by an aggressive product roadmap leading to even more innovative and architecturally advanced solutions, will prove highly valuable to the market as well as to our mutual customers. We look forward to an ongoing, mutually-beneficial and cooperative relationship with GSI.”  “MoSys has taken a leadership position in developing highly efficient serial interface technology for use with its high-performance Bandwidth Engine solutions, and we are excited to add these innovative products to our memory product portfolio,” stated Lee-Lean Shu, president and CEO for GSI Technology. “The combination of technology innovation, expertise and proven execution of both GSI and MoSys creates an excellent platform for providing the capacity and performance required in our customers’ current generation of networking equipment, and establishes exciting leading-edge roadmap opportunities for next generation systems.”  GSI’s SigmaQuad IVe family of high-performance synchronous SRAM products, which includes both separate I/O quad data rate and common I/O double data rate devices, offers a variety of performance and feature options tailored to high-performance networking and telecom applications. In particular, the combination of sub-1ns random cycle time, sub-6ns read latency, and high transaction rate capability available in the IVe quad data rate devices provides a level of performance that is essential for read-modify-write applications, such as counters and statistics, in today’s 100G and 400G networking systems.

Reports First-Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsMarketwiredJuly 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 27, 2017) - GSI Technology, Inc. (  NASDAQ :  GSIT ) today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017.The Company reported a net loss of $(1.5 million), or $(0.07) per diluted share, on net revenues of $10.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to net income of $260,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, on net revenues of $12.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a net loss of $(1.3 million), or $(0.07) per diluted share, on net revenues of $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, ended March 31, 2017. Gross margin was 52.4% compared to 51.9% in the prior year period and 56.4% in the preceding fourth quarter.Total operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $7.1 million, compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and $7.4 million in the preceding fourth quarter. Research and development expenses were $4.3 million, compared to $3.5 million in the prior year period and $4.2 million in the preceding quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were unchanged at $2.8 million in both the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and in the prior year quarter ended June 30, 2016, and down sequentially from $3.2 million in the preceding quarter.Lee-Lean Shu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted, "Our net revenues and gross margin came in below the range of guidance that we had provided earlier in the first quarter in part due to a mix of lower margin product deliveries to one of our largest customers and additional inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products that were greater than our normal quarterly average. We expect a return to a higher margin mix of sales to this customer in our second fiscal quarter. Overall, during the first quarter, we continued to see slowness in our primary telecommunications and networking markets along with continued weak sales in Asia. However, beyond our traditional markets of high speed SRAM and low-latency DRAM, we are seeing high interest in our newest market segment, our extremely high performance SigmaQuad radiation-hardened SRAM products targeted at aerospace and defense applications. We are also receiving inquiries about our patented in-place associative computing technology and intellectual property that is under development, which focuses on large emerging markets such as big data applications, computer vision and cyber security."We will continue to devote significant resources to develop our associative computing technology for the remaining quarters of calendar 2017. By way of background for our newer stakeholders, we obtained this technology through our acquisition of MikaMonu in late 2015. The technology changes the concept of computing from serial data processing -- where data is moved back and forth from the processor to the memory -- to parallel data processing, computation and search directly in the main processing array. While still in development, we are currently marketing new product sets based upon this technology to a variety of users, and we believe we will have an active base of potential customers once we bring this new product to market. We remain on schedule to complete the design of our initial product by the end of calendar 2017. We are very excited about our business and the quarters ahead."In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, sales to Nokia (Alcatel-Lucent) were $4.5 million, or 42.3% of net revenues compared to $4.2 million, or 40.0% of net revenues, in the prior quarter and $5.4 million, or 41.9% of net revenues, in the same period a year ago. First-quarter direct and indirect sales to Cisco Systems were $852,000, or 8.0% of net revenues, compared to $745,000, or 7.2% of net revenues, in the prior quarter, and $1.5 million, or 11.7% of net revenues, in the same period a year ago. Military/defense sales were 24.5% of shipments compared to 24.3% of shipments in the prior quarter and 12.5% of shipments in the comparable period a year ago. SigmaQuad sales were 51.1 % of shipments compared to 53.0% in the prior quarter and 55.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.First-quarter fiscal 2018 operating loss was $(1.5 million), compared to operating loss of $(1.5 million) in the prior quarter and operating income of $389,000 a year ago. First-quarter fiscal 2018 net loss included interest and other income of $98,000 and a tax provision of $81,000, compared to $142,000 in interest and other income and a tax provision of $271,000 a year ago. In the preceding quarter, net loss included interest and other income of $183,000 and a tax provision of $2,000.Read MoreTotal first-quarter pre-tax stock-based compensation expense was $478,000 compared to $518,000 in the prior quarter and $443,000 in the comparable quarter a year ago.At June 30, 2017, the Company had $49.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $14.1 million in long-term investments, $57.6 million in working capital, no debt, and stockholders' equity of $86.6 million.Outlook for Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018Looking forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we currently expect net revenues to be in the range of $10.0 million to $11.0 million. We expect gross margin of approximately 53% to 55% in the second quarter.Conference CallGSI Technology will review its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and discuss its current business outlook during a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific (4:30 p.m. Eastern) today, July 27, 2017.
