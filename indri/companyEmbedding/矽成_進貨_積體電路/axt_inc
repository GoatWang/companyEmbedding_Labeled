Why Shares of AXT Inc. Are Up Today
Better-than-expected revenue growth was enough to send the substrate manufacturer's stock soaring.

What happened
Shares of semiconductor substrate manufacturer AXT Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) jumped on Thursday following the release of the company's second-quarter report. Revenue was ahead of analyst expectations while earnings were in-line, which was enough to send the stock about 9.5% higher by 12:00 p.m. EDT.
So what
AXT reported second-quarter revenue of $23.6 million, up 14.9% year over year and about $1 million higher than the average analyst estimate. AXT CEO Morris Young pointed to record revenue from indium phosphide substrates, as well as improvements in semi-insulating gallium arsenide, semi-conducting gallium arsenide, and germanium substrates, as the main drivers of growth.

Earnings came in at $0.05 per share, up from $0.03 per share during the prior-year period and in line with analyst expectations. Higher revenue, a 30-basis-point improvement in gross profit, and a drop in total operating expenses drove the bottom-line increase. Substrate gross margin was higher than the companywide gross margin, offset by a lower gross margin from raw materials.





Now what
Young expects 2017 to end up being a good year for the company, as he stated in the release:

2017 is shaping up to be a solid year of growth for AXT. Across our portfolio, we are seeing emerging technologies and strengthening demand from established applications that are driving growth in each of our substrate product categories. ... Our customer and revenue base continues to diversify, giving us a broad-based opportunity for continued business expansion.

With AXT delivering double-digit revenue growth and solid earnings growth, investors found plenty of reasons to bid up the stock.

AXT, Inc: A Cash Hoard, Share Buybacks, And Other Potential Catalysts Make This $2 Tech Stock Attractive - AXT Inc (NASDAQ:AXTI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AXT, Inc: A Cash Hoard, Share Buybacks, And Other Potential Catalysts Make This $2 Tech Stock AttractiveJan.30.14 | About: AXT Inc (AXTI) Hawkinvest Value, growth at reasonable price, contrarian, GrowthEditors' Note: This article covers a stock with less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is a small tech company that appears to have been through some real highs and lows. In the early 2000's, this stock was trading for over $43. The financial crisis took the stock down to about a buck in May 2009, but it then surged to nearly $11 in January 2011. As most investors know, it's not uncommon for tech stocks to go through these boom and bust cycles. It's also well known that it can really pay off big to buy at the lows, if the company has the potential for another "up cycle".
This company primarily designs and manufactures semiconductor substrates which are often used in wireless communication products, fiber optics, and LED applications. AXT, Inc. has annual revenues of about $86 million and the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels due to a large amount of cash. Plus there is always the potential for the company to "reinvent" its business model. While it is hard to say if this stock is poised for a significant move higher any time soon, there are some factors that make this stock worth considering or at least watching.

As the chart shows, this stock has been in an uptrend in recent months. It bottomed out at about $2.15 per share in October, and then went up to about $2.70 in early 2014. The recent market pullback seems to have put pressure on this stock, however, this could be an ideal buying opportunity. As the light blue line on the chart shows, this stock remains in an uptrend and it is now resting at the low end of the recent trading range. In the past few months, investors who have bought the stock when it traded near the blue uptrend line were rewarded, and it has also paid to sell when it touched the high end of the recent trading range which is now around $2.70 per share (as indicated by the purple trend line). It's never a sure thing but these patterns are certainly worth considering.

For a company with a market capitalization of about $75 million, this one has a cash hoard. It has just over $36 million in cash which is equivalent to around $1.12 per share and no debt on the balance sheet. This is a considerable amount of cash for a stock trading at just over $2 per share. It also appears undervalued based on book value which is around $4.18 per share. When you factor in the cash and that it has no debt, it shows that the enterprise value is right around $43 million. This is another sign the company is undervalued, especially when considering the annual revenues of nearly $86 million.
The cash hoard reduces downside risks for investors and gives the company flexibility to develop new products and invest in marketing. One potential downside risk that needs to be considered is the fact that this company has recently posted losses. For the third quarter of 2013, it lost $2.3 million or about 7 cents per share. The loss was partially due to a decline in gross margins, from 12.9% in the second quarter to 11.9% in the third quarter. This gross margin decline was due to a change in the product mix sold in that quarter. However, the potential downside risks from a small quarterly loss seem minimal for a stock trading at these levels, especially since the company has plenty of cash.
Clearly, the company needs to increase sales or increase profit margins in order to return to a level of solid profitability. Another option would be to invest in new product lines and adapt to new market demands in order to create shareholder value. In addition to its main line of business, this company owns stakes in five joint ventures. It is the majority owner in three of these ventures which gives it board level control. In one company, "Nanjing Jin Mei Gallium Co, Ltd." which produces "6N, 7N Ga, and B203" (Gallium), it owns an 83% stake.
The stakes in these businesses may have more value than the current stock price indicates. The 83% stake in the company that produces gallium seems most interesting since gallium can be used like liquid chocolate in 3D printers. While this has not hit the mainstream yet, it could be a potential future business opportunity. 3D printing could revolutionize manufacturing and allow individuals to have a mini factory in their homes. While most 3D printers use thermoplastics, other materials like gallium allow printers to make metal products. An article from Extremetech.com explains the potential for gallium in 3D printing, which states:

"Gallium is the chocolate of metals. With a melting point of 86 degrees, the stuff will literally melt in your hand, and then solidify when you put it down. This melting point can be lowered by alloying with Indium to make a non-toxic substitute for mercury in applications like thermometers and tilt switches. Gallium has another trick up its sleeve, in which it rapidly forms an oxide skin when exposed to air. This property has recently been exploited by researchers at NC State to do something pretty incredible-print stable 3D structures using room temperature liquid metal."
It's far too early to know if gallium usage will grow and if this company will capitalize on 3D printing in the future, but it sure seems to be an interesting point to consider as it could be a game changer. As a high tech company, AXT, Inc. could be positioned to benefit from this potential in the future, if the market for gallium in 3D printing grows. That is a big if, but the fast growth in the emerging 3D printing industry is bound to create many opportunities that the market is not fully aware of now. That potential makes this stock worth watching. The cheap valuation, a cash hoard and the recent pullback make it a stock to consider buying as a turnaround play. Management also seems to think the shares are trading at bargain levels and worth buying since it authorized a $6 million stock buy back just last year.
Here are some key points for AXT, Inc.:Current share price: $2.35The 52 week range is $2.10 to $3.43Annual dividend: n/a

      FREMONT, Calif., July 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXT, Inc.
      (Nasdaq:AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound
      semiconductor substrates, today reported financial results
      for the second quarter, ended June 30, 2017.


Second Quarter 2017 Results


      Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $23.6 million,

      Gross margin was 30.8 percent of revenue for the second
      quarter of 2017, compared with 30.5 percent of revenue in the
      first quarter of 2017.  Second quarter substrate gross
      margin was higher than the total company gross margin and was
      offset by lower gross margin on raw materials.
    

      Operating expenses were $5.0 million in the second quarter of
      2017, compared with $4.9 million in the first quarter of
      2017. 
    

      Operating profit was $2.3 million for the second quarter of
      2017, compared with $1.4 million in the first quarter of
      2017. 
    

      Interest and other, net was a loss of $0.2 million for the
      second quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $0.8 million
      in the first quarter of 2017.  Tax expense in the second
      quarter of 2017 was $0.3 million compared to $0.2 million in
      the first quarter of 2017.
    

      Net profit was $1.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in
      the second quarter of 2017 compared with a net profit of $0.7
      million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first quarter of
      2017.  
    

Management Qualitative Comments


      “2017 is shaping up to be a solid year of growth for AXT,”
      said Morris Young, chief executive officer. “Across
      our portfolio, we are seeing emerging technologies and
      strengthening demand from established applications that are
      driving growth in each of our substrate product categories.
      As a result, we achieved record revenue in indium phosphide
      substrates in Q2, and posted solid improvement in
      semi-insulating gallium arsenide, semi-conducting gallium
      arsenide, and germanium substrates. Our customer and revenue
      base continues to diversify, giving us a broad-based
      opportunity for continued business expansion.”

Safe Harbor Statement


      The foregoing paragraphs contain forward-looking statements
      within the meaning of the Federal securities laws, including,
      for example, statements regarding the market demand for our
      products, our growth prospects and opportunities for
      continued business expansion, our market opportunity, and our
      expectations with respect to our business prospects. These
      forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that
      are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the
      company’s operations and business environment, which could
      cause actual results to differ materially from those
      expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements
      contained in the foregoing discussion. These uncertainties
      and factors include but are not limited to: overall
      conditions in the markets in which the company competes;
      global financial conditions and uncertainties; policies and
      regulations in China; market acceptance and demand for the
      company’s products; the impact of factory closures or other
      events causing delays by our customers on the timing of sales
      of our products; our ability to control costs, our ability to
      utilize our manufacturing capacity; product yields and their
      impact on gross margins; and other factors as set forth in
      the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
      on Form 10-Q and other filings made with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission.  Each of these factors is difficult
      to predict and many are beyond the company’s control. The
      company does not undertake any obligation to update any
      forward-looking statement, as a result of new information,
      future events or otherwise.

AXT's products include both high-performance semiconductor substrates for major electronic and opto-electronic applications, and a line of industry-critical raw materials. 
In substrates, our main product line consists of gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates in one-, two-, three-, four-, five-, and six-inch diameters. We offer a second product line of indium phosphide (InP) substrates in two-, three-, and four-inch diameters. We also produce single-element substrates  manufactured from germanium (Ge) in two- and four-inch diameters. We produce our wafers at our Tongmei facility, located in a suburb of Beijing. This large manufacturing complex totals eight buildings with about 300,000 square feet of factory area, making it what we believe is the world's largest III-V wafer production facility. 
Regarding raw materials, we participate in 10 joint ventures in China that offer products critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry. Those materials include gallium (4N, 6N and 7N Ga), arsenic (4N, 6N and 7N) and germanium, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles for growing crystals, and boron oxide. These raw materials are used in AXT's products and are also sold to third parties.
