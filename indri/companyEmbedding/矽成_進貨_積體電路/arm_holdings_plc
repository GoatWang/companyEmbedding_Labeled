ARM Holdings (ARM) is a British multinational semiconductor and software design company, owned by SoftBank Group and its Vision Fund. Headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom, its primary business is in the design of ARM processors (CPUs), although it also designs software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, as well as systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. It is considered to be market dominant for processors in mobile phones (smartphones or otherwise) and tablet computers. The company is one of the best-known 'Silicon Fen' companies.[7]
Processors based on designs licensed from ARM, or designed by licensees of one of the ARM instruction set architectures, are used in all classes of computing devices. Examples include microcontrollers in embedded systems – including real-time safety systems (cars' ABS),[8] smart TVs (Google TV), all modern smartwatches (such as Qualcomm Toq), as well as smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops,[9][10] servers[11] and supercomputers/HPC.[12][13][14]
ARM's Mali line of graphics processing units (GPU) are used in laptops, in over 50% of Android tablets by market share,[15] and some versions of Samsung's smartphones and smartwatches (Samsung Galaxy Gear). It is the third most popular GPU in mobile devices.[16]
Systems, including iPhone smartphones, frequently include many chips, from many different providers, that include one or more licensed ARM cores, in addition to those in the main ARM-based processor.[17] ARM's core designs are also used in chips that support many common network related technologies in smartphones: Bluetooth, WiFi and broadband,[18] in addition to corresponding equipment such as Bluetooth headsets,[19] 802.11ac routers,[20] and network provider's cellular LTE.[21]
ARM's main CPU competitors in servers include Intel and AMD.[22] In mobile applications, Intel's x86 Atom is a competitor. AMD also sells ARM based chips[23] as well as x86; Imagination Technologies (MIPS) offers another RISC design for embedded systems. ARM's main GPU competitors include mobile GPUs from Imagination Technologies (PowerVR), Qualcomm (Adreno) and increasingly Nvidia and Intel. Despite competing within GPUs, Qualcomm and Nvidia have combined their GPUs with an ARM licensed CPU.
ARM had a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on NASDAQ. However Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group made an agreed offer for ARM on 18 July 2016, subject to approval by ARM's shareholders, valuing the company at £23.4 billion.[24] The transaction was completed on 5 September 2016.[25][26]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
The acronym ARM was first used in 1983 and originally stood for "Acorn RISC Machine". Acorn Computers' first RISC processor was used in the original Acorn Archimedes and was one of the first RISC processors used in small computers. However, when the company was incorporated in 1990, the acronym was changed to "Advanced RISC Machines", in light of the company's name "Advanced RISC Machines Ltd." At the time of the IPO in 1998, the company name was changed to "ARM Holdings",[27] often just called ARM like the processors.
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in November 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines Ltd and structured as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and VLSI Technology.[28][29][30] The new company intended to further the development of the Acorn RISC Machine processor, which was originally used in the Acorn Archimedes and had been selected by Apple for their Newton project. Its first profitable year was 1993. The company's Silicon Valley and Tokyo offices were opened in 1994. ARM invested in Palmchip Corporation in 1997 to provide system on chip platforms and to enter into the disk drive market.[31][32] In 1998 the Company changed its name from Advanced RISC Machines Ltd to ARM Ltd.[33] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ in 1998[34] and by February 1999, Apple's shareholding had fallen to 14.8%.[35]
In 2010, ARM joined with IBM, Texas Instruments, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Freescale Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) in forming a non-profit open source engineering company, Linaro.[36]

Wikinews has related news: ARM to be bought by SoftBank


Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Group made an agreed offer for ARM on 18 July 2016, subject to approval by ARM's shareholders, valuing the company at £23.4 billion.[24][62] The transaction was completed on 5 September 2016.[25]
Operations[edit]
Business model[edit]
Unlike most traditional microprocessor suppliers, such as Intel, Freescale (the former semiconductor division of Motorola, now NXP Semiconductors) and Renesas (a former joint venture between Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric), ARM only creates and licenses its technology as intellectual property (IP),[63] rather than manufacturing and selling its own physical CPUs, GPUs, SoCs or microcontrollers. This model is similar to fellow British design houses: ARC International, and Imagination Technologies who have similarly been designing and licensing GPUs, CPUs, and SoCs, along with supplying tooling and various design and support services to their licensees.
Facilities[edit]
The company has offices and design centres across the world, including San Jose, California, Austin, Texas, Chandler, Arizona and Bellevue, Washington in the United States;[64] Bangalore and Noida in India;[65] Trondheim in Norway;[66] Lund in Sweden;[66] Sophia Antipolis in France;[66] Grasbrunn in Germany;[66] Budapest in Hungary;[66] Sentjernej in Slovenia;[66] Yokohama in Japan; [65] China,[65] Taiwan.[65]

Technology[edit]
A characteristic feature of ARM processors is their low electric power consumption, which makes them particularly suitable for use in portable devices.[67] In fact, almost all modern mobile phones and personal digital assistants contain ARM CPUs, making them the most widely used 32-bit microprocessor family in the world. As of 2005, ARMs accounted for over 75% of all 32-bit embedded CPUs.[68]
ARM processors are used as the main CPU for most mobile phones, including those manufactured by Apple, HTC, Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Samsung;[69] many PDAs and handhelds, like the Apple iPod and iPad,[70][71] Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, 3DS and Switch, Game Park GP32 and GamePark Holdings GP2X; as well as many other applications, including GPS navigation devices, digital cameras,[72] digital televisions,[72] network devices and storage. The WLAN processor of Sony's PlayStation Portable is an older ARM9.[73]
Licensees[edit]
ARM offers several microprocessor core designs that have been "publicly licensed" 830 times including 249 times for their newer "application processors" (non-microcontroller) used in such applications as smartphones and tablets.[74] Three of those companies[75] are known to have a licence for one of ARM's most powerful processor core, the 64-bit Cortex-A72 (some including ARM's other 64-bit core the Cortex-A53) and four have a licence to their most powerful 32-bit core, the Cortex-A15.
Cores for 32-bit architectures include Cortex-A32, Cortex-A15, Cortex-A12, Cortex-A17, Cortex-A9, Cortex-A8, Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A5, and older "Classic ARM Processors", as well as variant architectures for microcontrollers that include these cores: ARM Cortex-R7, ARM Cortex-R5, ARM Cortex-R4, ARM Cortex-M4, ARM Cortex-M3, ARM Cortex-M1, ARM Cortex-M0+, and ARM Cortex-M0 for licensing; the three most popular licensing models are the "Perpetual (Implementation) License", "Term License" and "Per Use License".[76]
Companies often license these designs from ARM to manufacture and integrate into their own System on chip (SoC) with other components such as GPUs (sometimes ARM's Mali) or radio basebands (for mobile phones).
In addition to licenses for their core designs, ARM offers an "architectural license" for their instruction sets, allowing the licensees to design their own cores that implement one of those instruction sets. An ARM architectural license is more costly than a regular ARM core license,[77] and also requires the necessary engineering power to design a CPU based on the instruction set.
Processors believed to be designed independently from ARM include Apple's (architecture license from March 2008[78]) A6, A6X, A7 and all subsequent Apple processors[79] (used in iPhone 5, iPad and iPhone 5S), Qualcomm's Snapdragon series[80] (used in smartphones such as the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S4) and Samsung's Exynos ("Mongoose" M1 cores). There were around 15 architectural licensees in 2013,[81] including Marvell, Apple, Qualcomm,[77] Broadcom[82] and some others.
ARM core licensees[edit]
Companies that are current licensees of the 64-bit ARMv8-A core designs include AMD,[83] AppliedMicro (X-Gene),[84] Broadcom,[83] Calxeda,[83] HiSilicon,[83] Rockchip,[85] Samsung,[83] and STMicroelectronics.[83]
Companies that are current or former licensees of 32-bit ARM core designs include AMD,[86] Broadcom,[87] Freescale (now NXP Semiconductors),[88][89] Huawei (HiSilicon division),[90] IBM,[91] Infineon Technologies (Infineon XMC 32-bit MCU families),[92] Intel (older "ARM11 MPCore"), LG,[93][94] Microsemi,[95] NXP Semiconductors,[96] Renesas,[97] Rockchip,[85] Samsung,[98][99] STMicroelectronics,[100] and Texas Instruments.[101]
ARM architectural licensees[edit]
In 2013, ARM stated that there are around 15 architectural licensees, but the full list is not yet public knowledge.[77][81]
Companies with a 64-bit ARMv8-A architectural license include Applied Micro,[102][103] Broadcom,[82][104] Cavium,[105] Huawei,[106][107] Nvidia,[108][109] AMD,[110][111] Samsung,[112] and Apple.[77]
Companies with a 32-bit ARM architectural license include Broadcom (ARMv7),[104] Faraday Technology (ARMv4, ARMv5),[113] Marvell Technology Group,[114] Microsoft,[115] Qualcomm,[116][117] Intel,[118] and Apple.[77]
Fujitsu[edit]
Fujitsu (a supercomputer maker of June 2011 world's fastest K computer according to TOP500) announced at the International Supercomputing Conference in June 2016 that its future exascale supercomputer will feature processors of its own design that implement the ARMv8 architecture, rather than the SPARC processors used in earlier supercomputers. These processors will also implement extensions to the ARMv8 architecture equivalent to HPC-ACE2 that Fujitsu is developing with ARM Holdings.[119]
Mali licensees[edit]
Companies that are current licensees of the Mali GPU designs include Rockchip,[85] Allwinner,[120] Samsung, Huawei, MediaTek, Spreadtrum and others.
Sales and market share[edit]
ARM-based CPU market share in 2010: over 95% in smartphone market; 10% in mobile computers; 35% in digital TVs and set-top boxes; however, ARM did not have any market share in servers and desktop PCs.[121]
As of 2014[update], over 50 billion chips with ARM cores inside have been produced, 10 billion of which were produced in 2013,.[122]
In the fourth quarter of 2010, 1.8 billion chips based on an ARM design were manufactured.[123]
With Microsoft's ARM-based Windows 8 OS, market research firm IHS predicted that in 2015 23% of all the PCs in the world will use ARM processors.[124] This guess by IHS has since been proved wrong and desktop Windows for ARM has been discontinued.
In May 2012, Dell announced the Copper platform, a server based on Marvell’s ARM powered devices.[125] In October 2012, ARM announced the first set of early licensees of the 64-bit-capable Cortex-A57 processor.[83]
ARM's goal was to have, by 2015, ARM-based processors in more than half of all tablets, mini-notebooks and other mobile PCs sold.[126]

Partnerships[edit]
University of Michigan[edit]
In 2011, ARM renewed a five-year, $5 million research partnership with University of Michigan, which extended their existing research partnership to 2015. This partnership will focus on ultra-low energy and sustainable computing.[130][131]
Senior management[edit]
Warren East was appointed Chief Executive Officer of ARM Holdings in October 2001. In the 2011 financial year, East received a total compensation of £1,187,500 from ARM, comprising a salary of £475,000 and a bonus of £712,500.[132][133] East said in March 2013 that he would retire from ARM in May, with president Simon Segars taking over as CEO.[134] In March 2014, former Rexam chairman Stuart Chambers succeeded John Buchanan as chairman. Chambers, a non-executive director of Tesco and former chief executive of Nippon Sheet Glass Group, had previously worked at Mars and Royal Dutch Shell.[135]

歷史[编辑]
ARM的前身為艾康電腦，於1978年，於英國劍橋創立。在1980年代晚期，蘋果電腦開始與艾康電腦合作開發新版的ARM核心。1985年，艾康電腦研發出採用精簡指令集的新處理器，名為ARM（Acorn RISC Machine），又稱ARM 1。因為艾康電腦的財務出現狀況，1990年11月27日，獲得Apple與VLSI科技的資助，分割出ARM，成為獨立子公司。ARM最初只有12人，因母公司財務狀況不佳，辦公室只是一間倉庫，以设计ARM处理器架构闻名于世，技术具有性能高、成本低和能耗省的特点，產品已遍及工業控制、消费类电子产品、通信系统、网络系统。ARM自己不制造芯片，将其技术知识产权（IP核）授权给世界上许多著名的半导体廠，其中包括Intel、IBM、LG半导体、NEC、SONY、飞利浦、Atmel、Broadcom、Cirrus Logic、Freescale、Actions等。
ARM成為一家獨立的處理器公司，從事研發低費用、低功耗、高性能晶片。受惠於手機與移動式裝置、汽车系统、大型家用电器的應用，ARM9核心已擁有超過200家的授權業者，ARM7也有150多家的公司採用。Apple Newton PDA用的就是ARM610處理器，但是Newton PDA的想法过于超前，在1997年停產。[6]1991年ARM將產品授權給英國GEC Plessey半導體公司。1993年，ARM將產品授權給Cirrus Logic和德州儀器，當時TI在DSP领域已经取得很高的成就，但并不熟悉CPU領域。ARM與Nokia和TI合作開發出16位的Thumb指令集，创建了ARM/Thumb的SoC商业模式，ARM7是最重要的一颗处理器内核，使用更小的晶粒, 得以發展出低功耗模式。1995年，DEC开始研发StrongARM, 1996年2月5日，DEC正式发布SA110处理器。SA110处理器迅速得到了业界的认可，Apple在MessagePAD 2000使用了SA110.也就在1996年這一年，發生財務危機的Olivetti将所持有的14.7%的Acorn股份出售给了雷曼兄弟。1996年发布ARM8内核，性能提高了一倍，但无法与StrongARM抗衡。1997年，DEC发布了第二颗StrongARM芯片，SA1100。Intel收購DEC在Hudson的工厂，Intel为StrongARM取名為XScale。1997年發佈ARM9, ARM9不再使用普林斯顿结构，而转向哈佛结构，原來的3級指令流水线提高到5级，最高的时钟频率达到220MHz。1998年ARM10内核正式推出，使用了6级流水线结构，並改良Cache Memory, 對乘法指令進行最佳化，並增加浮点运算，但由於XScale的關係，ARM10並未獲得巨大的成功，XScale处理器的最高运行频率达到了1.25GHz, Intel因不堪巨額虧損，将XScale处理器業務售予Marvell。日後Intel開始主推ATOM处理器。
1998年4月17日，ARM公司在英國倫敦證交所和美國納斯達克上市。[7]早期Apple投入3百萬美金擁有了ARM公司43%的股份，1998 年，ARM公司在英國和美國同時上市後，Apple逐漸賣出了這些股份。2006年，全球ARM芯片出货量为20亿片。至2007年底，ARM核心晶片的總出貨量已突破100億顆。早期的ARM7跟 8051一般是使用馮紐曼架構，而目前ARM11 或 Cortex A 則使用哈佛架構。
2010年6月中，蘋果公司表示有意以80億美元的價格收購ARM公司，但遭到拒絕。ARM公司CEO Warren East稱ARM公司作為獨立公司更具價值，“買家展開收購的唯一理由是消滅競爭對手。”[來源請求]
2013年12月13日，ARM宣布收購著名光引擎技術公司Geomerics。在光影計算領域Geomerics擁有非常領先的技術。此次收購將擴大ARM在圖形技術行業的領先地位。
2016年7月18日，日本軟銀集團同意以243億英鎊（約309億美元），以全現金方式收購安謀公司。

安謀控股公司（英语：ARM Holdings plc.），又稱ARM公司，是總部位於英國英格蘭劍橋的半導體設計與軟體公司。主要的產品是ARM架構處理器及相關外圍組件的電路設計方案，產品以智慧財產權核授權的形式與相應的軟體開發工具一起向客戶銷售。目前是日本軟銀集團旗下的子公司。
歷史[编辑]
ARM的前身為艾康電腦，於1978年，於英國劍橋創立。在1980年代晚期，蘋果電腦開始與艾康電腦合作開發新版的ARM核心。1985年，艾康電腦研發出採用精簡指令集的新處理器，名為ARM（Acorn RISC Machine），又稱ARM 1。因為艾康電腦的財務出現狀況，1990年11月27日，獲得Apple與VLSI科技的資助，分割出ARM，成為獨立子公司。ARM最初只有12人，因母公司財務狀況不佳，辦公室只是一間倉庫，以设计ARM处理器架构闻名于世，技术具有性能高、成本低和能耗省的特点，產品已遍及工業控制、消费类电子产品、通信系统、网络系统。ARM自己不制造芯片，将其技术知识产权（IP核）授权给世界上许多著名的半导体廠，其中包括Intel、IBM、LG半导体、NEC、SONY、飞利浦、Atmel、Broadcom、Cirrus Logic、Freescale、Actions等。
ARM成為一家獨立的處理器公司，從事研發低費用、低功耗、高性能晶片。受惠於手機與移動式裝置、汽车系统、大型家用电器的應用，ARM9核心已擁有超過200家的授權業者，ARM7也有150多家的公司採用。Apple Newton PDA用的就是ARM610處理器，但是Newton PDA的想法过于超前，在1997年停產。[6]1991年ARM將產品授權給英國GEC Plessey半導體公司。1993年，ARM將產品授權給Cirrus Logic和德州儀器，當時TI在DSP领域已经取得很高的成就，但并不熟悉CPU領域。ARM與Nokia和TI合作開發出16位的Thumb指令集，创建了ARM/Thumb的SoC商业模式，ARM7是最重要的一颗处理器内核，使用更小的晶粒, 得以發展出低功耗模式。1995年，DEC开始研发StrongARM, 1996年2月5日，DEC正式发布SA110处理器。SA110处理器迅速得到了业界的认可，Apple在MessagePAD 2000使用了SA110.也就在1996年這一年，發生財務危機的Olivetti将所持有的14.7%的Acorn股份出售给了雷曼兄弟。1996年发布ARM8内核，性能提高了一倍，但无法与StrongARM抗衡。1997年，DEC发布了第二颗StrongARM芯片，SA1100。Intel收購DEC在Hudson的工厂，Intel为StrongARM取名為XScale。1997年發佈ARM9, ARM9不再使用普林斯顿结构，而转向哈佛结构，原來的3級指令流水线提高到5级，最高的时钟频率达到220MHz。1998年ARM10内核正式推出，使用了6级流水线结构，並改良Cache Memory, 對乘法指令進行最佳化，並增加浮点运算，但由於XScale的關係，ARM10並未獲得巨大的成功，XScale处理器的最高运行频率达到了1.25GHz, Intel因不堪巨額虧損，将XScale处理器業務售予Marvell。日後Intel開始主推ATOM处理器。
1998年4月17日，ARM公司在英國倫敦證交所和美國納斯達克上市。[7]早期Apple投入3百萬美金擁有了ARM公司43%的股份，1998 年，ARM公司在英國和美國同時上市後，Apple逐漸賣出了這些股份。2006年，全球ARM芯片出货量为20亿片。至2007年底，ARM核心晶片的總出貨量已突破100億顆。早期的ARM7跟 8051一般是使用馮紐曼架構，而目前ARM11 或 Cortex A 則使用哈佛架構。
2010年6月中，蘋果公司表示有意以80億美元的價格收購ARM公司，但遭到拒絕。ARM公司CEO Warren East稱ARM公司作為獨立公司更具價值，“買家展開收購的唯一理由是消滅競爭對手。”[來源請求]
2013年12月13日，ARM宣布收購著名光引擎技術公司Geomerics。在光影計算領域Geomerics擁有非常領先的技術。此次收購將擴大ARM在圖形技術行業的領先地位。
2016年7月18日，日本軟銀集團同意以243億英鎊（約309億美元），以全現金方式收購安謀公司。

Our People
Arm was founded by a dozen engineers working from a converted barn in Cambridge, UK, a quarter of a century ago. By the end of 2015, that team had grown to more than 4,200 people in sites around the world. Arm gives its people the capabilities, processes and infrastructure to enable them to develop and thrive as the business scales and strengthens. At the same time, we seek to nurture a work culture that remains true to our founders’ original vision; empowering our engineers to be innovative and drive Arm-based technology into all areas where compute happens, maximizing their creative potential and enabling all of our people to be their brilliant selves.
Arm Careers

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
