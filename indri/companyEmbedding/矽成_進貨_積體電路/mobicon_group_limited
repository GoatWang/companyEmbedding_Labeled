The Group’s operating profit decreased by around 10% to approximately HK$18 million (31st March 2015: approximately HK$20 million). 






During the year under review, the Group continued to focus on its three core business operations, namely: (1) the distribution of electronic components, automation parts and equipment under the brand of  (the “Electronic Trading Business”)”); and (2) the Computer Business which includes (i) the retail sales of computer products and smartphone accessories under the brand of  (the “Computer Business”) and (ii) the distribution of computer products and consumer products under the brand of APower (the “Computer Distribution Business”); and (3) the Cosmetic Retail Business under the brand of   .

OUTLOOK


 


Over the year under review, there were several notable transitions in the global economy including low level of commodity prices, slowdown of China’s economy as a result of a structural change from investment activities towards domestic consumption and a relatively strong US Dollar against other currencies. Growth is moderate in advanced economies whilst many of the emerging countries are stuck in low growth era. 






Retail sales slump in Hong Kong continued its trend in 2015. Rent and prices are set to fall further as retail sales declined. The outlook for the retail sector is weak as a result of falling tourist arrival, mainly those from Mainland China due to the adverse impact of the “one-visit-one-week” policy implemented by the Central Government of China. However, the domestic demand remained resilient supported by factors such as steady inflation and low unemployment rate.






With regard to the Electronic Trading Business, the Group will allocate more resources for the development of lighting products and RF module for toys application to expand its market shares in China and Hong Kong. In addition, the Group expects to expand several product lines including LED dimming Modules, Bluetooth Modules and WiFi Modules. In addition, the Group will cautiously develop its Electronic Trading Business and participate in reputable industry exhibitions. Through these events, the Group will maintain close relationship with vendors and explore new business opportunities as well as to gain insights on industrial trends and new products. During the year under review, the Group has also utilised various social media platform to promote its new products and the outcome is satisfactory.






For the Computer Business, the Group will develop marketing strategies to increase its market presence through channels such as social media network. The Group will also increase product variety to satisfy the needs of different customer groups. Furthermore, the Group also expects to introduce several models of computer and mobile accessories and develop lighting industry.
