內嵌力旺電子NeoEE矽智財之量產晶圓累積出貨突破十萬片
2017/04/12
邏輯非揮發性記憶體 (Logic-Based Non-Volatile Memory，Logic NVM) 矽智財領導廠商力旺電子今日宣布，內嵌使用NeoEE矽智財的量產晶圓累積出貨量已突破十萬片。NeoEE矽智財為嵌入式之多次可程式(Multiple-Time-Programmable，MTP)解決方案，已成功被世界級晶圓廠採用於各製程平台。近期指紋辨識(Fingerprint)、2.4G無線通訊(Wireless)、微控制器(MCU)、電源管理(PMIC)、光學防手震(Optical Image Stabilization, OIS)系統、可編程伽瑪校正緩衝電路晶片(P-Gamma)等應用產品的快速發展，為推動內嵌NeoEE量產晶圓出貨量突破十萬片的重要推力。
NeoEE矽智財擁有與CMOS製程完全相容之特性，不需額外增加光罩，並具備低讀取電壓、低寫入功耗、高可靠度等特性，不僅於此，NeoEE的操作耐熱度更可高達攝氏150度。因為具備上述這些優異特性，NeoEE矽智財不但可以被用在一般消費性電子產品應用領域，也很符合車用電子應用領域的需求，方便客戶作參數設定或調校。
NeoEE的量產晶圓出貨數中，很大部分便是來自於指紋辨識相關產品的貢獻。客戶使用NeoEE 矽智財於指紋辨識相關產品中，可大為強化其感測之正確性與安全性。
NeoEE的量產晶圓出貨量仍會持續倍數增加。力旺電子將會繼續提供最全面的邏輯非揮發性記憶體矽智財，為客戶最緊密且值得信任的合作夥伴。

eMemory



								Founded in August of 2000, eMemory Technology Inc. provides a wide range of logic compatible non-volatile memory (NVM) IP and technology development services based on over 250 patents.

eMemory's core technologies - NeoBit and NeoFlash, are widely built on more than 120 process nodes at various Foundries and IDMs from 0.7 um to 65 nm generations. They feature superb structure robustness, high manufacturing yield, and easy design integration leading to fast time to volume. The derivative processes include Mixed Signal, Radio Frequency (RF), High Voltage (HV), BCD, SiGe and Low Power.

NeoBit is a programmable logic device aiming for embedded one-time programmable (OTP)/ multi-time programmable (MTP) applications. It utilizes hot electron injection for programming, while erasure can be achieved through UV exposure.

NeoFlash is the ultimate solution aiming for embedded MTP/ Flash applications. It utilizes advanced single poly Flash structure, and requires only 3 additional non-critical masks to be embedded into CMOS logic processes.

To date, eMemory has reached the record of 2.8M+ production wafers, over 1,400 customers' product tape-outs, and more than 400 products are in production. eMemory provides quick turnaround time and dedicated customized engineering services to help our customers create their differentiations and unique market position.
