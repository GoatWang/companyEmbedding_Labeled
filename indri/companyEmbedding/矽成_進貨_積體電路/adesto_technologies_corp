Adesto Technologies Introduces New Solution to Enable Smart Home Products
Jul 12 17
Adesto Technologies announced the DataFlash-L series, a new family of memory products targeting a variety of smart home applications. Designed for low power operation and higher system efficiency, DataFlash-L products can help optimize embedded systems in wireless edge devices. The DataFlash-L (AT25PE) series offers a range of power-saving features including wide operating voltage range (Vcc) and “ultra-deep power down” mode. With a Vcc range of 1.65V to 3.6V, the DataFlash-L family uses less power during active modes and offers designers the ability to operate the system in lower voltages -- maximizing battery life and minimizing the need for on-board capacitors. Home control systems and other wireless devices using DataFlash-L can operate from unregulated battery supplies and may not require low drop out or boost regulators to manage the power supply rail during a power-failure. The embedded ultra-deep power down mode allows the device to function with a standby current of less than 400 nanoamps, far lower than competitive offerings, and an important feature for battery-operated devices. To improve system efficiency, the new products include a page erase feature and built-in intelligence to automatically manage internal programming and erase tasks, reducing CPU overhead by offloading memory management tasks. The product family also features comprehensive security and unique identification features to protect stored data and prevent outside tampering. Additionally, the new DataFlash-L is a pin compatible alternative to Micron’s M25PE memory series which is used in smart home, industrial and automation markets.

LONDON – Adesto Technologies Corp. (Sunnyvale, Calif.), developer of resistive RAM non-volatile memory based on conductive bridging random access memory (CBRAM) technology, has acquired certain serial flash product families from Atmel Corp. (San Jose, Calif.)[Get a 10% discount on ARM TechCon 2012 conference passes by using promo code EDIT. Click here to learn about the show and register.]The acquisitions include the AT45xxx DataFlash and AT25xxx BIOS Flash product lines and associated patents and include IP licensing to cover support of the products and future product development.Adesto did not disclose how much it has paid for the product lines.Adesto said it intends to expand the Atmel product line offerings and that the newly acquired products complement Adesto's line of CBRAM devices for embedded applications. Second generation CBRAM devices are planned to ship in 2013, Adesto stated."The industry and market is ready for a supplier that can deliver on today's products and offer a roadmap for the next generation. Our roadmap includes higher density and higher performance devices with lower power and lower cost solutions based on an advanced memory technology that can scale with CMOS," said Narbeh Derhacobian, CEO of Adesto, in a statement.As part of the agreement, Atmel will provide manufacturing and other transition services to Adesto for up to one year. A team of Atmel employees supporting the product lines will also join Adesto.Adesto, founded in 2006, is included in version 13.0 of the Silicon 60 list of emerging startups published by EE Times and entered the Silicon 60 at version 10 in April 2010.

					Full Description



Adesto Technologies Corporation, incorporated on May 13, 2015, is a provider of application-specific and ultra-low power non-volatile memory products. The Company optimizes its non-volatile memory products for Internet of Things (IoT), applications, including current and next-generation Internet-connected devices in the consumer, industrial, medical and wearables markets. It operates in application-specific and feature-rich, ultra-low power non-volatile memory (NVM) products segment. It combines its non-volatile memory design capabilities with intellectual property and differentiated technology platforms to deliver products that manage the overall energy consumption of its customers' systems and battery life. Its products feature embedded intelligence in a small form factor. It sells its products directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs), respectively that manufacture products for its end customers. In general, it works directly with its customers to have its NVM devices designed into and qualified for their products, which it refers to as design wins. Although it maintains direct sales, support and development relationships with its end customers, most of its products are sold to those end customers through distributors.The Company offers four product families: DataFlash, Fusion Flash, Mavriq and Moneta, which are manufactured using two technology platforms: industry-standard floating gate technology and Conductive Bridging Random-access memory (RAM) (CBRAM) technology. It optimizes its products to operate at a voltage range, allowing continued operation even as the battery discharges and reaches very low power levels, where commodity NVM devices typically fail. Operating intelligence, such as low power mode, is designed into its products to help systems save energy. By incorporating power management features in its NVM products, it enables its customers to reduce the number of components included in and the overall footprint of their systems.Standard Serial Flash ProductsThe Company's DataFlash family of NVM products contains features that manage power requirements and system efficiencies, and is especially well suited for data-logging applications, such as industrial automation, home automation sensing, and health and fitness tracking. Its Fusion Flash product family combines industry-standard sector sizes and read/write commands with new features, such as wide voltage, ultra-deep power down mode and flexible erase capability. The Fusion Flash family of memory products is designed for use in various high-volume consumer applications, such as wearables, mobile and other applications requiring energy conservation and in which program code is copied from flash into embedded RAM for execution. Its features can extend the life of battery-operated devices, such as Bluetooth 4.0 products, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) Ultra Low Energy (ULE) products, ZigBee RF4CE, Z-Wave and other Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi-direct applications. Key features provided by its DataFlash and Fusion Flash product families include ultra-deep power down, which assists in system-level energy savings, and wide supply voltage range operation, which can maximize battery life. Its DataFlash product family also has byte-write capability, which enables management of the NVM system resources that allows for a smaller software footprint in the controller's Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), making more resources available for higher-priority operations and managing energy consumption.CBRAM-based ProductsThe Company's Mavriq family of memory products provides embedded or standalone storage technology. These products feature wide voltage range operation, low energy write and ultra-fast write speeds, enabling extended battery life in connected devices and other energy-conscious applications. With functional and electrical compatibility with competing serial memory products, its low-energy Mavriq memory solutions are well matched to the new design requirements of IoT and other applications, such as camera sensors, Bluetooth low energy devices, wearables, gaming components, printer cartridges, medical equipment and other devices that leverage its unique capabilities. With the ability to read and write at 50-100x lower power than comparable memory products, the Moneta family of memory products meets the requirements of new, ultra-low energy IoT electronics and enables applications in energy harvesting and other low energy system designs. By consuming less energy during standard operation, these products can extend battery life and/or allow customers flexibility to use smaller batteries to power their systems. In addition to their inherent low power technology capability, Moneta products employ features to save energy, automatically switching to deep power down between transactions, and providing an ultra-deep power down mode. Its Moneta products make battery-operated and battery-free designs possible, by enabling low power read, write and standby NVM operations.
