Functions, quality, cost and lead time... 
MegaChips offers optimal solutions that resolve issues with customers' products.
We develop and supply creative products underpinned by MegaChips' superior technologies in the image, audio and communication sectors. 
We have also established a fully integrated support system, covering everything from product specifications and logic design to physical design, production and quality, to enable us to meet our customers needs as quickly as possible.


 System LSIs based on unique technologies (algorithms and architectures)

MegaChips engineers, with extensive expertise in LSIs and systems, integrate the many different functions required for customer system devices into a single chip, called a system LSI. We offer state-of-the-art system LSIs with compact and power-saving features designed exclusively for specific customers to propose unique and optimal solutions that solve customers' problems.We secure our competitiveness by inventing unique algorithms and architectures, which significantly impact on product performance and price. We own patents and other intellectual property on most of our products.That considerably improves not only the performance of customers' devices but also their cost effectiveness. We provide our services in very close contact with our customers.
Key Examples of Market-Driven Products Featuring our Patented Technologies



Image processing LSI devices for digital cameras with technologies for

pixel interpolation, color adjustment, noise elimination and other image processing technologies for high-quality, optimized pictures 
enabling processing circuits that support a range of image-capturing sensors 
reducing power consumption required for the high-speed processing of large volumes of data associated with the use of high-resolution sensors 
(Ultra high-speed image processing unit (Pixessor™)) 




ASCP LSI

MegaChips tailors its LSI development to customer needs by accepting the project at multiple development phases, ranging from project proposals based on requirements or specifications to implementation of design data such as RTL and netlists designed by customers.
