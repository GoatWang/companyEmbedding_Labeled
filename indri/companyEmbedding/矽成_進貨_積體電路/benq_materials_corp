History[edit]
BenQ was originally spun off from Acer in 2001 to provide a separate branded channel. In 2006 Acer disposed of its remaining shares in BenQ.[3]
BenQ's first mobile phone was the M775C, from 2003. During Q1 2004, eight new phones were announced, ranging from bar and clamshell phones to Windows Mobile smartphones. A further seven phones, mainly clamshells, came in 2005.
BenQ-Siemens[edit]
Main article: BenQ-Siemens
On October 1, 2005, BenQ Corp. acquired the mobile devices division of Germany's Siemens AG, becoming the sixth largest company in the mobile phone industry by accumulated market share. The acquisition results in a new business group, BenQ Mobile, of BenQ Corporation entirely dedicated to wireless communications. Mobile phones of the new group are marketed under a new brand, BenQ-Siemens.[4]
In late September 2006, the mobile devices division of BenQ, BenQ Mobile (Germany), announced bankruptcy when BenQ Corp. discontinued its funding. As a result, BenQ Mobile was placed under the supervision of a state-appointed bankruptcy administrator. In February 2007, BenQ Mobile was finally disbanded as a suitable buyer could not be found. An estimated 2000 BenQ Mobile employees lost their jobs.[5] On August 24, 2006 BenQ announced plans to spin off its manufacturing operations in early 2007, separating contract manufacturing and own-brand divisions.[6]
After Siemens[edit]
After BenQ-Siemens collapsed, BenQ continued to make phones, primarily aimed at the Asian market (although one was released in Europe too).
This is a list of BenQ phones during the post-BenQ Siemens period:

T33
T51
C30
E72 (Windows Mobile smartphone. Also released in Europe)
M7
T60
E53
C36
E55

After a hiatus, BenQ resumed production of smartphones under its own brand in 2013.[7]
Smartphones[edit]

Dell Venue Pro

Qisda Corporation, a subsidiary of BenQ, manufactured smartphones for Dell, which were marketed under the Venue Pro name, and which ran Windows Phone 7.[8]> The phone was made available in limited quantities on November 8, 2010 with the launch of Windows Phone.[9] Delivery of the phone met severe setbacks, it was riled with numerous hardware issues,[10] and the device was discontinued as of March 8, 2012.[11]

Android


BenQ A3 — made for the Asian market, runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean
BenQ T3
BenQ F5 RAM 2GB, runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat


EE (UK)

Starting in 2015 BenQ manufactured the Harrier and Harrier Mini Android Smartphones for the UK mobile telecoms provider EE.
Corporate restructuring[edit]

BenQ DC C1030 Eco.


On August 24, 2006, BenQ announced plans to spin off its manufacturing operations in early 2007, separating contract manufacturing and own-brand divisions.[6]
In April 2007, considering that the branded business has achieved sufficient profit and scale to sustain and grow its operation independently, BenQ announced the plan to spin off its branded business. After the spin-off, BenQ Corporation was renamed Qisda Corporation, which will focus on integrated manufacturing service business, and the spun off company has succeeded the name of BenQ Corporation, which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Qisda Corp.[12]
On September 3, 2007, the newly spun off BenQ Corporation commenced its new operation to continue selling and marketing products under the BenQ brand name.[13]
Acquiring Zowie Gear[edit]
On December 10, 2015, BenQ announced that ZOWIE GEAR would become their new gaming division.[14] Their newer products include mice, mouse pads, sound cards, monitors, and other gaming accessories. The monitor line of products is used by over 80% of professional gamers.[15]
