APTOS Technology Environmental Policy

 




Bestan, Inc. and APTOS Technology, hereto referred to as APTOS Technology, recognize the value and importance of protecting and preserving our global resources and environment. APTOS Technology also recognizes the role it must play in this protection.
 
Our basic environmental philosophy is:
 
“APTOS Technology is committed to conducting its business in a manner that will preserve and protect our global environment for current and future generations to come”
 
APTOS Technology continues its responsibility for environmental preservation and protection by committing to be RoHS compliant.
 
APTOS Technology has developed a corporate RoHS Specification (APTOS Technology RoHS Specification) that sets forth requirements that all suppliers providing parts or materials to APTOS Technology must meet. This RoHS specification is in effect for all materials that are subject to the requirements of the European Unions Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU) amending 2002/95/EC (RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC), Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS).
 
APTOS Technology is also committed to meeting all the requirements of the European Unions 2011/37/EU (ELV Directive 2011/37/EU) amending 2000/53/EC ELV directive (ELV Directive 2000/53/EC) as well as the 2012/19/EU (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) amending 2002/96/EC WEEE directive (WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC).
Under the RoHS directive, electrical and electronic equipment placed on the European Union market after July 1, 2006 may not contain more than specified levels of:

Lead
Mercury
Cadmium
Hexavalent Chromium
PBB’s – Polybrominated biphenyls
PBDE’s – Polybrominated diphenyl ethers


 


A copy of the APTOS Technology, Bestan, Inc., Letter of Compliance can be found at the following link (Bestan Letter of Compliance).
 
APTOS Technology is committed to meeting the requirements of these regulations as they are introduced.APTOS Technology has changed our part numbers to easily identify all RoHS compliant parts.
 
In some cases, traditional and older technology parts will no longer be available. APTOS Technology will make every effort to inform customers of discontinuing parts and will ensure that our website reflects this information.
 
For all RoHS part numbers: As a standard, APTOS Technology will add a “-G” at the end of all part numbers that are RoHS compliant. A “V” will also be inserted into the part number ahead of the plating code to ensure that all pin and plating materials meet the RoHS requirements. For High Temperature processing requirements, An “F” will be placed ahead of the “G” to signify a part that is capable of withstanding High Temp processing as set forth in the APTOS Technology RoHS Specifications unless noted.
 
Bestan, Inc recognizes the various requirements of our customers. We are committed to providing current information about our products. We will support our customers to find alternatives for existing designs that have become restricted or obsolete do to unforeseen regulations. We will support our customers to meet these regulations with product alternatives and new designs. APTOS Technology strongly recommends that our customers re-qualify RoHS compliant products. This must be accomplished where it matters most, in the customers process, and in their specific application. These web pages are designed to help you understand the issues facing the electronics industry today and those in the future. Additionally, we want you to know that APTOS Technology and its suppliers are working together to assure our customers that all products are in compliance with existing and future directives and legislation. We will strive to keep the most up to date information available to you. To download a copy of this document, please use the following link. (APTOS Environmental Policy).
