	Softbank (SFTBF) Strong-Arms ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (ARMH)
Arm's Internet of Things prospects make it very promising indeed

Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS:SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son is known for sudden, seemingly impulsive, game-changing business moves, and taking over Arm Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ:ARMH) certainly qualifies.

For $32 billion (a 43% premium to ARMH’s closing price Friday), Softbank gets the premium mobile-chip design house in the world.
Arm designs the processor chips used in the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and many other devices, and has been a thorn in the side of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for years. The deal could close as early as next month because it represents a huge premium for ARMH shareholders, making an overbid unlikely.
And while the British government could protest the capture of its biggest tech asset over the pound’s post-Brexit weakness, it is unlikely to stop it. Softbank is promising to increase U.K. employment after the deal is done.
7 Stocks to Buy in the Healthcare Sweet Spot
Arm can use new investments to expand beyond its niche in mobile processor design to the larger market known as the Internet of Things, in which wireless processors are embedded in all sorts of industrial and consumer products. This brings a host of new potential customers, with new relationships to both design and production.
What Is Softbank’s Game?
As the majority owner of Sprint Corp (NYSE:S) and Softbank Mobile, Softbank has networks through which it can do deals that involve far more than mere chip sales, and the expertise acquired in making that happen should bring it deals in other geographies. On the conference call, Son said Sprint is becoming self-sufficient, and Sprint shares fell on the news.
While Softbank will have to reduce its financial stake in Alibaba Group Holding ltd (NASDAQ:BABA) over time to make this deal work, it retains enormous goodwill within that market, and China’s government is heavily invested in making IoT work in both consumer and business markets.
On the conference call announcing the deal, which he called the most important event in Softbank’s history, Son predicted that 1,000 IoT processors will be working for every person in the world 30 years from now.
Those connections can now redound to Arm’s benefit.
ARMH does now own a fabrication plant. It sells designs that other companies then customize and have produced as-needed. Softbank can now do deals for Chinese production, and distribution, of Arm designs that consume very little power. In short it has opportunities, but needs capital to take advantage.
The deal has to represent a transformation in Softbank, and it made the first move in that direction last year selling its stake in Supercell, a Finnish designer of social games like Clash of Clans, to China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCEHY). It is also possible that stakes in Softbank Mobile and Sprint could come to market as Softbank focuses capital on ARMH stock.
What Bernstein’s Optimistic S&P 500 Outlook Didn’t Tell You
The deal represents a great payday for those who have seen Arm settle into a trading range from $40 to $50/share since 2013, and the possibility of future deals could bring Sprint new bids over time, although the initial reaction of that stock was negative.
Softbank is down 30% from its early 2014 high, but if you buy Son’s new vision, now may be the time to get in. If I were 30 years younger, I would be a buyer, but the vision will take time to prove out.

Our People
Arm was founded by a dozen engineers working from a converted barn in Cambridge, UK, a quarter of a century ago. By the end of 2015, that team had grown to more than 4,200 people in sites around the world. Arm gives its people the capabilities, processes and infrastructure to enable them to develop and thrive as the business scales and strengthens. At the same time, we seek to nurture a work culture that remains true to our founders’ original vision; empowering our engineers to be innovative and drive Arm-based technology into all areas where compute happens, maximizing their creative potential and enabling all of our people to be their brilliant selves.

ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (ARMH) Takes Over Carbon For Acquiring Virtual Prototype Technology

ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ:ARMH) has absorbed the product portfolio of Carbon Design Systems for optimizing system-on-chip (SoC) development. The British semiconductor organization declared that both the assets as well as Carbon’s staff will be moved to ARM. No financial details were released.
By acquiring Carbon’s human resources and the product portfolio that have system models for utilization with virtual prototypes of ARM-based SoCs, ARM has an advantage. This is because the assets could enhance the pace of delivering fresh SoC solution to the market. This is done by virtualizing products earlier and identifying bugs, design issues, and deployment issues before the commencement of production.
Massachusetts-based Carbon supplies cycle accurate virtual prototyping software for system-on-chip architecture. SoC microchips deployed in tiny consumer devices such as tablets and handsets permit multiple functions such as memory and logic control, ADC converters to be integrated on a single circuit. This results in giving the devices the opportunity to be smaller. However, it ramps up the complexity of devices, a main trend in the consumer technology area via wearables as well as mobiles.





Virtual prototypes are made before the expensive need of having a design fabricated in silicon material. It’s a great way eliminate bugs and boost the quality of chip design prior to the design arriving at the foundry for production.
As per ARM, the current era is a post-PC era. Hence, strategic focus on tinier devices whether they are wearables, tablets or handsets will determine the company’s ranking in the technology sphere of the future. The company’s processors are present in the entry as well as high-end devices. They range from Cortex-M low-energy processors, high-resolution ARM Cortex processors, as well as ARM Trustzone hardware for smartphone device security.
In the future, Carbon products will be sold as ARM Cycle Models and sourced from ARM IP Exchange. The British company will retain the practice of providing Carbon solution for the purpose of model generation as well as SoC analysis.
