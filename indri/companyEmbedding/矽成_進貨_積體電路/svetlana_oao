TRENDS
Drinking milk products in Russia were more affected by the economic downturn rather than by the imposition of an imports embargo in 2014, as the category is predominantly supplied with domestically produced products. Facing shrinking real disposable incomes, Russian consumers cut down their consumption of non-essential drinking milk products such as goat milk and powder milk in 2014 and 2015. Since the economic downturn became evident in 2014, volume sales of drinking milk products have been mostly driven by the traditional category of cow’s milk.
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Danone Russia Group of Cos continued to lead sales of drinking milk products in Russia in 2016. The company is present in milk with brands such as Prostokvashino, Letniy Den and Petmol, and in flavoured milk drinks with the brands Actual and Smeshariki. Danone Russia Group of Cos has a strong reputation in Russia due to its high-quality products, a presence across many categories in dairy products and a long-standing presence in Russia. Its localised facilities allow the manufacturer to limit price growth and run continuous advertising campaigns to attract more and more consumers. In 2016, Danone Russia Group of Cos accounted for a 25% value share of drinking milk products.
PROSPECTS
Drinking milk products is set to remain a category driven by sales of traditional milk. The value share of flavoured milk drinks is set to increase slightly over the course of the forecast period, but by 2021, milk will account for a 94% value share of drinking milk products.
