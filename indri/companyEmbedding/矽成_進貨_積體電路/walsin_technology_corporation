Walsin Technology Corporation

Walsin Technology Corporation (WTC) is a leading manufacturer of passive components. Walsin’s product lineup includes multiple-layer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs), chip resistors and arrays, EMI, ESD filters, LTCC high frequency components (including antennas and filters), varistors, multi-layer common mode filters, power choke, and diodes.
Founded in 1985, Walsin is now part of the Passive Systems Alliance Taiwan and top-tier manufacturer in MLCC, chip resistor, and RF device production. Walsin has a production capacity of 30 billion pieces per month for chip resistors and MLCCs. Additionally, Walsin specializes in RF devices such as GPS, Bluetooth, chip antennas, diplexers, common-mode filters, and much more.
Passive Components
Passive electronic components are found in an electrical or computer system and require no electrical current to operate; in other words, they are incapable of power gain. Some of these components include resistors, capacitors, inductors, surge protectors, and more. Various types of electronic devices require passive components in order to work. Resistors are often found in fuses, sensors, heaters, and lighting. Other household items such as computers, cameras, game consoles, cellphones, and television also require passive components in order to function. 
Order with IBS Electronics
IBS Electronics is an authorized Walsin distributor. As an ISO 9001:2008 certified distributor of electronic components, you can trust IBS Electronics to offer you low prices on Walsin components and the highest level of quality assurance in the industry. Through our global network of offices in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, IBS Electronics provides speedy and safe shipments anywhere in the world.
