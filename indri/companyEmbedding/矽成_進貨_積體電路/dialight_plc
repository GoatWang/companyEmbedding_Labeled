  OVERVIEW 

  We are focused on executing our plan to capture the industrial LED market opportunity. The shift in the Group's operating model strategically positions us to focus on long term sustainable growth. The strategy gives the organisation agility, allowing us to respond quickly to changing customer and market dynamics. 

  During the period, we have delivered an increase in underlying profit as well as growth in cash generation. Group revenue was GBP92.7m (2016: GBP79.8m), including a favourable currency impact of GBP10.0m. The US, which generates the majority of our revenues, was up 10% on a constant currency basis. The European business was down 25%. This was partly due to certain product lines within the Signals and Components segments being discontinued. Additionally, Europe represents a significant lighting opportunity where we are rebuilding our capabilities, developing our sales force and expanding our distribution network.  Our new product road map includes the breadth of product features and certification requirements needed to capture these European opportunities. 

  Lighting order intake grew 2% year on year at constant currency despite the impact of the transition delays, discussed below. Our customers have delayed placing orders pending new product launches. This has been partly mitigated by encouraging new business wins. Underlying operating profit increased to GBP6.5m (2016: GBP4.2m), including a favourable currency impact of GBP1.1m. Non-underlying costs totalled GBP2.4m (2016: GBP11.1m); further details are provided in the Financial Review section. 

  Platform engineering, a key pre-requisite of the transition of our manufacturing footprint has been successfully completed. The move to a platform concept allows Dialight to deliver solutions to customers that better match their specific requirements while being configured from a greatly reduced set of sub-assemblies. This has improved forecast accuracy for manufacturing planning and will result in reduced inventory once the transition to our manufacturing partner has been completed. We have fundamentally improved supply chain management and streamlined our operations. This is clearly demonstrated in the gross margin expansion we have achieved in the period. 

  Completion of the transition is taking slightly longer than expected. We have experienced delays in the certification of some of the products being transferred, but we expect to complete the transition by the end of the year.  To ensure continuity of supply to our customers, we decided to keep our own facility running in parallel and this will lead to a short period of dual running costs. 

  As we finalise the foundations of a robust and scalable manufacturing platform, we pivot our attention to driving revenue growth in the industrial lighting market. Purchase decisions are driven by payback and risk, our value proposition continues to ensure that Dialight products provide the best cost of ownership to heavy industrial customers with paybacks based on energy savings, maintenance cost avoidance backed by a ten year warranty. 

  There has been progress in integrating Dialight lighting with leading factory automation solutions. Dialight and its strategic customers continue to explore new ways to use these solutions to enhance factory safety and productivity. 

  Dialight's sales model is direct specification sale to end users, transacting through distributors. Direct sale allows for the value proposition to be articulated, distributor inclusion enables simplified contracting and support for larger supply contracts. We have added 22 new distributors with a key focus on expanding the distribution network in Europe. 

  Market conditions 

  The main barrier to LED conversion is capex budget constraints. There are three key approaches to proactively drive accelerated market adoption by changing spending paradigms: 

   1          Enable maintenance spend - target a one year payback 

  2          Access different budgets- the corporate sustainability and safety budget, design engineering budgets and process productivity budgets 

   3          Promote market awareness of advantages of LEDs 

  Dialight recognises the opportunity to drive focus on corporate wide LED conversion programmes. The majority of Dialight's targeted strategic customers have a public commitment to sustainability, including carbon footprint reduction and energy savings programmes. Additionally, customers place a premium on work place safety. Driving awareness of the economic benefits as well as the sustainability and safety benefits of our lighting at the corporate level can change the perception of lighting away from just maintenance cost savings. We target corporate energy, sustainability and EHS directors and maintain a team focused on serving large new build projects. 

  Current quoting activity remains favorable with a strong pipeline and both short and long-term drivers of the markets we serve remain positive. We expect to grow in the markets we serve by executing our strategy focused on opportunities in underpenetrated geographies and industries, and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of our integrated, solutions strategy.  Based on various leading indicators and our focused investments in key strategic areas, we remain confident regarding the Company's prospects for long term profitable growth. 

  Outlook 

  We are focused on executing the Group's ambitious growth strategy as we seek to capture the opportunity in the industrial LED lighting market. The transformation to a robust and scalable manufacturing platform has advanced significantly in the period. We have completed platform engineering, and nine out of twelve product lines have transferred to our manufacturing partner with the final three lines to be completed by the end of the year. We remain excited by the Group's prospects and remain confident of delivering continued growth and shareholder value. Our expectations for the second half of 2017 remain unchanged. 

  FINANCIAL REVIEW 

  In the half year, we delivered an increase in underlying profit and cash flow on revenue growth of 16% (3% at constant currency). Group revenue was GBP92.7m (2016: GBP79.8m), including a favourable currency exchange impact of GBP10.0m. The US, which generates the majority of our revenue was up 10% on a constant currency basis. The European business was down 25%. This was partly due to certain product lines within the Signals and Components segments being discontinued. We also continued our efforts to develop outside of the US with Australian revenues up 19% at constant currency. 

  Underlying operating profit increased to GBP6.5m (2016: GBP4.2m), including a favourable exchange impact of GBP1.1m. 

  The increase in the Group's underlying profit was a result of the fundamental shift in Dialight's operating model, which has reduced costs and enabled scalable, efficient production: 

   --      Procurement programmes resulting in GBP1.3m improvement in cost of sales 

  --      The closure of the UK facility has delivered savings of GBP1.4m and further efficiencies of GBP1.2m at our Mexico plant 

  --      Offset partly by an increase of GBP0.9m in the cost base due to continued investment in the sales and product management teams 

  Currency impact 

  Dialight reports its results in Sterling. Our major trading currency is the US Dollar with 70% of revenue denominated in US Dollars. The Group has both translational and transactional currency exposure. Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of overseas company results into Sterling and this is the major currency exposure. Transactional exposure is more limited with natural hedging on revenue and purchases mitigating the majority of the currency risk. 

  The strengthening of the US dollar compared to the first half of 2016 has been the main driver for the currency impact. The average rate for the US Dollar against Sterling has moved from 1.43 in first half of 2016 to 1.26 in the first half of 2017. 

  The performance of each business segment is reviewed individually below. Allocation of overheads in each segment is based on directly attributed costs plus an allocation based on segmental revenue.

-----------------  -------  -------  --------- 
 

  The Lighting segment represents 78% of the Group's revenue and 82% of the Group's segmental operating profit. 

  Revenues were 23% higher than the prior period (9% at constant currency). Year on year order intake increased by 2%. We have seen growth in order intake in the US and Australia but this was offset by reduced orders in Europe. Transition delays have impacted the Group's order intake as certain customers have delayed placing orders pending new product launches. We continue to diversify our end markets and geographies, reducing our exposure to individual vertical markets. Oil and gas as a percentage of total lighting revenue was 300bps lower than the previous half year at 18%. This was offset by growth in Mining, Power and Pulp & Paper. 

  Gross margin has increased to 42% due to the focus on commodity management delivering material costs savings of GBP1.3m. Last year we closed our manufacturing plant in the UK and relocated the majority of production activity to Mexico. The strategic relocation and further production efficiencies at the Mexico plant resulted in a saving of GBP2.6m. The delays in the transition will defer expected savings from our manufacturing partner to Q1 2018. 

  Overheads increased by GBP4.3m compared to 2016, with GBP2.2m due to currency movements. The remainder of the increase relates to additional headcount to enhance our product development capabilities and expand our sales team. We have invested in training for the existing team and continue to be heavily focused on our HR initiatives. 

  The overall impact of the above was that profit in the Lighting segment increased by 47% (28% at constant currency).

 Underlying EBIT             1.6     1.4       +14% 
------------------------  ------  ------  --------- 
 

  Signals and Components are high volume businesses operating within highly competitive markets. There is significant competition from low cost producers but margins improved as a result of the transfer of traffic production from the US to Mexico in 2016. We continue to target further cost reduction measures to combat pricing pressure. There was a marginal increase in overheads due to foreign exchange movements, but the gross margin expansion resulted in an overall EBIT improvement of GBP0.2m (14%). 

  Central overheads 

  Central overheads are not allocated to these segments. In 2017 they amounted to GBP2.6m, an increase of GBP0.3m over the prior year. 

  Non-underlying costs 

  The Group incurs costs and earns income that is non-underlying in nature or that is otherwise considered to not be reflective of the underlying performance of the business. In the assessment of performance of the components of the Group, management examines underlying performance, which removes the impact of non-underlying costs and income. 

  Over the past two years the Group has been implementing our strategic plan to transform to a robust and scalable manufacturing platform. As we come to the end of this process we are incurring the final tranche of costs relating to transition to our manufacturing partner. 

  The table below presents the components of non-underlying profit or loss recorded within cost of sales and administrative expenses.

 Non-underlying costs recorded in 
  administrative expenses                  2.4    11.1 
--------------------------------------  ------  ------ 
 

  In the first half, we incurred costs of GBP2.4m relating to the transfer of lighting assembly to our manufacturing partner. These related to set-up costs, project management and dedicated engineering time. This transition has suffered some delays due to the quantum of the transfer but is still expected to be completed in the year. We expect further costs of up to GBP2m to be incurred in the second half. 

  In the prior year, non-underlying costs related to the closure of the UK manufacturing facility, expected redundancy costs at the Mexican production facility, goodwill impairment on the European Traffic business and initial production transfer costs to our manufacturing partner. 

  Finance arrangements 

  We continue to have a strong balance sheet supported by good working capital management, finishing the six months with net cash of GBP12.7m.  The Group has a revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank plc for GBP25m with a further GBP25m "accordion" feature and has a five-year term ending in 2021. The Group has no borrowings against the facility at the balance sheet date and is fully compliant with its covenant requirements. 

  As the Group generates higher levels of cash there is increased focus on capital allocation, ensuring it is aligned to our long term strategic goals. Our capital allocation strategy is firstly to ensure investment in operating capex and product development. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility. We will be good stewards of capital with strong capital discipline. Any excess capital will be utilised to invest in compelling (organic and acquisitive) growth or will be returned to shareholders. 

  The Board is not proposing an interim dividend payment for 2017 (2016: nil).

  Notes to the financial statements 

  For the period ended 30 June 2017 (unaudited) 

   1.   Basis of preparation and principal accounting policies 

  Dialight Plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in the UK. The condensed set of financial statements as at, and for, the six month period ended 30 June 2017 comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group"). The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing financial statements. 

  The Group financial statements as at, and for, the year ended 31 December 2016 prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, are available upon request from the Company's registered office at Leaf C, Level 36 Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London, EC2N 1HQ. 

  The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2016 are not the Company's statutory accounts for that year. Those accounts have been reported on by the Company's auditors and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditors was (i) unqualified (ii) did not include any reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. 

  The condensed set of financial statements for the six month ended 30 June 2017 is unaudited but has been reviewed by the auditors. The Independent review report is set out at the end of this report. 

  Statement of compliance 

  The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. The condensed set of financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group's financial statements as at, and for the year ended 31 December 2016. 

  This condensed set of financial statements was approved by the Board of Directors on 24 July 2017. 

  Adoption of new and revised standards 

  No changes to new or revised accounting standards have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 

  Estimates and judgements 

  The preparation of a condensed set of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

   2.   Operating segments 

  The Group comprises two reportable operating segments.  These segments have been identified based on the internal information that is supplied regularly to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker for the purposes of assessing performance and allocating resources.  The Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Group's Chief Executive. 

  The two reportable operating segments are: 

  a) Lighting, which develops, manufactures and supplies highly efficient LED lighting solutions for hazardous and industrial 

  applications in which lighting performance is critical and includes anti-collision obstruction lighting; and 

  b) Signals and Components, which develops, manufactures and supplies status indication components for electronics OEMs, together with niche industrial and automotive electronic components and highly efficient LED signalling solutions for the traffic and signals markets. 

  All revenue relates to the sale of goods. Segment gross profit is revenue less the costs of materials, labour, production and freight that are directly attributable to a segment. Overheads comprise operations management, selling costs plus corporate costs, which include share-based payments. 

  There are no individual customers representing more than 10% of revenue and there is no inter-segment revenue.

  3. Non-underlying items 

  The Group incurs costs and earns income that is non-underlying in nature or that is otherwise considered to not be reflective of the underlying performance of the business. In the assessment of performance of the components of the Group, management examines underlying performance, which removes the impact of non-underlying costs and income. 

  Over the past two years the Group has been implementing our strategic plan to transform to a robust and scalable manufacturing platform. As we come to the end of this process we are incurring the final tranche of costs relating to transition to our manufacturing partner. 

  The table below presents the components of non-underlying profit or loss recorded within cost of sales.

Non-underlying costs recorded in administrative expenses        (2.4)      (11.1)        (12.7) 
 
 

  In the first half, we incurred costs of GBP2.4m relating to the transfer of lighting assembly to our manufacturing partner. These related to set-up costs, project management and dedicated engineering time. This transition has suffered some delays due to the quantum of the transfer but is still expected to be completed in the year. We expect further costs of up to GBP2m to be incurred in the second half. 

  In the prior year, non-underlying costs related to the closure of the UK manufacturing facility, expected redundancy costs at the Mexican production facility, goodwill impairment on the European Traffic business and initial production transfer costs to our manufacturing partner. 

  Administrative costs contain items treated as underlying and non-underlying.

  5. Income tax expense 

  The tax charge of GBP1.4m for the half year to 30 June 2017 reflects the anticipated effective tax rate of 35.3% for the year ending 31 December 2017.  Non-underlying items have been taxed using the relevant tax rates.  The effective tax rate is higher than the current UK tax rate of 20.0% due to the level of Group profits in the US which has an effective tax rate of 38.0%. The effective tax rate credit for the period ended 30 June 2016 was 33.8% and for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 24.9%. 

  6. Earnings per share 

  Basic earnings per share 

  The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 June 2017 was based on a profit for the period of GBP2.6m (2016: loss of GBP4.7m) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the six months ended 30 June 2017 of 32,511,298 (2016: 32,503,258).

  We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 

  the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU; 

  the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by: 

  (a) DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and 

  (b) DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report that could do so.

  Independent review report to Dialight Plc 

  Conclusion 

  We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 which comprises the Condensed consolidated income statement, Condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Condensed consolidated statement of financial position, the Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows and the related explanatory notes and the related explanatory notes. 

  Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ("the DTR") of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA"). 

  Scope of review 

  We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the UK.  A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.  We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and consider whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements. 

  A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  . 

  Directors' responsibilities 

  The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the DTR of the UK FCA. 

  As disclosed in note 1 the annual financial statements of the group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.  The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU. 

  Our responsibility 

  Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. 

  The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

  This report is made solely to the company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA.  Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

AviationNavigationLight Surveillance System




Since the 1990’s, we have supplied aviation obstruction lights to the wind industry. For more than 20 years, we have constantly improved and expanded our product portfolio.
All our products comply with international regulation (ICAO, FAA) and are adapted to the differing national standards.
Aviation obstruction lights are typically required for turbines which total height exceed 100 m, but the requirements differ from market to market and also from location to location within a country.
The purpose of aviation obstruction lights is to mark the turbine as an obstacle at day and at night to air traffic, both civil and military, both onshore and offshore. The lights are installed on the nacelle and sometimes additionally on the tower of the turbine.
Dialight was the first to invent and produce LED obstruction lights for low intensity, medium Intensity and high intensity applications for the wind industry. Our entire aviation and aids to navigations product portfolio for the wind sector uses LED lighting solutions today.
Our products have a build-in GPS for the synchronisation of the beacons. This means that the GPS unit is integrated into the beacon and is thus better protected against weather and hazardous environments like the North Sea. In the following, we present our products in detail.
The majority of our products is available als “cold climate version (CCV)”.

Permanent Aids to Navigation
Besides aviation obstruction lights, offshore wind turbines require additional marking due to their location at sea. They need to be marked as an obstacle to maritime traffic during construction and during their lifetime under operation.
The products required for the marking at sea are called “Aids to Navigation” (in short: AtoN).
Dialight A/S has delivered AtoN components to the offshore wind industry since 2000. Our first projects were Avedøre and Middelgrunden in Denmark followed by Burbo Banks in the UK.. Since then, we have gathered comprehensive experience with offshore projects’ aids to navigation systems, both on the engineering, installation and operational side. Our products comply with international IALA and the respective national regulation.
We are today, one of the market leaders in this field and have delivered our solutions to all important offshore markets and offshore customers. We offer single products and complete systems including aids to navigation components, control and monitoring systems.
Dialight A/S AtoN solution consists usually of a combination of the following components depending on national regulation:

Marine lantern
ID marking signs boards day/night
ID floodlights for the proximity marking
Helicopter corridor lights
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
Automatic identification systems (AIS)
Visibility meters
Fog signals
Monitoring and control systems for the above components using programmable logic controllers (PLC)

Dialight A/S provides custom lighting and control solutions for each market that meet or exceeds local requirements.   In the following, we give two examples of what is usually required in the UK and Germany as the two biggest European offshore markets. The examples show the requirements for turbines placed on the periphery of an offshore wind farm:

Temporary Aids to Navigation
During construction when there is no electricity produced by the wind turbine itself for the AtoN components, the wind park needs to be marked with so-called “Temporary AtoN”. These consist of self-contained buoys that are placed on different locations at the periphery of the construction site (the so-called safety zone) and of solar-powered marine lanterns that are placed on the foundations under construction.
Dialight A/S offers our customers a complete temporary marking solution together with our partner Maritim Consult that has extensive experience from both the offshore sector and harbor infrastructure. We assist our customers with choosing the right solution for their project according to national legislation and individual preferences.
Instead of purchasing the temporary AtoN, we also offer a service of renting the buoys during the course of construction. Please contact our sales department for further information.








Dialight A/S has developed an outstanding intelligent surveillance unit, “BTI’s Light Surveillance System” that monitors the functioning of the different aviation obstruction lighting systems and AtoN components.
The system is currently installed at the UK offshore project “Westermost Rough”.
