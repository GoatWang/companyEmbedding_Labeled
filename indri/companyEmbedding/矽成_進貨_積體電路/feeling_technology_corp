Product DetailsTaxi Dispatch system Taxi Dispatch
Categories : Taxi Dispatch
It can locate passengers' position according to their GPS and automatically arrange the nearest empty taxi.
4,000 vehicles are being dispatched at the same time and 60 cars can be sent in per second.
The history record of asking for a taxi：It provides a complete record system, including the locations that passengers get on and off and staffs' numbers. 
You will only need 16 telephonists for a 3000 taxes company to receive phone calls and sending taxes which can save 70%~80% personnel cost.
 



Abstract  
A taxi driver spentsmore than 10 hours on driving in a day. However, they spend approximately 7 hours to seek for passengers. It's not only a waste of gasoline and cause air pollution and traffic jam. But in order to earn the basic necessities of life, the drivers need to wait in extremely long lines in front of stations or spend most of their time seeking for passengers. Over-time driving also influences the safety of driving.
Nowadays the smart phones are widely used and the passengers can immediately call a taxi with only click. Accordingly,there is no need to wait for the telephonist to arrange taxes. It can effectively improve the efficiency and reduce the unfairness which is caused by human relation. Traditional taxi company uses radio to inform taxi drivers by telephonist. Then taxi drivers report their will to the telephonist.  First come, first served. Therefore, some taxi drivers may install electromagnetic radiation amplifier to hinder other taxi drivers from recieving passenger's information. Besides, telephonists may assign passenger's call to their acquainted drivers.


System features 
 


Dispatch vehicle automatically：It dispatches the most suitable taxi according to passengers’ loaction, size of cars and the nearest car.


The way of asking for a taxi：APP can be used for automatically sending a car or making a phonecall for asking for the telephonist’s help to arrange


Save time：There is no the phenomenon that the passengers exposed in the sun and rain of the roadside and waited in vain because they cannot call the car, and also will not take two passengers so that A passenger is carried firstly to destination, and then let the B passenger wait in the original place in vain due to the drivers scramble for the passengers (A, B).


Simple calculation：It can calculate the approximate number of kilometers that from starting point to the destination and the fare for the guests to refer.


Avoid detours and lost：It can prevent the drivers going fruther distance, or encountering less familiar areas. The driver can simply carry the guests to their destinations through navigation.


A wide range of taxi services：Generally ask for the car (while asking for, and dispatch the car) and appoint to ask for car (the car can be sent according to the guests’ requirements about the time and place)


The category of vehicle type：It can specify the vehicle model(car, SUV) or designate service driver


The history record of asking for a taxi：It has a complete record of each passenger’s address about getting on or off the bus and the number of service personnel, and provide the most complete record management system.


Considerate warning：After calling the car the successfully (either call up or use APP), and inform passengers about the taxi data transfers and drivers special line.


SECDOR：Drivers get into the same area (can set the range), and can automaticaly be informed through dispatching the identification tag, then waiting for the passengers in this area call the car and dispatching the car according to the sequence.


The speed of dispatching a car：While the 4,000 vehicles are running at the same time, 60 cars can be sent per second.


Shift system：After the car dealers buy the car, the personnels can be arranged for shifting drive for the same car, the driver of each period can login in proper sequence and automatically update current drivers data and condition data.


Location mode：The maps can be directly downloaded and installed on the phone, and there is no need to open the satellite positioning so as to save the Internet transmission charges.


Adverse records’s drivers：The service can be set to suspend for those who are late to pay the membership dues, or are complained by the guest, or refuse to be sent by the system. (The reception desk can set the system downtime of bad records drivers for several hours, or to be permanently suspended




Cost and benefit
 
If a reception desk has 3,000 taxis, 64 telephonists should be arranged for answering the phone and sending a car. So when the passengers call the reception desk each time, they should wait the telephonists understanding the address, then contact the dealers drivers and wait for the drivers’ response, then inform the passengers whether it is successful to sent the car or not.
If use this system:
There has a reception desk of 3000 taxis, and just needs to arrange 16 telephonists for receiving telephone and sending the car. Passengers call the reception desk, just waiting for the telephonist check empty cars which have the identification tag in the system. When dispatched successfully, then can instantly inform the driver’s data and vehicle condition to the passengers. Or the passenger directly click and send a car through penetrating the APP, and the system will automatically send the car and notify passengers’ position to the driver.

Pioneering Technology Corporation
 




 

It's time to start feeling safe in your own home. We'll show you how.




 

We  make  products  that  help  prevent  cooking  fires.




 

Did you know? The National Fire Protection Association reported in 2011 that cooking is the #1 cause of household fires and fire injuries.




 

Pioneering Technology is the industry leader of fire prevention technologies and identifies, engineers and markets breakthrough solutions for existing mainstream appliances.







Products to help save lives:

Residential
Commercial






Pioneering  Technology  Corporation  is  a  technology  innovation  company  that  designs  and  produces  fire  prevention  solutions  that  save  lives,  time  and  energy.






 


SmartBurner™ is a new, state‐of‐the art consumer version of the highly praised commercial product Safe-T-Element. Learn more





 





 


Safe T Sensor™ is engineered to help prevent microwave fires and nuisance/false alarms, saving lives, preventing injury and saving money. Learn more





 





 


RangeMinder™ is a new consumer product that helps prevent unattended cooking on gas, ceramic and electric coil stovetops. Learn more





 







What people are saying about our products...



We will specify Safe T Element for all future projects to help provide a higher level of fire safety in the communities we manage.





We would definitely recommend this to all housing authorities to help protect residents and properties from the dangerous risk of cooking fires.





This technology does everything that it says it does and we are very pleased with the results.





On 2 occasions, a tenant has put things on her stove and fallen asleep. The good news is that while the food burnt, no fire started due to the new Safe T Element.





Without reservation, I strongly recommend the use of Safe T Elements for fire‐prevention in multi‐family developments.





The Safe T Elements have lowered our electrical consumption and… will pay for themselves in 2 or 3 years.





We would most definitely recommend this product to other housing authorities or apartment complexes.





Norstar is using a product called Safe T Element… and has been extremely pleased with (the) results… This technology allows food to cook like always, yet helps prevent a fire from happening in the first place.





We installed 642 STEs in 2 of our highest risk senior’s buildings. This product did exactly what it claimed to do and we are now taking active steps to expand the use of this technology in the Tampa Housing Authority properties.





“This installation and safety initiative is proving to be a great benefit to protecting the people and property at RHA.  We would definetly recommend this technology to all housing authorities to help protect residents and properties from the dangerous risks of cooking fires.”





The North Charleston Housing Authority has installed the Safe T Elements in all of its housing units since 2009. Since the installation we have not had one grease fire. Without doubt this product has proven itself to be an excellent fire prevention device.





“Since Safe T Element was installed; we have more confidence of the level of fire safety in our group homes and have not experienced a single unattended cooking fire related incident.”
