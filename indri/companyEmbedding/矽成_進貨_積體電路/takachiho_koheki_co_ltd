Revolutionizing retail store security using a track record with the largest share in the Japan market


In 1970, TK became the first company in Japan to import and sell the electronic article
surveillance (EAS) system manufactured by Sensormatic (now Tyco Fire & Security) of the United
States. Our customers are in diverse fields, which include music stores, fashion boutiques,
drugstores, general merchandise stores, home centers, and home appliance discounters. Our
systems are also being used by new markets including convenience stores supermarkets.
We can offer optimal" total security solutions," depending on our customers' businesses and
store formats, thanks to our long-standing experience and expertise and to our extensive product
lineup of gates and tags, surveillance camera systems, and remote monitoring systems, all
designed to prevent the unlawful removal of store or office property. After system installation,
value-added services such as follow-up and education are provided by our specialist staff, which
has helped us earn the top share (49.2%) in Japan's EAS market.
In recent years, our efforts have been put into guarding floor display models of increasingly
popular smartphones and tablets from theft, as well as developing product display systems that
cater to the need for illustrating both style and product appeal. Our timely, innovative proposals
have solidified TK's leading market position.
