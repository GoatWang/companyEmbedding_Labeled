IDT Gas Sensor Selected as CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree
The ZMOD3250 Multi-gas Sensor Array Joins Select Group of Products Honored

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA -- (Marketwired) -- 01/05/17 --

         Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (IDT) (NASDAQ:IDTI) today announced that its innovative ZMOD3250 gas sensor was selected as a CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree, receiving high marks from judges in the embedded technologies product category. IDT will showcase the ZMOD3250 during CES at its booth at Sands Halls A-D 40736. 
The IDT® ZMOD3250 family is a miniscule but highly sensitive gas sensor product line that can detect air quality (total VOC) as well as selectively identify several volatile organic compounds, including formaldehyde and ethanol. With dimensions of 3.0 mm x 3.0 mm x 0.7 mm, the chip features a unique silicon microhotplate with nanostructured sensing material that enables a highly sensitive measurement of gas. The accompanying ASIC provides a flexible solution for integrating the sensor with various consumer devices, including mobile phones, wearables and appliances. 
The ZMOD3250 was among projects in the embedded technologies category selected by a three-member judging team comprised of an independent industrial designer, an independent engineer and a member of the trade press. Judges looked at such attributes as engineering qualities, aesthetic and design qualities, and the product's intended use/function and user value. 
"We appreciate the judges' recognition of the ZMOD3250, which was developed to deliver outstanding reliability and flexibility in a very compact form," said Debra Deininger, director of gas sensing in IDT's Consumer Sensor Division. "I look forward to meeting with attendees at CES this week to demonstrate how the ZMOD3250 family of sensors can help differentiate their products."

Business segments[edit]
The communications segment offers communication clocks, serial RapidIO solutions for wireless base station infrastructure applications, radio frequency products, digital logic products, first-in and first-out (FIFO) memories, integrated communications processors, static random-access memory (SRAM) products, and telecommunications semiconductor products.[2] This segment markets its products to the enterprise, data center, and wireless markets.
The computing segment provides timing products, PCI Express switching and bridging solutions, high-performance server memory interfaces, multi-port products, signal integrity products, and PC audio and video products.[3] This segment’s computing products are designed for desktop, notebook, sub-notebook, storage, and server applications.
The consumer segment provides products for digital TVs, smartphones, and gaming consoles through touch controllers, timing products, multi-port memory, audio, and power management devices.[4]
History[edit]
IDT’s first product was the first low-power, high-speed CMOS-based 6116 static random-access memory (SRAM) device, released in 1981, followed by the first CMOS FIFO introduced in 1982.[5] Subsequent achievements include the first dual-port memory, pioneering in embedded RISC processors, leadership in network search engines and the first flow-control management device.
In 1993, IDT entered the PC clock market with a family of devices (CV104, CV105, CV107, and CV109) focusing on desktop computer platforms. IDT planned to expand its market by producing a suite of PC clock devices that serve next-generation notebook and desktop computing platforms.
In the early 2000s IDT introduced its first integrated microprocessor, the RC32334. The RC32334 was the first in the family of integrated processors targeted to communication applications. Then a year later IDT introduced an industry’s first network search engine.[6]
In 2003, IDT announced its entry into the PC clock market. The company shifted its initial PC clock family to products serving current-generation desktop, notebook, and server platforms.
In 2004, IDT continued to expand its business by acquiring ZettaCom and Internet Machines Corporation, allowing IDT to enter the serial switching industry. Rather than continue to evolve ZettaCom's full line of existing physical-layer switching and traffic management chips, IDT converted ZettaCom's operation into a new serial switching division. With the acquisition of Internet Machines, IDT was able to accelerate its entry into the standards-based serial-switching market with the addition of PCI Express technology licensed from Internet Machines.[7]
By the mid 2000s IDT had developed a single-chip clocking device for Intel Centrino for the notebook PC,[8] jitter attenuator for PCI Express applications, PCI Express interconnect to manage all communications in high density blade systems.
In July 2009, IDT and Micron Technology entered an alliance to develop PCI Express Solid-State Drive technologies for the server, storage and embedded markets. During this alliance, IDT and Micron co-developed enterprise flash controllers with PCIe host interface optimized for Micron’s flash devices and future generation RealSSD solid-state drives.[9] Currently[when?] IDT provides for analog and USB switches, audio solutions, clock/timing devices, digital logic products, display/video solutions, FIFO solutions, memory interface products, multi-port memory/dual-port RAM, PCI Express solutions, power management, RF solutions, SRAMs, Serial RapidIO solutions, signal integrity, telecommunications ICS, temperature sensors, and touch products.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In 2001, IDT acquired Newave Inc., a Chinese semiconductor firm, to accelerate its investment in the growing Asian semiconductor industry and telecommunications market. Newave became a subsidiary of IDT through a cash-for-stock merger.[10]
In April 2001 IDT acquired Solidum Systems, an Ottawa-based fabless semiconductor company.
In April 2004, IDT acquired ZettaCom, a serial switching and bridging semiconductor company, for $35 million. This enabled IDT to be one of the few communications IC suppliers to participate in the standards-based Advance Switching initiative spearheaded by Intel.[11]
IDT made two acquisitions in 2005. In June, IDT acquired Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS) for about $1.7 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition provided a platform for growth within the communications, computing, and consumer market.[12] In October, IDT acquired Freescale Semiconductor's timing solutions business for $35 million. The transaction was originally initiated by Integrated Circuit System Inc. before it was acquired by IDT earlier that year.[13]
In July 2006, IDT acquired the PC Audio division of Austin-based company SigmaTel for $80 million. This including the design, marketing and manufacturing rights, and software products. IDT planned to maintain the production flow of the existing SigmaTel products as part of the purchase agreement.[14]
In October 2008, IDT purchased the video processing technology and related assets from Silicon Optix, including the Hollywood Quality Video (HQV) brand and the Reon product line. This transaction included members of the Silicon Optix HQV engineering teams to enable continued delivery of video processing solutions.[15]
In April 2009, IDT sold its network search engine business to NetLogic Microsystems for approximately $100 million.[16]
In June, 2009, IDT acquired the touch sensor technology assets and employees of Leadis Technology necessary to execute the existing roadmap.[17] That same month, IDT acquired Tundra Semiconductor for about CDN $120.8 million to expand IDT’s serial switching bridging products through PCI Express, RapidIO, and VME interconnect standards.[18]
In 2010, IDT made two acquisitions. In January, IDT acquired Mobius Microsystems Inc., a developer of all-silicon oscillator technology. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.[19] In late April of that year, IDT acquired the assets of IKOR, a former subsidiary of iWatt Corporation that manufactures power module VRM solutions for high-performance computing. The all-cash transaction allowed IDT to produce high-performance power management solutions for enterprise computing.[20]
In September 2011, IDT and Qualcomm announced the signing an agreement to transfer IDT’s Hollywood Quality Video (HQV) and Frame Rate Conversion (FRC) Video Processing product lines and certain related assets to Qualcomm. As part of the agreement, both companies will be exploring options to include more of IDT’s products in Qualcomm’s reference designs.[21]
In 2012, IDT made three acquisitions. In April, IDT acquired FOX Electronics, a global supplier of frequency control products (FCPs), in an all-cash transaction for approximately $30 million.[22] In July 2012, IDT acquired NXP’s high-speed data converter assets and Alvand Technologies, an analog IP company specializing in data converters. Terms of the deals were not disclosed. These transactions add to IDT’s solutions for wireless infrastructure.[23]
In 2015, IDT acquired ZMDI in Dresden, Germany for $307 million.[24]

RF Products



IDT offers high-performance and full-featured radio frequency (RF) products helping to address unwanted interference from an increasingly crowded radio spectrum. Today’s higher data rates drive the need for better radio signal-to-noise ratios, which translates to the need for IDT’s higher linearity RF components. IDT’s patented RF solutions with unique technical innovations address the evolving needs of a wide range of applications, including cellular 4G base stations, communications systems, microwave (RF/IF), CATV, test and measurement, and industrial.

Industry-leading RF Innovations
Glitch-Free™ Technology: IDT’s digital step attenuators (DSA) virtually eliminate transient overshoot that occurs during MSB attenuation state transi­tions of standard DSAs. With Glitch-Free technology, amplifier damage and loss of information at the ADC are avoided.
FlatNoise™ Technology: IDT’s variable gain amplifier (VGA) noise figure is kept virtually flat in the criti­cal region, while gain is reduced. This greatly eases design constraints for radio engineers by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Zero-Distortion™ Technology: IDT’s RF mixers improve SNR by reducing the noise floor and third order intermodulation distortion. This is important for crowded spectrum envi­ronments, as it enhances quality-of-service (QoS) and frees up under-utilized spectrum.
K|Z| Constant Impedance Technology: IDT’s RF switches maintain nearly constant impedance when switching between RF ports. By controlling the impedance during the switching process voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), transients are minimized. This improves switch reliability, reduces voltage stresses on downstream components, and improves overall system performance.
KLIN Constant Linearity Technology: IDT’s variable gain amplifiers maintain constant high linearity as gain is adjusted. As the gain is reduced, the linearity (OIP3) remains constant in the critical region. This prevents in­termodulation distortion from degrading as the gain is reduced.
