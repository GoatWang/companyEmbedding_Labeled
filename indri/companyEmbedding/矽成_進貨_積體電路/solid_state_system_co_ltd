Specifications
1) Operating Principle

1) SSR for AC Loads (Zero-cross type)

The Zero-crossing SSR uses a phototransistor or photo trial coupler to isolate the input from the output (see Fig1-1). When the input signal is activated, the internal Zero-crossing detector circuit triggers the trial to turn on as the Ac load voltage crosses Zero. The load current is maintained by the trial’s Latching effect after the input signal is Deactivated, until the trial is turned off When the load voltage crosses Zero.


Resistive Loads


Since resistive loads cause no phase shift between the voltage and current, the trial turns on when the AC load voltage crosses Zero after the input signal is activated. The SSR turns off when the AC load voltage crosses Zero and the load current is turned off after the input signal is subsequently deactivated.




Inductive Loads


The SSR turns on when the load voltage crosses Zero after the input signal activated. It turns off when the loads current subsequently cresses Zero after the input signal is deactivated. A phase difference between the voltage and current may supply a transient spike to the SSR when it is turned off. While the snuffer circuit allsorts this spike, an excessively large spike may result in a dv/dt error in the SSR’s internal triad.




Capacitive Loads


When the input voltage applied approximates the AC supply voltage peak value, no current will flow to the SSR output circuit immediately. As the AC supply voltage falls close to zero, the SSR output circuit triac turns on to pass current to the load circuit. When this occurs, the load current will have a phase lead of up to 90 degrees relative to the AC supply voltage phase. Then, the SSR will not turn off until the load current falls to less than or below the triac holding current, not immediately after the input voltage turns off. Please note that due to the capacitive load, a voltage which is twice the supply voltage peak value may be applied to the SSR as the voltage from the charge stored in the capacitor is added to the supply voltage. We recommend using an SSR for 220V when used with a supply voltage of 110V.








2) For DC Loads


Transistor Output


Input and output are isolated by the photo coupler. The output side comprises the waveform shaping circuit, amplifier circuit, and output element (transistor). When switched on, current flows to the photo trial coupler LED and the optically-coupled phototransistor turns on, driving the output element (transistor) through the shaping circuit and amplifier circuit. In this way, the load current flows when the transistor is turned on.
                        When switched off, the phototransistor and then transistor turn off, shutting off the load current.




FET Output


Input and output are isolated by the photo coupler. The output side comprises the driving circuit and output element (MOSFET). When switched on, current flows to the photo trial coupler LED and electromotive force is generated in the optically-coupled photodiode array. This electromotive force drives the output element (MOSFET) gate. In this way, the load current flows when the MOSFET is turned on. When switched off, the electromotive force from the photodiode array disappears, the electrical charge stored in the MOSFET gate is discharged through the driving circuit, the MOSFET turns off, shutting off the load current.




Resistive Loads


When the input voltage is applied, current flows to the load immediately.
                        When the input voltage is turned off, the load current immediately becomes zero.




Inductive Loads


When the input voltage is applied, current begins flowing to the load.
                        In this case, as it is an inductive load, time lags occur until the load current returns to the steady state.
                        When the input voltage is turned off, the load current gradually decreases to zero.







2) Application Circuits

1) Solid State Relay (SSR) Driving Circuit Example


When Operated by Limit Switches and the Like


When the contacts are on, the SSR is on.




When Operated by NPN Transistors

When Operated by PNP Transistors


When the transistor is on, the SSR is on.

When the transistor is off, the SSR is on.




AC Driving


Driving SSRs for DC input with AC power supply is possible by external attachment of a rectifier circuit.
                        (Please check that the ripple is within the SSR operation voltage range)

When Operated by C-MOS IC


When the IC output is at L level, the SSR is on.







2) Control Examples of Various Loads


Light Bulb Flashing Control


Because a large inrush current (approximately ten times the steady state) flows to a light bulb when it is lit, please use within the range of the respective surge current properties.




Electric Furnace Temperature Control




Solenoid Valve Driving


In solenoid load, inrush current flows in initial operation, with steady current flowing after several cycles.
                        Please use within the range of the respective surge current properties.




Miniature Relay Driving Circuit


Miniature relay operation current is small, with some operating at several mA; miniature relays may operate with the leak current flows when an SSR is off. To avoid this, it is necessary to connect a shunt resistor R in parallel with the load and shunt the leak current when an SSR is off.




Neon Lamp Flashing Control


Please connect a shunt resistor R in parallel with a neon lamp to prevent leak current causing glow discharge from the neon lamp when an SSR is in the off state.




ON/OFF Control of Single-Phase Inductive Motor


Because inrush current flows to a motor in initial operation, please use within the range of the respective surge current properties.




Forward and Reverse Operation of Single-Phase Inductive Motor


The voltage between the SSR load terminals of whichever of SSR 1 or SSR 2 is turned OFF is approximately twice as high as the power supply voltage due to the properties of the motor LC circuit. Therefore, please be sure to use an SSR with a rated voltage of twice the supply voltage. Please provide for a time lag in switchover. (At least 30ms is necessary.) 
Selection of Protective Resistance R
                        Protective resistance R protects the SSR from damage due to over current. The resistance value is derived from the maximum surge current rating (non repetitive) of the power supply voltage and the SSR. 
R > √2 x power supply voltage ÷ maximum surge current rating (non repetitive)
The power resistance P is derived from the load current and protective resistance R values.
P > (load current)2 x R
When making a selection, we recommend leaving a buffer by selecting models of at least twice the calculated value




ON/OFF Control of Three-Phase Inductive Motor


Because inrush current flows to a motor in initial operation, please take care when selecting SSRs. Two SSRs are inserted into two of the three three-phase lines.
        In this circuit, the motor and power supply are always connected, and the motor being electrically charged requires caution concerning the motor’s insulation degradation and risk of electric shock.
        To ensure safety, it is ideal to connect a no-fuse breaker at the stage before the SSR and to disconnect the power supply when not in use.




ON/OFF Control of Three-Phase Heater



Please apply sufficient voltage to the SSR input side within the input voltage range.
                        When using a three-phase star connection with the neutral point earthed, over voltage may be applied to the SSR if the neutral point is disconnected, leading to malfunction. Be sure to make connections securely.
