Company Description                    




                        Wah Lee Industrial Corp. was founded in 1968. In order to integrate with the industry development of Taiwan and the overall operation requirement of Wah Lee, we have defined our mission as ¨develop and introduce advanced material, equipment, and technology, as well as provide high value-added service, to create growth to employees, customers, and stockholders. Through the collaborative efforts of our employees and the support of our suppliers and customers over the past four decades, we have successfully introduced complete sets of material and equipment for Composite materials, Engineering plastics, PCB's, Semi-conductors, IT/IA, FPD, and Opto-electronics. We have not only managed to predict the technology development trend and broken-through our own operation peaks, but have also been key in pushing to upgrade Taiwan's techonology industries, enabling us to become the main suppliers in these industries. Currently, we are concentrating on developing Nano technology products and fuel-battery and are highly confident in generating another prosperous era of Wah Lee. Starting from 1980, Wah Lee had been working on the globalization arrangement and the requirement to expand the company's operation scope. We have established many distribution sites throughout the main cities in USA, south-eastern Asia, Great China, and Japan. By utilizing our expertise in the critical technologies and the long term collaborative relationship with foreign suppliers, Wah Lee is gradually transferring the successful experiences to overseas sites. Our vision is to be ¨Leading Hi-Tech Solutions Integrator in Greater China〃.In addition to the distribution business development, we have participated in the joint venture of upstream materials, equipments and products manufacturing. Through the vertical integration of supply chain, we strongly believe Wah Lee will be charged with more powerful growing drive and can ensure high growth rate and high efficiency in business development. We will continue to exercise our core values ¨Trustworthiness, Enthusiasm, Respect, Knowledge Transfer, Innovation” and guarantee our quality statement ¨Superior products, Excellent employees, Intimate service” to serve our suppliers and customers. We appreciate all the support and encouragement from our business partners and expect higher commitment from our employees to promote Wah Lee to an international business and to generate more contribution to the entire society.
