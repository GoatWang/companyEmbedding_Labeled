Supplier: First Sensor AG


		First Sensor AG has promoted these products:
	









Rugged HDR-CMOS camera for automotive applications


The new digital Blue Eagle camera line offers a very light sensitive HDR-CMOS image sensor and excellent thermal and mechanical stability for use in automotive and mobile OEM applications. With its high dynamic range >100 dB the megapixel cameras are ideal for high brightness differences and low light conditions.

Avalanche photodiodes for red and green light


The Series 8r APDs with high sensitivities in the red and green wavelength range feature a flat gain curve where the internal amplification rises slowly with the applied reverse bias voltage. Therefore, the new photodiodes allow for easy and accurate adjustments of high gain factors and are ideal for applications which demand fast rise times and low capacitance.

APDs with enhanced NIR sensitivity up to 950 nm


The new Series 9.5 avalanche photodiodes from First Sensor feature an increased sensitivity in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range up to 950 nm. Due to its fast rise time and very low dark current the photodiodes are ideal for applications with low light intensities and high modulation frequencies such as laser rangefinding and laser scanning.

LME: New Manifold ultra-low pressure sensors


The LME differential low pressure sensors are based on thermal flow measurement of gas through a micro-flow channel integrated within the sensor chip. The innovative LME technology features superior sensitivity especially for ultra low pressures. The extremely low gas flow through the sensor ensures high immunity to dust contamination, humidity and long tubing.

        Description    


The x-ray satellite NuSTAR, launched in June 2012, is equipped with three DL400 PSDs from First Sensor. The DL400s area duolateral, two-dimensional PSDs with 400mm² active area. They are used for continuous alignment of the telescope optics with respect to the sensor unit. Optics and sensors in x-ray telescopes are separated by are large distance due to the long focal length of x-ray lenses. The 10m deployable mast in the NuSTAR satellite is characterized by low weight and low costs, yet it lacks the required buckling resistance for an optical system. Tilt and torsion of the optics with respect to the sensor are therefore monitored four times each second by three lasers. They are mounted to the optics unit and aligned to the PSDs which are placed on the sensor base. Every single DL400 detector has been measured and tested extensively by engineers of the Jet Propulsion Lab. Six out of seven components have been qualified for the highest demands of space application.

General description

First Sensor HDI sensors offer precision pressure measurement from 10 mbar up to 5 bar. The HDI series performs precision digital signal conditioning to achieve ultra high total accuracies. An internal ASIC compensates sensor offset, temperature effects and non-linearity to allow for an excellent Total Error Band (TEB) better than ±0.5 %FSS. The pressure sensors provide digital interfaces with I²C bus protocol as well as analog output signals. Optional 3 V supply voltage versions and special low power devices make the HDI series ideal for battery powered applications, e.g. in portable or handheld devices. Miniature SMT housings allow for space-saving PCB-mounting and maximum OEM design flexibility.

CamerasOur rugged and compact cameras withstand the toughest conditions: cold, heat or permanent vibrations to name only a few.
At First Sensor the complete assembly process is under one roof - from the processing of the sensor chip to the finishing of the camera system. At the same time we save you unnecessary development effort during the integration into your systems due to our modular camera design with different interfaces and data formats. All cameras can be adapted quickly and flexibly to customer-specific requirements.

Photodiodes
EuroPhotonicsDec 2016First Sensor AGRequest Info 
        

            BERLIN — First Sensor AG has announced Series 9.5 Avalanche Photodiodes, featuring increased sensitivity in the NIR wavelength range up to 950 nm.


Due to its fast rise time and very low dark current, the photodiodes are ideal for applications with low light intensities and high modulation frequencies such as laser range finding and laser scanning. The slow increase of the amplification with the applied reverse bias voltage of the Series 9.5 allows for easy and precise adjustments of high gain factors. They provide a quantum efficiency of >80 percent in the 730- to 930-nm range and have the option of equipping different band-pass filters.


The very flat leadless ceramic-carrier surface-mount package is suitable for reflow soldering in industrial printed circuit board assembly. Other housing options are available upon request.Visit company websitehttps://www.first-sensor.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=13649
