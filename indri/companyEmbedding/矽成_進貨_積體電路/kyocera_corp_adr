Why Kyocera Corp (ADR)(NYSE: KYO) stock is going gangbusters today

Kyocera Corp (ADR)(NYSE: KYO) has announced its consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2017. KYO in the FY 17 has posted growth in the automotive markets (especially Asia) and has expanded investment in communications infrastructure brought rising demand and revenue in the fine ceramic components and semiconductor components businesses during the FY17. Hence the stock rose over 4.2% this morning (as of 12:31PM EDT on May 1st, 2017; Source: Google finance).
However, the consolidated net sales have decreased 3.8% over the prior year, to JPY1,422,754 (USD12,703) million. This is due to the fact that the sales in the solar energy business have decreased primarily due to the market price erosion. The revenue in the telecommunications equipment business has decreased as the segment’s product strategy was refocused toward higher-margin offerings.
Moreover, the currency exchange fluctuations had impacted sales negatively during the FY17, as the prior year’s trend of a depreciating yen was reversed. The profit from operations has increased 12.8% in FY 17, to JPY104,542 (USD933) million, mainly due to the continued cost reduction efforts as well as the absence of impairment losses on goodwill and long-lived assets recorded in the FY16. The income before income taxes has decreased 5.3%, to JPY137,849 (USD1,231) million, due to the absence of an asset sale gain that totaled approximately JPY20 billion in the prior fiscal year. Overall, the net income attributable to shareholders of Kyocera Corporation has decreased 4.8%, to JPY103,843 (USD927) million.
Additionally, KYO expects the production levels to remain brisk in the automotive and semiconductor-related markets. For optimum financial results, KYO will continue to invest actively in these robust markets, by focusing on miniature, high-performance components and other products that can win high market share. KYO has planned to expand efforts to raise profitability by reducing costs, particularly in the solar energy and telecommunication equipment businesses, which reorganized production systems and implemented other structural reforms in the prior fiscal year. Finally, under its new leadership, KYO will aggressively investigate all avenues to expand its existing businesses and create new business opportunities by strengthening its competitiveness, pursuing technology synergies among its diverse product segments and potential external partners, and by considering further M&A activity.



In addition, KYO in the FY 18 expects the net sales to be in the range of JPY1,422,754 million to JPY1,500,000 million, which is an increase of 5.4% over FY 17. The diluted earnings per share attributable to shareholders of KYO is expected to be in the range of 282.62 to 285.77. KYO stock has risen 16.66% in a year (source: Google Finance).
