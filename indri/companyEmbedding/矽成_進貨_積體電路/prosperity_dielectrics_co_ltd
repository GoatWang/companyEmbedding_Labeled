		Your Best Specialty Partner


		Prosperity Dielectrics Co., Ltd. (PDC) was founded in 1990 as the first local manufacturer and exporter of ceramic dielectric powders and multilayer ceramic chip capacitors in Taiwan. PDC allied with PSA Group in September 2005, and officially merged with Frontier in 2008. The range of our products expanded widely, comprising Ceramic Dielectric Powders, Disc Type Semi-conductive Capacitor Elements, Multilayer Ceramic Chip Capacitors, Chip Resistors, Diodes, and Coils.

Supporting You Forward
		PDC has a vast technological base which has been accumulated and 
		expanded since TCC established an in-house laboratory named the Fine 
		Ceramic Development Center for studying the fine ceramics. The Center 
		eventually was suggested to establish a company and move all the 
		resources into this company. Through integration with external experts, 
		PDC has been achieving to develop a series of advanced ceramic products. 
		In order to provide a complete package of products for the orientation 
		of customers, PDC added Chip Resistors to the production lines in 1995. 

		The core competency of PDC is the strong material capability for 
		providing dielectric powders of complete production lines to the 
		worldwide market. PDC has been supplying dielectric powders to the 
		manufacturers of disc type ceramic capacitors worldwide since 1998. 
		Through incessant efforts, PDC started to supply dielectric powders to 
		MLCC manufacturers in 2001.

		As market segmentation fixed in 2000, PDC has been focusing on niche 
		markets.PDC is able to serve with Safety Certified, High-Voltage, Big 
		Size, and Custom-made products for MLCC and Low Ohm Resistance, High 
		Power, High Precision and High Voltage for Resistors. With in-house 
		dielectric powder, PDC has provided Green products for global customers 
		in various product fields.
		
		To reach the vision of becoming an important role in the specific application of electronic ceramic products, PDC has employed a large numbers of R&D resources to develop high quality products to meet customer requirements. PDC has been spending 8~10% of its sales revenues in R&D since 2000.
		

		Synergy with the PSA group is a new milestone for PDC to enlarge the 
		base of factories. PDC serves with a good logistical support in the 
		global market. We are your best specialty partner and support you 
		forward with fine dielectric powders and passive components of high 
		added value.

		Your Best Specialty Partner
		信昌電子陶瓷成立於1990年，為國內少數能自行供給瓷粉原料並同時銷售積層陶瓷電容的被動元件廠商，更是唯一有能力由上游初發原料，向下垂直整合至被動晶片元件的廠商。2005年信昌電陶與華新集團進行策略聯盟、2008年正式合併弘電電子，將銷售範圍從介電瓷粉、半導性陶瓷電容器瓷片、積層陶瓷電容、晶片電阻延伸到二極體與線圈，成為國內唯一可全數提供特殊電容、電感、電阻之被動元件供應商。
 

		上下游垂直整合，掌握完整關鍵性技術
		由於掌握關鍵性材料的技術利基，信昌電陶可配合市場需求，由材料研發著手，向下整合開發客戶所需要的電子元件，縮短量產時效，並積極規劃各項產品朝高附加價值的零件功能領域邁進，如：中高壓、高精度、大尺寸之晶片電容器及高功率、高精度與低阻值之晶片電阻器等高附加價值產品。未來更將結合材料核心技術，進軍高頻及高容領域。
目前信昌電陶貴金屬製程及卑金屬製程（BME）使用的晶片電容器介電瓷粉已陸續開發完成，量產自用與對外銷售並行展開，提升國內高階積層電容瓷粉原料自主供應比率。藉由原料往下游整合至晶片電容器成品的延伸策略，發揮上下垂直整合的高度營運績效。

		近年來，為了擴展磁性元件及半導體系列產品的產能，信昌電陶陸續在中國昆山廠增置半導體相關製造設備，在東莞廠、湖南廠、重慶廠增置電感、變壓器相關製造設備，藉由產能提升，大幅拉升業績。

Your Best Specialty Partner
Prosperity Dielectrics Co., Ltd. (PDC) was founded in 1990 as the 1st local manufacturer and exporter in Taiwan for ceramic dielectric powders and multiple-layer ceramic chip capacitors (MLCCs). PDC joined to Walsin Technology Corporation (WTC) as an allied company in September 2005, and incorporated Frontier to create solid synergy in 2008. Our product lines expand to SMD magnetic chips, power chokes, coils, diode and transformers.
Supporting You Forward
PDC has a vast technological base which has been accumulated and expanded since 1983, when TCC established an in-house laboratory named the Fine Ceramic Development Center to study all the prospects regarding the fine ceramics field. The Center eventually suggested building up a company and moved all the resources into this company. Through integration with external experts, PDC has been succeeding in developing a series of advanced ceramic products. In order to provide package delivery per customer orientation, PDC added chip resistors to the product line in 1995. The company has been enjoying a good reputation as a result.
The core competency of PDC lies in the strong material capability in the field of dielectrics which has been the foundation for serving complete product lines of dielectric powders to the worldwide market. PDC has been the largest supplier of dielectric powders for disc type ceramic capacitor manufacturers in the world since 1998. Through incessant effort, PDC started to supply dielectric powders to MLCC manufacturers as well as of 2001.
With market segmentation fixed in year 2000, PDC has been focusing on niche markets particularly for MLCCs with Safety High-Voltage and custom made Big Chip Cases for chip resistors in Low Ohm Resistance, High Power, High Precision and High Voltage. For advantage of in-house dielectric powder, PDC has provided Green MLCCs for global customers in various product fields.
To realize its vision of becoming a global player in specific application electronic ceramic products, PDC has employed a lot of R&D resources to develop high quality products to meet customer needs. The spending in R&D resources accounts for 8~10% of its sales revenue since 2000.
Joining the WTC group is a new milestone for PDC to enlarge the factory base. Better logistical support in the global market is also an advantage. We are always your win-win partner and supporting you forward with friendly dielectric powder and passive components with high added value.
