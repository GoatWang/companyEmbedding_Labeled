Micropac products include custom hybrids, high temperature hybrids, power hybrids and multi-chip modules, optocouplers, LEDs, Hall Effect sensors and custom optoelectronic assemblies
Micropac offers both custom and standard products from its ISO 9001 & 2000 and AS9100:2004. Rev B qualified facilities. Micropac has supplied single component and multi component devices for military, space, medical and hi-rel industrial applications. Micropac has ISO / AS 9100 registered facilities that are qualified to MIL-PRF 38534, Class K and MIL-PRF-19500 JANS. Micropac's Optoelectronic Division is proud to introduce the 66226 optocoupler.  It consists of an 850 nm GaAIAs LED optically coupled to a photodiode detector and a 2N2222 transistor all mounted in a hermetic 6 Pin LCC package.  This configuration has proven to be highly tolerant to both proton and total dose radiation.  The 850 nm LED has proven to be more tolerant of operating temperatures over 100°C than the more commonly used 660 nm LED. 
Micropac will work at the component level or the assembly level. Micropac will provide complete microcircuit outsourcing services for customers who are interested in microcircuit fabrication outsourcing. Microcircuits Division is announcing preliminary information on the 53508 and 53509 Series Solid-State Power Controllers.
