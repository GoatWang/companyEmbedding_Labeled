WESTPORT, Conn., July 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:   CODI) ("CODI" or the "Company"), an owner of leading middle market businesses, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its majority owned subsidiary, CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak"), to Vista Outdoor Inc.

After the allocation of the sales price to non-controlling equityholders and the payment of transaction expenses, CODI expects to receive between $355 million and $375 million of total proceeds from the sale at closing.  This amount is in respect of the Company's outstanding loans to CamelBak (including accrued interest) and its equity interests in CamelBak, which was acquired by CODI on August 24, 2011.  The proceeds will be used to repay all outstanding debt under the Company's revolving credit facility, with the balance increasing cash on the Company's balance sheet. The Company anticipates recording a gain on the sale of CamelBak ranging between $140 million and $160 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
Commenting on the transaction, Alan Offenberg, CEO of Compass Diversified Holdings, stated, "Over the past four years, we have enjoyed working closely with CamelBak's management team, led by its CEO, Sally McCoy, and are proud of our accomplishments together.  CODI's strategic investments enabled CamelBak to increase consumer penetration levels, build cash flows and generate greater organic growth.  CamelBak has established itself as the global leader in personal hydration products, and we wish the company and Vista Outdoor continued success."
Sally McCoy, President and CEO of CamelBak, stated, "On behalf of CamelBak, I would like to thank CODI for being an outstanding partner.  CODI's support of our people and culture was a key ingredient to successfully building our business and brand.  In addition, CODI recognized the strong demand for our innovative, world class personal hydration products, and through our successful partnership CamelBak's business achieved new heights.  We appreciate CODI's support and guidance while ensuring that CamelBak's future outlook and positive momentum are secure with Vista Outdoor."
Mr. Offenberg added, "As a result of this opportunistic sale, we continue to unlock significant value for shareholders and will have realized gains of over $480 million since our IPO, complementing our ongoing success acquiring and growing attractive businesses with a reason to exist.  Going forward, we are well-positioned to draw upon our solid balance sheet and financial flexibility to reinvest in the long-term growth of our current subsidiaries and capitalize on additional platform and add-on acquisition opportunities while providing shareholders with consistent cash distributions."
Additional information on the acquisition will be available on the Company's current report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   “Many private equity firms look to make cuts in spending to beef up the quarterly earnings of the portfolio companies. One of the things I like about The Compass Group is that they really look to invest in long-term growth. This is good business and great for employee morale.” — Margaret Hardin, CEO, ERGObaby LEARN MORE     “At Compass, they understand day-to-day operations. When good things happen, they say, 'great work!' When bad things happen, they say, 'how can we help?'” — Chris Dods, CEO, Clean Earth LEARN MORE     “Our investment in marketing has given us the strongest brand in the industry, making us the #1 producer of safes in America. This allowed us to invest in new technology, and to double our output. We've grown from a $64 million company to over $100 million. None of this would have been possible without Compass.” — Kim Waddoups, CEO, Liberty Safe LEARN MORE     “Advanced Circuits has been with The Compass Group the longest of any company. In the ten years that we have been with them, they’ve never said, 'you’ve got to do this'. They are true partners.” — John Yacoub, CEO, Advanced Circuits LEARN MORE     “The number one reason we decided to be acquired by Compass is we share a common vision — hemp is a unique, healthy food with nutritional benefits that many people have not yet discovered — and Compass is as passionate about our growth as we are.” — Mike Fata, Founder, CEO, Manitoba Harvest LEARN MORE     “I’ve been an Executive working with private equity firms for two decades and I can tell you this: everything starts with culture in a company. Culture is everything. At Compass, even the ‘behind the scenes’ support people are good people. There are no big egos, no sharp elbows at Compass.” — Don Hinshaw, CEO, Sterno Products LEARN MORE     “Compass was always a very supportive partner for Fox Factory as the Company developed to where it is today.

The Most Important Question When Selling Your Business Isn’t How Much, But — To Whom ?














Selling a business isn’t only about the bottom line.
After all, what is a business without the people who helped build it? That’s why at The Compass Group before we acquire any business we do much more than just look at the financials and perform our business due diligence.
We meet with the management team to see if the chemistry is right, because when all is said and done — we’re going to be partners. Sure we have the financial wherewithal to acquire the most unique niche market leaders in both industrial and branded consumer sectors.
But, we have much more than that: a long-term approach and commitment to working with the people who helped build your business.

WESTPORT, Conn., Aug. 25, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:   CODI) ("CODI" or the "Company"), an owner of leading middle market businesses, announced today that it acquired a controlling interest in CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak") on August 24, 2011.  
Based in Petaluma, California and founded in 1989, CamelBak invented the hands-free hydration category and is the global leader in personal hydration gear. The company offers a complete line of technical hydration packs, reusable BPA-free water bottles, performance hydration accessories, specialized military gloves and performance accessories for outdoor, recreation and military use. CamelBak's reputation as an innovator of best-in-class personal hydration products has enabled the company to establish preferred partnerships with leading national retailers, sporting goods stores, independent and chain specialty retailers and the U.S. military. Through its global distribution network, CamelBak products are available in more than 50 countries worldwide. For the year ended December 31, 2010, CamelBak reported revenue of approximately $122.2 million. 
The purchase price of $257.5 million for the membership interests of CamelBak is based on a total enterprise value of $245.0 million and included $12.5 million of cash and working capital adjustments. The acquisition was consummated through a majority-owned subsidiary, CamelBak Acquisition Corp.  This structure will allow CODI to amortize a substantial portion of the purchase price for tax purposes.  CODI funded the acquisition through drawings on its Revolving Credit Facility, as well as through funds provided by a private placement of 1.575 million of its common shares at the closing market price of $12.50 per share on August 23, 2011, to CGI Magyar Holdings LLC ("CMH"), its largest shareholder.  An affiliate of CMH also purchased $45.0 million of convertible preferred stock in CamelBak Acquisition Corp.  Acquisition related costs were approximately $4.2 million. 
CODI's initial common equity ownership in CamelBak Acquisition Corp. is approximately 89.9%.  In addition to its equity investment in CamelBak Acquisition Corp., CODI provided loans totaling $145.2 million to CamelBak as part of the transaction. CamelBak's management team and a lender in CODI's Revolving Credit Facility also invested in the transaction alongside CODI. 
Commenting on the acquisition, Alan Offenberg, CEO of CODI, said, "We are pleased to further expand our family of niche market leaders with the acquisition of CamelBak. This company possesses the critical characteristics that we seek in all of our subsidiaries, including market leadership, strong operating history and cash flow levels, proven management and compelling growth opportunities. CamelBak is an industry pioneer with strong brand recognition as the premier innovator of personal hydration products, offering superior performance as well as important health and environmental benefits. We expect to capitalize on the company's strong market position, as well as favorable macro trends, including the growing demand for improved everyday hydration. We believe CamelBak will continue to evolve its leading product and innovation platform and strengthen its relationships with top retailers and the military, thereby increasing consumer penetration levels globally. We look forward to working with CamelBak to continue to accelerate their growth."
Mr. Offenberg added, "We expect the acquisition of CamelBak to provide our owners with fifteen to twenty cents per share of cash flow accretion on a full year basis. This acquisition increases the number of businesses we own to nine and further enhances our ability to provide attractive cash distributions and create significant value for our owners." 
Sally McCoy, Chief Executive Officer of CamelBak, will continue to serve in the same capacity at the company. Ms. McCoy commented, "CamelBak's mission is to continuously reinvent and forever change the way people hydrate and perform. CODI's acquisition of CamelBak provides an exciting opportunity to further that mission. We are eager to leverage the unique strengths of CODI's financing structure and history of working with established middle market companies to build upon our track record of success in providing advanced hydration solutions for customers on a worldwide basis." 
Additional information on the acquisition will be available on the Company's current report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today.

        WESTPORT, Conn., July 20, 2017
      



WESTPORT, Conn.,
        July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/
        -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE: CODI) ("CODI"
        or the "Company"), an owner of leading middle market
        businesses, announced today that its subsidiary, Crosman
        Corporation ("Crosman"), has acquired the Commercial
        business of LaserMax, Inc. ("LaserMax"), a leading designer
        and manufacturer of gun mounted laser aiming devices.
      

        Since being founded in 1989, LaserMax has grown to become a
        global leader in hardened and miniaturized laser systems,
        offering a comprehensive line of premium laser sights for
        home defense, personal protection and training use. The
        company's Commercial business provides laser sighting
        solutions and tactical lights to the firearm OEM and retail
        channels. LaserMax has developed significant intellectual
        property in laser technology, resulting in a comprehensive
        IP portfolio. For the trailing twelve months ended
        June 30, 2017, LaserMax
        reported net revenue of approximately $8 million. CODI funded the purchase
        price through a draw on its revolving credit facility.
      

Alan Offenberg, CEO of CODI,
        stated, "The addition of LaserMax's Commercial business
        supports Crosman's strategic initiative of expanding into
        attractive adjacent markets and realizing cross-selling
        opportunities with current big box retail and international
        customers. Further, adding this premium laser sight brand
        to Crosman's product offering in the outdoor recreation
        market will enable it to reach a wider range of new
        customers across retail channels. Moving forward, CODI will
        continue to use its strong balance sheet to pursue
        compelling add-on and platform acquisitions that build
        long-term shareholder value."
      

Robert Beckwith, CEO of
        Crosman, commented, "LaserMax is well-known for its
        innovative laser products in the shooting sports accessory
        market, and the cross-selling synergies with Crosman's
        airgun and archery products are clear and highly
        attractive. With CODI's support, we are excited to be able
        to strengthen our product line for outdoor enthusiasts by
        adding this iconic brand to the Crosman portfolio."
