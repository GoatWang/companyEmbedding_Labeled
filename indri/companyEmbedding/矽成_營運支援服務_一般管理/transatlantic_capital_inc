  BINGHAM FARMS, Mich., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TransAtlantic Capital, Inc. (TACI) announces a new acquisition sector for the publicly traded company. Chief Executive Officer, Joshua Griggs announced the intent to begin sale-leaseback transactions in the licensed Medical-use cannabis industry. "Our investment model has always focused on Fortune 500 real estate. Today, medical marijuana is nearly a $7 billion industry, with 29 states and the District of Columbia allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis and more states are expected to support legalization. We plan to be capital providers for state licensed medical cannabis facilities," says Joshua Griggs.     TACI plans to acquire industrial real estate assets used for cultivating and processing Medical-use cannabis, and operated by state-licensed growers. The Triple-Net lease arrangements with tenants are long-term (15+ years) where the tenant is responsible for maintenance, taxes, insurance, and structural repairs, in addition to base rent. "By selling the real estate and facilities to us, and then leasing it back from us, growers can use the proceeds to improve operations, allowing higher profits than they would by owning the real estate," Says Griggs.  ABOUT TRANSATLANTIC CAPITAL, INC. TransAtlantic Capital, Inc. is a publicly listed real estate operating company trading on the OTCBB.

GuruFocus Profitability Rank ranks how profitable a company is and how likely the companys business will stay that way. It is based on these factors:

1. Operating Margin
2. Trend of the Operating Margin (5-year average). The company with an uptrend profit margin has a higher rank.
3. Consistency of the profitability
4. Piotroski F-Score
5. Predictability Rank

The maximum rank is 10. A rank of 7 or higher means a higher profitability and may stay that way. A rank of 3 or lower indicates that the company has had trouble to make a profit.

Profitability Rank is not directly related to the Financial Strength Rank. But if a company is consistently profitable, its financial strength will be stronger.

On May 4, 2006, it changed its name to ACRO Inc. The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Acrosec Ltd. incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. It develops and markets the products for the detection of military and commercial explosives for the homeland security market. Its first product is called the Peroxide Explosives Tester (ACRO-P.E.T.). ACRO-P.E.T. is a small, disposable, pen-like probe which detects the presence of peroxide-based explosives using three chemical solutions and relies on direct contact with the suspicious substance. ACRO-P.E.T. has been designed for rapid, on-site detection of peroxide-based explosives. In November 2006, it completed the first production of the ACRO-P.E.T. for evaluation by potential customers. In 2007, it developed a new version of ACRO-P.E.T. which enables easier verification of peroxide-based explosives, such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP). In addition, in the new version it improved the sampling device to enable easy and immediate sampling of suspicious liquids, in addition to all other forms of explosives, such as powder. The new version has been available for sale since mid 2007. In addition, it developed the ACRO-N.E.T. (Nitride Explosives Tester), which detects the presence of commercial and military explosives. ACRO-N.E.T. incorporates into its pen-like device the explosive testing kit of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), licensed to it under an agreement dated October 28, 2007, with a subsidiary of IIBR called Life Science Research Israel Ltd. (LSRI). ACRO-N.E.T. is based on the LSRI explosive detecting kit, called ETK. The ETK is capable of identifying the full range of well-known types of military and commercially available explosives, and also of homemade explosives based on nitrate and chlorate salts. This device, ACRO-N.E.T., complements ACRO-P.E.T. by providing the possibility to detect explosives other than TATP. Its operation system and advantages are the same as the ACRO-P.E.T.; however, it uses different solutions and detects different explosives. It also signed several agreements with LSRI pursuant to which it may distribute the ETK and ETK 5, exclusively, in several countries. The ETK's kits complete its products. The Company competes with other developers and manufacturers of explosive detection devices. The Company's ability to develop and commercialize its products is dependent upon approval from certain governmental security organizations.

This is a pure speculation play that I am guessing will be either a 70% loss or a 700% gain over the next year but after investigating, I personally like what I am finding. I found it by accident when searching for information on another stock.  The product immediately caught my attention but I have been burned by "story" stocks before (they sound good but never make money), so I searched several message boards for stock hype but I did not find any with activity.  I have been impressed so far with the company and the people involved.  It is still an OTC penny stock so you must also consider the risk of stock manipulation no matter how good the company is.   The stock just did a private placement of $1.5 million with an off-shore company but according to the press release it was for a fixed amount @ $.75 cents per share with incentive warrants @$1.25 per share available in the future (so no convertible debenture to worry about).  The CEO and a Director also agreed not to sell any of their shares until May 1st, 2008.    Now here is my personal quick assessment:  ACRO inc Ticker ACRI (OTC:BB) is very thinly traded (not much daily volume) but the largest shareholder Ehud Keinan (see short bio below) who owns 30%, appears to be a straight shooter with good connections on his advisory board (like General (ret.) Ehud  arak, former IDF Chief of Staff and former Primer Minister of Israel) and the product has recently tested well and appears to be in the right place at the right time to do very well if they can market it properly with the right price point and produce a quality product that customers are pleased with.  Searching for company news can be tricky because they were listed in the oil services sector until 2006 (under the ticker MDIN) when the company made a complete change in direction and a new Board of Directors but they are still listed in the oil sector on most stock quotes plus many stock websites include news info for a different company called Acacia (which apparently used ACRI or ACRO a couple years ago).     Yahoo is one of the few quote services that seem to have the news and quote info correct:  http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACRI.OB   Please do your own research and consider the high risks before investing.     Monty   (Below are some informational excerpts I found that will get you started on your research.)  _______________________________________________________  About Acro Inc.  http://www.acrosec.com  Acro Inc. is involved in the development of explosives detection technologies. The company developed a  unique patented technology for identifying peroxide based explosives, such as TATP.  Acro's Advisory Board includes General (ret.) Ehud Barak, former IDF Chief of Staff and former Primer  Minister of Israel, Prof. K. Barry Sharpless, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, and Prof. Richard  A. Lerner, President & CEO of The Scripps Research Institute, which is considered one of the most influential  scientific institutes worldwide.  _______________________________________________________  Acro Reports on Independent Testing of Peroxide Explosive  Tester - P.E.T. By Rafael   Israel's National Defense Research and Development Defense Laboratory to Provide Third Party Verification  of Proprietary Technology  TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 29, 2007 Acro Inc. (OTC BB:ACRI) today announced that  Rafael, Israel's Armament Development Authority, and a world leader in the development and production of  advanced interdisciplinary weapon systems for naval, air and ground forces, is testing the Company's  proprietary Peroxide Explosive Tester - the ACRO-P.E.T.  Internationally renowned Rafael has been contracted to independently establish the product parameters in few  specific areas: selectivity tests to eliminate "false-positive" detections, performance in the presence of  "camouflaging materials", determination of threshold levels of detection and the mechanical reliability of the  product.    Initial tests on 600 units of the device have demonstrated that the ACRO-P.E.T can detect less than 50  micrograms (0.00005 gram) of TATP. Furthermore, 23 different commonly used and commercially purchased  materials were tested to verify that they do not provide false-positive results. The results were better than  pre-test expectations and have been published in a report. This invaluable report will be made available to  potential customers to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the ACRO-P.E.T.  Acro intends to deliver the device to several international security agencies for further evaluation tests. The  receiving agencies are all governmental, national security agencies, such as the US Department of Homeland  Security. Several national police forces have also requested to receive evaluation units.  "Independent verification of the ACRO-P.E.T. product and its potential to address the threat of improvised  explosives by Rafael is of great assistance in propelling the Company from development to full-fledged  marketing. Acro is the only company using this technology which addresses the multitude of threats arising  from peroxide based explosives, which may appear in variety of shapes and form, including liquid explosives,"  stated Gadi Aner, Chairman of the Board.        TEL AVIV, Israel, November 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Acro Inc. (OTCBB: ACRI) announces that it  has completed the first production of its patented, Peroxide based explosives tester, the ACRO-P.E.T. This  device is one of the few products in the market that is able to identify the Peroxide based explosives, such as  the TATP, and is the only one using Acro's proprietary technology.      Acro intends to deliver these products to several international security agencies for evaluation tests. The  receiving agencies are all governmental, national security agencies, such as the US Department of Homeland  Security. Several national police forces have also requested to receive evaluation units.      Prof. Ehud Keinan, the inventor, a director and scientific advisor to Acro stated that "Acro's goal is to  ensure that its product meets all the standards and function as intended thus allowing us to finally be able to  provide a viable method of combating the terrible threat of terror with improvised explosives. Such explosives,  which can appear in many different forms and shapes, including liquids, are very difficult to detect.  ACRO-P.E.T. is the only product available using this technology for identifying peroxide based explosives."  _______________________________________________________  ARCO INC  Product  Our first product called the Peroxide Explosives Tester (ACRO-P.E.T). ACRO-P.E.T is a small disposable  pen like probe which detects the presence of peroxide-based explosives using three chemical solutions and  relies on direct contact with the suspicious substance. ACRO-P.E.T has been designed for rapid, on-site  detection of peroxide-based explosives. Its main advantages are high sensitivity, high selectivity, fast response,  simple operation, small size and cost effectiveness. In November 2006, we completed the first production of  the ACRO-P.E.T for evaluation by potential customers. We intend to deliver these products to several  international security agencies for evaluation tests. To date, the data supporting our development programs is  derived solely from laboratory and limited early stage trials that were not all designed to be statistically  significant or proof-of-concept trial, some of which are exploratory in nature. We cannot assure you that our  ACRO-P.E.T will gain commercial acceptance in the marketplace.  We plan to follow ACRO-P.E.T with additional future products utilizing our proprietary technologies and  public domain methods for detecting other explosives.  _______________________________________________________  (Formerly known as Medina International Corp OTCBB: MDIN until 2006)  Acro Inc (OTC: ACRI)   Industry: Oil Equipment & Services (older info from Answers.com)  Acro Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 22, 2002. Since the Company's inception, its  business has been to provide professional consulting services for the technical and economic evaluation of  petroleum and natural gas resources. The primary services that the Company offered was conducting due  diligence on petroleum and natural gas projects, identifying potential petroleum and natural gas projects  available for acquisition by clients and the provision of professional services to petroleum and natural gas  clients primarily in the technical areas of geology, geophysics and petroleum engineering. Acro was not  successful in fully implementing its initial business plan for the consulting services and have decided to no  longer offer consulting services to oil and gas Companies. To better protect stockholder interests and provide  future appreciation, management have conducted an in-depth analysis of its business and decided to find a  product that the Company would be able to develop and license or sell. The product that it has found is a  method of detecting peroxide based explosives. When the Company completes its acquisition of U.S. Patent  No. 6,767,717 and the related intellectual property for its potential explosive detection device products,  the Company would be competing with other developers and manufacturers of explosive detection device. Several  corporate announcements have recently appeared in the media about efforts to develop devices that detect  Triacetone Triperoxide. Most of these devices are based on air-sampling followed by spectral analysis using  various methods. These instruments, which are quite heavy and expensive, are designed primarily for  checkpoint stations, such as airports. Nevertheless, none of them can compete with the Company's potential  peroxide based explosive detection device, which is a small, disposable device, portable, easy to operate for  quick analysis by anybody at any location. The Company plans to introduce its potential products to the  addressable markets such as the law enforcement agencies, military, airport security personnel and others  employed in security checkpoints at other locations vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Acro Inc. does not  currently have any employees.  _______________________________________________________  Professor Ehud Keinan (before joining ACRO inc)   Benno Gitter and Ilana Ben Ami Chair in Biotechnology  Born in Israel 1947   B.Sc. 1971 Tel Aviv Univ., M.Sc. 1972 Ben Gurion Univ., Ph.D. 1977 The   Weizmann Institute of Science   On Technion faculty since 1987   Adjunct Professor, Department of Molecular Biology and the Skaggs Institute  of Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California.

BINGHAM FARMS, Mich., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TransAtlantic Capital, Inc. (TACI) announces a new acquisition sector for the publicly traded company. Chief Executive Officer, Joshua Griggs announced the intent to begin sale-leaseback transactions in the licensed Medical-use cannabis industry. "Our investment model has always focused on Fortune 500 real estate. Today, medical marijuana is nearly a $7 billion industry, with 29 states and the District of Columbia allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis and more states are expected to support legalization. We plan to be capital providers for state licensed medical cannabis facilities," says Joshua Griggs. 








TACI plans to acquire industrial real estate assets used for cultivating and processing Medical-use cannabis, and operated by state-licensed growers. The Triple-Net lease arrangements with tenants are long-term (15+ years) where the tenant is responsible for maintenance, taxes, insurance, and structural repairs, in addition to base rent. "By selling the real estate and facilities to us, and then leasing it back from us, growers can use the proceeds to improve operations, allowing higher profits than they would by owning the real estate," Says Griggs.
