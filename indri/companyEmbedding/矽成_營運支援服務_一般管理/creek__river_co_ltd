最佳解答: 
             Basically, the difference among them is their size: 

(smallest) brook < creek < stream< river (biggest)

TOKYO, Jan. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/-- CREEK & RIVER Co., Ltd., a planner and producer of media content and involved in creators' agency business, announced on January 22 that it has begun a KAORI project to promote Japanese novels and comics overseas. Named for the concept of bringing Japanese kaori (culture) to the world, this project will see the translation, digitization, and global distribution of works by authors who network with CREEK & RIVER's literary agency.
As a first highlight, global distribution has begun for Miyuki Miyabe's "Puppet Master", a best-selling smash hit with over four million copies sold, and a winner of both the Mainichi Publishing Culture Award and the Minister of Education Award for Fine Arts in Literature. Koh Murao, an artist currently active in New York, provided the cover illustration. This novel is to be released in consecutive volumes, with the fifth and final volume planned for release in February 2016.
Additionally, distribution has also been confirmed for the seminal sci-fi manga "COBRA" (by Buichi Terasawa), the subject of a surprise announcement that it would be made into a live-action Hollywood movie adaptation. This bestselling comic with over 60 million copies sold is a representative work of Japanese science fiction. Now, all 15 volumes of the full-color English edition will be released sequentially.
Ten manga masterpieces of various genres are in the line-up of Japanese Authors' Gallery KAORI. These are planned for release mainly on Amazon Kindles and Apple iBooks, with later expansion to other distribution platforms.
