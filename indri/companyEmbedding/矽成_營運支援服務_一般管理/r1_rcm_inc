You could say we’re radically responsible.


We leverage your data and measure ourselves only on what flows through to your ledger. We act as a true operating partner no matter what environmental conditions you may experience.
Our performance stack enables us to calculate income statement and balance sheet entitlement and produce CFO-validated impact.
KPIs align our performance with yours. 86% of the time, we drive 4 pts of yield; 79% of the time we achieve better than 20% improvement.
All this while enhancing patient experience and offloading administrative burdens from physicians.



Operating with consistency.


Our diagnostics and tools enable us to measure against the standards of our operating model.
We analyze the baseline, identify deviations, and rapidly close gaps.
The ultimate power in our approach is a continuous assessment of achieving these standards.
This ensures delivery consistency and enables economic and patient experience gains.



Visibility from every meaningful angle.


Our reporting is designed to remove the mystery and provide you and your team with a clear window into your revenue operations.
Reporting is continuous and comprehensive and can be tailored to your priorities and needs.
Technology provides superior performance visualization by automating over 90% of in-process metrics.
This ultimately enables us to effect real-time defect intervention and recovery workflow.



Measuring each and every component.


Our local experts, supported by a strong central operations group, drive a constant focus on measurable results.
We use hundreds of measurement methods to drive comprehensive daily accountability designed to identify and correct small issues before they become organizational problems.
We institutionalize all adjustments and improvements to ensure consistency and repeatability in performance.
This level of inspection fuels our ability to scale to the unique needs of your organization.



Technologies built for operators.


Our technologies integrate with your operations across multiple host and payer systems. They are designed to scale and perform in the largest, most complex systems.
Our systems institutionalize process improvements and automate over 80% of our methods.
Robust applications are powered by 23 distinct and proprietary rules engines.
These sophisticated tools enable end-to-end process integration.
LEARN MORE



A proven process born of hard knocks.


We developed our operating model through years of challenging implementations coupled with groundbreaking achievements.
As one of the first RCM providers, we’ve “seen it all” as we built today’s modern revenue cycle systems and capabilities from the ground up.
The hallmarks of our process are standard structures and rigorous methods, tested and proven in an array of organizations and operating environments.



We've seen every problem you'll face.


We understand the missions and unique needs of nonprofit organizations.
Problem solving skills are deep in the DNA of our executives, leaders, and operators.
Team members are certified through our onboarding and training system—then continuously developed and supported to ensure they are equipped to deliver on your mission.
Our human capital system is based on a philosophy that the right skills and the right leadership abilities are essential to high performance.

CHICAGO, Aug.  02, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- R1 RCM Inc. (NASDAQ:RCM), a leading provider of revenue cycle management and physician advisory services to healthcare providers, today announced the appointment of Gary Long to the newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.
Long will be responsible for R1’s customer growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, product management and solution development. Long comes to R1 with more than 20 years of healthcare experience in leading organizations to drive revenue growth and profitability. Most recently, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Sales Officer at Premier Inc., where he developed and led a commercial organization focused on driving the company’s revenues across health systems, life sciences and government markets. Long created a professional and sustainable market-focused organization while leading the business up to and beyond its successful IPO in 2013.  Under Long’s leadership the business more than doubled its annual revenues while increasing its profitability. Prior to Premier, Long served as Senior Vice President of sales and support for Surgical Information Systems. Additionally, he previously worked at McKesson Corporation, where he held a series of progressive leadership roles in product management, corporate marketing and enterprise sales. “I am very excited to join R1 and look forward to working with the team to drive the company’s growth. This is a pivotal time for healthcare providers as the industry must integrate and transform itself to provide higher quality and more cost-efficient care,” said Long.  “Healthcare financial leaders today need to transform their revenue cycle approach to address increasing complexity, shrinking margins and rising consumerism.  R1 is well positioned to partner with these leaders to improve the patient and provider experience while driving financial performance across the continuum of care.”   “R1 has developed a comprehensive technology-enabled revenue cycle service platform and has optimized the performance of this platform in the past few years. As a direct result of the optimization of this platform, we are excited to enhance our commercialization efforts to drive sustainable growth for the company,” added Joe Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer of R1. “Gary’s background in revenue cycle management and track record in sales, marketing and product development positions him well to lead our commercial effort. We are delighted to welcome Gary to the R1 team.” Long’s appointment is effective immediately and he will report directly to Joe Flanagan. Forward-Looking Statements This document includes information that may constitute “forward-looking statements,” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to future, not past, events and often address our expected future growth, plans and performance or forecasts. These forward-looking statements are often identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “designed,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” or “would,” and similar expressions or variations, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations about future events as of the date hereof and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Subsequent events and developments, including actual results or changes in our assumptions, may cause our views to change. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included herein are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Our actual results and outcomes could differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to: if we are not able to achieve or maintain profitability; if we are unable to retain our existing customers or acquire new customers; delayed or unsuccessful implementation of our technologies or services with our customers or implementation costs that exceed our expectations; as well as the factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, our 2017 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any other periodic reports that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. About R1 RCM R1 serves as the one revenue cycle management partner for select hospitals and healthcare systems regardless of their payment models, patient engagement strategies, or settings of care.  The Company uses a proven operating model based on the R1 Performance StackSM designed to fit seamlessly into any healthcare organization’s infrastructure and to enhance the patient experience, improve provider economics, and provide revenue predictability.
