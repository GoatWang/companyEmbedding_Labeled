There are also healthy life hours and community impact hours, which, if you have a manager who actually lets you utilize these, are nice.ConsTABC does not learn from its mistakes. It will be dissolved soon enough. It promotes people into roles that are not deserving or fit, and side steps hard workers. The acquisitions this company has made are handled extremely poorly. The pay is terrible starting out, and it is difficult to make more. Entry-level employees are looked down upon and treated poorly. It was a decent job, but I definitely was not unhappy to leave, and I don not recommend joining this organization.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) The Advisory Board Company Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Advisory Board Company 2017-07-31 13:51 PDT Jul 15, 2017"Analyst"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at The Advisory Board Company full-timeProsYou get experience with projects early on, a lot of training, good place to start workingConsConfusing structure, a lot of different divisionsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) The Advisory Board Company Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Advisory Board Company 2017-07-15 18:07 PDTReviews > The Advisory Board Company There are newer employer reviews for The Advisory Board CompanySee Most Recent There are newer employer reviews for The Advisory Board CompanySee Most RecentWork at The Advisory Board Company?

History[edit]
The company was founded by David G. Bradley in 1979 as the Research Council of Washington with five employees. Its original mission was to answer "any question for any company for any industry," but in 1983 the company began to specialize in research for the financial services industry and changed its name to The Advisory Board Company. By 1986, the company had launched its health care-focused strategic research division, including its first membership program, the Health Care Advisory Board.[1]
Across the next four years the firm grew to 150 employees, served more than 500 health care members, and published 15 major reports and 2,000 research briefs each year. In 1993, the firm launched a strategic research membership for large companies, bringing on almost half of the Fortune 500 within 18 months. The firm expanded in 1994 to include its first clinically based program, the Cardiology Roundtable—which has since evolved to become the Cardiovascular Roundtable—providing best practices to the nations’ cardiac programs.
In 1997, the company spun off its corporate membership group, forming The Corporate Executive Board (now CEB Inc.) as an independent company. It maintained its focus on the health care sector, working with more than 1,500 health care organizations. H*Works, a consulting business offering best practice implementation support launched in 2000, followed shortly by The Advisory Board Company’s initial public offering in 2001, in which Bradley sold his ownership interest.
By 2002, the firm topped 2,100 memberships and 500 employees, and launched The Advisory Board Academies leadership development division—now the company's Talent Development division—to address the leadership gap in health care. In 2003, the company was named to Washingtonian’s Great Places to Work and launched its business intelligence and analytics offering, Compass, providing memberships anchored by robust decision support tools. In 2005, the firm was named to Forbes’ Top 200 High-Growth Companies and again to Washingtonian's Great Places to Work.[2]
In 2007, the company launched its first membership programs in higher education, working with student and academic affairs executives at several U.S. research universities.[3] The firm continued to grow across 2008, acquiring Crimson, a data, analytics, and business intelligence software provider focused on physician performance, quality metrics, and cost of care outcomes.
By 2009, The Advisory Board Company had opened its doors in San Francisco, marking the fourth U.S. office. The firm also grew to over 1,000 employees and over 2,800 health care and higher education members. The company expanded its capabilities in the physician management terrain through the acquisition of Southwind, a management and consulting firm focused on aligning hospitals and physicians through a comprehensive set of physician employment, clinical integration, and information technology deployment solutions. During this time,the company was named to Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work—an honor it has received every year since.[4]
From 2010 to 2011, the company continued to expand, acquiring and partnering with a series of technology firms, including Milliman MedInsight, which provides population risk analytics, Cielo MedSolutions, which provides ambulatory patient registry software, and PivotHealth, a physician practice management firm.
In 2012, The Advisory Board Company acquired ActiveStrategy,[5] a performance improvement technology firm, and 360Fresh,[6] a leading provider of clinical data analytics. The firm also was named as one of Healthcare Informatics' top 100 health care IT firms[7] and Modern Healthcare's top 40 fastest-growing health care firms list.[8] During that year, the firm also provided $1 million in benefit to non-profit organizations through its Community Impact program.
In 2013, the firm was named the “#1 Best Large Company to Work For” by Modern Healthcare magazine.[9] It also became the first for-profit company of its size to achieve 100% participation in community service.
That year, the Advisory Board acquired Care Team Connect,[10] a care management workflow platform, and launched the Student Success Collaborative, a software-based program that helps colleges and universities improve outcomes for at-risk and off-path students. The company also announced the acquisition of Medical Referral Source, a technology firm with software that facilitates a seamless referral process.[11]
2014 brought the acquisitions of HealthPost,[12] which helps health systems reduce referral leakage and attract new patients, and Royall & Company, which provides the higher education industry with data-driven student engagement, enrollment management, financial aid optimization, and alumni fundraising solutions.[13]
The company’s Community Impact program, meanwhile, received the 2014 Corporate Engagement Award of Excellence from Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.[14] The firm also partnered with the de Beaumont Foundation, Kresge Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to launch the BUILD Health Challenge to identify and support health partnerships taking bold, upstream, integrated, local, and data-driven approaches to improving health in low-income, urban communities.[15]
In 2015, the company announced its acquisition of Clinovations, an EMR optimization firm serving providers at the intersection of clinician workflows and information technology, and GradesFirst, a student success technology company with workflow software that enables colleges and universities to identify, engage, and support at-risk students.[16]
As of 2016, the company had grown to more than 3,600 employees, with offices on three continents. It was named as a Modern Healthcare Best Place to Work for the eighth straight year.[17]
In January 2017, the company reduced it's healthcare workforce by 220 employees, or 5.7%, exited several businesses and announced a plan to close 4 offices by the end of 2017. [18]
Advisory Board[edit]
The company’s advisory board division serves 4,400+ health care members. Advisory Board forges and finds best practices, then customizes and hardwires those insights for members with research, technology, and consulting. It also publishes American Health Line, a daily health care policy briefing.
Advisory Board Research provides clarity on health care's pressing issues—including strategy, care delivery, and operations—and strategies for addressing them.
Advisory Board Technology services help members find and address opportunities by embedding best practices into operations.
The Advisory Board Consulting team provides hands-on best practice implementation, practice management solutions, and physician alignment services.
EAB[edit]
The company’s EAB division serves 1,100+ college and university members. EAB forges and finds best practices to address education’s top challenges with research forums dedicated to presidents, provosts, chief business officers, and other academic and administrative leaders.[19]

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Robert Musslewhite serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company. Robert joined the firm in 2003, guiding growth strategy and the firm’s technology portfolio before becoming CEO in 2008. 
Under Robert’s leadership as CEO, The Advisory Board Company has more than quadrupled in size and now serves nearly 300,000 leaders in over 5,500 hospitals, health systems, and universities worldwide. He has continued to guide the firm’s strategy, keeping our comprehensive research portfolio at the core while expanding our technology, consulting, and data-enabled services capabilities to help members hardwire best practices into their institutions. In health care, our focus is on three critical areas, ensuring that health systems: attract, retain, and engage patients by offering the care they need; deliver the highest standard of care by instituting and consistently following the best protocols; and receive payment for the services they render, so they have the financial stability to serve their communities for the long term. In Education, we deliver significant value by leveraging our data assets and deep expertise to bolster results across the student life cycle, including recruitment, enrollment, retention, and student success.
The company’s mission, values, and unique culture are a priority for Robert. On his watch, the firm has garnered wide recognition, including Modern Healthcare magazine’s “Best Places to Work” for eight years running; Forbes’ “Best Management Consulting Firm” and “40 Most Innovative Growth Companies”; Working Mother magazine’s “100 Best Places to Work”; the Human Rights Campaign’s “Best Place to Work” for LGBTQ employees; and a two-time finalist for the Software & Information Industry Association CODiE Awards. Robert has also placed immense emphasis on strengthening our communities; the firm has one of the highest rates of employee volunteerism in the nation, with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of service work and donations provided to non-profit organizations across his tenure. 
Robert was named a “Tech Titan” by Washingtonian Magazine three times, honored as one of the "Power 100" in the Washington Business Journal, won the Ernst & Young LLP Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Business Services in Greater Washington, and has been profiled in the New York Times.
Prior to joining The Advisory Board Company, Robert was an Associate Principal with McKinsey & Company in the Washington, D.C., Amsterdam, and Dallas offices. He served a range of clients across the consumer products and other industries and was a co-leader of McKinsey’s Pricing Center. Robert holds a JD from Harvard Law School and an AB in economics from Princeton University.
