Altech Tower Lights are the choice of many customers in the packaging equipment manufacturing industry, material handling and conveyor equipment builders. Production line managers now have a reliable resource of checking production status and machine operation sequences with the new ALTECH Tower Lights. The modular design allows maximum flexibility in colors and functions, the modules quickly install into place with a simple twist action. Maintenance is minimized due to the long life SMD LED illumination source. The only tool you need is a screwdriver to mount the unit; assembly is completed without tools - just insert the unit onto the base, twist it and done. Instructions are included with each unit and it is available for download from www.altechcorp.com/towerlights.
