	Reis provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools to real estate professionals through its Reis Services subsidiary. Reis Services, including its predecessors, was founded in 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage and seniors housing properties, and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess, quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nation’s leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.

	The Company’s product portfolio features: Reis SE, its flagship delivery platform aimed at larger and mid-sized enterprises; ReisReports, aimed at prosumers and smaller enterprises; and Mobiuss Portfolio CRE, or Mobiuss, aimed primarily at risk managers and credit administrators at banks and non-bank lending institutions. It is through these products that Reis provides online access to a proprietary database of commercial real estate information and analytical tools designed to facilitate debt and equity transactions as well as ongoing asset and portfolio evaluations. Depending on the product or level of entitlement, users have access to market trends and forecasts at metropolitan and neighborhood levels throughout the U.S. and/or detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates, lease terms, property sales, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reis’s products are designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision-making of property owners, developers, builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers.  These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply, absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and construction.

	Organization and Business







	Reis, Inc. is a Maryland corporation. When we refer to Reis or the Company, we are referring to Reis,
	Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools to real estate professionals, through its Reis Services subsidiary. For disclosure and financial reporting purposes, this
	business is referred to as Reis Services.



	Reis Services



	Reis Services, including its predecessors, was founded in 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed
	information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage,
	seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing properties, and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity
	investors to assess, quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nations
	leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.


	The Companys product portfolio features:

	Reis SE

	, its flagship delivery platform aimed at larger and mid-sized enterprises;

	ReisReports

	, aimed at prosumers and smaller enterprises; and

	Reis Portfolio CRE

	and other portfolio support products and services

	,

	aimed
	primarily at risk managers and credit administrators at banks and non-bank lending institutions. It is through these products that Reis provides online access to a proprietary database of commercial real estate information and analytical tools
	designed to facilitate debt and equity transactions as well as ongoing asset and portfolio evaluations. Depending on the product or level of entitlement, users have access to market trends and forecasts at metropolitan and neighborhood levels
	throughout the U.S. and/or detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates, lease terms, property sales, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reiss products are designed to meet the demand for timely
	and accurate information to support the decision making of property owners, developers, builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers. These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the
	performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply, absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and
	construction.

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies









	Basis of Presentation





	Principles of Consolidation



	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned and controlled
	subsidiaries. Investments in entities where the Company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the
	Companys proportionate share of the investments income (loss) and additional contributions or distributions. All inter-company accounts and transactions among the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.



	Quarterly Reporting



	The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the
	instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
	prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
	Companys balance sheets, statements of operations, statement of changes in stockholders equity and statements of cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature. These consolidated financial statements should be
	read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on March 9, 2017. The consolidated
	statements of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are not necessarily indicative of full year results.

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)






	Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
	differ from those estimates.


	From time to time, the Company has been, is or may in the future be a defendant in various
	legal actions arising in the normal course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The outcome of any litigation is
	uncertain; it is possible that a judgment in any legal actions to which the Company is a party, or which are proposed or threatened, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 10.




	New Accounting Pronouncements




	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	(ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09
	affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods
	or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
	adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and as of the date of this report has not determined the method of adoption.


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	(ASU 2016-02)

	.

	ASU 2016-02 establishes a
	right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
	classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective
	transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
	available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

	Compensation-Stock Compensation

	(ASU 2016-09). Under ASU
	2016-09, entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance on employers accounting for (1) an employees use of shares to satisfy the
	employers statutory income tax withholding obligation and (2) forfeitures is also changing. For public business entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
	years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017, which included (1) recording an additional deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet of approximately $657,000 and (2) the recording of a cumulative effect
	change in stockholders equity related to the prior treatment of estimated forfeitures as the Company has elected to record forfeitures in the period in which they occur. The cumulative effect change in accounting principle is reflected on the
	consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity to reconcile from the previously reported December 31, 2016 balances to the recast amounts after giving effect to ASU 2016-09. Other than the items identified, the adoption of ASU
	2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


	In August
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows-Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	(ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions are presented in
	the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
	adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


	In November 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force

	(ASU 2016-18). ASU 2016-18 intends to address the diversity in practice that exists in the classification and
	presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. The amendments require that a

	described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
	expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.


	In
	January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

	Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business

	(ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 provides a criteria to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (a
	set) is not a business and narrows the definition of the term output so that it is consistent with the description of outputs in Topic 606. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
	beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is only permitted for transactions that have not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU
	2017-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.




	Reclassification




	Amounts in certain accounts, as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and condensed operating data in Note 3
	have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In particular, the Company has changed its presentation of revenue to include two categories: subscription revenue and other revenue.

	In October 2012, Reis Services, as borrower, and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a loan and security agreement with
	Capital One, National Association, as lender (Capital One), for a $10,000,000 revolving credit facility (the 2012 Revolver). The 2012 Revolver had a three year term scheduled to expire on October 16, 2015; however, the
	expiration date was extended to January 31, 2016. In January 2016, Reis Services and Capital One executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement for a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility with terms substantially similar to the
	2012 Revolver (as amended, the 2016 Revolver, and collectively with the 2012 Revolver, the Revolver). The 2016 Revolver expires on January 28, 2019. Any borrowings on the Revolver bear interest at a rate of LIBOR +

	Due to the amount of its NOL and credit carryforwards, the Company does not anticipate paying
	Federal income taxes for a number of years. The Company expects, in the future, that it will be subject to cash payments for Federal AMT and for a portion of its state and local income taxes as the New York State and New York City laws enacted in
	March 2014 and April 2015, respectively, limit the amount of existing NOLs which could be used each year.


	Deferred income
	taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax asset was approximately $18,074,000
	and $16,815,000 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The significant portion of the deferred tax items relates to deferred tax assets including NOL carryforwards, Federal AMT credit carryforwards and stock based
	compensation, with the remainder of the deferred tax items relating to liabilities resulting from the intangible assets recorded at the time of the May 2007 merger.


	The Company had Federal NOL carryforwards aggregating approximately $38,679,000 at December 31, 2016, as well as
	significant state and local NOL carryforwards. Approximately $5,961,000 of these Federal NOLs are subject to an annual Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation of $2,779,000, whereas the remaining balance of approximately $32,718,000 is not
	subject to the limitation. The enactment of a 2014 New York State law and a 2015 New York City law limit the amount of existing NOLs which could be used each year in those jurisdictions; however, all such NOLs are expected to be fully utilized in
	the future.

	On August 30, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) authorized a repurchase program of
	shares of the Companys common stock up to an aggregate of $5,000,000. Purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Depending on market conditions, financial
	developments and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time, or from time to time, without prior notice and may be expanded without prior notice. The Company may make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under
	Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, permitting open market purchases of common stock during blackout periods.

	$2,651,000, or an average price of $19.99 per share. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock.


	The Company declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share for both the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016. Dividend payments aggregated approximately $1,971,000 and $1,936,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

	In the first quarter of 2017, an aggregate of 131,630 RSUs were granted to employees, which RSUs vest one-third a year over
	three years and had a grant date fair value of $18.67 per RSU. In the first quarter of 2016, an aggregate of 116,336 RSUs were granted to employees, which RSUs vest one-third a year over three years and had an average grant date fair value of $20.15
	per RSU.


	In each case, the grant date fair value was determined based on the closing stock price of the Companys
	common stock on the applicable date of grant and considers the impact of dividend payments. The awards granted to employees in 2017 and 2016 are treated as equity awards and the grant date fair value is charged to compensation expense at the
	corporate level on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Dividends are not paid or accrued on unvested employee RSUs.

	granted to non-employee directors (with an average grant date fair value of $22.25 and $23.73 per RSU, respectively) related to the equity component of their compensation. In each case, the grant date fair value was determined as of the last trading
	day of the quarter for which the RSUs were being received as compensation. The RSUs are immediately vested, but are not deliverable to the non-employee directors until six months after termination of their service as a director. Dividends are paid
	on RSUs granted to non-employee directors.




	Option and RSU Expense Information




	The Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of approximately $535,000 and $534,000, respectively, including $34,500 in
	each period related to non-employee director equity compensation, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to all stock options and RSUs accounted for as equity awards, as a component of general and
	administrative expenses in the statements of operations.

	Earnings Per Common Share







	Basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
	period. Diluted earnings per common share is based upon the increased number of common shares that would be outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive common share options and the consideration of restricted stock awards. The following table
	details the computation of earnings per common share, basic and diluted:

	thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.




	Organization and Business




	Reis, Inc. is a Maryland corporation. When we refer to Reis or the Company, we are referring to Reis, Inc. and its
	consolidated subsidiaries. The Company provides commercial real estate market information and analytical tools to real estate professionals, through its Reis Services subsidiary. For disclosure and financial reporting purposes, this business is
	referred to as the Reis Services segment.



	Reis Services



	Reis Services, including its predecessors, was founded in 1980. Reis maintains a proprietary database containing detailed information on
	commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S. The database contains information on apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing,
	student housing and affordable housing properties, and is used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess,
	quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. Reis currently provides its information services to many of the nations leading lending
	institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.




	Product Overview




	The Companys product portfolio features:

	Reis SE

	, its flagship delivery platform aimed at larger and mid-sized enterprises;

	ReisReports

	, aimed at prosumers and smaller enterprises; and

	Reis Portfolio CRE

	and other portfolio support products and services, aimed primarily at risk managers and credit administrators at banks and non-bank lending institutions.
	It is through these products that Reis provides online access to a proprietary database of commercial real estate information and analytical tools designed to facilitate debt and equity transactions as well as ongoing asset and portfolio
	evaluations. Depending on the product or level of entitlement, users have access to market trends and forecasts at metropolitan and neighborhood levels throughout the U.S. and/or detailed building-specific information such as rents, vacancy rates,
	lease terms, property sales, new construction listings and property valuation estimates. Reiss products are designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision making of property owners, developers,
	builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers. These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply,
	absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and construction.




	Proprietary Databases




	Reis
	develops and maintains three highly curated, proprietary databases which include information on (1) property performance, (2) new construction and (3) sales transactions. The significant characteristics of the Reis databases include:

	Reiss long-standing relationships with thousands of data sources, including building owners, property
	managers and agents, represent a unique and highly valuable asset that benefits from decades of investment. The Company is recognized by the industry and the business and trade press as the premier source of objective, timely and granular market
	information, a reputation attributable to two key factors: (1) Reis is viewed as independent as it does not compete as a broker in the listings space; and (2) Reis information is used by owners and managers in the underwriting, due
	diligence and marketing of properties, mortgages and real estate backed securities at both the single asset and portfolio levels.



	Property Performance
	Dababase



	Reis is continually expanding its property level and market coverage by geography and property type. In August 2016, Reis
	introduced coverage on its ninth property type, affordable housing, with information on 176 counties in 45 metropolitan areas and in February 2017, expanded coverage of this property type to include information on 256 counties in 110 metropolitan
	areas. In addition, in 2017, Reis expects to enhance its market reports in all sectors consistent with many of the enhancements made in March 2016 to its apartment market reports and in June 2016 to its office market reports. These enhancements
	include licensed photographs, sector-specific details, contact information, effective rent at the property level, sales transaction history, and numerous illustrative charts and graphs, all to fortify Reiss position as the preferred source for
	comparables information among all real estate professionals involved in buying, selling, leasing, or managing real estate assets. Reis expects to add similar details to property level reports in other sectors, while also introducing high level
	analytical modules that take a broader perspective across markets and geographies. Further development plans for 2017 include a module that will allow portfolio managers and C-level executives to look for market opportunities based on Reiss
	forecasts at the market and submarket level.


	Reiss core property performance database contains information on competitive,
	income-producing properties in the U.S. apartment, office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing sectors. On an ongoing basis, Reis surveys
	and receives data downloads from building owners, leasing agents and managers which include key building performance statistics including, among others: occupancy rates; rents; rent discounts and other concessions; tenant improvement allowances;
	lease terms; and operating expenses. In addition, Reis processes multiple data sources on commercial real estate, including: public filings databases; tax assessor records; deed transfers; planning boards; and numerous local, regional and
	national publications and commercial real estate websites. Reis screens and assembles large volumes of data into integrated supply and demand trends on a monthly basis at the neighborhood (submarket) and metropolitan market levels. All
	collected data are subjected to a rigorous quality assurance and validation process developed over many years. At the property level, surveyors compare the data collected in the current period with data previously collected on that property and
	similar properties. If any unusual changes in rents and vacancies are identified, follow-up procedures are performed for verification or clarification of the results. All aggregate market data at the submarket and market levels are also subjected to
	comprehensive quality controls.



	New Construction Database



	In addition to its core property database, Reis develops and maintains a new construction database that identifies and monitors projects that
	are being added to our covered markets. Detailed tracking of the supply side of the commercial real estate market is critical to projecting performance changes at the market and submarket levels. This database is updated weekly and reports relevant
	information such as project size, property type, location, status, and estimated completion dates for projects that are planned, proposed or under construction.

	Sales Transactions Database



	In September 2016, Reis expanded its commercial real estate sales transactions database including virtually all U.S. markets and property
	types, regardless of geography or sector. The new offering is expected to appeal to mortgage and property originators and underwriters, brokers and appraisers, and any other real estate professionals seeking the most comprehensive database of CRE
	transactions to source deals, search for related business, or conduct due diligence. Reiss sales transactions database includes key structural data points, including but not limited to address, land use code, parcel number, and lot size, in
	addition to key transactional data points, such as buyer and seller name, sale price, sale date, deed reference, and financing details when available, as well as other desirable datapoints and licensed photographs. In 2017, the Company expects to
	add land transactions to this database.




	Products and Services




	Reis has invested in a robust technology infrastructure to disseminate a number of market information products to meet the demands of a wide
	variety of commercial real estate professionals, from large financial institutions seeking an integrated commercial real estate portfolio management platform, to a single access user seeking local market intelligence. Reis is committed to
	consistently upgrading and expanding its product offering to reach new markets and new types of consumers of commercial real estate information.



	Reis SE




	Reis SE

	(or sometimes referred to as Reis Subscriber Edition), available at

	www.reis.com

	, is the Companys flagship product, designed to assist in market research, due diligence and support of commercial real estate transactions,
	including loan originations, underwriting, acquisitions, risk assessment (such as loan loss reserves and impairment analyses), portfolio monitoring, asset management and appraisal. Reports are retrievable by street address, property type (apartment,
	office, retail, warehouse/distribution, flex/research & development, self storage, seniors housing, student housing and affordable housing) or on the market/submarket level and are available as full color, presentation quality documents or

	Data Redistribution / Marketing Alliances



	The Company has established data redistribution agreements with information service providers as part of a strategy designed to raise brand
	awareness and generate sales leads for Reiss information and services. Over time, third party users may enter into agreements with Reis directly in order to gain access to the full suite of reports and analytical modules. The Companys
	data redistribution agreements are typically multi-year contracts in length, do not afford access to Reiss proprietary database and provide limited views of Reiss market data. Reis has also established marketing alliances to promote

	ReisReports

	to its alliance partners members through discounts, email outreach, website advertising and newsletter ads.

	2017 Revenue Performance



	Total revenue decreased by approximately $(698,000), or (5.4)%, from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017. Reiss
	performance for the first quarter of 2017 relative to the results for the first quarter of 2016 has been impacted by $1,200,000 of revenue from a significant custom data deliverable in the first quarter of 2016 which was not replicated in the 2017
	period, offset by the effects of an improving renewal rate and continuing strong new business.


	In order to provide insight into 2017 and
	2016 relative performance, we have disaggregated total revenue into two components: Subscription and Other. Other revenue specifically includes revenue related to contracts for one-time custom data deliverables and one-time
	fees for settlements of previous unauthorized usage of Reis data. The following tables present subscription revenue, other revenue and total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

	Subscription Revenue




	Subscription revenue increased by approximately $151,000, or 1.3% from the first quarter of 2016 to 2017. It also grew on a consecutive
	quarter basis by $240,000, or 2.1%. The two factors that have led to our modest subscription revenue growth to start 2017 included: (1) improvement in our trailing twelve month (TTM) renewal rates; and (2) continued strong new
	business.



	Renewal Rates

	 The Companys improving renewal rates over the last three consecutive quarters has been
	raising its TTM renewal rates. For the TTM ended March 31, 2017, the Companys base renewal rate (renewal rate, excluding price increases) was 83.4% and the renewal rate, including price increases, was 86.5%. These rates represent an
	improvement over the comparable rates as of December 31, 2016, at which time the Companys base renewal rate was 81.6% and the renewal rate, including price increases, was 85.7%. Reiss March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016
	TTM renewal rates continued to be negatively impacted by the cancellation of contracts, primarily in the second quarter of 2016, associated with Reiss intellectual property (IP) compliance initiatives, from customer losses from
	subscribers that exited the CRE business and from aggressive repricing on contract expirations. However, the Companys 93.7% quarterly renewal rate, including price increases, increased by 410 basis points during the 2017 first quarter.

	Table of Contents



	Many of the 2016 cancellations involved contracts which had prior long-term unauthorized access
	to Reis data and a substantial monetary settlement. As Reis worked through the renewal cycle of these older and more egregious cases of unauthorized usage, our renewal rates for these compliance accounts and overall renewal rates began to improve in
	the second half of 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017. On a going-forward basis, the prompt discovery of unauthorized usage allows for more satisfactory resolution, typically by having the non-compliant entity enter into a market-rate
	subscription and without requiring a monetary settlement and the attendant ill-will. Operationally, in the latter half of 2016, Reis allocated senior account management and customer service resources to work with these accounts. We believe that
	upgrading the onboarding and account management experience has contributed to improved renewal rates for these accounts and should continue to do so in the future. On a going-forward basis management believes that the reduction in compliance-related
	cancellations will help to restore our TTM renewal rates over time to be more in line with our historic levels.


	In addition to
	cancellations of IP infringement-related subscribers, other factors combined to exert downward pressure on our TTM renewal rates in 2016 which included: (1) customer losses from subscribers that exited the CRE business or were merger-related;
	and (2) Reiss aggressive stance on renewal pricing to ensure equitable alignment among subscribers as it relates to report consumption, number of users, property-type and geographic coverage, length of contract, and the associated
	subscription fee, among other factors.


	Aggressive repricing on contract expirations in the circumstances noted above also placed downward
	pressure on renewal rates during the first and second quarters of 2016. Although many firms were successfully repriced to levels consistent with their usage and value received, price increases did lead to instances of cancellation. As always,
	competition is a factor, both with respect to new accounts and renewals with existing subscribers. We believe that our two-pronged strategy of expanding our property types and geographic coverage and the addition of many more property records and
	granular property-level details has allowed Reis to consolidate its leadership position among vendors of CRE market data and analytics. This assessment is supported by the significant increase in win-backs we experienced in 2016 and in
	the first quarter of 2017, especially as contracts expired between former subscribers and competitive vendors and these firms had the opportunity to return to Reis without the expense associated with maintaining multiple vendors.


	As a result of these focused efforts on the improvement of our renewal rates in the second half of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, we
	have realized significant positive momentum. In the first quarter of 2017, the Companys base renewal rate rose to 91.3% and the renewal rate, including price increases, reached 93.7%; a positive and promising trend of quarter to quarter
	improvement. In contrast, during the second quarter of 2016, the Companys quarterly renewal rates hit their recent quarterly lows at a base renewal rate of 73.5% and a renewal rate, including price increases, of 77.4%. Quarterly renewal rates
	increased to a base renewal rate of 83.7% and a renewal rate, including price increases, of 89.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016.



	New
	Business

	 The first quarter of 2017 continued to build on the new business successes of the fourth quarter of 2016, with sales that were directly tied to recent product improvements including sales of affordable housing within our existing
	customer base, and wins associated with our expanded sales transaction database with investment sales brokers, property tax appeal firms and tax assessors.




	Other Revenue




	The Companys other revenue includes non-subscription revenue comprised of (1) non-subscription custom data deliverables and
	(2) one-time settlements.



	Custom Data Deliverables 

	The Company recognized significant revenue in the first quarter of
	2016 from a custom data deliverable for one of our existing

	Reis SE

	subscribers. The revenue recorded reflected the portion of the custom data files that was delivered in February 2016, positively impacting results for the first quarter of
	2016. Revenue related to this deliverable aggregated $1,200,000 in 2016 (all in the first quarter of 2016).


	In 2016 and through
	March 31, 2017, Reis did not replicate similar custom data sales. As we move forward into 2017, management hopes to be able to identify opportunities to sell custom data files, but structured as a subscription agreement with periodic quarterly
	updates in order to record revenue ratably, consistent with how the Company recognizes revenue for

	Reis SE

	.



	Intellectual
	Property Settlements



	


	Reis continues to successfully resolve cases in which our intellectual property rights have been violated. In 2015 and 2016, the Company was very active in protecting its intellectual property by
	pursuing firms and individuals who had previously gained unauthorized access to our services. The discovery of the instances of unauthorized usage creates opportunities for Reiss compliance team to engage in productive conversations with firms
	regarding ongoing access to Reis data in accordance with


	 


	23







	Table of Contents



	the terms and conditions of a subscription agreement. Reis has developed a programmatic approach to promptly resolving cases of unauthorized usage and is devoting significant client services and
	account management resources to increase the renewal rates of IP infringement related accounts to levels typical of all other Reis subscribers. As a result of these compliance procedures, the Company has been able to generate revenue through either
	one-time settlement payments or by signing up the non-complying firm or individual to an annual or multi-year

	Reis SE

	subscription.


	Revenue from one-time settlement payments aggregated $547,000 and $196,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively. Although identified instances of non-compliance remains steady, the frequency and dollar amount of one-time settlements can fluctuate each quarter. As our compliance team continues to identify instances of unauthorized access, the
	period of unauthorized usage is much shorter and report consumption is not as significant as cases that were settled in 2014 and 2015. Management believes that compliance resolutions will yield a continuing and significant volume of subscription
	contracts and recurring revenue for the foreseeable future.




	Other Items Affecting Revenue




	In order to increase the predictability of fees from our subscribers and Reiss own revenue and cash flow, we have made a concerted
	effort to encourage multi-year contracts when appropriate, with terms of two or three years, and in some cases, four years. At December 31, 2016, approximately 38% of our subscribers were in multi-year contracts. For multi-year contracts, the
	average life of multi-year contracts signed in each of the last three years was approximately 2.2 years. There are significant benefits, on a selective basis, of multi-year contracts, including locking in recurring subscription revenue for longer
	periods, thereby improving our renewal rates and increasing the predictability of future revenues. Operationally, multi-year contracts free up account management resources to focus on subscribers requiring a higher level of attention and upselling
	opportunities across our account base. Finally, multi-year deals also insulate us from competitive pressures and increase the likeliness that Reis data and analytics will become embedded in the work flow of our clients.


	In accordance with GAAP, our revenue recognition policy is to record revenue ratably over the life of a subscriber contract. Therefore any
	increases in the price of the subscription after the first year of a multi-year contract are considered in the total amount being straight-lined over the contract term. If a multi-year contract includes pricing steps on and after the first
	anniversary, there will be increasing cash flow from the contract, but no growth in revenue during the subsequent years under that contract. There has been, and in the future can be, resulting variability in our growth rates from having such a
	significant segment of our subscriber base under multi-year agreements.



	Deferred Revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract



	Two balance-sheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract. Analyzing these amounts can
	provide additional insight into Reis Servicess future financial performance. Deferred revenue, which is a GAAP basis accounting concept and is reported by the Company on the consolidated balance sheet, represents revenue from annual or longer
	term contracts for which we have billed and/or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue
	under non-cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis.


	Deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions, or in the case of future
	custom reports or projects, will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer, provided no significant Company obligations remain. At any given date, both deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract can be either
	positively or negatively influenced by: (1) the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed; (2) the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi-year; and (3) the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a
	multi-year contract, which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year. The following table reconciles deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A comparison of these
	balances at March 31 of each year is more meaningful than a comparison to the December 31, 2016 balances, as a greater percentage of renewals occur in the fourth quarter of each year and would distort the analysis.

	Included in Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at March 31, 2017 was approximately $33,331,000 related to
	amounts under contract for the forward twelve month period through March 31, 2018. The remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond March 31, 2018. The forward twelve month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract amount is approximately 71.2%
	of total revenue on a trailing twelve month basis at March 31, 2017 of approximately $46,832,000. For comparison purposes, at March 31, 2016, the forward twelve month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $31,486,000 and approximately 59.9%
	of total revenue.



	2017 Reis Services EBITDA, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income Performance



	Reis Services EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $3,289,000, a decrease of $(2,093,000), or (38.9)%, from the first
	quarter 2016 amount. The decrease was primarily derived from the decrease in revenue of $(698,000), as described above, and an increase in operating expenses for the Reis Services segment of $1,395,000, an increase of 18.7% in the first quarter of
	2017 over the 2016 comparable period. The Reis Services EBITDA margin of 27.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was lower than the reported Reis Services EBITDA margin of 42.0% in the 2016 comparable period. See  Results of
	Operations for a discussion of the variances for specific expenses.


	Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 was $2,588,000, a decrease of $(2,041,000) or (44.1)%, from the first quarter 2016 amount. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA reflects the revenue and Reis Services EBITDA decreases discussed above. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA
	margin was 21.3% for the first quarter of 2017.


	Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $535,000, a decrease of
	$(1,069,000), or (66.6)%, from the first quarter 2016 reported net income of $1,604,000. This decrease reflects the revenue decrease of $(698,000), operating expense increases of $1,344,000, the effects of increased amortization expense in 2017 in
	connection with database and website investments of $294,000, as well as from increased depreciation expense from the build out and furnishing of our new corporate headquarters which was completed in October 2016 of $123,000 and an increase in other
	expenses of $19,000, offset by the decrease in the consolidated tax provision of $1,409,000 due to the recognition of a windfall tax benefit on stock options exercised in the 2017 first quarter.


	The Company continues to make significant investments in our business, including our core

	Reis SE

	platform and in our portfolio
	analytics offering. As a result of these initiatives, our employment related costs increased throughout 2016 across all departments including strategic hires in sales and operations. The pace of our database and website enhancements accelerated in
	2016 and into 2017. Management believes that the investments it has made in 2016, and is continuing to make in 2017, will further the differentiation between Reis and other U.S. commercial real estate market information providers.




	Reconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA




	We define EBITDA as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before
	interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock based compensation. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, senior management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure
	operational and management performance. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported GAAP basis financial information which may assist investors in
	evaluating and understanding: (1) the performance of the Reis Services segment, the primary business of the Company and (2) the Companys consolidated results, from year to year or period to period, as applicable. Further, these
	measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as other non-operating items, such as interest income, interest expense
	and income taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, isolates non-cash charges for stock based compensation. Management also believes that disclosing


	 


	25







	Table of Contents



	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector. However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance
	with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented both for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis. We believe that these metrics,
	for Reis Services, provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core Reis Services business, excluding public company costs, and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand-alone
	business to a potential acquirer. Management primarily monitors and measures its performance, and is compensated, based on the results of the Reis Services segment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, allow the reader to
	make assessments about the current trading value of the Companys common stock, including expenses related to operating as a public company. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net
	income (loss), operating income, or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, follow
	for each identified period on a segment basis (including the Reis Services segment), as well as on a consolidated basis:

	Results of Operations





	Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016



	Total revenue and related cost of sales were approximately $12,126,000 and $3,366,000, respectively, for the three months ended March 31,
	2017, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $8,760,000. Amortization expense included in cost of sales (for the database intangible asset) was approximately $872,000 during this period. Total revenue and
	related cost of sales were approximately $12,824,000 and $2,462,000, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which resulted in a gross profit for the Reis Services segment of approximately $10,362,000. Amortization expense
	included in cost of sales was approximately $612,000 during this period. See  Critical Business Metrics of the Reis Services Business for a discussion of the variances and trends in revenue and EBITDA. The increase in cost of sales
	of $904,000 resulted from greater employment related costs, specifically from hiring during 2016 and 2017, coupled with compensation increases and higher benefit costs than in the 2016 period of $644,000 and a $260,000 increase in amortization
	expense for database costs.

	Sales and marketing expenses were approximately $3,328,000 and $2,668,000 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in sales and marketing expenses (for the customer relationships intangible asset) was approximately $231,000
	and $235,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing expenses between the two periods of approximately $660,000 resulted from increases in employment related costs due to
	additional headcount related to hiring in sales management, sales enablement and marketing in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, coupled with compensation increases and higher benefit costs than in the 2016 period.


	Product development expenses were approximately $1,167,000 and $1,005,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively, and solely represented costs of the Reis Services segment. Amortization expense included in product development expenses (for the website intangible asset) was approximately $570,000 and $456,000 during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Product development costs increased $162,000, primarily due to increased amortization expense of $114,000 and increased employment related costs of $48,000 from hiring during 2016, coupled with
	compensation increases and higher benefit costs than in the 2016 period.


	General and administrative expenses of approximately $4,120,000
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included current period expenses of approximately $3,350,000, depreciation expense of approximately $235,000 for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and approximately $535,000 of net non-cash
	compensation expense. The net non-cash compensation expense was comprised of equity awards for employees and directors. General and administrative expenses of approximately $4,085,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 included current
	period expenses of approximately $3,363,000, approximately $75,000 for the lease value intangible asset amortization (which fully amortized in 2016) and furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation of $113,000, and approximately $534,000 of net
	non-cash compensation expense. Excluding the non-cash expenses, the net decrease in general and administrative expenses of $(13,000) was primarily the result of decreased legal and other professional fees, offset by increased occupancy related costs
	from office space expansion and increased employment related costs in the 2017 period. The increase in depreciation expense of $122,000 in the first quarter 2017 over the corresponding 2016 period is a result of the build out and furnishing of our
	new corporate headquarters which was completed in October 2016.


	Interest expense of $33,000 and $21,000 during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was comprised of unused facility fees and deferred financing cost amortization on the Companys revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the Revolver. There was no outstanding balance on the
	Revolver during the three months ended March 31, 2017 or 2016.


	The income tax benefit of $422,000 during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 reflected a deferred Federal tax benefit of $473,000 and a deferred state and local tax benefit of $140,000, offset by current Federal AMT expense of $19,000 and $172,000 of current state and local tax expense. The income tax
	benefit resulted from the recognition of a windfall tax benefit on stock options exercised in the 2017 first quarter. Income tax expense of $987,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 reflected deferred Federal tax expense of
	$811,000, deferred state and local tax expense of $53,000, current Federal AMT expense of $62,000 and current state and local tax expense of $61,000.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	The core Reis Services business has traditionally generated significant cash annually; and we expect it to continue to do so. Our
	consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance aggregated approximately $21,536,000 at March 31, 2017, an increase of $45,000 from the December 31, 2016 balance of approximately $21,491,000. The Company had cash flows provided by its
	operating activities of $3,449,000, and the Company received $2,626,000 in proceeds associated with the exercise of 252,500 options in the period. The Companys cash uses in the first quarter of 2017 included: (1) making investments in its
	websites and databases of $2,129,000, (2) spending on tenant improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment associated with the new office spaces of approximately $423,000, (3) paying aggregate dividends of approximately $1,971,000 and
	(4) repurchasing 78,440 shares of the Companys common stock in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,507,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	At March 31, 2017, the Companys short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include: current operating and capitalizable costs,
	including accounts payable and other accrued expenses; near-term product development and enhancement of the website and databases either through building with Company resources or through acquisitions; operating leases; growth in operating expenses,

	Table of Contents



	including a further increase in the number of Reis employees and additional resources devoted to our sales and marketing efforts; other costs, including public company expenses not included in
	the Reis Services segment; any open invoices for tenant improvements and related spending for new corporate headquarters space; the resolution of open tax years with state and local tax authorities; payment of employee taxes on vested equity awards,
	for which the employee uses shares to settle his/her minimum withholding tax obligations with the Company; the use of cash for the payment of quarterly dividends; and repurchases of shares of Reis common stock (at March 31, 2017, approximately
	$2,349,000 remained available to be purchased under our current share purchase authorization). The Company expects to meet these short-term and long-term liquidity requirements generally through the use of available cash and cash generated from
	subscription revenue of Reis Services and, if necessary, with borrowings under the Revolver, and/or proceeds from the sale of Reis stock.


	The Company has a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires in January 2019. For additional information regarding the Revolver, see
	Note 5 to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this filing.


	In June 2015, the Companys shelf
	registration statement on Form S-3 was declared effective. The shelf registration statement permits the offering, issuance and sale of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $75,000,000 of the Companys stock from time to time for three
	years. Any determinations about the issuance of new common shares will be at the discretion of the Companys Board and the use of proceeds, unless otherwise indicated, will be for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital,
	capital expenditures or acquisitions. Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds. The Company has no immediate plans to issue shares under the shelf registration statement.


	The Company has NOLs that it expects to utilize against future Federal, state and local taxable income. The use of certain NOLs for New York
	State and New York City purposes will be subject to an annual limitation and, therefore, any taxable income in excess of the limitation will be subject to tax. Tax payments related to 2017 are expected to be for state and local taxes based on
	income, in excess of limitation amounts, Federal AMT, and tax on capital.


	In the future, the Company may determine to use its cash to:
	(1) acquire or invest in other databases or information companies that have logical adjacencies or complementary products or services; (2) repurchase additional shares of Reis common stock; or (3) pay a special dividend, or increase
	its recurring quarterly dividend. There can be no assurance that the Company will use its cash for any of these purposes during 2017, or thereafter.




	Issuer Purchases and Equity Securities




	On August 30, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of shares of the Companys common stock up
	to an aggregate of $5,000,000. Purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Depending on market conditions, financial developments and other factors, these purchases may
	be commenced or suspended at any time, or from time to time, without prior notice and may be expanded without prior notice. The Company may make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, permitting open market
	purchases of common stock during blackout periods consistent with the Companys Policies for Transactions in Reis Stock and Insider Trading and Tipping.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company purchased an aggregate of 78,440 shares of common stock, at an average price of
	$19.21 per share, leaving approximately $2,349,000 at March 31, 2017 that may be used to purchase additional shares under the program. Cumulatively, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 132,616 shares of common stock, or approximately 1.2%
	of the common shares outstanding at the time of the Boards initial authorization on August 30, 2016. No repurchases were made prior to August 30, 2016 during 2016.

	Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $(2,626,000) from $6,075,000 provided in the
	2016 period to $3,449,000 provided in the 2017 period. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of collections for outstanding receivables.


	Cash used in investing activities decreased by $(452,000) from $3,004,000 used in the 2016 period to $2,552,000 used in the 2017 period. This
	change resulted from a $417,000 decrease in purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment in the 2017 period, coupled with a $(35,000) decrease of cash used in the 2017 period as compared to the 2016 period for website and database development
	costs for continuing product development initiatives. The expectation for the remainder of 2017 is that cash used for website and database development will exceed amounts capitalized in 2016.


	Net cash used in financing activities were approximately $852,000 and $2,818,000 in the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively. The 2017 period
	includes approximately $1,971,000 for dividends declared and paid in the first quarter of 2017 and stock repurchases aggregating $1,507,000, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options by Reis employees aggregating $2,626,000. The 2016
	period includes cash uses of approximately $1,936,000 for dividends declared and paid in the first quarter of 2016, $701,000 used to settle minimum employee withholding tax obligations on vested RSUs and $181,000 of deferred financing costs related
	to the expansion and extension of the Revolver in that period.

	year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2017.





	You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report on
	Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect any events or circumstances after the date of this quarterly report on
	Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.








	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
	Disclosures about Market Risk.



	The Companys primary market risk exposure has been to changes in interest rates. This risk may
	be managed by limiting the Companys financing exposures, to the extent possible, by purchasing interest rate caps when deemed appropriate.


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Companys only potential exposure to interest rates was on variable rate based
	debt. This exposure has historically been minimized through the use of interest rate caps. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and throughout 2016, the Company did not have any interest rate caps. No debt was outstanding at
	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For more information about the Companys debt, see Note 5 to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this filing.


	Reis holds cash and cash equivalents at various regional and national banking institutions. Management monitors the institutions that hold our
	cash and cash equivalents. Managements emphasis is primarily on safety of principal. Management, in its discretion, has diversified Reiss cash and cash equivalents among banking institutions to potentially minimize exposure to any one of
	these entities. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in
	the financial markets.


	Cash balances held at banking institutions with which we do business generally exceed the Federal Deposit
	Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While management monitors the cash balances in these bank accounts, such cash balances could be impacted if the underlying banks fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.








	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	As of March 31, 2017, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017 were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
	management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	There has been no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report that has
	materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

	As disclosed in Note 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this filing, the Company is not a party to any

	A wide range of risks may affect our business and financial results, now and in the future; however, we consider the risks described under
	Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on March 9, 2017, to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable
	economic, business, competitive, governmental or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our business or future results. See Part I. Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

	On August 30, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of shares of the Companys common stock up
	to an aggregate of $5,000,000. Purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Depending on market conditions, financial developments and other factors, these purchases may
	be commenced or suspended at any time, or from time to time, without prior notice and may be expanded without prior notice. The Company may make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1, permitting open market
	purchases of common stock during blackout periods consistent with the Companys Policies for Transactions in Reis Stock and Insider Trading and Tipping.

Our Research and Analytics
Reis Data Powers the Commercial Real Estate Industry
At every stage of the commercial real estate transaction lifecycle, and for every job function within the industry, Reis brings deal flow efficiency and transparency, guiding all parties to a common understanding of market conditions and, ultimately, property valuations.









The Reis Database
Underlying all of Reis’s analytical modules and reports is the nation’s most carefully developed, most diligently maintained commercial real estate database—a database in which properties are precisely categorized into subtypes most relevant to investors, plotted into logical submarkets, and rolled up to support clean, reliable trends and forecasts.
On an ongoing basis, Reis’s analysts survey property owners and managers to record key performance indicators, such as vacancy levels, rental rates, and concession package details. Reis's dynamic property-level updates allow refreshed data to flow through to rent comparables reports in real time. However, unlike other commercial real estate research services that tout their reliance upon online apartment listings services' advertisements as the basis for their "real time" data alterations, Reis subjects its real time updates to time-tested quality control procedures. In addition, to ensure full coverage of sales transactions and new construction projects, we scour public filings, such as tax assessor records, deed transfers, and numerous local, regional and national publications.
Quality Assurance
All findings are subjected to rigorous quality assurance and validation processes developed over many years. For example, if a survey at the property level reveals an unusual change in rent or vacancy since we last spoke to the owner or manager, follow-up procedures are performed to verify or correct results before publication. All aggregate market data at the submarket and market levels are also subjected to comprehensive quality controls.
A Trusted Source
Reis provides a curated view of the commercial real estate markets.  Our rigorous, uniformly applied research methodology, relentless product development, and top-notch customer service have made Reis the industry standard source, trusted by the nation's most respected financial institutions to provide accurate information on properties, submarkets, and metros.

Relative Strength Alert For Reis
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Reis, Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Oversold Conditions For Reis
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

As sales have dropped off, due to market saturation, they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process. This is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls, and the results haven't met expectations. Unfortunately, these efforts have been less than successful, and have created unintended consequences with a mass exodus of sales talent leaving the company, either by choice, or termination. Morale is at an all time low, with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible, as the damage created is irreparable.Advice to ManagementSeek advice from your employees. So many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most. It's so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce. Restoring that sense of pride and loyalty should begin with an executive management self assessment, and honest apologies to staff for the environment toxicity. Honestly may be difficult, but it is respected over continual excuses and blame.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-15 17:51 PDT Jul 26, 2017 Helpful (5)"Needs Innovation and Leadership!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYFormer Employee - Sales in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Reis full-timeProsNew Offices in NYC are a nice upgrade from former location. Solid collection of historical CRE data that could be the foundation for solid company growth if an executive team were to be brought in that had the ability to lead, innovate and motivate its employees.ConsAll of the Executive Leadership of the company have no presence in the industry, completely lack leadership skills, offer no strategic vision (they consider minor, long overdue, product upgrades to be revolutionary new products), and worst of all encourage a gossipy, dreary, infighting environment rather than one of team work and high motivation. They prefer to sit in their offices rather than attend industry events, engage their customers and prospects, and believe they are above listening to their employees. Rather than admit to their continual string of errors and lack of innovation, they choose to blame the employees for their ongoing failures.Advice to ManagementMy advice would be for the founding partners - your loyalty to your executive team is admirable but if you want growth it is time for change. You have made numerous changes to your organization, both individual contributors and middle management, to no avail - at some point your executive team must be accountable rather than passing the buck to those below them. You need executive leadership that can innovate and one that your employees will respect and follow!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-26 17:58 PDT Jun 16, 2017 Helpful (1)"Great place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis (More than a year)ProsIf you work hard and show that you have a willingness to learn, you will get noticed and be compensated for it.

In fact, management is completely unhelpful and overall employee morale is at an all-time low. Reis cares more about quantity over quality and does not instill any positive reinforcement into their employees. Not quite sure how they sustain a business model in which the actual product they are providing clients has little to do with quality, depth or accuracy. At Reis we are quite literally told to not take our times on our work but instead to rush so we can complete more. Did I mention our performance is based solely on the #amount rather than any other factor? Doesn't make for a very accomplished feeling. Also, the positive reviews on this site are from Management who monitors this and makes sure to negate any true review like the one you are reading with a very untrue inaccurate review. Employees are underpaid, undervalued, and bored. I wouldn't wish this job on anyone.Advice to ManagementLearn how to actually manage because as a manager you are only as good as the employees you are responsible for. If we are all equally miserable, the problem starts with you.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-06-19 11:20 PDT Apr 25, 2017 Helpful (2)"Great Company To Work For!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis full-time (Less than a year)ProsI have nothing but great things to say about working at Reis.
