athenahealth, Inc. is a publicly traded American company that provides cloud-based services for health care and point-of-care mobile apps. The company was founded in 1997 in San Diego, California. athenahealth is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts, with operational sites in Belfast, Maine; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; and Chennai, India, and Bangalore, India.[1]
History[edit]
In 1997, athenahealth cofounders Jonathan Bush and Todd Park started Athena Women's Health, a women's health and birthing practice in San Diego, California. The practice encountered problems being reimbursed by payers. Lacking a system to track insurance claims, Bush and Park formed athenahealth, Inc. to develop a practice management system.[2] Todd's brother, software developer Ed Park, helped to develop a revenue cycle management system with a "rules engine" of dynamic billing rules data. In 2000, athenahealth introduced athenaCollector, its cloud-based revenue cycle and practice management service.[3]
In 2006, the company launched athenaClinicals, reported as the "first economically sustainable, service-based" electronic medical records (EMR) system.[4] athenahealth, Inc. announced an initial public offering of its common stock on June 22, 2007.[5] The offering was completed on September 20, 2007, at a price of $18 per share. It trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ATHN.[6]
In 2008, athenahealth introduced athenaCommunicator to manage phone calls.[7] Since then, the product has evolved into a suite of "patient engagement services", including a patient portal, population health campaign tool, scheduling solution, and answering service. athenahealth purchased Anodyne Health in 2009.[8] The Anodyne Health services were incorporated into athenaCoordinator Analytics, an analytics service for medical groups and health systems.
athenahealth's More Disruption Please program was launched in 2011. The initiative is both a partner program and an incubator environment for independent companies to develop products and services connected to athenahealth's ecosystem.[9]
In 2011, athenahealth purchased Proxsys, LLC, a care coordination company, and launched athenaCoordinator (now athenaCoordinator Core) for order transmission and care collaboration with secure text message.[10] In 2012, the company purchased Healthcare Data Services, a population health management company.[11] The company launched athenaCoordinator Enterprise (now athena Population Health) in 2014 to design end-to-end care coordination and population health service for enterprises.
In 2013, the company purchased the Epocrates mobile brand.[12] Epocrates is now an athenahealth service for clinical decision support in the moments of care.
On January 14, 2015, athenahealth announced the acquisition of RazorInsights, a "leader in cloud-based EHR and financial solutions" for rural, critical access, and community hospitals. The purchase extended athenahealth’s established position in the outpatient market into the 50-bed and under inpatient care environment, which makes up nearly one third of the hospital market.[13] In February 2015, athenahealth announced that it had purchased webOMR, the web-based clinical applications and EHR platform developed by Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. athenahealth collaborated with BIDMC on the development of athenahealth's acute care service offering, using Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham, a 58-bed community hospital, as the alpha development site.[14]
athenahealth was named 2015/2016 Best in KLAS for mid-sized ambulatory EMR software.[15]
