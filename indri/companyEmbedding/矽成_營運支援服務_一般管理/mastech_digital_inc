(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 25, 2016.  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about future events, future performance, plans, strategies, expectations, prospects, competitive environment and regulations.  Website Access to SEC Reports:  The Company's website is www.mastechdigital.com. The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, current reports on Form 8-K and all other reports filed with the SEC, are available free of charge on the Investor Relations page. The website is updated as soon as reasonably practical after such reports are filed electronically with the SEC.  Recent Developments:  On September 12, 2016, the Company announced that it changed its name to Mastech Digital, Inc. The name change was part of the Company's rebranding initiative that reflects its ongoing transformation into a digital technologies company. The rebranding also included a change in the Company's logo and a refreshed corporate website. The effective date of the name change with the NYSE MKT was September 15, 2016. The ticker symbol "MHH" for its common stock listing remained the same.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:  The Company's significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are described in Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes to these critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Overview:  We are a domestic provider of IT staffing and digital transformation services to mostly large and medium-sized organizations. The Company's IT staffing services span across digital and mainstream technologies while its digital transformation services include Salesforce.com, SAP HANA and Digital Learning services. We do not sell, lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware, and 100% of our revenue is derived from the sale of IT staffing and digital transformation services.  Our IT service business combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services within business intelligence / data warehousing; service oriented architecture; web services; enterprise resource planning & customer resource management; e-Business solutions; mobile applications; data management and analytics; and the implementation and support for cloud-based applications. We provide our services across various industry verticals including: automotive; consumer products; education; financial services; government; healthcare; manufacturing; retail; technology; telecommunications; transportation; and utilities.  We have one operating segment. Thus, no segment related disclosures are presented. We do, however, track and evaluate our revenues and gross profits by three distinct sales channels: wholesale; retail; and permanent placements / fees. Our wholesale channel  Table of Contents  consists of system integrators and other staffing firms with a need to supplement their abilities to attract highly-qualified temporary technical computer personnel. Our retail channel focuses on clients that are end-users of IT staffing services. Within the retail channel are end-user clients that have retained a third party to provide vendor management services, commonly known in the industry as Managed Service Providers ("MSP"). Our digital transformation services offerings are sold to clients within both the wholesale and retail sales channels. While we have the ability to deliver our digital transformation services on a managed solutions basis, essentially all of our assignments to date have been delivered as staffing engagements. Permanent placement / fee revenues are incidental revenues derived as by-product opportunities of conducting our core contract staffing business.  Economic Trends and Outlook:  Generally, our business outlook is highly correlated to general U.S. economic conditions. During periods of increasing employment and economic expansion, demand for our services tends to increase. Conversely, during periods of contracting employment and / or a slowing domestic economy, demand for our services tends to decline. As the economy slowed during the second half of 2007 and recessionary conditions emerged in 2008 and during much of 2009, we experienced less demand for our staffing services. During the second half of 2009, we began to see signs of market stabilization and a modest pick-up in activity levels within certain sales channels and technologies. In 2010, market conditions continued to strengthen over the course of the year and activity levels within most of our sales channels progressively improved. In 2011 and 2012, activity levels continued to trend up in most technologies and sales channels. During 2013, 2014 and 2015, we continued to see a steady flow of solid activity in our contract staffing business; however, tightness in the supply side (skilled IT professionals) of our business in 2014 and 2015 negatively impacted our new assignment successes. Solid activity levels continued during the nine months of 2016. However, recruitment challenges remain due to the tightness in supply of skilled IT professionals.  In addition to tracking general U.S. economic conditions, a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients. Accordingly, our trends and outlook are impacted by the prospects and well-being of these specific clients. This "account concentration" factor may cause our results of operations to deviate from the prevailing U.S. economic trends from time to time.  In recent years, a larger portion of our revenues have come from our wholesale sales channel, which consists largely of strategic relationships with systems integrators and other staffing organizations. This channel tends to carry lower gross margins, but provides higher volume opportunities. This trend in our business mix has impacted overall gross margins during the past several years. The acquisition of Hudson IT in June 2015 has increased our retail revenues and materially improved the balance of our business mix between the retail and wholesale channels.  Within our retail sales channel, many larger users of IT staffing services are employing MSPs to manage their contractor spending in an effort to drive down overall costs. This trend towards utilizing the MSP model may pressure gross margins in the future.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015:  Revenues:  Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $34.3 million compared to $34.6 million in the corresponding three month period of 2015. Our small revenue decline from a year earlier was due to a modest decline of consultants on billing, partially offset by a slightly higher average bill rate in the 2016 period. The consultants on billing decrease reflected the net impact of an increase of 38-consultants during the first nine months of 2016, and a 47-consultant decline during the fourth quarter of 2015. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016 our billable consultant headcount totaled 884 consultants compared to 893 consultants, one-year earlier. Our average bill rate in the third quarter of 2016 was up to $75.15/hour compared to $74.87/hour in the corresponding quarter of 2015.  Below is a tabular presentation of revenues by sales channel for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:   Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Revenues (Amounts in millions) September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Wholesale Channel $ 20.4 $ 21.0 Retail Channel 13.8 13.4 Permanent Placements / Fees 0.1 0.2 Total revenues $ 34.3 $ 34.6  Table of Contents  Revenues from our wholesale channel decreased approximately 3% during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period. Lower revenues from both our integrator clients (down 4%) and staffing clients (down 2%) were responsible for this revenue variance. A slightly lower new assignment win ratio due to a tighter supply of available skilled IT professionals in the marketplace and fewer project opportunities from our integrator partners negatively impacted our revenue performance in this channel. Retail channel revenues increased 3% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the period one-year earlier. Higher revenues from end-user clients were largely offset by lower revenues from MSP clients. The lower new assignment win ratio mentioned above has keenly impacted our revenue performance at several larger MSP accounts. Permanent placement / fee revenues were approximately $0.1 million lower in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had one client that exceeded 10% of total revenues (CGI = 11.0%). For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had no clients that exceeded 10% of total revenues.  The Company's top ten clients represented approximately 45% and 47% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Gross Margin:  Gross profits in the third quarter of 2016 totaled $6.9 million, which was in line with the $6.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 20.1% for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to 19.9% during the same period of 2015. This 20-basis point improvement largely reflected higher margins on new assignments over the last several quarters.  Below is a tabular presentation of gross margin by sales channel for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:   Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Gross Margin September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Wholesale Channel 18.1 % 17.5 % Retail Channel 22.6 22.8 Permanent Placements / Fees 100.0 100.0 Total gross margin 20.1 % 19.9 %  Wholesale channel gross margins increased by 60 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. Higher margins on new assignments were responsible for this overall margin improvement. Retail gross margins were down 20 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period and largely reflected tighter margins on new assignments at several of our larger MPS clients over the past several quarters.  Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses:  SG&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $5.3 million or 15.5% of total revenues, compared to $5.4 million or 15.5% of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Fluctuations within SG&A expense components during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015, included the following:   Sales expense in the 2016 period was flat when compared to 2015.   Recruiting expense in the 2016 period was flat when compared to 2015.   General and administrative expense in 2016 was down $0.1 million from a year earlier and reflected lower travel expenses in the 2016 period when compared to 2015.  Other Income / (Expense) Components:  Other Income / (Expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of interest expense of $116,000 and foreign exchange losses of $4,000. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, Other Income / (Expense) consisted of interest expense of $125,000 and foreign exchange gains of $1,000. The decline in interest expense was due to lower outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the 2015 period.  Table of Contents  Income Tax Expense:  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $550,000, representing an effective tax rate on pre-tax income of 37.3%, compared to $512,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which represented a 36.6% effective tax rate on pre-tax income. A higher aggregate state tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was largely responsible for the higher effective tax rate.  Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015:  Revenues:  Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $99.6 million compared to $90.9 million for the corresponding nine month period in 2015. This 10% year-over-year revenue increase largely reflected the June 2015 acquisition of Hudson IT. Organically, revenues declined by 6% and largely reflected a lower number of billable consultants on assignments.  Below is a tabular presentation of revenues by sales channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:   Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended Revenues (Amounts in millions) September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Wholesale Channel $ 59.4 $ 63.4 Retail Channel 40.0 27.2 Permanent Placements / Fees 0.2 0.3 Total revenues $ 99.6 $ 90.9  Revenues from our wholesale channel decreased approximately 6% in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period. Lower revenues from our integrator clients (down 12%) reflected a lower new assignment win ratio and fewer project opportunities from our integrator partners. Revenues from our IT staffing clients were flat in the 2016 period compared to 2015. Retail channel revenues increased 47% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the period one-year earlier. The Hudson IT acquisition was responsible for the entire improvement. Permanent placement / fee revenues were approximately $0.1 million higher in the 2015 period when compared to the first nine months of 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no clients that exceeded 10% of total revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had one client that exceeded 10% of total revenues (Accenture = 11.8%).  The Company's top ten clients represented approximately 44% and 52% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Gross Margin:  Gross profits during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $19.9 million, or approximately $2.8 million higher than during the first nine months of 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 20.0% for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to 18.8% during the same period of 2015. Approximately 80-basis points of this improvement reflected higher margins on new assignments over the last several quarters and approximately 40-basis points reflected a favorable mix of channel revenues (a higher level of retail clients) due to the Hudson IT acquisition.  Below is a tabular presentation of gross margin by sales channel for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:   Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended Gross Margin September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Wholesale Channel 17.7 % 17.0 % Retail Channel 22.8 22.0 Permanent Placements / Fees 100.0 100.0 Total gross margin 20.0 % 18.8 %  Table of Contents  Wholesale channel gross margins increased by 70 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the 2015 period. Higher margins on new assignments were responsible for this overall margin improvement. Retail gross margins were up 80 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding 2015 period and largely reflected the impact of the Hudson IT acquisition and some margin improvement on new assignments in 2016.  Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses:  SG&A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $16.5 million or 16.6% of total revenues, compared to $14.6 million or 16.1% of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding severance costs incurred in the 2016 period of $0.8 million and excluding severance costs and acquisition transaction expenses incurred in the 2015 period of $0.9 million, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues would have been 15.8% and 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues was largely due to the consolidation of Hudson IT, which employs a branch model that has an operating costs structure that is higher than Mastech Digital's centralized business model. In the 2015 period, these expenses were included in our financial results effective June 15th and for the 2016 period these expenses were included for the entire nine-month period.  Fluctuations within SG&A expense components during the first nine months of 2016, compared to the nine months of 2015, included the following:   Sales expense increased by $1.0 million in the 2016 period compared to 2015, of which essentially the entire variance was attributable to the acquisition of Hudson IT.   Recruiting expense increased by $0.6 million in the 2016 period compared to 2015, of which essentially the entire variance was attributable to the acquisition of Hudson IT.   General and administrative expense in 2016 increased by $0.3 million from a year earlier. The year-over-year increase was due to $0.5 million of higher severance cost and $0.4 million of higher amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets of Hudson IT in the 2016 period, partially offset by $0.6 million of acquisition transaction expenses incurred in the 2015 period.  Other Income / (Expense) Components:  Other Income / (Expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of interest expense of $353,000 and foreign exchange losses of $24,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Other Income / (Expense) consisted of interest expense of $172,000 and foreign exchange gains of $33,000. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average outstanding borrowings in the first nine months of 2016 reflective of debt financing of the Hudson IT acquisition in June 2015.  Income Tax Expense:  Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1.1 million, representing an effective tax rate on pre-tax income of 37.7%, compared to $867,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which represented a 37.2% effective tax rate on pre-tax income. A higher aggregate state tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was responsible for the higher effective tax rate.  Liquidity and Capital Resources:  Financial Conditions and Liquidity:  At September 30, 2016, we had bank debt, net of cash balances on hand, of $15.3 million and $7.7 million of borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility.  Historically, we have funded our business needs with cash generated from operating activities. Controlling our operating working capital levels by closely managing our accounts receivable balance is an important element of cash generation. At September 30, 2016, our accounts receivable "days sales outstanding" ("DSOs") measurement improved to 58-days from 59-days a quarter earlier.  We believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash balances on hand and current availability under our credit facility should be adequate to fund our business needs and debt service obligations over the next twelve months, exclusive of any potential acquisition activity.  Table of Contents  Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities:  Cash (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled ($3.7 million) compared to cash (used in) operating activities of ($1.0 million) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Elements of cash flows in the 2016 period were net income of $1.9 million, non-cash charges of $1.2 million, and an increase in operating working capital levels of ($6.8 million). During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, elements of cash flows were net income of $1.5 million, non-cash charges of $0.7 million and an increase in operating working capital levels of ($3.2 million). The operating working capital increases in 2016 reflected amended payment terms on several major clients and higher operating working capital levels in support of 2016 revenue growth. The operating working capital increase in 2015 was applicable to our acquisition of Hudson IT.  Cash flows used in investing activities:  Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $67,000 compared to $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In 2016, capital expenditures essentially accounted for our total cash needs. In 2015, cash used in investing activities consisted of $17.0 million to complete our acquisition of Hudson IT and $0.1 million for capital expenditures.  Cash flows provided by financing activities:  Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $3.7 million and consisted of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $4.9 million and cash generated from stock option activities of $0.2 million, partially offset by debt payments on our term loan of ($1.4 million). Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $16.2 million and largely consisted of an increase in bank debt of $16.3 million to finance our Hudson IT acquisition. Cash (used in) financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the purchase of treasury shares of ($0.2 million) and the payment of deferred financing expenses of ($0.1 million), partially offset by cash generated from stock options / restricted share activities of $0.2 million.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Inflation:  We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seeking to ensure that billing rates are adjusted periodically to reflect increases in costs due to inflation.  Seasonality:  Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants' billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation policies. Accordingly, we generally have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter. Additionally, assignment completions tend to be higher near the end of the calendar year, which largely impacts our revenue and gross profit performance during the subsequent quarter.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards:  Recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements.  Nov 10, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

PITTSBURGH, Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mastech Digital, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MHH), a national provider of Information Technology staffing and Digital Transformation services, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. 








Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights:

Revenues totaled $32.4 million, in-line with revenues of $32.5 million in the 2015 fourth quarter; 
Billable consultants at year-end 2016 totaled 881 or approximately 4% higher than at December 31, 2015; 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.14 versus $0.29 in the 2015 fourth quarter; 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.19 versus $0.31 in the 2015 fourth quarter.

Fourth Quarter Results:Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $32.4 million compared to $32.5 million during the corresponding quarter last year.  Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $6.4 million, compared to $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $640,000 or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $1.3 million or $0.29 per diluted share during the same period last year.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $841,000 or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
Demand for the Company's staffing services was in-line with the third quarter of 2016 and largely offset a higher level of assignment ends historically expected during the fourth quarter. This resulted in the Company's billable consultant-base being essentially unchanged from the previous quarter. 
Commenting on the Company's 2016 fourth quarter results, Vivek Gupta, Mastech Digital's Chief Executive Officer stated, "While our fourth quarter operating results were challenged on a year-over-year basis, due in part to several favorable cost adjustments in the 2015 quarter and increased investment in our business, I was pleased with our consultants-on-billing performance and the continued progress with respect to our digital transformation efforts.  With investments made in 2016 to enhance both our sales and recruitment capabilities, I'm confident in our abilities to accelerate growth in 2017." 
Full Year Results:Revenues for the full year 2016 totaled $132.0 million compared to $123.5 million in 2015.  Our top-line growth largely reflected our June 15, 2015 acquisition of Hudson IT.  Gross profit for 2016 totaled $26.3 million or 19.9% of total revenues, compared to $23.8 million or 19.3% of total revenues in 2015.  GAAP net income for 2016 totaled $2.5 million or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $2.8 million or $0.62 per diluted share in 2015.  Non-GAAP net income for 2016 totaled $3.8 million or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million or $0.85 per diluted share one year earlier. 
Commenting on the Company's financial position, Jack Cronin, Mastech Digital's Chief Financial Officer, stated, "At December 31, 2016 we had bank debt, net of cash balances on hand, of $9.1 million and approximately $12 million of borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit line.  During the year, our bank debt declined by $2.6 million. Additionally, our largest balance sheet asset, accounts receivable, remains of very high quality with a "days sales outstanding" measurement of 58-days at year-end 2016."  
In conjunction with its fourth quarter earnings release, Mastech Digital will host a conference call at 9:00 A.M. ET on February 8, 2017 to discuss these results and to answer questions.  A live webcast of this conference call will be available on the Company's website, www.mastechdigital.com.  Simply click on the Investor Relations section and follow the links to the live webcast.  The webcast will remain available for replay through February 15, 2017.

Use of non-GAAP Measures:
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures to supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis.  The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables. 
We believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share offers investors useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.  Additionally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance. 
Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures contained herein exclude the following expense items:
Amortization of acquired intangible assets:  We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with our June 2015 acquisition of Hudson IT.  We exclude these amortization expenses in our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe it allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry and facilitates a helpful comparison of our results with other periods. 
Acquisition related transaction expenses:  We incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisition of Hudson IT which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.  These transaction expenses consist of investment banking fees, legal expenses, audit charges related to our acquired companies and various advisor costs.  We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these expenses allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry and facilitates a helpful comparison of our results with other periods. 
Stock-based compensation expenses:  We incur material recurring expense related to non-cash, stock-based compensation. We exclude these expenses in our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that it provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance.  In particular, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC 718, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these expenses allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies within our industry and facilitates comparison of our results with other periods. 
Severance charges:  From time to time, we incur severance expense related to the termination by the Company of leadership personnel.  While it is probable that these expenses will occur in the future, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these expenses are useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses and facilitate comparison of our results with other periods. 
Forward-Looking Statements:
Certain statements contained in this release are forward-looking statements based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "scheduled," "estimates" and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which include but are not limited to (i) projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow, and (ii) the expected benefits to Mastech Digital from completing the acquisition of Hudson IT and the expected performance of Mastech Digital following completion of the acquisition.  These statements are based on information currently available to the Company and it assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements as circumstances change.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the level of market demand for its services, the highly competitive market for the types of services offered by the Company, the impact of competitive factors on profit margins, market conditions that could cause the Company's customers to reduce their spending for its services, and the Company's ability to create, acquire and build new lines of business, to attract and retain qualified personnel, reduce costs and conserve cash, and other risks that are described in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

PITTSBURGH, Sept. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mastech Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MHH), a national provider of IT staffing and digital transformation services, announced today that it has changed its name to Mastech Digital, Inc. The ticker symbol "MHH" for the Company's common stock listed on the NYSE MKT will remain the same. The effective date of the name change with the NYSE MKT will be September 15, 2016.
 








The name change is part of the Company's rebranding initiative to reinforce the message that it is fully committed to the world of 'Digital' – which includes the SMAC, Automation and IoT technologies.  (SMAC is an acronym for Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud.)  
The rebranding is accompanied by a change in the company's logo and a refreshed corporate website www.mastechdigital.com.  The Company's new logo is a chic design, made up of vibrant colors, contemporary typefaces and a stylized motif of connecting dots, which conveys its renewed focus and capabilities to solve customers' business problems by 'connecting the dots' digitally.
Commenting on this rebranding initiative, Vivek Gupta, the Company's President & CEO, said, "Our new name, Mastech Digital, reflects our ongoing transformation into a digital technologies company.  While we will continue to offer IT staffing services, we have added focus and capabilities in staffing around the digital technologies.  Additionally, we have started offering new project-based digital transformation services, beginning with Salesforce.com, SAP HANA and Digital Learning.  Over the next several quarters we expect to enrich this portfolio of offerings further to address the wider digital transformation needs of our existing and prospective customers."
