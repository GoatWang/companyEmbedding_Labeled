History
William Russell Kelly founded Russell Kelly Office Service in 1946,[8][9] initially providing office services performed at Kelly's offices, rather than providing temporary staffing at the client's location. However, customers asked for the work to be performed at their locations, and the temporary staffing concept was born out of responding to this type of request. It was in 1946 that the first 'Kelly Girls' came into scope and the first 'Kelly Girl' was Adelaide Hess Moran who was able to demonstrate that this new working sphere for women could be one to enjoy.
The temporary workers, who were usually female, became known as 'Kelly girls'.[10] In recognition of this, the name of the company was changed to Kelly Girl Service, Inc. in 1957.[8] The term 'Kelly girl' became a widely used term for a temporary worker, regardless of the worker's company affiliation or gender. In 1966 the name of the company was changed to Kelly Services, Inc., in order to reflect an expanding range of services.[8]
The current Chairman of the Board of Directors is Terence E. Adderley,[11] and the CEO is Carl T. Camden.[12]

Business Services & Administration Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


The Service sector is often considered the tertiary sector of many global economies, with the others being the secondary sector or manufacturing and the primary sector being agriculture.

As the name suggests, the service sector consists of the service-focused portion of the economy, such activities where companies or individuals offer their knowledge and time to improve productivity, performance, or opportunities. The basic characteristic of this sector is the production of services instead of tagible products. Services (also known as "intangible goods") include attention, advice, experience, and discussion. 

For decades, there has been a substantial shift from the primary and secondary sectors to the tertiary sector in industrialized economies. This sector is now the largest sector of the economy in the Western world, and has also seen the fastest growth. 

The business services industry, a subset of the Services sector, is focused on services explicitly offered to businesses and includes accounting, human resources, consulting, facilities management, leasing, security, and numerous other functions.  

The market reports available in this Business Services category will help you research specific topics or organizations providing support to other businesses and in many cases will be focused on a specific topic, such as collections services, intellectual property, or corporate finance.  Our collection of market research reports provides insights into product and market trends, opportunities, projections, sales, and marketing strategies. Specifics on market share, segmentation, size, and growth by country are also featured.
