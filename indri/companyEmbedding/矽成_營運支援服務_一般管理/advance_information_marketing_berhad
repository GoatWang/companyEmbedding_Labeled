Chairman's Statement
DATO' IR LIM SIANG CHAI
Independent and Non-Executive Chairman of AIM








Introduction


	For the year under review, the Group continued its existing core businesses of providing customer loyalty solutions programmes and sale of beauty care products. The customer loyalty solutions industry remained extremely competitive with countless players in the industry and with ever-changing technology. However, despite operating in a volatile foreign exchange environment in Indonesia, the Group’s customer loyalty business growth was steady with a strong customer base. The Indonesian operations continued to be the major contributor of revenue to the Group. The beauty care business under the brand name of HABA has its flagship store at Pavilion, Kuala Lumpur as well as counter outlets in other department stores in the Klang Valley. This business segment also maintained a steady volume of sales amidst a highly competitive industry.











Financial Results


For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group recorded a revenue of RM21.06 million. The revenue for the year under review increased by 60% compared to last year’s revenue of RM13.17 million. Against the increase in revenue, the Group registered a higher profit before taxation of RM0.80 million compared to the previous year’s profit of RM0.33 million. The improvements in revenue and profit were mainly attributed to the better results achieved by the Indonesian operations amidst an appreciating Indonesia Ruppiah against our currency.











Prospects


The Group is actively exploring the development of new products and services based on its existing platforms in both local and international markets. The Board is aware that the continuous cut back on corporate spending on loyalty marketing by the Group’s clients and customers’ preference for instant redemptions and gift vouchers will continue to pose a major challenge to the Group’s customer loyalty solutions business in Malaysia.
However, this segment has shown encouraging growth in Indonesia and the Group expects this trend to continue in the current year. In this regard, while the Group is focusing its resources to tap into this area of growth, it is also mindful of the risks associated with doing business in a foreign country.
For the Group’s beauty care products business, the weakening of Ringgit Malaysia has extended pressure on the product margin. Despite the challenging environment, the Company is actively looking into expanding its distribution network as well as enlarging the product range. The Group is planning to widen its distribution network to East Malaysia, Northern Region as well as Southern Region of Peninsular Malaysia.
The Group is also looking into diversification into other industries.











Appreciation


On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our valued shareholders, business associates and our employees for their continuous support. In the coming years, we expect to face new challenges amidst plentiful of opportunities and I am confident our Group will continue to remain strong whilst enjoying continuous support from our stakeholders. Last but not least, I thank my fellow directors for their guided wisdom and contributions.
