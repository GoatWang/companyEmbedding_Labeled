MICROmega MICROmega COMPANY RECEIVES ISO 9001:2008 QUALITY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION







      PRESS RELEASE
    

      22 September 2015
    

      MICROmega COMPANY RECEIVES ISO 9001:2008 QUALITY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION
    

      Utility Systems, a subsidiary of JSE-listed MICROmega Holdings Ltd, has received ISO 9001:2008 certification for the design and distribution of its water management products. Durban-based Utility Systems is South Africa's premier supplier of water management devices, including remote- communicating electronic water-control valves and Standard Transfer Specification Association approved pre-payment water management products.
    

      The ISO - the International Standards Organisation - 9001 certificate sets out the criteria for a quality management system (QMS). The standard is based on a number of quality management principles, including a strong customer focus, the motivation and implication of top management, the process approach and continual improvement.
    

      "This certification means all our processes, from design to production and product support, are covered by this international standard. This underlines the commitment to quality and strong customer focus that exists in our organisation," says Utility Systems managing director, Peter Rodseth.
    

      ISO 9001 requires an accredited third-party auditing organisation to thoroughly review a company's internal QMS processes to ensure they are capable of consistently delivering a service that meets customer needs and expectations.
    

      "I am happy to be able to congratulate Utility Systems on achieving certification," says Shavil Maharaj of Transpacific Certifications Limited. "The certification is more than just working to a set standard; the company is looking at this as a way to instil confidence in the products and services it delivers to customers."
    

      Although Utility Systems has only recently been certified, its products have been manufactured in accordance with ISO standards for some time and internal processes have been managed in accordance with its in-house quality management standards.
    

      "By being officially certified we are demonstrating our commitment to a strong culture of quality. This makes it easier for us to partner with customers requiring compliance with the standard, particularly those in more regulated export markets," confirms Rodseth.
    

      Notes MICROmega CEO, Greg Morris: "This certification confirms Utility Systems as a leader in its sector. We live in a water-scarce country and being ISO-certified makes transparent the company's commitment to quality within the vitally important water management industry."

How the pricing works
Trades are executed at the live price on the underlying exchange at the time your order is received, as a result the price that you invest at may differ from the price displayed. Further to this you are buying at the Offer Price which is the price at which sellers are currently prepared to sell.
The difference between all three prices quoted is an indication of the current interest investors have in this share. The bigger the difference between the prices, the smaller the interest/liquidity in the share i.e. there are limited buyers and sellers of this share. Investors should be cautious when buying or selling shares with lower liquidity.
