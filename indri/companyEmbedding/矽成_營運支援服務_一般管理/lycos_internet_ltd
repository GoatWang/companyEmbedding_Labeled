We had a very strong year and pleased with the performance this year. I have to thank the various teams that had to push harder, work extra hard to make this happen. Amongst the significant developments this year, we launched programmatic product Brightcom, bringing together the legacy of ‘Ybrant Digital’ alongside the ‘Brightcom’ Media initiative. We also renewed another year of relationship with Yahoo! across the globe for contextual advertising and our LYCOS Life product featured among the top ten fitness bands in India.
Business Review:
Coming to business during the year, marketing was always driven by how users accessed the Internet media. Years ago, it was driven through a keyboard, through displays of desktop, laptop, tablet, all that is shifting at a very high level. It is going from static images to very dynamic moving videos. People are looking for more engaging content. You can see at the content distribution level, whether it is Facebook or Twitter or Google, all are shifting towards video, we are seeing more and more usage on the video side. Consequently, we see the advertisers are also shifting towards advertising on the video. This puts us in a very unique position as we saw that coming last year. While we had a sense, we didn’t expect the speed at which the advertisers picked up. One of the interesting things about video is that it is very engaging content. So, obviously conversion rates have been significantly better. The mobile-based videos have picked up and as an intermediate medium, social media continues to pick up. These are the few things that are really changing and shifting things, in going from text based to video based consumption of media. We expect as we go forward that more voice based commands will drive this.
We witnessed growth in video advertising. We saw massive growth in the programmatic buying, which is automated buying through programs. Automated trading, buying and selling of media through online platform for advertisers and publishers. To address that market, LYCOS launched a new division called BRIGHTCOM this year. Brightcom brings together the legacy of ‘Ybrant Digital’ alongside the ‘Brightcom’ Media initiative. This combines data-driven technology together with the company’s strong bonds with advertisers and publishers, all in one consolidated platform. Gali Arnon took on the role of CEO of Brightcom. She was transition out of her previous role as the General Manager of the Advertising division of LYCOS. Brightcom ranked number four globally in the Video Seller Trust Index done by Pixellate and also featured amongst the top Alternate Ad networks published by MonetizeMore.com.
Through Brightcom we signed up with Medula, a large conglomerate targeting US Hispanic population. We are happy to tell you that we have made this partnership. We have made partnership across all the devices at all levels, including display, video, mobile and social, all the areas.
We launched a product called Vid-In, a video advertising solution that we have offered both to our publishers and advertisers. The key feature that really worked for us, we had a nice solution to address above the fold, which is view-ability and another feature that really worked for us is the ability to have custom sizes. We were able to create custom size video ads, based on where and how the ad demands. The big part of which is the ‘video on mobile’ format.
In other significant developments, majors steps were taken to cut out any sort of fraudulent bot-based traffic. We have signed up with GeoEdge to improve ad verification and then for fraud detection. So, it overall it again gives a very important security to the advertisers that this is a clean proper traffic that they can easily advertise. In this challenging environment, we are very proud to say, our team has been able to sustain and grow.
In terms of LYCOS Media, we have renewed a contract with Yahoo for global contextual advertising and we are pretty excited about it. We see that as a big opportunity to grow revenue globally with advertiser fee that we get from Yahoo. Plus, we have partnered with Ezoic, which is part of the Google relationship, which will give us additional business. We have added a local ad feed from Dex Media.
Coming to the products, we added VAST engine to Compass to sell video traffic to DSPs (Demand Side Platforms) via RTB (Real Time Bidding).
LYCOS Life band, which is one of the wearable products that we have been working on. We have already started selling on Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal in India and on the Amazon in the US. This product was picked as one of the top ten fitness bands by IOT India Magazine. We are pretty excited about LYCOS Life as a division.
In terms of key appointments that have happened this year, Mr. Ramesh Reddy has been appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer. He brings in a lot of experience, expertise and knowledge, from what the shareholders need and how to run a global enterprise. He has always been a friend and advisor to Lycos over the years. The second one is Dr. Jayalakshmi Kumari came in as an Independent Director. Dr. Jayalakshmi also comes from a very different background. She brings in an alternate view and added strength to the board. And the third important appointment this year is Ms. Gali Arnon in Israel. She was already a part of the team. She was the General Manager of the LYCOS advertising group.
Moving Forward:
We are looking at improving our tools to make online marketing more relevant and current with the changing market conditions. Emergence of video and social media included. The areas of digital marketing that continue to intrigue us are Influencer marketing, Ad viewability and Wearables/IOT. We believe these areas will pick momentum this year and expect to capitalize on it.
I would like to take this opportunity to place on record the excellent contribution made by our leadership team, our employees and partners across all subsidiaries and geographies.
Warm Regards,
Suresh Reddy

My page are screwed up , greyish backgrounds and everything is off centered; I have checked other tripos sites and theyha⋯⋯ve the same problem.  Filed tickets for help and all they do is mark them as solved when it isnt true.  It's always like taht.....when there is a problem, they give NO feedback and completely ignore their customers......well thats enough, I am going elsewhere! 更多Sarah K. Bendorf · 2017年5月31日I wish i could give 0 star review, because they dont even receive one star. I have a client that has purchased their domain through Lycos, and I am trying to un⋯⋯lock it to move it to our servers. There is an error message when you try to unlock that says please contact our support to have a domain unlocked for transfer and to receive the EPP code. The phone numbers provided - one says disconnect, the other says we do not offer phone support. And no one is responding to my emails. CROOKS 更多Lupe Ponce · 2017年6月20日I am unable to send email out thru computer or cell phone and am unable to contact lycos.  They seem to have disappeared in thin air.  What is going on with you⋯⋯ people?!  At least have the courtesy to tell your clients that you are no longer in business!  Customer service number is not working either.  Nothing works!!! 更多JP Pollard · 2017年5月16日They have abandoned the Tripod community. For those paying and not paying there is no customer service for the Tripod community anymore. We now use GoDaddy and I am trying to get my other clients to use them.David Piket · 2017年4月3日Terrible customer service. As in No customer service. While they are very quick to charge your credit card, they provide no service or products what so ever!   Please do your job of servicing your customers with their issues of your terrible product.Thomas Bauer · 2016年10月29日I received no e-mail to my back-up address signalling that my e-mail account is down.  I get no progress reports.   I did an experimental send, and it bounced b⋯⋯ack to me 20 minutes later.  When I try to access my e-mail account, I get a "Forbidden" page with an additional error 404.  Every other e-mail service I used has gone through upgrades without cutting off access to my account.  Those few times it happened,  I got advanced notice of the pending maintenance.  Lycos, on the other hand, never gives advance notice when it shuts down services.  In the past, such shut-downs lasted only hours for me.  This shutdown is now is heading to 48 hours --with NO hint it will be resolved.  All my work-related activity is on this account. It galls me to no end that I cannot access what I need to use.  As soon (maybe?) that the Lycos mail server is back online, I'll back up my messages, transfer them to a new e-mail service, and close this account.    This is piss-poor service.  It should not even get the measly star that I'm obliged to click.  I'm another disgruntled customer (among many, many of them) complaining on your Facebook Page.  Please get back up and running soon.  You have hurt too many people. 更多Winston Tortajada · 2017年1月10日Lycos hosts our website, it is a pay site, they charged our credit card, and our site has a Tripod banner on top of it, like a free site, and we can not access ⋯⋯it. we have tried email, chat and phone, and no customer service at all. Please remove the banner from our site and fix the login issue. our site is lakechapalamoving . com 更多Dan Kundert · 2016年12月6日I have been unable to edit my Zeeblio Website for a month now. Previous attempts for help went unanswered. I tried to get online help today and that just gets m⋯⋯e in a login loop that goes nowhere.  Online chat brings up a window that says that page doesn't exist. Getting very angry, I should be getting compensated for paying for a useless product that is sub par at best.  This is unacceptable LYCOS... 更多Karin Keller Cecil · 2017年4月10日Trying to get issue fixed. Opened 3 tickets and no response.  Ice paid for the month but I'm not able to use my serviceLyle Hodges · 2016年9月14日Tucows unlocked my domain twice, and each time Lycos locked it back while I was waiting for them to send Authorization Code to transfer my Domain to a hosting s⋯⋯ite who actually puts my site online as they are being paid to do, plus gives customer service as they are paid to do. My sites have been offline for months, with Lycos, even as they had no problem collecting my monthly payments, now that I have found another company to host my sites, Lycos still wants to keep screwing with me to block the transfer, and continue to keep my sites off the web. Refusing to give me the authorization code as they stated they would do, once I sent info required by ICANN, which I sent numerous times, yet Lycos still does not respond. If anyone is thinking of doing business with Lycos, you better think again unless you just want to get ripped off. 更多PRashanth Singh · 2017年3月20日This Stock fell from Rs. 68 to Rs. 7.  Now it is moved to T2T even then the price fall continues. Please do not get fooled and loose money in this stockDave Gartener · 2017年5月11日Website down again, thats it. Patience has a limit. I'm moving. Its the same old story: No information, no service. Geuss what? Your not getting my money anymore.Adell Brancevich · 2016年11月1日For over a week I'm having major issues with my website I have created through tripod/zeeblio classic. The important updates I have made throughout years have g⋯⋯one, and now it looks like it hasn't been updated for almost two years with old photos and text appeared again that actually have been removed long time ago.  I'm using paid services for several years now and I would've never thought that this company doesn't care about its clients. I have a website that I can't run normally I'm paying for and only what I get is automatic response that "they're working on that technical issue" and there's no help at all. This is a nightmare. 更多Shari Carder · 2016年11月1日Down for days and no explanation anywhere as to why.  Why can't someone from Lycos post a message to this facebook page to let everyone know what is going on.  If you can post messages about other stuff, you could certainly post about the status of your email service.Kristine Hannah · 2016年6月17日Third day, all websites and domain names are still down, with no explanation or apology from Lycos. "Customer service" is a Facebook page with a pinned post giv⋯⋯ing a non-functioning web address. Lycos can't help us or even tell us what's going on, but they do have people deleting comments on that page. I've been with Lycos since 2001 and once upon a time they were a great company, but no more. Now they have the distinction of being the most dishonest and incompetent company I've ever dealt with. 更多Prashanth Loke · 2016年7月31日The Price fall of Lycos Internet limited is causing some serious concerns to investors over the last 24 Months. The Stocks fell from Rs. 68 to Rs. 7. There is n⋯⋯o word from the board to support the investors.  Now it is moved to T2T even then the price fall continues. Boarders in Moneycontrol and so are just trying to grab attention of some investors who can loose their money by investing in this stock. Please do not get fooled and loose money in this stock 更多Ray Whatley · 2016年9月26日I just recently bought THE PLAN. I would like to know the best way to get a refund. The customer service is non existent. I have asked for help getting a featur⋯⋯e to work correctly using their tools and I get a formed response saying they can't help with my code. I have informed them its NOT my code, its their tool, but they have not responded whatsoever. I would like to just part ways as soon as possible. This is exactly why I have created my page, to battle companies such as this. 更多Jack Aiello · 2016年6月16日For the last 2 days, very poor since I can get one my site sfbayareamyelomasupport-dot-org. because you're fixing yours.  This has certainly taken more than a f⋯⋯ew hours (which took a few hours just to post on lycos-dot-com). When will I no longer get the msg "[Fiddler] DNS Lookup for "sfbayareamyelomasupport-dot-org" failed. The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found".
