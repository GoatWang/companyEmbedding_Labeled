Plate from stock
We stock carbon steel plate materials from 1mm to 450mm thick.
Material Specifications include the popular BSEN 10025:S275(JR) and BSEN 10025:S355J2+N & K2+N and also offshore grades EN 10225:S355G8/9/10+M
With our vast supplier contacts we can offer just about any grade of material and cut to meet your exact requirements – so please ask and we’ll meet your every need!


Profiles
We offer the highest standards in profile burning to meet our stringent quality control, giving complete traceability from steel mills to end user.
Gas Profile Burners and hi-definition plasma cutting machines are all CNC controlled, giving precise cutting to meet and exceed current profiling standards.


Our profiling services and machines at a glance
With our state-of-the-art CNC Gas and Plasma cutting machines we can cut and mark vast sizes of steel – quickly and precisely. We pride ourselves in using the very latest technology for a guaranteed solution that’ll exceed your expectations…


State-of-the-art machinery
Our ESAB Gas and Plasma Machines are among the newest in the UK. And with the Plasma VBA Global Pro, we can apply ESAB’s Precision Hole TechnologyTM and Plasma Bevelling (see below).


Oxy-Fuel Burning
Our Gas Burning Machines both have 6 cutting heads for faster and more cost efficient cutting. Our table sizes for the Gas Machine are 40m x 6m. So no plate is ever too big to cut.


Plasma Bevelling
We can offer bevel cut parts from -45° to +45° and offer multi-pass bevelling for V, Y, X  & K cuts up to 35mm thick. Our Plasma Bevel Machine can cut up to 50mm thick vertically.


Precision Hole TechnologyTM
If you’re looking for world-class plasma cut holes and the highest quality edge cuts, look no further. To create bolt-ready holes with plasma requires cylindricity measured in thousands of an inch. The Plasma VBA Global Pro achieves this with ease by producing the highest quality plasma cut bolt-ready holes in mild steel up to 2.5cm thick and holes down to 1:1 diameter to thickness ratio. Our table size for this machine is 12m x 3m.


Plasma marking
ALL our machines have the capability to plasma mark in high definition. One of the biggest advantages of plasma marking is the capability to mark on wet, oily or rusted surfaces – it’s the ideal method for signing mild steel, stainless steel or all electrical conducive materials.

					Five strategic compensation and benefits trends that will drive business success in 2016
				

January 7, 2016
This year — once again — compensation and benefits professionals will need to 
focus on smart ways to stretch their limited payroll budgets. The competition 
for talent won’t go away, so optimizing workforce programs that attract, retain 
and engage talent will also be critical. To stay ahead of the game, 
organizations need to be keyed into these five trends as they navigate through 
2016.

Towers Watson Global Access
June 2014 Towers Watson: Other


Gold

Global Access is Towers Watson’s newly launched global benefit solution, which allows multinational employers to deliver local country benefit programmes.
The plan can include prepackaged life, accident, health and disability insurances with three, fixed, benchmark levels. Those levels are based on Towers Watson’s global data against general market practice data in each country (25th/50th/75th percentiles). Fixed or indicative pricing is provided by age group, allowing almost immediate quotes with little data. Enhanced underwriting and flexible underwriting features – such as guaranteed issue, or free cover limits and removal of pre-existing condition requirements – are included. The plan also offers renewable annual rates on a block or portfolio basis by country to minimise fluctuation.
Global Access is available in 32 countries and aims to give employers easy access to competitive benefit coverage solutions when customisation is not required. Very low minimum headcount is required of cover.
The plan has been developed with leading global insurers.
Comment: This is a very sophisticated solution that should help multinationals address a number of issues (including compliance and governance) in providing employee benefits for their workforce globally.
Plus points: Sophisticated solution that large firms can adopt globally, with the flexibility and options they need; Fast quotes with little data needed; Quick implementation; Avoids firms having to retain a local broker in each geography.
Not so plus points: Relatively limited market; Limited customisation; Not accessible to other intermediaries.

Rating (max 10): Innovation:  9. Overall: 8. Gold
