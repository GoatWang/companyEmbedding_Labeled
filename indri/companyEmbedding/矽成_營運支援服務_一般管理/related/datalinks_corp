   DataLinks Information and FAQ's



 

   Introduction





DataLinks is PerCon's internet-based online database search system. DataLinks provides customers access to a variety of FCC and FAA related databases, many of which are updated daily. The system contains data and features designed specifically for use in a business or commercial setting. The system is an excellent resource for engineers, licensing offices, communications companies or anyone in need of a complete and timely source of FCC or FAA data.The DataLinks system currently hosts 25 different databases with more databases added on a continuous basis. The databases are updated either daily, monthy or quarterly depending on the database and source of data. Each database has a variety of searches and output options which also vary depending on the database.The DataLinks system is compatible with both Netscape Navigator/Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Customers using either browser with any operating system can access the DataLinks site. 


 

   Advantages





The DataLinks system offers several advantages over other online services and delivery mediums. Many advantages are directly related to the fact that DataLinks is entirely internet based. 



Operating System Independant-  DataLinks is compatible with both Internet Explorer and Navigator / Communicator web browers. Customers using most operating systems, including the MacOS, Unix/Linux variations and all versions of Windows, with either browser can access the DataLinks site. 
Standard Internet Connection- The DataLinks website can be accessed like any other website from any location. No additional connections are required, so any existing ISP/internet account can be used. In addition, the are no busy dialup lines or long distance charges.



Accurate & Timely Data-  The data is maintained on PerCon's DataLinks server and is updated at scheduled intervals. The data is always timely and does not age the same way as data provided through other mediums.
Cost Effective- Searches cost as little as 25% when compared to the cost of competitive systems using per-minute dialup rates. Users perform searches to extract only the data they need. In addition, customers have access to a variety of database which cannot be found on single CD-ROM.




In addition to the data residing on a central server, the code used to execute the searches and process the output is also maintained on a central server. This makes it possible to add new searches, new export options or other features to the system instantaneously with no need to download program updates. 


 

   Pricing





DataLinks are all unlimited user accounts. Please contact PerCon for pricing and details. 


Yearly Unlimited Access- For companies or individuals who typically perform searches daily and require large amounts of data, we offer yearly unlimited access accounts. Unlimited accounts allow users to perform an unlimited number of searches for one full year for a flat fee. Yearly unlimited accounts can be set up for individuals as well as multiple users in a corporate account. 

Pricing:
Yearly Unlimited Access - Single User: Call (716)386-6015 for pricing

   Frequently Asked Questions





The following information is provided to help answer the most common questions about PerCon DataLinks.
Q. Which product will work best for me, DataLinks or the Professional Series CD-ROMS?
A. While both products are designed for use in commercial, business or engineering environments, there are several differences between DataLinks and the Professional Series CD-ROMS. These differences can be used to determine which product is best suited for a customer's needs.
DataLinks is best suited for customers who need data as current as possible. Customers who need data requiring multiple CD-ROMS also benifit from the variety of databases found on the DataLinks system and the fact that each database contains national coverage, not regional. However, because each search consumes search credits, customers who are performing a large number of searches in a localized area may benifit more by using a CD-ROM.


Q. What is the source of the data and how accurate is it? Does PerCon collect and maintain their own databases?
A. The databases are created using data directly from the FCC, FAA and Industry Canada. PerCon does not edit or change the data in any way and the data is provided exactly as it appears in the repestive databases. Because the data is an exact copy of what the FCC, FAA and Industry Canada have in their systems, the data should be 100% accurate, provided that the original data is correct. PerCon processes the data into a format which is compatible with the DataLinks searches.
Q. Do any of the DataLinks databases contain data for places outside the US?
A. Yes. Data for Canada is also available. 
A. Without a credit expiration date, it would make it difficult for PerCon to make any policy or pricing changes to the DataLinks system. We have found that one year is sufficient for most customers.
Q. Can I distribute data found using the DataLinks System?
A. No. Data contained within the DataLinks system is copyright © 2007 by PerCon and cannot be re-distributed without permission from PerCon. Please contact PerCon for additional information.

5 Key Considerations for Platform Selection
In recent years, companies have rushed to take advantage of the benefits of placing workloads in the public cloud. There are many factors driving this move, but in general, they are looking to expand processing and storage capabilities while controlling costs. Often, there is significant value to be gained from making the public cloud part of a platform mix.

DataLinks
DataLinks is a powerful database driven search engine of FCC Databases,
            these range from IBFS, COALS, CDBS to all FCC Univeral Licensing System
            Databases (ULS). All FCC frequency databases are included in one composite
            Master Frequency Database. Due to the uniqueness of this product, DataLinks
            is is considerd a sole-source product by many of PerCon's customers.
            DataLinks also includes the FCC Antenna Registration (ANTREG), the
            FAA Digital Obstacle (DOF) and the Industry Canada TAFL. Most frequency
            databases are updatad daily. DataLinks offers a robust range of searches
            and outputs based unique to each individual database. Searches range
            from simple Callsign searches to complex multi-field searches. An SQL
            like query build and editor is available for those that would like
            to develop their own complex searches. Specialty searches include Radius
            (with inner and outer), Box, and Buffer Searches are available for
            most databases. Output formats range from simple HTML pages, Excel
            files, Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF), KML for Google Earth,
            XML, to ASCII and DBF file formats. DataLinks also provides access
            to utilies like our Find Available Frequency utilities. Canada is also
            supported for those searches near the ABCD line. DataLinks offers an
            easy to use and time saing alternative to the ULS. Searches can be
            completed against multiple databases with no drill-down.
           DataLInks can be used in frequency interference, licensing, R&D, competive analysis
           and much more. Contact PerCon if you have questions or have specific
           requirements.

Dynamic Database Browsing (DDB)
Dynamic Database Browsing (DDB) provides users with a new way of searching
            and visualizing data found in PerCon online databases. Using special
            .KML files, users can not only view data, but search and extract new
            records simply by moving and manipulating a Google Earth map. Information,
            such as transmitter locations or towers are displayed automatically
            as the user zooms into the desired geographic location. As the user
            moves the map, data is retrieved from PerCon servers and new results
            are added to the map display. The search results are returned as interactive
            points and clicking on any point will provide detailed information
            for that record in a pop-up window. In addition, towers can be viewed
            in a 3D mode, giving the user a real sense of the structure height
            & scale. Users who mainly perform geographic database searches will
            benefit greatly from this option as they can now search various PerCon
            databases visually from a single interface. DDB is an optional product
            to PerCon DataLinks. To try our demo using Chautauqua County, NY, click on the following link:

PerCon's Worldwide Bandplan is multi-country Table of Frequency Allocations
            that covers over 135 countries and/or entities. It is a sole source
            product since it is the only searchable database of it's kind. Searches
            across single or multiple countries can be performed using the easy
            to use DataLinks Database Engine. Many outputs are available, they
            range from ASCII, HTML to Google Earth KML and Excel.

            WBP now supports a new and dynamic visual interface. Visual Table of Allocations is now available to WBP users.

FCC Activity Monitor (FAM)
FAM can monitor any daily activity from the FCC, both Pending Applications
            and Granted Licenses. Any field or combination of fields in the PerCon's
            FCC data can be tracked, allowing for extremely robust queries. Queries
            can range from File Numbers or Call signs to application contact names
            or frequency coordinator names. Site specific searches can be performed
            as a radius search to protect against activity around locations. You
            may monitor any licenses, your licenses or even your competitor's licenses.
            Frequency ranges or specific frequencies searches may be performed
            with class of stations or radio services. Virtually any daily activity
            may be monitored. Get a heads up on future installations, potential
            interference or potential sales. Save valuable time in repetitive manual
            searches. On a daily basis you will receive an email with all results
            of pending and/or granted activity. These emails also contain quick
            links to the FCC and to a PerCon Excel spreadsheet that corresponds
            to the search results.

Did you know?
PerCon was the first commercial provider of FCC data in digital form.
                In 1993, PerCon published a frequency database of floppy disk.
                That year we signed up the FCC as our first government customer
                (on CDROM).
