SORDIMM
Mini-DIMM
VLP Mini DIMM
LRDIMM
NVDIMM

We build our modules from start to finish—designing, manufacturing, and testing all of the DRAM ourselves before assembling the modules and testing again. So, from high-performance SODIMMs to high-density LRDIMMs, you can depend on the quality and reliability of our devices.





Managed NAND

Select Category
e.MMC Memory
Embedded USB

Our fully managed devices like eMMC, UFS and SSDs help make technology transitions nearly seamless by handling media management and error correction code (ECC) internally.





NAND Flash

Select Category
SLC NAND
MLC NAND
TLC NAND
Serial NAND
3D NAND

Micron does more than design and manufacture NAND Flash memory. We strive to solve design challenges through better engineering—by raising the bar on NAND products that cover everything from mobile to embedded, to enterprise storage applications.





NOR Flash

Select Category
Parallel NOR Flash
Serial NOR Flash
Xccela™ Flash

Whether you’re designing for wireless, embedded, or automotive applications, our extensive portfolio of serial and parallel NOR Flash solutions delivers the right mixture of performance, cost, and design continuity, backed by years of Micron Flash memory expertise.





Multichip Packages

Select Category
e.MMC-Based MCP
NAND-Based MCP
NOR-Based MCP

Get the critical features and functions for your design—including high performance, high quality, power efficiency, wide density ranges, small package sizes, and industrial temperature ranges—from our broad portfolio of industry-standard multichip packages (MCPs). 





Hybrid Memory Cube

Select Category
Short-Reach HMC

Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) represents an entirely new leap forward in memory technology. It combines high-speed logic and DRAM layers into one optimized 3D package that leverages through-silicon via (TSV) technology.







Storage





Solid State Storage
Our family of solid state storage products targets a wide spectrum of needs—from low-density, cost-effective embedded storage, to client and performance-class SSDs.





Memory Cards
Ideal for mission-critical applications that require more robust memory performance, microSD cards  deliver reliability, quality, performance, security and longevity needed for edge recording and other industrial IoT applications.

NEW PRODUCT ANNOUCEMENTExclusive North American Distribution
Gas Eye Cross Duct in-situ analyzer

Having finished successful contract negotiations M&C has signed two far reachingdistribution contracts with the innovative company AIROPTIC of Poland.

AIROPTIC is a highly specialized company focusing on real-time gas analyzers.It has developed and is producing laser based gas analyzers for industrial process control.We will enhance our website shortly showing the additional sales program available via M&C from now on.

The first contract is exclusively covering the sales region USA, the second contract covers most of Europe (apart from Poland, Scandinavia and some very special customers of AIROPTIC).

M&C will provide its own highly experienced sales force to introduce the technologically smart products and solutions of AIROPTIC to all potential customers.

The technology of AIROPTIC and the own developments of M&C will complement each other excellently and both partners are proud and confident to be able to offer our customer industries new and highly qualified opportunities.

We are delighted to inform you about this new, future-orientated activity of M&C and can be reached through the existing contact channels as your exclusive AIROPTIC Sales Partner in the sales areas mentioned above.
The AIROPTIC Gas Eye is a maintenance free in-situ gas analyzer.
Designed for ambient, emission monitoring or process applications with 24/7 continuous operation.  
There is no need for sample conditioning, does not exhibit zero or span drift, and no field calibration necessary. The Gas Eye can measure real time Formaldehyde, Ammonia, Carbon Monoxide and other gases that absorb in the mid IR region.
AIROPTIC’s Gas Eye is configured with a transmitter, process interface, and a receiver.  The process interface is made of 316 stainless steel. The Interband Cascade Laser Technology allows measurement from ppb to ppm with large dynamic ranges, responding in less than 1 second. The Gas Eye is easily adjustable to specific customer needs, ranging from ambient, to extractive through harsh combustion control environments. Windows for the Gas Eye are fused silica or sapphire (Helix leak tested and certified in accordance with EN1779:1999 norm), depending on the gas to be measured, and the application.
