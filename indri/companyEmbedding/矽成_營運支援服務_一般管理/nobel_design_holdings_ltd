Nobel Design Holdings Ltd. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
Apr 20 17
Nobel Design Holdings Ltd. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company's revenue was SGD 23,569,000 compared with SGD 21,151,000 a year ago. This increase is mainly attributable to the group's supply chain division which sells to the USA market. Profit before income tax was SGD 1,525,000 compared with SGD 1,342,000 a year ago. Profit attributable to equity holders of the company was SGD 520,000 compared with SGD 867,000 a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was SGD 3,249,000 compared with net cash used in operating activities of SGD 1,114,000 a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were 0.23 cents compared to 0.40 cents a year ago. As on March 31, 2017, the company's net asset value per share was 73.84 cents compared to 73.64 cents a year ago. The group's net profit after tax for the first quarter decreased by 39% to SGD 0.78 million as compared to a net profit after tax of SGD 1.29 million for the first quarter ended 31 March 2016. This was mainly due to a fall in the group's share of profits from its property investments joint ventures which was partially offset by the increase in contribution from the supply chain division.
