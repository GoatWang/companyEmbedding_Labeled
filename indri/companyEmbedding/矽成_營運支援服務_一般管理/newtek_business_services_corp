 Mr. Sloane concluded, "It remains our goal to grow our company organically as well through strategic investments within the business services footprint in order to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities the market has to offer. Specifically, our recent investment in our new wholly owned controlled portfolio company IPM ( www.ipm.com), an information technology consulting company, positions Newtek's portfolio companies to offer end-to-end technology solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses, commercial business and larger institutional clients.  We will outline our portfolio company strategy for growth in the technology space on our conference call tomorrow morning as well as discuss our current investment pipeline."    Investor Conference Call and Webcast  A conference call to discuss second quarter 2017 results will be hosted by Barry Sloane, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Eddelson, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, tomorrow, Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. ET.  The live conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 303-6993 or (760) 666-3611. In addition, a live audio webcast of the call with the corresponding presentation will be available in the 'Events & Presentations' section of the Investor Relations portion of Newtek's website at http://investor.newtekbusinessservices.com/events.cfm. A replay of the webcast with the corresponding presentation will be available on Newtek's website shortly following the live presentation and will remain available for 90 days following the live presentation.    1    Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Newtek Business Services Corp. and Subsidiaries  In evaluating its business, Newtek considers and uses ANII as a measure of its operating performance.  ANII includes short-term capital gains from the sale of the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans, and beginning in 2016, capital gain distributions from controlled portfolio companies, which are reoccurring events. The Company defines ANII as Net investment income (loss) plus Net realized gains recognized from the sale of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loan investments less realized losses on non-affiliate investments, plus or minus loss on lease adjustment, plus the net realized gains on controlled investments.

Of note, our Adjusted Net Investment Income and investment income for the first six months of 2017 increased approximately 39% and 35%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, we have raised our total SBA loan origination guidance for 2017 by approximately 4% to $415 million, which would represent an approximate 31% increase over total SBA loan originations in 2016. We remain positive about our continued growth and expect the second half of the year to follow our historical trend of yielding stronger results than the first half of the year.” Mr. Sloane continued, “We are also proud to report that we have been able to continue to secure capital with more attractive financing terms, a testament to the market’s recognition of our strong track record and continued growth.  Certain of our portfolio companies were able to increase the aggregate principal amount of the term loan facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA to $50.0 million from $38.0 million with a reduction in the interest rate of between 1.0% and 2.0%.  Additionally, NSBF increased its existing revolving credit facility through Capital One, from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, and received a reduction in the interest rate of 1.125% to fund the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans and 1.25% to fund the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans. Together with our use of at-the-money (ATM) equity offerings during the second quarter, which allows us to access equity capital at a significantly lower underwriting cost than with a typical equity offering, we believe we are well capitalized as of the date of this release.”Mr. Sloane concluded, “It remains our goal to grow our company organically as well through strategic investments within the business services footprint in order to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities the market has to offer. Specifically, our recent investment in our new wholly owned controlled portfolio company IPM (www.ipm.com), an information technology consulting company, positions Newtek’s portfolio companies to offer end-to-end technology solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses, commercial business and larger institutional clients.  We will outline our portfolio company strategy for growth in the technology space on our conference call tomorrow morning as well as discuss our current investment pipeline.”Investor Conference Call and WebcastA conference call to discuss second quarter 2017 results will be hosted by Barry Sloane, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Eddelson, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, tomorrow, Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. ET.  The live conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 303-6993 or (760) 666-3611.In addition, a live audio webcast of the call with the corresponding presentation will be available in the ‘Events & Presentations’ section of the Investor Relations portion of Newtek’s website at http://investor.newtekbusinessservices.com/events.cfm.

The Company defines ANII as Net investment income (loss) plus Net realized gains recognized from the sale of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loan investments less realized losses on non-affiliate investments, plus or minus loss on lease adjustment, plus the net realized gains on controlled investments.Read MoreThe term ANII is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  ANII has limitations as an analytical tool and, when assessing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider ANII in isolation, or as a substitute for net investment income, or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Among other things, ANII does not reflect the Company’s actual cash expenditures.  Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than Newtek, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools.  The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results supplemented by ANII.2Note Regarding Dividend Payments Amount and timing of dividends, if any, remain subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Company's Board of Directors expects to maintain a dividend policy with the objective of making quarterly distributions in an amount that approximates 90 - 100% of the Company's annual taxable income.  The determination of the tax attributes of the Company's distributions is made annually as of the end of the Company's fiscal year based upon its taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year.About Newtek Business Services Corp.Newtek Business Services Corp., Your Business Solutions Company®, is an internally managed BDC, which along with its controlled portfolio companies, provides a wide range of business services and financial products under the Newtek® brand to the small- and medium-sized business (“SMB”) market. Since 1999, Newtek has provided state-of-the-art, cost-efficient products and services and efficient business strategies to SMB accounts across all 50 states to help them grow their sales, control their expenses and reduce their risk.Newtek’s and its portfolio companies’ products and services include: Business Lending, SBA Lending Solutions, Electronic Payment Processing,  Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, IT Consulting), eCommerce, Accounts Receivable Financing & Inventory Financing, The Secure Gateway, The Newtek Advantage™, Insurance Solutions, Web Services, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions.Newtek® and Your Business Solutions Company® are registered trademarks of Newtek Business Services Corp.Note Regarding Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Newtek Business Services Corp. Forms Partnership with Lending Club


NEW YORK, May 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Newtek Business Services Corp., (NASDAQ: NEWT), an internally managed business development company ("BDC"), today announced that that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Lending Club (NYSE: LC).  This partnership will allow Newtek to expand its lending product menu and offer business loans to its customer base through the Lending Club platform.  Lending Club is the world's largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors with a lending platform that has facilitated loans totaling over $9.3 billion since its inception in 2007. 
Barry Sloane, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Newtek Business Services Corp. stated, "We are extremely excited to announce our partnership with Lending Club, the leader in marketplace lending. As a national small- and medium-sized business lender, Newtek provides a range of financing from $50,000 to $10 million, through a wide variety of product offerings. This partnership will enable us to further expand our suite of lending products, and service clients who require a revolving line of credit, a small-balance working capital loan or a collateralized term debt facility of up to $10 million."
Mr. Sloane continued, "We believe we are the only full-service small-business nationwide lender that acquires leads from retail channels and retail distribution partners and assembles, underwrites, services and funds these loans.  With over a decade of lending experience, we have discovered that the majority of independent business owners are truly unaware of their funding needs and for what type of loan product or amount they are capable of qualifying.  On a consultative basis, we offer expert guidance and provide financial business solutions to help businesses grow, refinance existing debt, stabilize their business and flourish in today's complicated markets.  As we further develop as a BDC and grow the Newtek brand, we welcome the benefits we believe Lending Club will provide to us and our clients as a national exchange for small business finance.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 08/03/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
