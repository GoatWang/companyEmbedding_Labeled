                  以高技术力量和严格的质量管理为基础，技术、开发、设计、实验、制造、销售等各个环节紧密结合，向顾客提供满意度更高的包装加工机械是我们的追求。

                  设备购入後，维护保养指导以及技术指导等都会针对设备的特性而实施。得到顾客长期的信赖是最令

create and contemplate

			The basis of our philosophy lies in "to create." This means 'not to just physically make something' but "to create the best possible products."
			We never draw a negative conclusion only with the theoretical discussion, but always try to make a prototype sample or hands-on trial first to respond to whatever needs the customer may have.
			This is not a wasted attempt of reaching for something blindly in the dark.
			With the confidence and challenging sprit based on the accumulation of our experience, our desire to create something will come out. We create products that will meet new needs, and at the same time, foresee new possibilities one step beyond our perspective.
			Newly created products offer added value as well as problems. As for the added values, we "contemplate" how they can be fully used.
			As for problems, we "contemplate" how they can be solved. In other words, "to create" can be complemented by "to contemplate."
			Tohshin Group is a cluster of product creators who arduously continue to "create and contemplate."
