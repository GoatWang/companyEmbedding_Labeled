Elon Musk has discovered a new passion in life — and it could be Tesla's best product yet

Elon Musk made a surprising announcement about Tesla's next car




Tesla CEO Elon is the best car salesman in history. And as CEO of SpaceX, he's declared his intention to retire on Mars.
But what are supercar-fast electric vehicles and low-Earth orbits in the face of ... roofing.
Against all odds, Musk has become perhaps the biggest booster in the history of the roofing business, thanks to a new Tesla product, the Solar Roof, that officially went on sale Wednesday.
It's the first post-Solar City-acquisition product that Tesla is selling, and it sounds as if it's been occupying at least as much of Musk's attention as the forthcoming launch of Tesla's Model 3 car.
I can honestly say that I've never heard anyone express such enthusiasm about the top of house. As someone who has owned a few houses, my general reaction to discussions of roofs has been dread. They have to be replaced periodically, and that's expensive. Also, they have to be repaired. And they leak. 
Musk doesn't share this dread. Just as he has a vision for Tesla's vehicles and for SpaceX's Mars-colonizing ambitions (as well as traffic-beating tunnels and artificial intelligence), so he has a vision for roofs. And it's actually rather exciting.
Big on solar

Musk has always been big on solar power. Prior to Tesla buying SolarCity for over $2 billion, Musk was the company's Chairman (his cousin was the CEO). He likes to point out that humanity has a compelling alternative to fossil-fuel energy: the giant fusion reactor in the sky that bathes the planet every day with free power.
Solar also fits into his master plan, which involves eliminating greenhouse-gas emissions by electrifying transportation; backing up the biosphere with SpaceX, which would make humanity a multi-planetary species; and powering it all with solar energy.
SolarCity has long been able to sell or lease a homeowner solar panels, but the Solar Roof offers a different value proposition. If you have to replace your roof anyway, why not replace it with a roof that generates power and saves you money over the long haul? 
With a 30-year-mortgage, if you stay in the house, you'll replace your roof at least once. At a cost of about $10,000, you maintain the value of the home, but you don't necessarily add much to it. The Solar Roof should last twice as long as a traditional roof (and maybe much longer) and it will both mitigate your electricity costs and, paired with a Tesla Powerpack battery, provide you with backup energy. 
The up-front costs are high, but the overall economics are compelling. And in sunny states where electricity is costly, such as California, a Solar Roof could net a homeowner tens of thousands of dollar over 30 years.
But there's something else that thrills Musk even more than the money part.
It's the aesthetics.
Looks are everything
Such beauty!Tesla
Tesla will have four different tile choices for the Solar Roof by 2018, and Musk made it clear in a call with reporters Wednesday that the company tried really hard to redefine the way we look at the top of our houses. 
We're talking roof envy here, something that Musk sought to stoke when the Solar Roof was revealed in Los Angeles last October. "Check out the sweet roof," he joked at the time, speculating on previously unheard-of dialogue in suburban enclaves that will be early adopters of the Tesla design.
Last week, he said that Tesla had struggled to find sufficiently beautiful roofs upon which to base its designs for the Solar Roof. 
"We had a hard time finding good-looking roofs. Try it. Use Google search. This Solar Roof is the opposite. It will look better and last longer than a normal roof."
In fact, Musk seemed almost giddy about the Solar Roof, joyfully embracing this bane of many a homeowners existence and arguing that for far too long, we've been deprived of rooftop beauty as a species. 
And it's not hard to see why he's so thrilled. On paper, Solar Roof is an enticing product — and something new for Tesla. The company's vehicles are remarkable, but they do currently cost $100,000 on average and, like all cars, are depreciating assets. Even a Tesla is invariably worth less the day after you buy it.
An appreciating asset
I love these damn Solar Roofs!Tesla
The Powerwall and the other Tesla Energy products are potentially a solid line of business, but a slab of battery on your garage wall, no matter how cool, doesn't stir the spirit. And like a stove or refrigerator, a Powerwall will lose value over time.
The Solar Roof, on the other hand, could be financed through a homeowner's mortgage (adding, for the sake of argument, $20,000 for an effectively 30-year net savings of around $5,000, making the roof effectively free). If the home's value rises in line with the rate of inflation and the Solar Roof remains in working order, it will become part of an appreciating asset, further enhancing the homeowner's bottom line and net worth.
It's certainly worth noting that almost no other tech company is in the appreciating asset business. Apple iPhones are from the moment of purchase on a swift path to worthlessness. Facebook's "product" is ephemeral. Google facilitates finding things, offering a service rather than something that you can buy that will be worth more later. Microsoft grew large on software that has to be updated every few years.
In fact, if you look around, outside of financial instruments, there are really aren't that many ways to buy stuff that will actually be worth more tomorrow than today. 
Of course, there will be some depreciation with a Solar Roof, and maintenance costs could be a factor. But all in, when the real-estate value of the property is taken into account, a homeowner should come out well ahead.
And the homeowner would have an awesome roof to look at! Musk is so utterly into the Solar Roof that he didn't want to let the reporters he spoke with last week go back to work without a message of gorgeous rooftops and free power.
"What's is the future we want?" he asked. "We want to look around and see roofs that are beautiful and that draw energy from the sun."

The bigger the number, the more powerful and long lasting the battery. SD Card / Micro SD CardThis is the standard memory card you use with your camera or phone. The the case of the much smaller Micro SD (also known as TF). If the product says SD card slot it will take any SD card you already own. Pay attention to max GB size compatibility if you are using very big storage SD cards. iOSThis means Apple's Operating System for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Appliances which are compatible with iOS Apps will work with all those products. Car charger/car power socketAll vehicles have that standard "cigarette lighter" power socket. With this you can plug power cables into your car gadgets. It's a standard 12V on all vehicles so don't worry about compatibility. If you are charging/powering many electronic appliances from one car socket, buy a good car accessory power splitter.

Don't worry about electrical power compatibility One of the most commonly asked question is about mains electrical compatibility. Every American has experienced the frustration of trying to use 110V chargers overseas. and having concern when plugging into 240V mains sockets. So a lot of customers wonder if "Chinese" electronics are somehow on a strange foreign system that is not compatible. Well, not at all - first of all, the whole of China is on standard 220-240V mains electricity. It also uses EU and UK type plugs everywhere. Although we would not go so far to say electrical plugs in China are standard - much like many other things here.  All Chinavasion devices with mains power adapters will work in all countries. And Chinavasion offers all mains charger cables in EU plug type, and we provide you a free travel plug adapter for USA, UK, or Australian standards. According to your delivery order address. All our adapters are capable of working in both 110V and 240V regions (auto switching) unless indicated otherwise. We can offer further customization of power adapter and plug types on electronics for bulk wholesale buyers on inquiry. What influences gadget prices? When comparing prices on electronic gadgets you may find similar products with different price points. The most common reasons for this are that newly released, tech items will usually be more expensive than lower specification or older products. Bigger screens, more connectors, wireless capabilities, bigger storage, batteries, and extra accessories are mean higher prices. Which is good news if you are a business retailer or drop shipper seeking value to promote when reselling these Chinavasion products. Keep up with the latest technology gadgetsChinavasion aims to add new products to the catalog each working day. Keep an eye on our New Products page for the latest gadget releases. You can subscribe to our newsletter to make sure you never miss a big launch.  Chinese gadget manufacturers are constantly closing the gap between big brand technology firms. Matching them in component quality, device speed, and quality of materials. You can look at a lot of Chinese electronics as copies. Another way to see it is that they are learning and catching up with how to produce the best electronics gadgets and quality devices.  Another trend is that more Chinese-born brands are starting to develop and increase a diverse range of new tech gadgets. China is one of the fastest developing countries in the world. It is home to many chip manufacturers so there's a real entrepreneurial and creative atmosphere. This has seen the rise and rapid development of all kinds of new tech, such as 3D video glasses, drones, 3D Printers, camera equipment and laser gadgets.

Advice for new gadget sellers If you are a retailer or drop shipper of electronic gadgets, you may need to consider selecting good titles and description keywords to attract customers. Remember people may be searching for gadget and gift keywords as well as specific product names. Don't be afraid of adding titles and keywords that match the bargain shoppers. Although we suggest that you point out the reliable quality of Chinavasion products. One more thing to remember is that geeky gadgets can give rise to technical questions before sales. As a good seller, you should answer your customer's questions promptly. To help you do this it is a good idea to get samples of what you are selling.

Elon Musk Says SolarCity Will Sell a Roof Integrated With Solar Panels | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchTerm SheetTerm Sheet — Thursday, Aug. 3FacebookHow Facebook’s Latest Change Will Affect Which Articles You SeeCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDSmokingMaine Becomes Fourth State to Raise Smoking Age to 21A worker lays down a solar panel on a rooftop. Sergio Flores—Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSolarCityElon Musk Says SolarCity Will Sell a Roof Integrated With Solar PanelsKatie FehrenbacherAug 09, 2016Solar installer SolarCity, which is in the process of being acquired by electric car maker Tesla, plans to develop and sell a roof integrated with solar panels. Currently the company installs solar panels on top of its customer's roofs.SolarCity chairman and major shareholder Elon Musk discussed the new product in the company's second quarter earnings call on Tuesday afternoon.The move shows how SolarCity (scty) is shifting to focus on new products as the market for home rooftop solar systems has gotten more competitive and difficult in some states. The new product also appears to be an example of Musk's influence on the company as it undergoes a merger with Tesla.Musk, who joined SolarCity's earnings call for the first time on Tuesday, has long been laser focused on products at Tesla (tsla). He's not only Tesla's CEO but also its "Product Architect."Musk says his goal is for SolarCity to sell solar roof and battery products that make homeowners so excited that they want to show their neighbors. SolarCity plans to launch two new products before the end of the year, and presumably the solar roof will be one of them."It's a solar roof, as opposed to a module on a roof. . . it's not a thing on a roof, it's the roof," said Musk. He added: "it's something that will be a standout."For an inside look at Tesla's Gigafactory, watch: SolarCity's CEO, and Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive said on the earnings call that there are 5 million new roofs bought in the U.S. every year. SolarCity's new roof product would focus on that market.SolarCity's CTO, and Rive's brother, Peter Rive said that SolarCity plans to expedite manufacturing of the company's solar cells and modules to supply technology for the roof product. About two years ago SolarCity bought a solar cell manufacturing startup called Silevo, and now the company plans to use the tech to make its own solar panels at a big factory in Buffalo, New York.Musk pointed to the new planned solar roof product as an example of why SolarCity needs to make its own solar panels. We "need to do manufacturing in house to control the aesthetics," said Musk. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.Musk's attention to energy products at SolarCity puts the company in an unusual position. While consumers commonly buy cars for aesthetic purposes, not many solar customers are currently buying panels because they like how they look. Many solar customers shop around to look for the lowest priced deal they can get.The solar industry has been working on what it calls "building integrated" solar panels for years and a handful of companies have developed these types of rooftop solar systems. Many of these products have failed to make a mark because they usually cost more than standard solar panels, but generate electricity with less efficiency. For example, Dow Chemical just recently stopped selling its solar shingle product, due to underwhelming sales.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
