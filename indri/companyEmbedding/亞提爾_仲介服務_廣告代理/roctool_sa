RocTool SA, the French maker of induction systems that can rapidly heat and cool molds, is a new member of the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation.
RocTool is a strategic partner with IACMI in its Vehicle Scale-Up Facility in the Corktown area of Detroit. Both organizations share a vision for innovation in the world of composites and are enthusiastic about the relationship, officials said.
The partnership aims for lightweighting research and collaboration with automakers on exusting parts, and next-generation applications. The Detroit facility will be equipped with Roctool’s latest induction technologies for compression and injection molding.
“The partnership between Roctool and IACMI ... demonstrates the commitment of both organizations to providing impactful, cost-effective technology solutions to the composites manufacturing ecosystem,” said IACMI CEO Bryan G. Dods.
Support for infrastructure improvements to accommodate RocTool’s equipment has been provided by the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and Michigan State University.
IACMI is based in Knoxville, Tenn.
