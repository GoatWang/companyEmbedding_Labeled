  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBest Ever for Blow Drying and Flat Ironing!ByM Adele Fosteron July 13, 2015Size: 4 oz|Verified PurchaseI don't usually write reviews, but I absolutely had to for this product. I like to flat iron my hair and was looking for a product that would help protect from the heat, but was not heavy and oily. I searched the internet and found out about this product. I read other Amazon reviews and decided to give it a try.  This is one of the BEST if not BEST products I have ever used for flat ironing my hair. I'm a black female. Don't know my hair type by classification, but it's not tightly coiled. More like a loose wave. I can usually blow dry my hair and that straightens it out pretty easily and then flat iron it for a silky smooth finish.  I washed, conditioned and then applied the product to my hair.  It definitely detangles as I was able to run the comb through my hair pretty easily. As I blow dried sections of my hair, I could IMMEDIATELY see and feel that it was soft, light and had great movement. Then to the flat iron. No problem. Hair looks just about as good as coming out of a salon. Over the years I've tried many serums, sprays etc, but this is the one product by far that I've been instantly impressed with. Someone said, you can't go wrong with this product and I TOTALLY AGREE!!!Read more

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsSOME OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE FAKE.........ByLisamarieon November 26, 2015Size: 10 oz|Verified Purchasereally don't know how this is getting such great reviews...I had used this product for 3 years having always bought it from the salon. Then it became to be a bit expensive so I held off on buying more. When I saw this I was so excited, you don't even understand. Ugh. If I only knew then. Since it had been some time since my last purchase I hadn't noticed the differences in the product right away. But it seemed to be leaving a waxy/sticky thick residue on my hair. Leaving it looking dirty within less than 12 hours of a wash. I was sure it was my shampoo never considering that this product I loved was the culprit. I started seeing reviews on fake products and got curious. I stopped using and my problems disappeared. I then bought a smaller bottle from the salon and was so shocked I hadn't noticed the glue smell from my bottle purchased from Amazon it's crazy. After using the REAL stuff my hair was soft and manageable....ugh until i stopped using it, it was ruining my hair!!!!!This is NOT an authentic product. ;(I wish I could say that it is.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsI wouldn't buy againByNikki s.on July 13, 2016Size: 10 oz|Verified PurchaseIve used this product every time I wash my hair. I'm not sure what's so great about it. I thought it's suppose to strengthen the hair, detangler, make shine and all that jazz. I have long hair so detangler is something I look for. This product doesn't really detangle. It doesn't really add shine. Sometimes my hair feels fake from it.Read more0Comment|
