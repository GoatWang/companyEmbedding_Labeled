      GREEN PRODUCTION
    










      Green production is a business strategy that focuses on profitability
      through environmentally friendly operating processes. Proponents of this
      management philosophy contend that green production is a sensible course
      to follow not only because of the benefits that it bestows on the natural
      environment, but also because of its fundamental strategic soundness. As
      Stuart Hart, director of the University of Michigan's Corporate
      Environmental Management Program (CEMP), indicated in 
      
        Northwest Environmental Journal,
      
       "green business strategies based on the principle of environmental
      sustainability may constitute a key basis for competitive advantage in the
      coming decades." Other business observers concur with this
      evaluation. Writing in 
      
        Business Horizons,
      
       J. Stephen Shi and Jane M. Kane asserted that many companies that take a
      proactive stance toward environmental improvements in production have a
      decided advantage over businesses that are indifferent to—or
      actively oppose—new standards: "First, they gain a
      'greener' image in the public eye. Second, because adopting
      new standards takes time and money, they have more time to develop methods
      for reducing waste and can do so on their own schedule. Companies that
      wait until they are forced to change often find themselves in an
      expensive, last-minute scramble to meet the requirements. As a result,
      they end up throwing more money at the problem for a less effective
      solution than their more proactive counterparts."
    

      DEFINING AND INSTITUTING GREEN PRODUCTION PROCESSES
    

      Many people think that green production simply entails instituting
      pollution controls or recycling programs when manufacturing goods. The
      reality, however, is that green production processes seek to minimize the
      impact of the manufacturing process on the environment at every stage. As
      Hart observed in 
      
        Northwest Environmental Journal,
      
       "pollution prevention … can only deliver half the loaf:
      Green production also means that firms transform their input (raw material
      use) and output (product disposition) processes." George Zinkhan
      and Les Carlson agreed, stating in the 
      
        Journal of Advertising
      
       that green consumers "are worried about more than just the
      purchase and the consumption processes. They are also concerned about the
      production process, in terms of scarce resources consumed." Taking
      all these factors into consideration, Hart and P. Shrivastava defined
      green production as follows in a study titled "Greening
      Organizations": "Green production focuses upon three
      fundamental goals: 1) minimize emissions, effluents, and accidents; 2)
      minimize the use of virgin materials and non-renewable forms of energy;
      and 3) minimize the life-cycle cost (cradle to grave) of products or
      services."
    



          "GREEN" USE OF RAW MATERIALS
        

       "Growing concerns over depletion of forests and other natural
      resources, and environmental degradation created by mining and fossil fuel
      production," remarked Hart, "suggest that corporations may
      need to rethink their raw material and procurement strategies."
      Significant sectors of the business community—especially large
      corporations engaged in the lumber and energy industries—continue
      to take issue with such sentiments, arguing that resources remain
      plentiful. But many other businesses, citing the findings of both the
      scientific and environmental communities (or the internal data of their
      marketing arms), have begun to make changes in the ways that they gather
      raw materials for their products. Reliance on recyclable or renewable
      materials, new energy and material conservation initiatives, and
      "replenishment" programs (such as forest replanting
      programs) have all been touted as effective tools in establishing
      processes that do not unduly harm the environment.
    



          GREEN MANUFACTURING/PRODUCTION PROCESSES
        

       Information from industry studies and consumer research is being used to
      develop new products and to redesign existing products and services in
      order to reduce their impact on the environment. In its book 
      
        Green Products by Design,
      
       the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) advocated green design as
      a thoroughly viable goal "in which environmental attributes are
      treated as design objectives, rather than as constraints…. green
      design incorporates environ-mental objectives with minimum loss to product
      performance, useful life or functionality." In fact, supporters of
      green production assert that it makes financial sense for businesses of
      all sizes and shapes to undertake the process of green design.
      "Wasteful and polluting throughput processes lead to inefficient
      use of material and human resources as well as occupational and public
      health risks," wrote Hart in 
      
        Northwest Environmental Journal.
      
       "Just as the 'zero-defects' goal in quality control
      demands preventative action and continuous improvement at every production
      step, a 'zero-waste' goal can focus efforts toward the
      virtual elimination of pollution. This preventative approach has proven
      far more efficient than efforts aimed at controlling discharges at the
      'end of the pipe.' Corporations are realizing that pollution
      prevention can be a cost saving activity (e.g. by lowering compliance,
      waste treatment, disposal, and raw material costs)." Subsequently,
      some businesses have increasingly steered their product and packaging
      designs to use less materials or to be easily disassembled so that
      high-value components can be recycled or refurbished more readily.
    

      Analysts generally agree that product packaging is one of the most visible
      and important elements of an environmentally sensitive production
      operation. Examples of green packaging include the use of recycled content
      in packaging materials, source reduction, and refill alternatives.
      Whatever form the packaging takes, it should clearly state whether green
      claims pertain to the product or to its package. "If the particular
      environmental quality that is lauded applies only to a portion or
      component of the product or packaging, this fact must also be clearly
      indicated," explained Shi and Kane. "For example, a
      manufacturer of aluminum foil displays a 'recyclable' claim
      on a box of aluminum foil with no qualifications. But if only the foil and
      not the box is recyclable, the claim is deceptive. The manufacturer must
      instead distinguish between the product and the packaging in claiming such
      recyclability. The exception to this rule is when only a minor, incidental
      component of the product or packaging is not recyclable."
    



          THE "ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE" COMPANY
        

       As Shrivastava and Hart remarked in "Greening
      Organizations," companies that wish to embrace green production
      philosophies and processes after years of indifference usually have to
      redesign significant aspects of the business, including its mission and
      vision, competitive strategies, core technological systems, performance
      measurement and reward systems, and organizational processes and culture
      (of course, this task is more formidable for larger companies than it is
      for small and mid-sized firms). Of the above elements of a business,
      perhaps none is more important than "mission and vision,"
      for all the other aspects of the organization are fundamentally shaped by
      those values. But while the process of establishing a green production
      company can be quite daunting, proponents argue that cost savings
      associated with pollution prevention efforts, coupled with marketplace
      benefits in the realms of reputation and consumer loyalty, can make the
      shift a beneficial one not only for the environment, but also for the
      company itself.
    

      SMALL BUSINESS AND GREEN PRODUCTION
    

      Although most media attention on green production has been directed at the
      efforts of big corporations, increasing numbers of small companies have
      successfully established ecologically sensitive business practices as
      well. Indeed, some small companies operate in regions or industries that
      are ideally suited to green production. Many companies that provide goods
      (equipment and clothing manufacturers) or services (retail stores, guiding
      services) to backpackers, anglers, mountain bikers, canoeists, kayakers,
      campers, and other aficionados of the outdoors are very careful to operate
      in environmentally friendly ways. Similarly, companies that operate in
      geographical regions that are very supportive of environmental protection
      may well publicize their use of green production methods and philosophies.
      The marketplace goodwill that can be realized in such situations should
      not be underestimated.
    

      Small business consultants, meanwhile, counsel their clients to carefully
      research the obligations that a commitment to green production entails
      before making any decision. Smaller businesses sometimes have difficulty
      securing the necessary financing to switch physical operations to a green
      production mode. Moreover, jumps in other operating costs as a result of
      changes to green production methods sometimes result in higher prices for
      customers, and subsequent drops in sales. While larger companies can
      usually shrug off such ripple effects with ease, smaller businesses are
      often less able to do so. But consultants acknowledge that green
      production methods can boost business as well, increasing sales while
      decreasing production costs. Indeed, proponents argue that for many small
      businesses—and especially new ventures, which do not have
      previously established modes of operation—green production can be a
      rewarding business philosophy.

Equity Financing
Equity financing is a strategy for obtaining capital that involves selling a partial interest in the company to investors. The equity, or ownership position, that investors receive in exchange for their funds usually takes the form of stock in the company. 
Ergonomics
Ergonomics is the process of changing the work environment (equipment, furniture, pace of work, etc.) to fit the physical requirements and limitations of employees, rather than forcing workers to adapt to jobs that can, over time, have a debilitating effect on their physical well-being. Companies of all shapes and sizes have increasingly recognized that establishing an ergonomically sensitive work environment for employees can produce bottom-line benefits in cutting absenteeism, reducing health care costs, and increasing productivity. 
Estate Tax
Estate taxes are taxes due to the federal government upon the death of the owner of a business or estate. At first glance, IRS figures indicate that the tax has a far greater impact on wealthy individuals than on small business owners, but representatives of the latter group insist that it has long been a dreaded levy that packs a deceptive punch among small businesses. 
European Union (EU)
The European Union (EU), formerly known as the European Community (EC), was formed in the 1950s to encourage and oversee political and economic cooperation between numerous European nations. In the nearly half-century since it was formed, the EU has gradually succeeded in becoming the dominant governing economic body in Europe, and it now affects every aspect of business in its member states.
Expense Accounts
Expense accounts, also called expense allowances, are plans under which companies reimburse employees for business-related expenses. These expenses include travel, entertainment, gifts, and other expenses related to the employer's business activity. 
Export-Import Bank
The United States Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank, originally established in 1945, is an independent agency that was created to help finance U.S. exports to industrializing and developing markets by providing loans, credit guarantees, and insurance. 
Exporting
Exporting is the practice of sending or carrying merchandise to a foreign country for trade or sale. International business is a potentially lucrative area for many businesses, but the small business owner should be aware that establishing oneself in a foreign market is a complex, time-consuming task. 
Exporting—Financing and Pricing
One of the most important elements in establishing a successful exporting business is understanding financing and pricing issues associated with international trade. Production costs and product pricing are profoundly interrelated aspects of any business venture; an enterprise has to fully understand its marketing, production, distribution, and other operating costs if it hopes to make an informed decision regarding pricing strategies for its product line. 
Facility Layout and Design
Facility layout and design is an important component of a business's overall operations, both in terms of maximizing the effectiveness of production processes and meeting employee needs and/or desires. Writing in Production and Operations Management, Howard J. 
Facility Management
In an article for Managing Office Technology, Kit Tuveson defined facility management as "the coordination of the physical workplace with the people and work of an organization. It integrates the principles of business administration, architecture, and the behavioral and engineering sciences." In the most basic terms, facility management encompasses all activities related to keeping a complex operating. 
Factoring
Factoring is a form of financing in which a business sells its receivables to a third party or "factor company" at a discounted price. Under this arrangement, the factor agrees to provide financing and other services to the selling business in return for interest and fees on the money that they advanced against receivables invoices. 
Family Limited Partnership
Family limited partnerships (sometimes known as FLPs) are an increasingly popular succession planning alternative utilized by owners of family businesses who want to pass the establishment on to their children without being hit by heavy federal taxes. Neil Alexander, writing in Best's Review, described the family limited partnership as "a legal agreement that allows business owners and their children to address several tax, business-succession, and estate-planning needs all at once. 
Family and Medical Leave Act
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides employees who qualify with up to 12 work weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in a 12-month period for specified family and medical reasons. It also requires group health benefits to be maintained during the leave as if employees continued to work instead of taking leave. 
Family-Owned Businesses
A family-owned business is any business in which two or more family members are involved and the majority of ownership or control lies within a family. Family-owned businesses may be the oldest form of business organization, and today they are recognized as important and distinct participants in the world economy. 
Feasibility Study
A feasibility study is a detailed analysis of a company and its operations that is conducted in order to predict the results of a specific future course of action. Small business owners may find it helpful to conduct a feasibility study whenever they anticipate making an important strategic decision. 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was established as an independent administrative agency pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. The purpose of the FTC is to enforce the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce." The Clayton Antitrust Act (1914) also granted the FTC the authority to act against specific and unfair monopolistic practices. 
Fica Taxes
Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) taxes, which include contributions to federal Social Security and Medicare programs, must be paid by all American workers, whether they are employed by a company or are self-employed. Small businesses that employ persons other than the owner or partners are required to withhold FICA taxes—along with regular income taxes—from the wages paid to employees, remit these taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and make regularly scheduled reports to the IRS about the amount of taxes owed and paid. 
Fiduciary Duty
Fiduciary duty is a legal requirement of loyalty and care that applies to any person or organization that has a fiduciary relationship with another person or organization. A fiduciary is a person, committee, or organization that has agreed to accept legal ownership or control and management of an asset or group of assets belonging to someone else. 
Finance Companies
Commercial finance companies have in recent years become a favorite option for entrepreneurs seeking small business loans. These institutions generally charge higher interest rates than banks and credit unions, but they also are more likely to approve a loan request. 
Finance and Financial Management
Finance and financial management encompass numerous business and governmental activities. In the most basic sense, the term finance can be used to describe the activities of a firm attempting to raise capital through the sale of stocks, bonds, or other promissory notes. 
Financial Analysis
Financial analysis is an aspect of the overall business finance function that involves examining historical data to gain information about the current and future financial health of a company. Financial analysis can be applied in a wide variety of situations to give business managers the information they need to make critical decisions. 
Financial Planners
A good financial planner will conduct an in-depth interview to gather information about the client's income, expenses, assets, liabilities, future goals, and risk tolerance. Then the planner will use this information to develop a detailed, written financial plan specifically for the client. 
Financial Ratios
Financial ratios illustrate relationships between different aspects of a small business's operations. They involve the comparison of elements from a balance sheet or income statement, and are crafted with particular points of focus in mind. 
Financial Statements
Financial statements are written records of business finances, including balance sheets and profit and loss statements. They stand as one of the most essential components of business information, and as the principal method of communicating financial information about an entity to outside parties. 
Firewalls
A firewall is a computer security device that is situated between a small business's internal network and the Internet. It can work at either the software or the hardware level to prevent unwanted outside access to the company's computer system. 
Fiscal Year
A fiscal year is any 52-week period used consistently by an organization for the purposes of financial reporting and policy setting. It may or may not correspond with the typical calendar year of January to December. 
Fixed and Variable Expenses
Fixed and variable expenses are the two main components of a company's total overhead expense. Fixed costs are those that do not fluctuate with changes in production activity level or sales volume, such as rent, insurance, dues and subscriptions, equipment leases, payments on loans, depreciation, management salaries, and advertising. 
Flexible Benefit Plans
Flexible benefit plans allow employees to choose the benefits they want or need from a package of programs offered by an employer. Flexible benefit plans may include health insurance, retirement benefits such as 401(k) plans, and reimbursement accounts that employees can use to pay for out-of-pocket health or dependent care expenses. 
Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
A flexible spending account (FSA) is a tax-deferred savings account established by an employer to help employees meet certain medical and dependent-care expenses that are not covered under the employer's insurance plan. Established under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, FSAs were once known as medical Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). 
Flexible Work Arrangements
Flexible work programs are work arrangements wherein employees are given greater scheduling freedom in how they fulfill the obligations of their positions. The most commonplace of these programs is flextime, which gives workers far greater leeway in terms of the time when they begin and end work, provided they put in the total number of hours required by the employer. 
Flow Charts
A flow chart, or flow diagram, is a graphical representation of a process or system that details the sequencing of steps required to create output. A typical flow chart uses a set of basic symbols to represent various functions, and shows the sequence and interconnection of functions with lines and arrows. 
Focus Groups
A focus group is a marketing research tool in which a small group of people (typically eight to ten individuals) engages in a roundtable discussion of selected topics of interest in an informal setting. The focus group discussion is typically directed by a moderator who guides the discussion in order to obtain the group's opinions about or reactions to specific products or marketing-oriented issues, known as test concepts. 
Forecasting
Forecasting can be broadly considered as a method or a technique for estimating many future aspects of a business or other operation. Planning for the future is a critical aspect of managing any organization, and small business enterprises are no exception. 
Fortune 500
The term Fortune 500 refers to an annual listing by Fortune magazine of the top 500 public companies in the U.S., as ranked by sales, assets, earnings, and capitalization. This list ranks only public companies, or those which have issued securities through an offering and which are traded on the stock market. 
401(K) Plans
A 401(k) plan is a tax-deferred, defined-contribution retirement plan. The name comes from a section of the Internal Revenue Code that permits an employer to create a retirement plan to which employees may voluntarily contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. 
Franchising
Franchising is a kind of licensing arrangement wherein a business owner, known as the "franchisor," distributes or markets a trademarked product or service through affiliated dealers, who are known as "franchisees." While these franchisees own their establishments, terms of franchising agreements typically require them to share operational responsibilities with the franchisor.
Free-Lance Employment/Independent Contractors
Free-lance employees, also known as independent contractors, are individuals who work on their own, without a long-term contractual commitment to any one employer. A free-lance employee usually performs services or completes work assignments under short-term contracts with several employers, or clients, who have the right to control only the final result of the individual's work, rather than the specific means used to get the work done. 
Gender Discrimination
Gender discrimination, also known as sexual discrimination, is the practice of letting a person's sex unfairly become a factor when deciding who receives a job, promotion, or other employment benefit. It most often affects women who feel they have been unfairly discriminated against in favor of a man. 
Globalization
Globalization is the process by which the economies of countries around the world become increasingly integrated over time. This integration occurs as technological advances expedite the trade of goods and services, the flow of capital, and the migration of people across international borders. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is a type of intangible business asset. It is defined as the difference between the fair market value of a company's assets (less its liabilities) and the market price or asking price for the overall company. 
Government Procurement
Many small businesses maintain and increase their operations through reliance on local, state, and federal government contracts. While these businesses may also secure business through the offering of competitive bids on jobs offered by the private sector, small business owners should be aware of the differences in procuring work from the public and private sectors. 
Graphical User Interface
A graphical user interface (GUI, pronounced "gooey") is a computer environment that simplifies the user's interaction with the computer by representing programs, commands, files, and other options as visual elements, such as icons, pull-down menus, buttons, scroll bars, windows, and dialog boxes. By selecting one of these graphical elements, through either use of a mouse or a selection from a menu, the user can initiate different activities, such as starting a program or printing a document. 
Green Marketing
Environmentally-responsible or "green" marketing is a business practice that takes into account consumer concerns about promoting preservation and conservation of the natural environment. Green marketing campaigns highlight the superior environmental protection characteristics of a company's products and services, whether those benefits take the form of reduced waste in packaging, increased energy efficiency in product use, or decreased release of toxic emissions and other pollutants in production. 
Green Production
Green production is a business strategy that focuses on profitability through environmentally friendly operating processes. Proponents of this management philosophy contend that green production is a sensible course to follow not only because of the benefits that it bestows on the natural environment, but also because of its fundamental strategic soundness. 
Grievance Procedures
Grievance procedures are a means of dispute resolution that can be used to address complaints by employees against management or to settle disputes between a company and its suppliers, customers, or competitors. The best-known application of grievance procedures is as a formal process outlined in labor union contracts. 
Groupthink
Groupthink occurs when the pressure to conform within a group interferes with that group's analysis of a problem and causes poor group decision making. Individual creativity, uniqueness, and independent thinking are lost in the pursuit of group cohesiveness, as are the advantages that can sometimes be obtained by making a decision as a group—bringing different sources of ideas, knowledge, and experience together to solve a problem. 
Groupware
Groupware is a category of software designed to help groups work together by facilitating the exchange of information among group members who may or may not be located in the same office. Often, groupware users are collaborating on the same project, although groupware can be used to share a variety of information throughout an entire organization and can also be extended to clients, suppliers, and other users outside the organization. 
Health Insurance Options
Health insurance is a contractual agreement between an individual or group and an insurance provider through which the insurance provider agrees to pay for some or all of the health care costs incurred by the person or group in exchange for their regular payment of a sum known as a premium. In this way, the insurance company assumes the financial risk of reimbursing health care costs, but it is able to offset that risk by collecting premiums from a large number of people, many of whom will have very low medical expenses. 
Health Maintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider Organizations
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) administer the most common types of managed care health insurance plans. Managed care plans typically arrange to provide medical services for members in exchange for subscription fees paid to the plan sponsor—usually an HMO or PPO. 
Health Promotion Programs
A health promotion program—sometimes known as a wellness program—is a type of employee benefit that encompasses the various efforts companies make to promote and maintain their employees' health. Examples of health promotion programs might include company-sponsored smoking cessation training, visits with a nutritionist to receive information about healthy cooking, discounted fitness center memberships, or free cholesterol testing.
High-Tech Business
High-technology businesses are those enterprises engaged in securing growth and revenue from industry sectors characterized by rapidly changing and advanced technology. In fact, advanced technology has come to be utilized in so many different industries that members of the business community now often regard it as its own unique industry subset, with applications across the spectrum of the world of commerce. 
Home Offices
A home office is a space within an individual's personal residence that is used for business purposes. It may be a corner of a spare bedroom equipped with nothing more than a desk. 
Home-Based Business
A home-based business is any enterprise for which the principal administrative and managerial activities take place within an individual's personal residence. People start home-based business ventures for a wide variety of reasons. 
Hoteling
Hoteling is a form of "alternative officing" which allows employees who travel on business or work flexible hours to reserve desk space at the employer's offices as needed, rather than maintaining a permanent work space there. This allows the employer to make more efficient use of office space and thus reduce costs. 
Html
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an authoring tool that is used in creating Internet Web pages. It is the preferred tool for those who wish to make their Web page more accessible and userfriendly because it is able to accelerate downloading over the Internet, although its quickness comes at the expense of formatting control. 
Hubzone Empowerment Contracting Program
The HUBZone Empowerment Contracting Program is an initiative of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) that gives preference in securing federal contracts to small businesses located in "historically underutilized business zones," or HUBZones. 
Human Resource Management
Human Resource Management (HRM) is the term used to describe formal systems devised for the management of people within an organization. These human resources responsibilities are generally divided into three major areas of management: staffing, employee compensation, and defining/designing work. 
Human Resource Management and the Law
The field of human resources management is greatly influenced and shaped by state and federal employment legislation. Indeed, regulations and laws govern all aspects of human resource management, including recruitment, placement, development, and compensation areas.
Human Resource Policies
Human resource policies are the formal rules and guidelines that businesses put in place to hire, train, assess, and reward the members of their work force. These policies, when organized and disseminated in an easily used form—such as an employee manual or large postings—can go far toward eliminating any misunderstandings between employees and employers about their rights and obligations in the business environment. 
Income Statements
An income statement presents the results of a company's operations for a given reporting period. Along with the balance sheet, the statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in owners' equity, the income statement is one of the primary means of financial reporting.

REMANUFACTURING






EQ Renew provides complete remanufacturing services for the Advantage style parallelogram lift.  Whether you have one of the early style “Classic” systems, or the later model GEN II and above, we can remanufacture your lift and deliver a product of better quality than you can buy new today.







UPGRADES






Product upgrades are available to improve the operation and enhance the dependability of your lift. Through the years, we’ve learned what needs to be upgraded or re-engineered to bring about bullet-proof operation. We offer many upgrades in kit form. Call today for details.







SUPPORT






Technical support for your lift is available by phone, email, Skype, or on site. Customers whose lift is no longer under warranty have the same options on a pay-per-use or open account basis. Call today to discuss your support needs.

The 1 Thing More Important than IQ and EQ


Your intellectual and emotional potential are the result of your DNA.  What's important is what you do with whatever you've got.

I recently posted an infographic that provided a view of "personality traits" versus "intelligence levels" as indicators of success.  I decided to let it stand on its own because I believe it does have some value.
However, the infographic also contains some seriously fuzzy thinking that might lead readers astray. Therefore, I'm using this post to pull the infographic apart and to see where it falls badly short.
The infographic has three sections: 1) a premise, 2) a list and 3) a conclusion, so for clarity's sake I'll address each of these elements separately.
Intelligence Versus Personality
The setup for the infographic states that some "personality factors" are more important than "intelligent level. " But what does this mean, exactly?
Does "intelligent levels" mean IQ (Intelligence Quotient) or does it mean level of intellectual skill gained over time?
This is an important distinction.  IQ measures potential not performance. Relevant intellectual skill, by contrast, is crucial to many jobs.
For example, an employee with an IQ of 160 who's skilled in literary criticism is less likely to be useful than an employee with an IQ of 120 who's mastered object-oriented programming.
This is true even if both employees are autistic or even if the employee with the higher IQ is charismatic and the employee with the lower IQ is a dullard. Skills matter.
The premise then quotes a psychologist's list of the "personality factors" more valuable than "intelligence levels."  While make sense, the fifth "extraversion" is absurd.
As I've pointed out previously, extraverts are at a disadvantage in a business world where most of the interaction takes place online.
The only place where extraversion is an advantage are in open offices, which are designed to promote social interaction while reducing actual productivity.
The premise then quotes a study showing that 85% financial success is generated from "people skills" while 15% is from "technical knowledge."  What does that mean, exactly?
A person with zero technical knowledge has little hope of becoming successful, while many entrepreneurs--Bill Gates comes to mind--are definitely not "people-people."
The premise ends with a summary: "Intelligence, it seems, can only take you so far. Hard work and social skill development are the keys to reaching the top."This sudden appearance of "hard work" is odd, because it's the first indication that effort might be required.  I'll have more to say about this later.
The 8 Personality Traits
I agree that all eight of these traits are important.  However, the trait of "Passion" is a bit misleading and even a bet dangerous in practice.
A common business mistake is to wrongly believe that passion is contagious: that expressing your passion for your job, company or product will make other people passionate about it, too.
In fact, your personal enthusiasm is irrelevant to other people, except insofar as the lack of it might indicate incompetence.
In fact, gushing about your passion can come off glad-handing and even make you seem untrustworthy, especially if it's not backed by competence and intellectual skill.
The overall problem here, though, is that these "traits" continually blur the concept of potential versus actualization.  
For example, any parent of multiple children knows that some children are better than others at keeping their temper (i.e. self-regulation.")   Nevertheless, unless a child is seriously impaired, any child can learn to stop throwing tantrums.
Another problem is the catch-all "social skills."  By definition, skills aren't traits; they're something that's learned.  Some people find social interaction easy; others find it more difficult.  Such skills build on potential but they aren't the same thing as potential.
The final statement of this this section that the possession of social skills "ultimately means success," is completely absurd. There are plenty of failures who have great social skills.  (The TV show Better Call Saul, for instance, is a excellent character study of such a person.) 
For some jobs, indeed many jobs, developing requisite intellectual skills are as important or more important than social skills.  Empty suits can only rise so far; after a while people want to see some brains behind the fancy talk.
The Conclusion
The final segment of the infographic brings it's limitations to the forefront by stating that "intelligence" can't be taught but "personality traits" can be developed and enhanced.  
But that's ridiculous.  Of course, intelligence can be taught; that why we attend school, read books, and so forth.  What can't be altered is IQ but that's potential, not actualization.
What can't be taught is "personality traits" which is EQ, which measures potential rather than actualization.  Just as some people have a high IQ, some people have a higher EQ and therefore find people skills easier.
What's important isn't so much your IQ or your EQ, but what you decide to do with whatever potential you've got.  Thomas Edison put it perfectly when he said: "Success is 10 percent inspiration and 90 percent perspiration."
