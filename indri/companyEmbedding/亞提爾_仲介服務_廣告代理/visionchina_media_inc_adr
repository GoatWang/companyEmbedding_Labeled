	VisionChina Media Inc (ADR) (VISN) Dives 7% on Stake Sale Update

VisionChina Media Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:VISN) is off to a lousy start Monday morning after Friday’s run-up from $5.30 to $8.08 was halted pending further news. Today, VISN stock opened 11% lower amid that “further news.” Namely, it announced new details concerning the sale of its subway mobile TV ad business.
For those unfamiliar with VisionChina, its business is in advertising, focusing on China’s mass transportation systems through mobile digital television networks. Currently, VISN has more than 30,000 buses running free Wi-Fi hotspots under the brand name “VIFI” in China.
The deal sees the company selling off 49% of its stake in VisionChina New Culture Media Co, which is VISN’s subway mobile TV ad business, to Ledman Optoelectronic.
CEO Limin Li had this to say:
“The sale of our subway mobile TV advertising business is a critical and strategic step for VisionChina Media, and we remain open in the future to sell the remaining 51% of our equity position in New Culture. We believe the execution of the New Agreements with Ledman will provide significant flexibility to satisfy our working capital needs and allow us to focus our resources on the fast growing WiFi business, and to further strengthen our leading position in China’s urban mass transit WiFi market.”
Ledman agreed to pay VISN 382.2 million yuan, translating to roughly $57.46 million in U.S. dollars. Li anticipates the deal will close in “the near future,” where Ledman will pay an installment of 321.2 million yuan (about $48.3 million) to VisionChina. Under the terms, VISN is required to use the payment in full to buy Ledman shares in a block trade within five business days of the payment.
7 Stocks to Sell or Short Into the Ground
The remaining amount will be paid by Ledman within 10 business days (not including the block trade time allotment) after the close of the deal. Theses shares are subject to a lockup until May 31, 2019, which doesn’t allow VisionChina to sell more than three-fourths of its Ledman shares during the first full year after the lockup expires.
The deal also prevents VISN (and affiliates) from doing similar business to its now-sold New Culture subway mobile TV advertising business for up to eight years after the transaction closes. What’s more, VisionChina is on the hook for its New Culture business if it fails to meets its profit targets (in yuan) of 60 million, 80 million and 100 million, respectively, for 2016, 2017 and 2018. In such cases, VISN will have to pay the difference by returning its acquired Ledman shares, or pay in cash if the shares are not enough.
As of press time, VISN stock was off closer to 7%, with shares bouncing between support at $6.64 and resistance at $8.59. VisionChina temporarily broke above resistance Friday before shares were halted pending news of its revised pact with Ledman.
As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

While the first quarter of each year is typically marked by seasonal weakness, we are confident that our integrated mobile TV network, now enhanced with a wider range of product offerings, will provide advertisers with a comprehensive all-in-one media solution and improve our operations throughout the remainder of 2013. "
      

Stanley Wang, VisionChina Media's chief financial officer, added, "Sequential decreases in various cost and expense items indicate that our cost control measures have effectively built up a very healthy cost structure on which we can implement our operating strategies for the rest of 2013. With an expected rebound in our top line in the second quarter and further revenue improvement in second half of the year, we believe we are on the right track to make significant improvements in our performance as compared to that of 2012."

The letter notified the Company that, based on the Company's filing of its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December, 2012 on May 30, 2013, NASDAQ determined that the Company complies with Rule 5250(c)(1)
      


            Recent developments in the litigation with former Digital Media Group ("DMG") shareholders and management ("Selling Shareholders")
          


        On June 11, 2013, the Appellate Division, First Department of the Supreme Court of the State of New York(the "Appellate Court") entered a Decision and Order determining the pending appeals and cross-appeals from rulings by Hon. Charles E. Ramosof the Supreme Court, New York County(the "Trial Court").  The Appellate Court's ruling (a) affirms the Trial Court's orders of November 3, 2011granting the motions of the Selling Shareholders to dismiss VisionChina Media and Vision Best's claims and counter-claims for fraud, unjust enrichment and declaratory judgment, (b) reverses that part of the Trial Court's order of June 15, 2012that denied the Selling Shareholders' motion for partial summary judgment on the defense asserted by VisionChina Media and Vision Best to the Selling Shareholders' claims for breach of contract, including the defense based on allegations of intentional destruction of certain electronic data that was to be conveyed as part of the sale of DMG's assets, and (c) affirms the Trial Court's denial of the Selling Shareholders' motion to dismiss the breach of contract and indemnity claim asserted by VisionChina Media and Vision Best, seeking an amount not less than US$2,785,633, based on alleged inaccuracies in the representations and warranties within the Merger Agreement.
      

        With respect to the orders entered by the Trial Court regarding the attachment of VisionChina's assets, the Appellate Court's ruling (d) reverses the Trial Court's order entered on November 4, 2011, granting the motion by the Selling Shareholders for pre-judgment attachment of assets of VisionChina Media and Vision Best, (e) reverses the Trial Court's order entered on June 15, 2012, granting the motion by the Selling Shareholders to confirm the two ex parte orders of attachment they previously obtained in the aggregate amount of US$60 million, and (f) reverses the Trial Court's order entered on August 13, 2012, granting the motion of the Selling Shareholders' to compel VisionChina Media and Vision Best to transfer US$60 millioninto New Yorkpursuant to the two ex parte orders of attachment.
      

        As a result of the Appellate Court's Decision and Order, we will promptly seek return of the approximately US$4.5 millioncurrently held by the Sheriff of the City of New Yorkpursuant to the orders of attachment and the order compelling transfer of assets. Among other alternatives, we are determining whether to seek leave to appeal the portions of the Appellate Court's Order that affirmed the dismissal of VisionChina's claims and counter-claims and reversed the denial of the Selling Shareholders' motion for partial summary judgment dismissing VisionChina's defenses, including those based on the allegations of data destruction. 
      

        Business Outlook
      

        The Company estimates its advertising service revenue in the second quarter of 2013 to be between $26.0 million and $27.0 million, excluding 6% VAT.

        These estimates are based on an exchange rate of RMB 6.2666per $1.00.
      

        The Company noted that its guidance is based on its current network that, as of the date of this press release, has already been secured by exclusive agency agreements or joint venture contract, and based on management's current assessment of the possible outcome of pending litigation with the selling shareholders and former management of Digital Media Group.

        Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      

        In addition to VisionChina Media's consolidated financial results under GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP financial measures, including net income/(loss) excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, contingent loss in connection with a litigation, impairment loss and income tax credit in connection with the impairment loss. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with another method for assessing VisionChina Media's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. Readers are cautioned not to view non-GAAP results on a stand-alone basis or as a substitute for results under GAAP, or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of VisionChina Media's liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. The Company computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter.
