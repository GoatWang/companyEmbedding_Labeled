"Many IMS items have common details, but many specifications which can make finding your part cumbersome. When you see the IMS Filters Button after a part search, click on it to open our filters panel which allows you to narrow your search down by selecting criteria that allows you to find your part faster than ever! It is a feature you won't find on competitors websites. Just another example of IMS innovation. Helping molders since 1949."

A Scenic Marathon Route
Carmina Stremlau

In my previous blog, City Girl at Heart, I described the way in which San Francisco has shaped my life and instilled in me a love for the unique places and atmosphere that one finds in the hills and valleys along the Bay.  The sights and sounds of San Francisco, combined with the natural warmth and diversity of its people, leave a lasting impression on those who arrive for a brief visit as tourists, or the lucky ones who call this place 'home,' as I once did.  Whether by cable car or on foot, in an Uber or by bike in the green lane, an adventure around the City is typically an enriching, spontaneous experience.  Some of my most memorable (and oftentimes demanding) moments in San Francisco came during the annual marathon, a race that gives meaning to the term 'hill repeat' which describes the training required to make it, with a respectable time, to the finish line.  more
