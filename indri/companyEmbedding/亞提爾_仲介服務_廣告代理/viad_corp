The Markets we Serve
The Live Events industry is a large market and GES serves all major segments with a dominant position in Exhibitions. We are pursuing a focused and disciplined growth strategy, with the goal of expanding our share in the currently under-penetrated Corporate Event and Conference segments. These segments offer strong growth opportunity with a higher margin profile than Exhibitions, which will help to improve profitability and diversify our revenue mix over the long-term.





Exhibitions
The primary purpose is to facilitate B2B & B2C sales/marketing.  Host and exhibitors typically pay for services.










Conferences
The primary purpose is to facilitate attendee education; expo or trade show may be held in conjunction to further facilitate attendee education. Host and exhibitors typically pay for services.














Corporate Events
The primary purpose is to facilitate attendee education of sponsoring company’s products or product ecosystem. Corporation or host pays for services.









Consumer Events
The primary purpose is to entertain, educate or create an experience, typically around a specific genre.






















GES offers a comprehensive and award-winning range of services and innovative technology, including creative design, strategy, audio visual, show production and event accommodations to help our clients maximize performance and achieve their visions through face-to-face experiences. In connection with our focused growth strategy, we have made important acquisitions of leading Audio-Visual (AV) production and Event Technology firms. These new services are a perfect complement to our Core Services. They also have higher-margins and provide a more compelling offering to penetrate Corporate Events and Conferences where AV is larger portion of the total spend.

  Viad Corp (NYSE: VVI) today announced second quarter 2017 net income attributable to Viad of $27.9 million, or $1.37 per share, and income before other items of $24.9 million*, or $1.22 per share*. These results exceeded the company's prior guidance primarily driven by stronger than expected revenue growth of 12.3 percent and solid execution at both business units.                            Q2  2017               Q2  2016                y-o-y  Change     $ in millions, except per share data                                             Revenue             $   364.8         $   324.7         12.3   %     Organic Revenue*               350.9           321.5         9.1   %                                       Net Income Attributable to Viad             $   27.9         $   19.5         43.3   %     Income Before Other Items*               24.9           21.1         17.9   %     Income Before Other Items per Share*               1.22           1.04         17.3   %                                       Adjusted Segment Operating Income*             $    40.5         $   34.8          16.4   %     Adjusted Segment EBITDA*               55.0           44.9          22.4   %                                         Revenue of $364.8 million increased 12.3% ($40.0 million) year-over-year, or 9.1% ($29.4 million) on an organic basis (which excludes the impact of acquisitions and exchange rate variances).     The organic revenue growth primarily reflects strong underlying growth at both business units and positive show rotation at GES.   The acquisitions of ON Services (August 2016), FlyOver Canada (December 2016) and the Poken event visitor engagement technology (March 2017) contributed incremental revenue of $19.7 million.   Exchange rate variances had an unfavorable impact on revenue of $9.1 million.     Adjusted segment operating income, adjusted segment EBITDA and income before other items improved compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the increase in revenue.    Steve Moster, president and chief executive officer, commented, "Viad delivered another quarter of strong results that exceeded our prior guidance as positive business momentum at both GES and Pursuit carried into the second quarter. We are realizing the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and favorable industry trends. Our teams executed well during the quarter and did an excellent job converting the increased revenue into profitable growth. Our income per share came in $0.23 above the high end of our prior guidance range and adjusted segment EBITDA margins improved by 130 basis points year-over-year."

Service Industries Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The service industry is a compilation of sectors wherein companies or institutions are rendering services to the consumers in profiteering or non profiteering basis. 
	 This ranges from transportation, postal and warehousing, information sector services, banks, securities, commodities and other financial investment services, catering, rental and leasing services, civic affairs, cable TV, insurance, law, telecom, aviation, administrative and support services, waste management and remediation, health care and social assistance and arts, entertainment and recreation services etc. With the increase in industrialization and population, the need for the service industry has also escalated. Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers. As the economy of many nations in todays date chugs on the growth of the service sector as it is contributing a substantial part to the GDP of a nation, hence it is a vital worldwide business prospect. As per service industry reports of a global survey, it has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals. Therefore it wont be wrong to say that the service sector has today become a prominent feature for the smooth flowing of the economy of a nation as huge volumes of business just depend on this sector.
