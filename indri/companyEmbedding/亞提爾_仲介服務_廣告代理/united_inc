 4 out of 5   Sohail Raza – July 19, 2016  It’s nice stylish and good price. The best thing is it’s adjustable for all ages of kids.








 5 out of 5   Jessica Sparks – August 23, 2016  I purchased the kids adjustable blue and white desk (desk top also lifts up) Got here the next day and my son likes it!








 5 out of 5   Felicia – November 3, 2016  Both the table and chair are designed to grow with your child, the tilting top and drawer are nice features. It came in many parts, thankfully, my husband was here to assemble it, It took my husband about 15 minutes.








 4 out of 5   Muhammad Hasnain – November 28, 2016  I bought UCSA2 for my daughter. We are satisfied with product quality and reliability.

 5 out of 5   Rochelle J – January 21, 2017  Everything I was looking for in a desk! Ages 3-10 is a complete understatement. Im a grown adult and can happily adjust this desk to fit me. My 4yr fits perfect. I doubt i ever have to buy a new desk








 4 out of 5   orathai sae-ia – February 6, 2017  Nice desk, I love about everything but the height adjustment is not easy sometimes to make it level and lock in place.








 4 out of 5   Yasmin Hummadi – February 21, 2017  Perfect solid stable comfortable durable
Perhaps a bit more storage space will make it even better!

 5 out of 5   Alliston Flooring – April 19, 2017  Shopping online these days is hard because you don’t know what you’re gonna get until you actually get it. That wasn’t the case with United Canada. Everything I ordered for my office was GREAT quality! I definitely recommend this company. Prices are reasonable  and even better, shipping was SUPER FAST!
