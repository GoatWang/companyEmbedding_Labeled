(Headquarters: Tokyo, Japan; President and COO: Masataka Okuda; TSE First Section: 9715; hereafter, transcosmos) has concluded a service provider partner contract with Dassault Systemes Co., Ltd. (hereafter, Dassault Systemes). From here on transcosmos will be enhancing engineering solution services which mainly focus on areas such as design development operations support and CAD system operations.
Dassault Systemes is a world leader in the areas of 3D design software, 3D digital mock-up and product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions. The various solutions in the 3D EXPERIENCE Platform, which consists of elements such as the 3-CAD “CATIA” and the PLM system “ENOVIA” also provided by the company, are used in a variety of product development operations in a wide range of industrial fields. These include major domestic and foreign automakers and aircraft-related manufacturers, as well as high-tech, shipbuilding and industrial machinery industries. transcosmos has been providing engineering solution services using CAD since 1984, and more recently it has been actively pursuing BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) in this field.
Based on this new service provider partner agreement, transcosmos will be able to achieve a close and strategic partnership with Dassault Systemes. Our aim is to efficiently provide services to meet more client needs by sharing the know-how, global case studies, core technologies and latest knowledge possessed by both companies, and jointly building a more advanced and extensive coverage system which is necessary for proposals and implementation of the 3D EXPERIENCE Platform offered by Dassault Systemes.
transcosmos aims to contribute to the resolution of business challenges in a variety of manufacturing industries, such as responses to drastically changing markets and innovative improvements that add value to consumer products. This will be accomplished through further enhancement of a complete set of engineering IT services ranging from introduction and formulation to the operation and maintenance of engineering information systems and a complete set of services related to design development ranging from design to production, as well as further promoting the globalization of our business.
We have received the following comments from Mr. Seiji Kajiya, the President and CEO of Dassault Systemes. “We are very pleased to be able to welcome transcosmos as our first service provider partner in Japan. We introduced the 3D EXPERIENCE Platform in 2012 and we are now actively developing it. With the conclusion of this agreement, we are expecting more opportunities to have our 3D EXPERIENCE Platform utilized by both domestic and overseas customers.”
Service provider partners of Dassault Systemes develop the necessary personnel who possess skills in areas such as expert knowledge and technologies related to the products of Dassault Systemes, and they provide services together with the company’s Industry Services Division in order to support effective introduction and utilization of Dassault Systemes products. transcosmos is the first Japanese company to become a service provider partner for Dassault Systemes.

Service Industries Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The service industry is a compilation of sectors wherein companies or institutions are rendering services to the consumers in profiteering or non profiteering basis. 
	 This ranges from transportation, postal and warehousing, information sector services, banks, securities, commodities and other financial investment services, catering, rental and leasing services, civic affairs, cable TV, insurance, law, telecom, aviation, administrative and support services, waste management and remediation, health care and social assistance and arts, entertainment and recreation services etc. With the increase in industrialization and population, the need for the service industry has also escalated. Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers. As the economy of many nations in todays date chugs on the growth of the service sector as it is contributing a substantial part to the GDP of a nation, hence it is a vital worldwide business prospect. As per service industry reports of a global survey, it has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals. Therefore it wont be wrong to say that the service sector has today become a prominent feature for the smooth flowing of the economy of a nation as huge volumes of business just depend on this sector.
