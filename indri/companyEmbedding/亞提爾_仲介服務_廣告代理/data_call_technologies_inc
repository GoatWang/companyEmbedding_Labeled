We hate the waste of data, because it is the root cause of inefficiency.Learn MoreCreate a Culture of ImprovementManufacturing is competitive. Especially as clients demand more competitive pricing, higher quality, and faster delivery. It’s no surprise that manufacturing was first to adopt Lean principles and equivalents for survival. Lean is hygiene in industry. ”Leaner” is crucial for survival. Reducing waste and becoming more efficient is essential.Learn MoreConfidence for Your CustomersAn infinite, searchable record of production variables and results allows engineers to solve all problems that occur. Every root-cause can be seen, understood, and fixed. The proof is shown in the product you deliver, and in the Oden database.

Data Call Technologies, Inc. - New Product Release 



FRIENDSWOOD, TX--(Marketwired - Mar 22, 2016) -  Data Call Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: DCLT) (the "Company" or "Data Call") is a company specializing in the production, curation, aggregation and delivery of news and information content for the Digital Signage and Corporate Communication industries. The Company has been recognized by its peers as a pioneer with the wide range of its product offerings for the Digital Signage space since the early part of this decade. 
Last week the Company displayed its core content offerings of News, Sports and Weather at the 2016 Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. As promised earlier, Data Call followed through and released a sizeable amount of new products qualifying to part of their tag line "...and a whole lot more" at the Expo. All of the added products are playlist ready video and/or motion graphics, formatted for full screen viewing. 
In the General Interest category http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/general-interest/, the company added "Travel", "Animal Facts", "Picture Trivia", and an "HD Quote of the day".
In the Video category, the company introduced a Video in Demand editorial product "DCFlix ViD" http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/video/ 
The Company has also added a completely new category -- Health and Wellness. http://www.datacalltech.com/health-and-wellness/. This is an evidence based category including "Healthy Eating", "Wellness Top 10s", "Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables", "Healthy Workforce", and "Did you Know?" content.
Tim Vance, the company's CEO, stated, "I am extremely happy with the activity resulting from this year's expo. Our timing is on point with the addition of these latest products. The DS networks are now built and running. Networks and end users alike are in search of engaging content. Relevant, dynamic content. Check! We've got it. As we have been preaching -- Feed the Beast! Over the last couple of years, we have seen DS integration with smart phones. We are now witnessing the full circle between of both Digital Signage and Mobile products. It is not a battle of devices, yet a special harmony of the two. Our content keeps the DS screens fresh and vibrant while the network operators focus on their direct message to their audiences and integration with smart devices for rewards programs, recognition, and full viewer engagement. We empower the DS operators to leave the bulk of the content to us while they focus on other initiatives within their network's reach. The addition of this latest content has immediately opened doors to sectors that we have in the past struggled for presence in. It is a very exciting time for the company."

(  OTCQB :  DCLT ) (the "Company" or "Data Call") is a company specializing in the production, curation, aggregation and delivery of news and information content for the Digital Signage and Corporate Communication industries. The Company has been recognized by its peers as a pioneer with the wide range of its product offerings for the Digital Signage space since the early part of this decade.Last week the Company displayed its core content offerings of News, Sports and Weather at the 2016 Digital Signage Expo in Las Vegas. As promised earlier, Data Call followed through and released a sizeable amount of new products qualifying to part of their tag line "...and a whole lot more" at the Expo. All of the added products are playlist ready video and/or motion graphics, formatted for full screen viewing.In the General Interest category http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/general-interest/, the company added "Travel", "Animal Facts", "Picture Trivia", and an "HD Quote of the day".In the Video category, the company introduced a Video in Demand editorial product "DCFlix ViD" http://www.datacalltech.com/content-feed-the-beast/video/The Company has also added a completely new category -- Health and Wellness. http://www.datacalltech.com/health-and-wellness/. This is an evidence based category including "Healthy Eating", "Wellness Top 10s", "Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables", "Healthy Workforce", and "Did you Know?" content.Tim Vance, the company's CEO, stated, "I am extremely happy with the activity resulting from this year's expo. Our timing is on point with the addition of these latest products. The DS networks are now built and running. Networks and end users alike are in search of engaging content. Relevant, dynamic content. Check! We've got it. As we have been preaching -- Feed the Beast! Over the last couple of years, we have seen DS integration with smart phones. We are now witnessing the full circle between of both Digital Signage and Mobile products. It is not a battle of devices, yet a special harmony of the two. Our content keeps the DS screens fresh and vibrant while the network operators focus on their direct message to their audiences and integration with smart devices for rewards programs, recognition, and full viewer engagement. We empower the DS operators to leave the bulk of the content to us while they focus on other initiatives within their network's reach. The addition of this latest content has immediately opened doors to sectors that we have in the past struggled for presence in. It is a very exciting time for the company."For future press releases and more information on the company, please visit www.datacalltech.comForward-Looking Statements Statements contained herein, which are not historical facts, including statements about plans and expectations regarding business areas and opportunities, demand and acceptance of new or existing businesses, capital resources and future financial results are "forward-looking" statements as contemplated by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
