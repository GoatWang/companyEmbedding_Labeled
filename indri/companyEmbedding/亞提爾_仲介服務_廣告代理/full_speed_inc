Other Resources
These are some resources useful to USB developers:
High Speed USB Platform Design Guidelines (.pdf
 file format, size 298k) This document provides guidelines for 
integrating a high-speed USB host controller onto a 4-layer desktop 
motherboard. It covers board design, EMI/ESD, and front panel USB 
guidelines. 
Requirements and Recommendations for USB Products with Embedded Hosts and/or Multiple Receptacles (.pdf
 file format, size 289k) will assist developers of products that don't 
fall into the traditional categories of host, hub or peripheral. An 
ever-increasing number of USB peripherals are being designed with more 
than a single device port, some including host ports that are intended 
to support only a limited set of peripherals.
USB-IF Compliance is expanding its coverage to ensure more complete testing of these types of products.Labs

GV-SD2301
20x PoE Outdoor Full HD IP Speed Dome


     
          The GV-IP Speed Dome (GV‐SD2301) is a network PTZ camera designed for image quality and adaptability in various environments. This camera offers image of 1080p at 30 fps, 720p at 60 fps and 20x optical zoom, capable of showing smooth live view with great detail. In low-light environments, image quality is promised with its image processing tools, such as IR-cut filter (ICR), Wide Dynamic Range Pro (WDR Pro), Backlight Compensation and noise reduction.

Wide surveillance coverage is made possible with 360° endless panning and -20 ~ 200° tilting capacity. Dome movements such as Preset, Sequence, Auto Pan, Cruise and Tour can be programmed and activated by schedule. You can create multiple dome movement modes and have different modes enabled at different time slots. The GV-IP Speed Dome provides variable pan/tilt speeds ranging from a fast patrol of 460° per second to a slow ramble of 0.5° per second with 0.2° pan accuracy for fast and accurate tracking ability. 

GeoVision offers a complete series of GV-IP Speed Dome for indoor and outdoor use, and also optional mounting kits for outdoor installations on wall, ceiling and pole.
