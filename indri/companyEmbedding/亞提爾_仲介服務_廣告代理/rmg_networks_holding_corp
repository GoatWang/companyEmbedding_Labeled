(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  The Company was formed on January 5, 2011 for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets. The Company consummated the acquisition of RMG on April 8, 2013 and on April 19, 2013 acquired Symon Holdings Corporation ("Symon"). Symon is considered to be the Company's predecessor corporation for accounting purposes.  As a result of its two acquisitions, the Company is a global provider of media applications and enterprise-class digital signage solutions. Through an extensive suite of products, including media services, proprietary software, software-embedded hardware, maintenance and creative content service, installation services, and third-party displays, the Company delivers complete end-to-end intelligent visual communication solutions to its clients. The Company is one of the largest integrated digital signage solution providers globally and conducts operations through its RMG Media Networks and its RMG Enterprise Solutions business units.  The RMG Media Networks business unit engages elusive audience segments with relevant content and advertising delivered through digital place-based networks. These networks include the RMG Airline Media Network. The RMG Airline Media Network is a U.S.-based network focused on selling advertising across airline digital media assets in executive clubs, on in-flight entertainment, or IFE, systems, on in-flight Wi-Fi portals and in private airport terminals. The network, which spans almost all major commercial passenger airlines in the United States, delivers advertising to an audience of affluent travelers and business decision makers in a captive and distraction-free video environment.  The RMG Enterprise Solutions business unit provides end-to-end digital signage applications to power intelligent visual communication implementations for critical contact center, supply chain, employee communications, hospitality, retail and other applications with a large concentration of customers in the financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceutical, utility and transportation industries, and in federal, state and local governments. These solutions are relied upon by approximately 70% of the North American Fortune 100 companies and thousands of overall customers in locations worldwide. The installations of Enterprise Solutions deliver real-time intelligent visual content that enhance the ways in which organizations communicate with employees and customers. The solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with a customer's IT infrastructure and data and security environments.  Revenue  The Company derives its revenue as follows:  ? Advertising  ? Product sales:  ? Licenses to use its proprietary software products; ? Proprietary software-embedded media players; ? Proprietary LED displays; and  ? Customer support services:  ? Product maintenance services; and  ? Professional installation and training services  Revenue is recognized as outlined in "Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" below.  RMG Media Networks Revenues  The Company sells advertising through agencies and directly to a variety of customers under contracts ranging from one month to one year. Contracts usually specify the network placement, the expected number of impressions (determined by passenger or visitor counts), and the cost per thousand impressions ("CPM") over the contract period to arrive at a contract amount. The Company bills for these advertising services as required by the customer, but most frequently on a monthly basis following the delivery of the contracted ad insertions. Revenue is recognized at the end of the month in which fulfillment of the advertising orders occurred.  RMG Enterprise Solutions Revenues  The Company sells its Enterprise products and services through its global sales force and through a select group of resellers and business partners. In the United States, approximately 90% or more of its enterprise sales are generated solely by the Company's sales team, with 10% or less through resellers in 2013. In the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the Middle East and India, the situation is reversed, with around 85% of sales coming from the reseller channel. Overall, approximately 67% of the Company's global enterprise revenues are derived from direct sales, with the remaining 33% generated through indirect partner channels.  The Company has formal contracts with its resellers that set the terms and conditions under which the parties conduct business. The resellers purchase products and services from the Company, generally with agreed-upon discounts, and resell the products and services to their customers, who are the end-users of the products and services. The Company does not offer contractual rights of return other than under standard product warranties, and product returns from resellers have been insignificant to date. The Company sells directly to its resellers and recognizes revenue on sales to resellers upon delivery, consistent with its recognition policies. The Company bills resellers directly for the products and services they purchase. Software licenses and product warranties pass directly from the Company to the end-users.  Cost of Revenue  RMG Media Networks Revenues  The cost of revenue associated with RMG Media Networks revenues consists primarily of revenue sharing with the Company's airline and other business partners. Revenue sharing payments to airlines and other business partners are made on a monthly basis under either under minimum annual guarantees, or as a percentage of advertising revenues following collection from customers. The portion of revenue shared with partners ranges from 25% to 80% depending on the partner and the media asset. The Company makes minimum annual payments to three partners and revenue sharing payments to all other partners. The Company's partnership agreements have terms generally ranging from one to five years. Four of the Company's partnership agreements renew automatically unless terminated prior to renewal, and the remaining agreements have no obligation to renew.  RMG Enterprise Solutions Revenues  The cost of revenue associated with RMG Enterprise Solutions product sales consist primarily of the costs of media players, the costs of third-party flat screen displays and the operating costs of the Company's assembly and distribution center. The cost of revenue of professional services is the salary and related benefit costs of the Company's employees and the travel costs of personnel providing installation and training services. The cost of revenue of maintenance and content services consists of the salary and related benefit costs of personnel engaged in providing maintenance and content services and the annual costs associated with acquiring data from third-party content providers.  Operating Expenses  The Company's operating expenses are comprised of the following components:  ? Sales and marketing expenses include salaries and related benefit costs of sales personnel, sales commissions, travel by sales and sales support personnel, and marketing and advertising costs.  ? Professional fees paid to attorneys, accountants, consultants and other professionals in connection with the acquisitions of RMG and Symon.  ? Depreciation and amortization costs include depreciation of the Company's office furniture, fixtures and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.  Given the nature of the formation of the Company, its financial results are required to be reported on a basis that includes various groupings of the three companies (RMG Networks Holding Corporation, RMG and Symon), and for different time periods, both before and after the two acquisitions.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the period from April 20, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013  As discussed above, the Company acquired RMG on April 8, 2013 and Symon on April 19, 2013. Prior to its acquisition, Symon had a January 31 fiscal year end. The financial statements for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 include the results of operations of RMG Networks, RMG, and Symon (the "Successor Company") for 256 days. The financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the results of operations of Symon (the "Predecessor Company") for the entire year. As a result, the financial results shown are not generally comparable on a meaningful basis.   Successor Predecessor Company Company April 20, 2013 through Year Ended December 31, January 31, Change 2013 2013 Dollars % Revenue $ 50,277,647 $ 42,528,391 $ 7,749,256 18.2 % Cost Of Revenue 29,685,596 18,441,521 11,244,075 61.0 % Gross Profit 20,592,051 24,086,870 (3,494,819 ) -14.5 % Operating Expenses - Sales and marketing 12,681,559 7,760,739 4,920,820 63.4 % General and administrative 12,871,283 7,313,398 5,557,885 76.0 % Research and development 2,623,791 2,103,078 520,713 24.8 % Acquisition expenses 2,095,250 380,000 1,715,250 451.4 % Depreciation and amortization 4,956,622 1,111,948 3,844,674 345.8 % Total Operating Expenses 35,228,505 18,669,163 16,559,342 88.7 % Operating Income (Loss) (14,636,454 ) 5,417,707 (20,054,161 ) -370.16 % Warrant liability income charge 1,960,211 - 1,960,211 - Interest expense and other - net (3,327,148 ) (66,467 ) (3,260,681 ) - Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (16,003,391 ) 5,351,240 (21,354,631 ) -399.1 % Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (3,003,088 ) 1,860,190 (4,863,278 ) -261.4 % Net Income (Loss) $ (13,000,303 ) $ 3,491,050 $ (16,491,353 ) -472.4 %  Revenue  Revenue was $50,277,647 and $42,528,391 for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This represents a $7,749,256 or 18.2%, increase. This difference in revenue is due to the fact that revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 include advertising revenues for the Successor Company, while revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the revenues of the Predecessor Company. Revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 have also been reduced by $4,399,479 to reflect the adjustment to market value of the Company's deferred revenue accounts at the acquisition date in accordance with US GAAP.  During the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, the Company's revenues were derived as follows.   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20, 2013 Year through ended December 31, January 31, 2013 2013 Revenue : Advertising $ 15,963,107 $ - Products 18,488,304 19,185,359 Maintenance and content services 7,537,024 17,065,483 Professional services 8,289,212 6,277,549 Total $ 50,277,647 $ 42,528,391  The fluctuations in the components of revenues between the two periods are due to the same reasons stated above with respect to total revenues. Specifically, the RMG Media Networks business unit was not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013, and, as a result, there was no advertising revenue. In addition, revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 are for the Successor Company for a 256 day period while revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 are for the Predecessor Company for a 365 day period.  The following table reflects the Company's sales on a geographic basis.   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20, 2013 through Year ended December 31, January 31, 2013 2013 North America $ 40,235,491 80.0 % $ 29,750,058 70.0 % EMEA 10,042,156 20.0 % 12,778,333 30.0 % Total $ 50,277,647 100.0 % $ 42,528,391 100.0 %  The increase in North America business for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 was due to the inclusion of the RMG Media Networks advertising revenues which were almost exclusively generated in North America. The RMG Media Networks business unit was not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013.  We believe that a better basis for comparing the Company's financial results can be found in Note #14 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing that provides unaudited "Pro-Forma" financial results for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. These Pro-Forma financial results present the Company's results of operations assuming the acquisitions of Reach Media and Symon had occurred on January 1, 2012 and the Company had operated as a combined entity since that date. The financial results include the following entries required under GAAP purchase accounting guidelines:  ? Amortization expense includes amortization of the fair value of Intangible Assets that were acquired.  ? Revenues have been reduced based on the adjustment to market value of the Company's customer order backlog that existed at the acquisition date.  Operating expenses do not include:  ? Any acquisition related expenses.  ? The charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in 2012.  The Pro-Forma financial results reflect revenues of $72,294,886 and $64,632,528 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These revenue totals include reductions in revenues of $577,749 and $4,684,396 in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting from the adjustment to market value of the Company's customers' order backlog in accordance with GAAP purchase accounting guidelines. Excluding the reductions, the Company's revenues were $3,555,711, or 5.1%, higher in 2013 than in 2012.  Differences in the composition of the Company's revenues for the two Pro-Forma periods are as follows:  ? Advertising revenues for the Company's Media Networks business unit totaled $23,217,226 and $21,635,113 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This is a $1,582,113, or 7.3%, increase.  ? Excluding the revenue reductions previously discussed, revenues generated by the Company's Enterprise Solutions business unit totaled $48,094,564 and $43,646,851 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. This represents a $4,447,713, or 10.2%, increase in revenues in 2013.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue totaled $29,685,596 and $18,441,521 for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and for the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This $11,244,075, or 61%, increase in cost of revenue is directly attributable to the previous explanations given for the fluctuations in revenues, i.e., the cost of revenues are comprised of cost of revenue totals for different time periods and different groupings of companies.  The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's revenue and cost of revenue for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013.   Successor Company Predecessor April 20 Company through Year ended Change December 31, January 31, 2013 % 2013 % Dollars % Revenue - Advertising $ 15,963,107 31.7 % $ - - $ 15,963,107 - Products 18,488,304 36.8 % 19,185,359 45.1 % (697,055 ) -3.6 % Maintenance and content services 7,537,024 15.0 % 17,065,483 40.1 % (9,528,459 ) -55.8 % Professional services 8,289,212 16.5 % 6,277,549 14.8 % 2,011,663 32.0 % Total 50,277,647 100.0 % 42,528,391 100.0 % 7,749,256 18.2 % Cost of Revenue - Advertising 10,718,458 36.1 % - - 10,718,458 - Products 11,974,491 40.4 % 11,581,070 62.8 % 393,421 3.4 % Maintenance and content services 1,759,866 5.9 % 2,507,840 13.6 % (747,974 ) -29.8 % Professional services 5,232,781 17.6 % 4,352,611 23.6 % 880,170 20.2 % Total $ 29,685,596 100.0 % $ 18,441,521 100.0 % 11,244,075 61.0 %  The fluctuations in the components of cost of revenues between the two periods are due to the same reasons stated above with respect to total revenues. Specifically, since the Media Networks business unit is not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013, there is no advertising revenue for that period and, as a result, no associated cost of advertising revenue.  The following table reflects the Company's gross margins for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013:   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20 through Year ended December 31, 2013 January 31, 2013 $ % $ % Advertising $ 5,244,649 32.9 % - - Products 6,513,813 35.2 % 7,604,289 39.6 % Maintenance and content services 5,777,158 76.7 % 14,557,643 85.3 % Professional services 3,056,431 36.9 % 1,924,938 30.7 % Total 20,592,051 41.0 % 24,086,870 56.6 %  The Company's overall gross margin for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 decreased to 41.0% from 56.6% for the year ended January 31, 2013. The lower gross margin was primarily attributable to the following:  ? Revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 have been reduced by $4,399,479 to reflect the amortization of the Company's customer order backlog from the date of acquisition in accordance with US GAAP.  ? Advertising revenue, which comprised 31.7% of total revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013, generates a lower gross margin than the average gross margin for the Company's other products and services. As previously noted, there was no advertising revenue in the year ended January 31, 2013.  ? The Company also had a lower gross margin on product sales in the period ended December 31, 2013 because of sales mix.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses totaled $35,228,505 and $18,669,163 for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This $16,559,342, or 88.7%, increase in operating expenses is also directly attributable to the previous explanations given for the fluctuations in revenues and cost of revenues, i.e., the operating expenses are comprised of operating expense totals for different time periods and different groupings of companies.  In addition, during the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 the Company incurred acquisition expenses of $2,095,250 and amortization expense of $4,368,000 related to the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions of RMG and Symon in accordance with GAAP purchase accounting guidelines.  A comparison of operating expenses shown in the Pro-Forma financial results reflects that pro-forma operating expenses totaled $44,678,417 and $34,148,728 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As previously discussed, operating expenses do not include any acquisition related expense or the charge for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in 2012. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to implementing the Company's multiple new sales growth initiatives. These initiatives include additional sales and sales support personnel and new marketing programs, materials and personnel. In addition, the Company incurred additional general and administrative expenses related to expanding its infrastructure, both personnel and systems, and various public company expenses.  Warrant Liability Expense  The Company calculates its warrant liability based on the quoted market value of its outstanding warrants. The warrant liability income credit for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 of $1,960,211 represents the decrease in the Company's warrant liability during that period. The financial results for 2012 include only the results of Symon, which had no outstanding warrants.  Interest and other - Net  Interest expense and other - net for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 increased by $3,260,681 compared to the year ended January 31, 2013, primarily due to the following items:  ? Interest expense of $2,063,997 related to the Company's borrowings that were used finance the acquisition of Symon.  ? Loan origination fees of $876,774.  ? Costs of $263,398 incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Company's debt.  The financial results shown for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the Predecessor Company which had no outstanding debt.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's primary source of liquidity prior to acquiring RMG and Symon had been the cash generated from its initial public offering. Historically, Symon has generated cash from the sales of its products and services to its global customers. In addition, both RMG and Symon had realized cash through debt agreements with lenders.  In April 2013, the Company entered into two debt agreements whereby it received $34,000,000 of cash. These funds were used to finance the acquisition of Symon.  In August 2013, the Company completed a public offering of 5,365,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share, minus the underwriters' discount of $0.56 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $39.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to prepay a portion of its outstanding senior indebtedness.  The Company has entered into revenue sharing agreements with certain customers that require the Company to make minimum revenue sharing payments of $7,842,448 in 2014, $8,619,842 in 2015, and $6,000,000 in 2016.  At December 31, 2013, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $8,235,566. This includes cash and cash equivalents of $1,696,475 held in bank accounts of its subsidiaries located outside the United States. The Company currently plans to use this cash to fund its ongoing foreign operations. If the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its subsidiary located outside the United States, it may incur tax liabilities.  Management feels that the Company has an adequate amount of cash to operate the Company for at least twelve months from December 31, 2013. Despite our present liquidity position, however, if we fail to achieve the level of revenues that we forecast, including as a result of an extended downturn or lower than expected demand for our products and services, we could generate less cash flow than we have budgeted. Under those circumstances, our cash on hand and funds from operations may not be sufficient to fund our operations or pursue strategic transactions, and we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.  At December 31, 2013 the Company had outstanding debt of $8,000,000. This debt represents the remaining balance of the borrowings the Company made in connection with the acquisition of Symon as discussed above and the additional funds borrowed when the Company refinanced its debt on November 14, 2013.  The Company has generated and used cash as follows:   Successor Predecessor Company Company April 20, 2013 through December 31, Year Ended January 31, 2013 2013 . . .
