Propel Media, Inc.
The Propel Media, Inc. brand was developed into a colorful and bold experience as it merged two growing online advertising companies into one unified tech brand. 














Logo Colorful, bold and unified. The logo needed to possess all the dynamic parts of two merging media giants. The colors represent the individual products and brands that this company is built on while the symbol evokes the sense of movement, growth and unity.  Below demonstrates some of the avenues that were taken during the brainstorm phase and through its evolution in the final selection. 











Branding When developing the look and feel of the logo application we wanted to utilize a black and white duality to create a confident and bold look while flecking in the brand colors as an accent to draw the eye into hot points and call to actions across web and print collateral. 











Logo Introduction Video This animation flow shows the fusion of the two companies along with its ideas, products and people to form a unified brand.

	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INTRODUCTION


	 


	All statements other than statements of historical
	fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) including, without limitation, statements under
	“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding our financial
	position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward looking statements. When
	used in this Form 10-K, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
	“intend” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward looking statements. Such
	forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available
	to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements as a result
	of certain factors detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All subsequent
	written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by
	this paragraph.


	 


	In assessing forward-looking statements contained
	herein, readers are urged to carefully read those statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
	are: inability to protect our intellectual property; inability to comply with the covenants in our credit facility; inability to
	obtain necessary financing; inability to effectively manage our growth; inability to effectively comply with the policies and procedures
	of Google, Microsoft and other leading industry companies; failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired businesses;
	competition; loss of key personnel; increases of costs of operations; continued compliance with government regulations; and general
	economic conditions.

	Propel is a holding company for Propel Media and
	Kitara.


	 


	Propel is a diversified online advertising company.
	Propel generates revenues through the sale of advertising to advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and
	internationally to promote their products and services.


	 


	Propel delivers advertising, including via its real-time, bid-based, online
	advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform allows advertisers to target audiences and deliver
	video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform provide advertisers with an effective way to serve,
	manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing. Propel offers both a self-serve platform and a managed
	services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online audiences and acquire customers. Propel has over 1,400
	advertiser customers and serves millions of ads per day.


	 


	Propel primarily serves its advertising to users
	who are part of its owned and operated member-based network or the member-based networks of our third party application partners.
	Propel provides its audience with access to its premium content for free and obtains the users’ permission to serve advertising
	to them while they peruse content on the web. In this model, Propel also serves advertising through partners who acquire users
	by providing a variety of applications free of charge in exchange for the ability to serve ads to their users. In this model, advertising
	units are served directly to users through a browser extension or other software installed on the user’s computer.


	 


	Propel has also developed a publisher business
	model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply channels expand our ability to serve advertising.
	In this model, the advertising units are served to users through websites, and we serve the advertising in coordination with the
	publisher, network or exchange.


	 


	Propel’s principal executive office is located

	History and Structure of Our Company


	 


	Overview


	 


	Propel was incorporated in Delaware on October
	7, 2014 under the name “Kitara Holdco Corp.” It was formed for the purpose of completing the Transactions (as defined
	below). Prior to the completion of the Transactions, Propel had no assets and did not conduct any material activities other than
	those incidental to its formation. Upon completion of the Transactions, the businesses of Propel Media and Kitara became the business
	of Propel. In February 2015, Propel changed its name to “Propel Media, Inc.” to better reflect its current operations
	and its common stock began trading on the OTC Pink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group (“OTC Pink Market”) under
	the trading symbol “PROM.” In December 2015, Propel changed the name of Propel Media from “Future Ads LLC”
	to “Propel Media LLC” and the Company now conducts all of its business under the Propel Media brand name.


	 


	Business Combination


	 


	On January 28, 2015, Propel consummated the transactions
	(the “Transactions”) contemplated by (i) the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”),
	dated as of October 10, 2014, by and among Kitara, Propel, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara, and Kitara
	Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel, and (ii) the Unit Exchange
	Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of October 10, 2014 and amended as of December 23, 2014, April 29, 2015
	and January 26, 2016, by and among Kitara, Propel, Propel Media and the former members of Propel Media (the “Transferors”).
	Prior to the Transactions, Kitara was a public operating company and Propel Media was a private operating company. Upon the closing
	of the Transactions, Propel became the new public company and Kitara and Propel Media became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Propel.

	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged
	with and into Kitara (the “Merger”), with Kitara surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel. In the
	Merger, each outstanding share of Kitara common stock was converted into one share of Propel common stock. In addition, Propel
	assumed Kitara’s existing 2012 Long-Term Incentive Equity Plan (the “2012 Plan”) and its 2013 Long-Term Incentive
	Equity Plan (the “2013 Plan”), and all outstanding stock options thereunder. However, Propel has amended the plans
	so that no further awards may be issued thereunder. Propel also assumed the other outstanding options and warrants of Kitara, in
	each case in accordance with the terms of the respective securities.


	 


	Immediately following the Merger and as part of
	a single integrated transaction, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Transferors exchanged all of the outstanding Propel Media
	interests for (i) $80,000,000 in cash, (ii) 154,125,921 shares of Propel common stock, (iii) the right to receive performance-based
	“earn out” payments that will enable the Transferors to receive up to an additional $40,000,000 in cash or stock consideration
	based on Propel Media reaching certain EBITDA levels during the 2015 to 2018 fiscal years, (iv) the right to receive, on or prior
	to June 30, 2019, $10,000,000 in cash and/or shares of Propel common stock, and (v) the right to receive, immediately after the
	payment of certain fees to Highbridge (as defined below) on or about the fourth anniversary of the closing, $6,000,000 in cash
	(the “Exchange”). The consideration payable to the Transferors was subject to a post-closing adjustment based on the
	working capital and indebtedness of Propel Media and the working capital of Kitara. On October 30, 2015, the Company paid $3,337,000
	to the Transferors in full satisfaction of this post-closing adjustment. The Company did not achieve the required EBITDA level
	in 2015 or 2016 and accordingly no “earn out” payment was made with respect to such fiscal years. Pursuant to the Exchange
	Agreement, Propel also reimbursed the Transferors for all transaction expenses paid by Propel Media, its subsidiaries or the Transferors
	on or before the consummation of the Transactions, and assumed all of their unpaid transaction expenses as of such date. The aggregate
	transaction expenses reimbursed or assumed by it were $867,000.


	 


	The Transactions were treated as a reverse merger
	under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).
	For accounting purposes, Propel Media is considered to have acquired Kitara in the Transactions. Under the purchase method of accounting,
	the assets and liabilities of Kitara have been recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of Propel Media in our
	financial statements.


	 


	Debt Financing


	 


	On January 28, 2015, in connection with the closing
	of the Transactions, Propel, Kitara and Propel Media, as “Borrowers,” and certain of their subsidiaries, as “Guarantors,”
	entered into a financing agreement, as amended on December 23, 2016 (“Financing Agreement”), with certain financial
	institutions as “Lenders,” HPS Investment Partners, LLC (formerly known as Highbridge Principal Strategies, LLC) (“Highbridge”),
	as collateral agent for the Lenders (“Collateral Agent”), and PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), as
	a Lender and administrative agent for the Lenders (“Administrative Agent”).


	 


	The Financing Agreement provided the Borrowers
	with (a) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $81,000,000 (the “Term Loan”) and (b) a revolving credit
	facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding (the “Revolving Loan” and,
	together with the Term Loan, the “Loans”). The Loans will mature on January 28, 2019 (“Final Maturity Date”).


	 






	 



	3



	 







	 




	 




	Upon the closing of the Financing Agreement, the
	Term Loan was borrowed in full and $7,500,000 was made available to the Borrowers under the Revolving Loan. The proceeds of the
	Loans were used (a) to pay off and refinance the Credit and Security Agreement (the “Wells Fargo Credit Agreement”),
	dated as of November 1, 2013, by and between Kitara and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as
	amended and other existing indebtedness of the Borrowers, (b) to pay fees and expenses related to the Financing Agreement, (c)
	to finance the cash consideration under the Exchange Agreement and (d) for general working capital purposes of the Borrowers.


	 


	The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan
	shall be repayable in consecutive quarterly installments in equal amounts of $1,750,000 on the last day of each March, June, September
	and December commencing on March 31, 2015, except that the payment due on March 31, 2015 was $1,219,000. The remaining balance
	of the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan are due and payable on the Final Maturity Date, except in certain limited circumstances.


	 


	The Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow the
	Revolving Loan prior to the Final Maturity Date, subject to the terms, provisions and limitations set forth in the Financing Agreement.
	The outstanding principal amount of advances may not at any time exceed the lesser of the $15,000,000 or the borrowing base.


	 


	Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement,
	the Term Loan or any portion thereof shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the
	date of the Term Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (but not
	less than 1% and not more than 3%) for the interest period in effect for the Term Loan (or such portion thereof) plus 9.00%.


	 


	Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement,
	each Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the date of such Loan
	until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such Loan plus 6.00%.


	 


	The obligations of the Borrowers under the Financing
	Agreement are secured by first priority security interests granted to the Lenders on all of the Borrowers’ and Guarantors’
	tangible and intangible property, including accounts receivable, intellectual property and shares and membership interests of the
	Borrowers (other than Propel) and the Guarantors.


	 


	The Financing Agreement and other loan documents
	provide for certain customary fees and other amounts to be paid to the Lenders at the closing of the Financing Agreement (approximately
	$3,000,000), during the term of the Financing Agreement (approximately $800,000) and on the fourth anniversary of the closing date
	of the Financing Agreement ($12,500,000).


	 


	The Financing Agreement and other loan documents
	contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the
	Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, create certain liens, make certain types of borrowings and engage in certain mergers,
	acquisitions, consolidations, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Financing Agreement also contains a financial covenant,
	as discussed in Item 7 below. The Financing Agreement provides for customary events of default, including, among other things,
	if a change of control of Propel occurs. The Loans may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.

	Kitara


	 


	Kitara was incorporated in Delaware on December
	5, 2005 under the name “Ascend Acquisition Corp.” From Kitara’s inception until February 29, 2012, it was a blank
	check company and did not engage in active business operations other than the search for, and evaluation of, potential business
	combination opportunities.

	On December 30, 2011, Kitara entered into a Merger
	Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Andover Games LLC (“Andover Games”) and the members of Andover Games. On
	February 29, 2012, pursuant to such agreement, Andover Games became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara. As a result, Kitara’s
	business became the business of Andover Games. Andover Games’ principal business was focused on developing mobile games for
	iPhone and Android platforms prior to June 30, 2013.


	 


	On June 12, 2013, Kitara entered into a Merger
	Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, as amended on July 1, 2013, with Kitara Media, NYPG and the former holders of all of the
	outstanding membership interests of Kitara Media and all of the outstanding shares of common stock of NYPG. On July 1, 2013, pursuant
	to such agreement, Kitara Media and NYPG became wholly owned subsidiaries of Kitara. In connection with the transactions, Kitara
	ceased the operations of Andover Games. On July 1, 2013, Kitara’s operations became entirely those of Kitara Media and NYPG.
	On August 19, 2013, Kitara changed its name from “Ascend Acquisition Corp.” to “Kitara Media Corp.”


	 


	On December 3, 2013, Kitara entered into a Merger
	Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Health Guru Media and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital
	stock of Health Guru Media, and simultaneously consummated the transactions contemplated thereby. At the closing, Health Guru Media
	became Kitara’s wholly-owned subsidiary. On April 27, 2016, Propel sold substantially all the assets of the Health Guru Media
	business, and subsequently changed the name of Health Guru Media to “Tek Array, Inc.”


	 


	Upon completion of the Transactions (as described
	above), Kitara became a wholly owned subsidiary of Propel.

	Strategy


	 


	Propel participates in the online advertising market
	where advertisers reward providers who can deliver performance and return on advertising investment. The fundamental strategy of
	the business is to drive advertiser performance across all mediums and geographies. Key elements of the Propel strategy include:


	 






	1.


	Increasing quality inventory from supply sources that deliver improved advertiser performance. This includes increasing Propel’s
	proportion of inventory coming from its owned and operated member-based network through increased investment in media buying to
	acquire users.

	Expanding revenues that come from video advertisers. As more advertiser budget moves from television to online, we see opportunities
	to increase the revenue we generate from distributing video advertisements on behalf of our advertisers.

	Business


	 


	Overview


	 


	Propel generates revenue by selling advertising
	to advertisers and serving the advertising to users while they browse the Internet. We have two monetization models.


	 


	In one model (which we sometimes refer to herein
	as the “member-based business”), we have a direct relationship with users who have installed an extension in the users’
	browsers or software that allows us to serve them advertising through their browsers as an overlay image on the content that they
	are viewing or in a new browser window or tab. In this model, we have no publisher relationship and as a result no publisher payments.
	We acquire a relationship with users in two ways: (i) through our owned and operated properties and (ii) through properties developed
	by our third party application partners. In each case, a user who accepts free access to our owned and operated property or to
	the application partner’s property agrees to receive advertisements served by us from advertisers using our Propel Media
	Platform as they browse the Internet. This allows us or our third party application partners to install an extension to the user’s
	browser or download software onto the user’s computer. The extension or software allows us to travel with the user as the
	user views content on the Internet. We capture the URLs and keywords of certain browsing pages viewed, and in real time determine
	if we have advertisers who have bid on keywords or the URL being browsed. If so, we serve the relevant advertising. In some situations,
	we have advertisers who wish to have us serve advertising on a run-of-network basis, which then permits us to serve ads across
	our user base without targeting parameters being established.


	 


	During 2016, as we transitioned away from the declining
	revenues from third party application partners, we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our own and operated properties,
	such as free casual games and free lifestyle content. We continue to have a distinct media buying organization that purchases advertising
	on various online ad platforms and is dedicated to developing the user base acquired through our owned and operated properties
	for our member-based business model.


	 


	In the second model (which we sometimes refer to
	herein as the “publisher business model”), we develop publisher based syndication supply channels through relationships
	with web publishers, exchanges and other supply channels. In this model, there is a direct publisher relationship and we use the
	traffic from publishers as the user base to whom we serve ads. No extension or software is downloaded or otherwise used. In this
	model, we enter into a revenue share or CPM (as defined below) payment model with the publisher.


	 


	Advertiser Sales and Account Management


	 


	Propel is focused on building relationships with
	digital advertisers.

	and its advertiser clients include, but are not limited to, direct advertisers, affiliate advertisers, lead generation advertisers
	and leading advertising agencies and advertising networks and exchanges representing premium brands.


	 


	Propel’s sales team and account management
	organization are comprised, collectively, of 15 employees. They call on and support advertisers and their advertising campaigns.
	The sales and account management teams are responsible for acquiring new advertisers, developing campaign goals and strategies
	with advertisers or their agents and working with the clients to establish the ad formats that will run. They are also responsible
	for developing the return on investment metrics with the advertiser that will be used to help the account management organization
	or the advertiser understand performance as the campaign is running and will allow the account management organization, the salesperson
	and the advertiser to optimize campaigns to meet campaign goals.


	 


	Campaigns are set up and managed by either the
	salesperson, account manager or the advertiser themselves. These activities are executed through the Propel Media Platform. This
	platform allows Propel to work with advertisers to:

	each tile representing a different ad or advertiser. If the user clicks on the ad tile, the user is taken to the content and ad

	Audience Development


	 


	Propel advertisers’ campaigns are dependent
	on having an audience to receive the advertising. Propel’s model is to reach its audience either directly or via partners.


	 


	Propel reaches audiences for its advertisers through
	two different business models:


	 






	 



	●




	The member-based business model acquires a relationship with users in two ways:







	 







	o




	Owned and Operated Properties

	. Propel develops and distributes multiple free casual gaming sites and other lifestyle
	content properties. In this method, Propel buys media and advertises these gaming sites and lifestyle content properties on various
	online destinations, including gaming and social media portals. Propel provides its audience with access to its premium gaming
	and lifestyle content for free and obtains the user’s permission to serve advertising to them while they peruse content on
	the web. Propel incurs media costs to acquire audiences in this manner.




	 


	 


	 







	o




	Application Partners’ Properties

	. Propel partners with third party application developers who have their own audience
	bases and are seeking to serve advertising to them. In this instance, Propel partners with these third party application developers
	to increase the total audience that Propel’s advertisers can reach with their advertisements. Propel operates under a revenue
	share model with its partners in this distribution model. 




	 








	●




	The publisher business model serves advertising through publisher based syndication supply channels

	.

	In this model,
	Propel develops direct relationships with publishers, networks and exchanges for supply and then purchases impressions from these
	supply sources. Propel operates under a revenue share model or on a fixed CPM with its partners in this distribution model. 




	 


	During 2016, as we transitioned away from the declining
	revenues from third party application partners, we focused on growing our user base via the marketing of our own and operated properties,
	such as free casual games and free lifestyle content. This led to 77% of our 2016 revenue being generated by our owned and operated
	audience. Our revenue mix is expected to continue to be heavily weighted to supply coming from owned and operated audience and
	publisher business as opposed to our third party application partners.


	 


	Solutions, Technology & Services


	 


	Propel offers advertisers the ability to reach
	audiences in which performance is measured by their willingness to view an ad or click through to the advertisers landing page
	for more information or complete a conversion action as defined by the advertiser. Typical conversions might include, for example,
	making a purchase, filling out an automobile test drive form, taking a survey or filling out a request for more information from
	online education providers. Superior performance is achieved by having engaging ad units that target the right audiences and are
	served at the right scale and frequency. Although most creative work is done by the client, Propel offers design services to help
	improve campaign performance through more impactful creative ads and landing pages. Propel offers video, display, text link and
	native ad units that are designed for maximum impact and conversions.


	 


	Audience targeting is achieved through keywords
	and URLs. Advertisers bid on keyword and URL targets which they believe will be relevant to the content that their audiences will
	be consuming. An advertiser will bid on anywhere from a few to thousands of keywords and URLs at varying bid prices based on the
	importance of the keyword or URL and the competition from other advertisers for that same keyword or URL. Advertisers may raise
	or lower keyword or URL bid prices as they see how effective various keywords or URLs perform for their campaign. If a keyword
	or URL target is performing well for an advertiser, the advertiser may want to increase the number of individuals clicking on the
	advertiser’s advertisements. This is accomplished by raising the bid price the advertiser is willing to pay to have the advertiser’s
	ad served, which in turn will generate more impressions and, hopefully, increased conversions. Conversely, if a keyword or URL
	is not performing, bid prices might be lowered in order to not spend advertising budget on underperforming keywords or URLs.

	Propel’s proprietary ad serving technologies
	are geared toward optimizing direct response advertiser campaigns to ensure that the desired performance criteria are generated
	within advertiser defined cost parameters. It is through Propel’s ad serving technologies that Propel matches advertisers
	with targeted audiences in a real time auction environment. Propel’s ad serving technologies determine if there are relevant
	keywords or URLs on the webpage that an audience member is perusing and that an advertiser or advertisers are targeting. It then
	evaluates the parameters for serving an ad, including the number of times an audience member has been exposed to a particular ad,
	the time intervals between ads, the competitive bid prices, the conversion data, time of day parameters that the advertiser has
	chosen to show ads and other relevant segmenting options. The ad server then decides which advertiser’s ad to serve to a
	particular audience member. This generally takes place in the 150 milliseconds that generally takes a webpage to load on a computer
	and occurs tens of millions of times per day.


	 


	Propel Media Platform is the Propel advertiser
	interface platform that registers campaign input parameters that drive its ad serving to carry out campaigns as defined by the
	advertiser. The Propel Media Platform interface allows advertisers to establish and direct what and where creative assets (ads)
	are to be found, the keyword, URL and geographic targets for each campaign, the bid price for each keyword and URL target, day
	part serving parameters, serving intervals between ad impressions, budget parameters on a daily basis and other segmenting options.

	provides performance traffic and budget management capabilities to meet key goals.


	 


	The platform is currently servicing over 1,400
	advertisers. Propel solutions deliver effective results for advertisers that allow them to target and reach mass audiences with
	high performance results across text, display and video formats. The reporting and analytics interface allows advertisers to see
	campaign performance in real-time. Campaign optimization and management is all performed through the Propel Media Platform interface.


	 


	Video Offerings


	 


	In 2016, Propel focused on expanding its video
	offerings to existing and new advertisers on our user network (the member-based business model) and on our expanding syndication
	network of publishers, exchanges and marketplaces (the publisher business model).

	Propel is focused on delivering a set of comprehensive
	solutions supported by industry leading services and a proven video advertising technology platform.


	 


	Propel’s objective is to ensure that every
	online advertising campaign dynamically achieves key performance metrics through brand-safe delivery to the right audience against
	relevant content in engaging interactive video ad formats. We believe consumers are spending more time online watching video content
	and advertisers are increasingly shifting budgets from television to online platforms.


	 


	The Propel video solutions are designed to address
	the needs of traditional direct relationships with brands and their agencies as well as the expanding evolution of programmatic
	advertisers. We believe that regardless of how online advertising campaigns are executed, whether by media buying or through programmatic
	automation, the same elements of relevant content, audiences and performance are required to optimize brand value.


	 


	Competition


	 


	Propel operates in a dynamic and competitive market,
	influenced by trends across multiple industries, including, but not limited to, the digital advertising industry, the video content
	marketing industry and the digital publishing industry. We expect that competition in Propel’s industry will continue to
	intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the continuing maturation of the industry and low barriers to entry.



	 


	The display, video, desktop application and online
	advertising solutions market is highly competitive, with many companies providing competing solutions. Propel competes with Google,
	RythmOne, RocketFuel, Tremor, Criteo, IAC, Facebook, Vibrant and many demand side advertiser platforms, supply side advertising
	platforms, ad networks, exchanges (such as BrightRoll, Inc. and Yume, Inc.) and desktop and mobile applications.


	 


	We believe that Propel competes favorably with
	an emphasis on key competitive factors, including strong relationships with online advertisers, publishers and third party application
	developers, an advanced and scalable technology platform, effective audience engagement and goal-based performance, data driven
	benchmarks and brand and campaign metrics for advertising campaigns, brand safety and proven performance. With respect to these
	factors, we believe that Propel’s effective, scalable and stable goal based performance platform well positions Propel as
	an independent provider of online advertising solutions.


	 


	Technology and Development


	 


	Propel’s technology and development efforts
	are focused on investing in its Propel Media Platform and a suite of complementary services. Much of its technology and development
	is conducted through a consulting arrangement with Bravo Studio d.o.o., which arrangement dates back to 2009. Pursuant to the consulting
	arrangement, Bravo Studio d.o.o. provides Propel with ongoing software and technology development services and support. Any intellectual
	property that is created within the scope of the consulting arrangement is owned by Propel. The consulting arrangement is terminable
	by either party upon 15 days’ prior written notice to the other party. Propel has incurred approximately $3,488,000 and $3,992,000
	in technology and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	Propel continues to develop a robust platform to
	enable automation and optimization of online advertising and publisher inventory. Propel’s strategy incorporates enhanced
	optimization management capabilities for video, display and text ad units. Capitalizing on proprietary and third-party data tools
	and reporting functionality, Propel will continue to analyze audience insights and offer reporting functionalities to provide Propel
	and its advertisers, publishers and third party application developers with a transparent understanding of Propel’s performance.

	Intellectual Property


	 


	Propel’s ability to protect its intellectual
	property, including its technologies, will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of its business. Propel has
	established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of its proprietary information such as the use of license
	agreements with customers and its use of confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with its employees,
	consultants, business partners and advisors where appropriate. These methods, however, may not afford complete protection for Propel’s
	intellectual property and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop technologies similar or superior
	to those of Propel.


	 


	Propel currently has secured one patent which expires
	on July 16, 2033 and multiple trademarks protecting its intellectual property and its brands.


	 


	Government Regulation


	 


	Propel is subject to numerous U.S. and foreign
	laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the online advertising business. In addition, many areas of law
	that apply to Propel’s business are still evolving, and could potentially affect its business to the extent they restrict
	its business practices or impose a greater risk of liability. We are aware of several ongoing lawsuits filed against companies
	in Propel’s industry alleging various violations of privacy or data security related laws.


	 


	Privacy


	 


	Privacy and data protection laws and regulations
	play a significant role in Propel’s industry. In the United States, at both the state and federal level, there are laws that
	govern activities, such as the collection, use and disclosure of data by companies like Propel.


	 


	Online advertising activities in the United States
	have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which has regularly relied upon
	Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices.
	Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool used to enforce against alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. In
	addition, as Propel continues expanding into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, Propel increasingly becomes subject to
	additional laws and regulations that may affect how it conducts business. In particular, European data protection laws can be more
	restrictive regarding the collection, use and disclosure of data than those in the United States.


	 


	Additionally, U.S. and foreign governments have
	enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’
	ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share anonymous data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent
	required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online. The European Union (the “EU”),
	and some EU member states have already implemented legislation and regulations requiring advertisers to obtain specific types of
	notice and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and
	deliver targeted advertisements. It remains a possibility that additional legislation and regulations may be passed or otherwise
	issued in the future. Propel also participates in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance
	obligations, it provides consumers with notice about its use of cookies and its collection and use of data in connection with the
	delivery of its offerings. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that Propel participates in are updated from
	time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon it in the future.


	 


	Any failure, or perceived failure, by Propel to
	comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection, or other policies,
	self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or
	others.

	Advertising Content


	 


	Even though Propel’s advertisers create the
	content of their ads and Propel receives contractual protections from its advertisers, Propel may nevertheless be subject to regulations
	concerning the content of their ads. Federal and state laws governing intellectual property or other third-party rights could apply
	to the content of ads Propel places even if it has no part in the creation of the ad. Laws and regulations regarding unfair and
	deceptive advertising, sweepstakes, advertising to children and other consumer protection regulations, may also apply to the ads
	Propel places on behalf of clients.


	 


	Employees


	 


	In April 2016, as part of a strategic plan designed
	to improve operational and cost efficiencies, the Company completed a workforce reduction and the consolidation of office facilities.
	As of December 31, 2016, Propel had 41 full-time employees, 2 part-time employees. None of Propel’s employees are represented
	by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Propel considers its relationship with its employees to be good.


	 


	Internet Address/Availability of Reports


	 


	Propel is subject to the informational requirements
	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and files or furnishes annual reports on Form
	10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Such reports
	and other information filed by Propel with the SEC will be available free of charge on Propel’s website at http://www.propelmedia.com
	as soon as reasonably practicable after Propel electronically files such material with, or otherwise furnishes it to, the SEC.
	The public may also read and copy any materials filed by Propel with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F
	Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by
	calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and
	other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not
	incorporated into this filing. Further, Propel’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references
	only.

	RISK FACTORS




	 



	The following discussion of risk factors contains
	forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following
	information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
	of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item
	8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.




	 




	Propel’s business, financial condition
	and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to
	those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause Propel’s actual financial condition
	and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any
	of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect Propel’s business, financial condition, operating
	results and stock price.




	 




	Because of the following factors, as well as
	other factors affecting Propel’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered
	to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends
	in future periods.

	Risks Related to Our Business


	 




	Any material reduction in spending by our
	key advertisers and/or our inability to retain such key advertisers could adversely impact our business and results of operations.






	 




	Our success requires us to sell advertising through
	our Propel Media Platform, to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing advertisers and ad agencies and to develop
	new relationships with other advertisers and ad agencies. These advertising sources generally do not include long-term obligations
	requiring them to purchase from us and are cancelable at any time or upon short notice and without a termination penalty. As a
	result, we have limited visibility as to our future advertising revenue streams from our advertisers, even if they have been long-standing
	advertisers. Our advertisers’ usage may decline, fluctuate or cease all together as a result of a number of factors, including,
	but not limited to:

	If a major advertiser decides to materially reduce
	its use of our services, it could do so on short or no notice. We cannot ensure that our advertisers will continue to use our services
	or that we will be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing advertisers with new advertisers from whom we generate
	comparable revenue.


	 




	Seasonal fluctuations in digital advertising
	activity could adversely affect our cash flows.






	 




	Many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount
	of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Accordingly,
	our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature with the fourth quarter of each calendar year historically representing the largest
	percentage of our total revenue for the year. Our operating cash flows could also fluctuate materially from period to period as
	a result of these seasonal fluctuations.


	 




	Our revenues are impacted by seasonal fluctuations and decreases or
	delays in audience acquisition and advertising spending which make any forecasting of our operating results inherently uncertain.




	 


	Our
	revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to both our ability to acquire audiences and advertiser spend.  Further,
	expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting
	and buying patterns. Our revenue could be materially reduced and our ability to grow our revenues could be negatively impacted
	by a decline in our audience, a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or a decline in the economy in general.  Due
	to such risks, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future
	results.  Further, forecasting economic activity is inherently difficult, and the nature of our business provides only limited
	visibility for our future operating results. In addition, we do not generally have long-term contracts with our advertiser customers.
	Accordingly, our ability to forecast future operating results is limited, any such forecasts would be inherently uncertain and
	our quarterly results could be quite volatile.

	Our sales efforts and relationships with advertisers,
	publishers, third party application developers and other partners require significant time and expense, which may adversely affect
	our operating results if we are unable to secure substantial commitments from them.






	 




	Attracting new advertisers, third party application
	developers, publishers, and other partners requires substantial time and expense, and we may not be successful in establishing
	new relationships or in maintaining or advancing our current relationships. With respect to advertisers and agencies, it may be
	difficult to identify, engage and market to potential advertisers and agencies who do not currently spend on contextual, display
	or digital video advertising or are unfamiliar with our current solutions. Furthermore, many of our advertiser and agency customers’
	purchasing and buying decisions typically require input from multiple internal constituencies. As a result, we must identify those
	persons involved in the purchasing decision and devote a sufficient amount of time to presenting our solutions to each of those
	persons. With respect to our publishers and third party application developers, we seek to establish long-term relationships to
	ensure audience reach for our advertisers. As a result, we invest significant time in cultivating relationships with our third
	party application developers, publishers and other partners to ensure they understand the potential benefits of monetization of
	their inventory or applications with us rather than other parties. The relationship building process can take many months and may
	not result in us winning an opportunity with any given advertiser, agency, third party application developer, publisher or other
	potential partner. Moreover, even when opportunities are won, the contractual obligation may be short-term and terminable by the
	other party upon short or no notice. For example, many of our advertising sources are direct advertisers and ad exchanges that
	programmatically bid and buy without obligation or commitment and can terminate or stop buying immediately. Therefore, we may invest
	significant resources into winning an opportunity only to result in a short-term commitment from our clients.


	 


	Our solutions and business model are relatively
	unique and often require us to spend substantial time and effort educating potential advertisers, third party application developers,
	publishers and other partners about our solutions, including providing demonstrations. This process can be costly and time-consuming.
	If we are not successful in targeting, supporting and streamlining our sales processes, our ability to grow our business may be
	adversely affected.


	 




	We operate in a highly competitive industry,
	and we may not be able to compete successfully.






	 




	The digital advertising market is highly competitive,
	with many companies providing competing solutions. We compete with Google, RythmOne, RocketFuel, Tremor, Criteo, IAC, Facebook,
	Vibrant and many demand side advertiser platforms, supply side advertising platforms, ad networks and exchanges (such as BrightRoll,
	Inc. and YuMe, Inc.), and desktop and mobile applications. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have
	more capital to invest in their businesses. Furthermore, our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships
	with their digital media property partners, advertisers or other parties, thereby limiting our ability to promote our solutions
	and generate revenue. Competitive pressures could require us to lower our prices for our advertisers or increase the prices we
	pay to publishers and third party application developers.


	 


	Additionally, some large advertising agencies that
	represent our current advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect
	advertisers with digital media properties. Our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and publishers purchase
	and sell inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between them. Other companies
	that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third party solutions have or may become intermediaries between our clients
	and thereby compete with us. In addition, we also compete with many of the same large scale competitors set forth above in the
	acquisition of audiences. As competition for audience increases, the cost of acquiring audiences could rise.


	 






	 



	14



	 







	 




	 




	Any of these developments would make it more difficult
	for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing
	expenses or the loss of market share. Accordingly, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.


	 




	We and our distribution partners rely on the
	ability to offer our audience downloadable applications which allows us and our distribution partners to offer services and serve
	advertising to our audience. Should we or our distribution partners be unable in the future to profitably acquire new audiences
	due to an inability to distribute downloadable applications via the Internet, our ability to generate revenues could be significantly
	negatively impacted.






	 




	Our ability to serve ads from our advertisers and
	to generate revenues is dependent on our ability to provide the appropriate audiences for our advertisers’ campaigns. We
	acquire audiences in a variety of ways including offering free downloadable applications ourselves or via our distribution partners
	that audiences agree to install and which allow us to serve advertising to them. If our ability to acquire audiences through this
	value exchange is disrupted, our advertising business model could be impaired. Possible reasons for such disruption could include
	audiences not valuing the offered application, costs of marketing the software being too high, the lifetime value of the acquired
	audiences not covering the cost of acquiring the audiences, or ad blockers, anti-virus protection blockers or other applications
	preventing our applications from being installed or our ads from being served.


	 




	The dominant players in our industry, including
	Microsoft and Google have modified their guidelines and policies to prevent or limit the ability to offer downloadable applications
	or to serve advertising to audiences that have installed downloadable applications. This may negatively impact our ability to generate
	revenues and could cause a material adverse effect on our financial results.






	 




	In an effort to protect their audiences from unwanted
	applications or unwanted behaviors while using their software and to control the computing experience, the dominant industry players
	who control access to audiences via their browsers and operating systems are regularly updating their policies and procedures to
	regulate the applications that may be installed on a computer. We cannot predict the changes that these players, such as Google
	or Microsoft, might implement. If they implement changes to their policies and procedures that limit our ability or third party
	application developers’ or other partners’ abilities to distribute their applications online, or if they disable our
	applications or the applications of our third party application developers, our member-based business will have difficulties acquiring
	audiences at the scale that is required to meet the demands of our advertisers. This could materially affect our financial results.


	 




	In order to maintain our revenue and grow
	our member based, we need to continuously acquire and reach new audiences and maintain audience engagement with our application
	products through advertising campaigns.






	 




	Our member-based business model depends on reaching
	audiences through relationships with third party application developers and distribution partners as well as through direct media
	buying for our owned and operated properties. In all cases, our growth is dependent on our ability to reach, maintain and expand
	audiences. The market to generate audiences for applications is highly competitive, and we experience significant competition for
	audience engagement with our applications from other vendors who use application advertising and search business models. We generate
	the substantial majority of revenues associated with our audiences during the first year after an application is installed. In
	order to maintain our current revenues and grow our business, we need to continuously engage in marketing campaigns aimed at maintaining
	audience engagement with our applications and acquiring new audiences. If we fail to conduct such marketing campaigns or any of
	our marketing campaigns prove less successful than anticipated, either because we are not able to accurately project the number
	of completed installations of the applications or otherwise, we expect that our audience engagement would decline materially, which
	would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

	Our business and prospects would also be harmed
	if new versions or upgrades of operating systems and Internet browsers adversely impact the process or platform by which audiences
	install our applications and audiences view our advertisements. The application installation process for our solutions is currently
	straightforward and includes detailed information about our products and services. In the future, operating systems, Internet browsers,
	ad blockers, and security programs could introduce new features or limitations that would make it more difficult to install applications
	and serve advertising, and may negatively impact the growth of our audience base and adversely impact our business and prospects.


	 




	Any significant decline in desktop personal
	computer audiences accessing the Internet could significantly diminish the value of our solutions in our member-based business
	model and cause us to lose revenue since most of our revenue generating solutions are currently not usable on competing platforms.






	 




	We focus primarily on the market related to personal
	computers, or “PCs.” To the extent that there is an even more significant shift by the market from PCs to mobile or
	tablet devices, we could experience a substantial reduction in revenues. Recently, the number of individuals who access the Internet
	through devices other than PCs, such as mobile phones and tablets, has increased dramatically. Our services are not yet available
	on these alternative platforms and devices. If this trend accelerates, and if we fail to successfully develop a mobile offering,
	we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, and our services
	will become less relevant and may fail to attract advertisers and web traffic.


	 


	Additionally, mobile devices are more controlled
	by the mobile device manufacturers and the providers of their operating systems. To the extent that these hardware and software
	providers use their position to advantage their own or other offerings, our opportunities could be more limited.


	 




	If we fail to adapt and respond effectively
	to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and advertiser needs, our solutions may become less competitive or
	obsolete.






	 




	The market for display, video, desktop application,
	mobile application and other online advertising solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards
	and frequent new product and service introductions. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract
	new digital advertisers, third party application developers, digital publishers and other partners, and increase spending by our
	existing advertisers, we will need to expand and enhance our solutions to meet advertiser needs, add functionality and address
	technological advancements. If we fail to develop new solutions that address our advertisers’ needs, or fail to enhance and
	improve our solutions in a timely manner or conform to industry standards, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market
	acceptance of our solutions, and our solutions may become less competitive or obsolete.


	 


	Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk
	of future technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver advertising solutions at lower prices or more efficiently
	or effectively than our solutions, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. Keeping pace with new and changing
	technology and evolving industry standards may require significant expenditures of financial and other resources. We cannot guarantee
	that such efforts will be successful.


	 




	A loss of the services of our senior management
	and other key personnel could adversely affect the execution of our business strategy.






	 










	We depend on the continued services of our senior
	management team. The loss of the services of these personnel could create a gap in management and could result in the loss of expertise
	necessary for us to execute our business strategy and thereby adversely affect our business.

	Further, our ability to execute our business strategy
	also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified and skilled technical and creative personnel
	and skilled management, marketing and sales personnel. Competition for well-qualified employees in our industry is intense and
	our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to retain existing key employees and to attract
	new skilled employees as well. If we cannot attract and retain additional key employees or lose one or more of our current key
	employees, our ability to develop or market our products and attract or acquire new users could be adversely affected. Although
	we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly senior
	management, we cannot be assured that we will be able to retain the services of senior management or other key employees, or that
	we will be able to attract new employees in the future who are capable of making significant contributions.


	 




	Our substantial debt and deferred obligations
	could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.






	 




	As of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness and
	other commitments that principally consisted of $67,531,000 for our Term Loan (bearing interest at approximately 10% per annum)
	and $0 for our Revolving Loan (bearing interest at 7.0% per annum for loans based upon the LIBOR and 9.5% per annum for reference
	rate loans). In addition, we have $10,000,000 (which can be satisfied with cash or stock as per the terms of the Exchange Agreement)
	and $6,000,000 of deferred payment obligations to the Transferors, and a $12,500,000 obligation due to the Lenders pursuant to
	the Financing Agreement. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sufficient earnings to cover fixed
	charges in future years. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks for us could intensify.


	 


	Our substantial debt and other commitments could
	have important consequences. In particular, it could:


	 







	●




	require
	us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
	our indebtedness and other commitments (in addition to interest payments, we are required
	to pay $1,750,000 at the end of each quarter as a principal reduction on our Term Loan),
	thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other
	general corporate purposes;

	Our debt agreements contain restrictive and
	financial covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities and
	failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our business.






	 




	The Financing Agreement contains restrictive covenants
	that limit our ability to, among other things:


	 







	●




	incur
	or guarantee additional debt or incur or suffer to exist additional liens;

	In addition, the Financing Agreement contains a
	financial covenant that requires us to maintain a certain Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Financing Agreement) as of each
	calendar quarter end. Under this covenant, we were required to maintain a Total Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.25:1.00 as of
	December 31, 2016. Our Total Leverage Ratio as of such date was 3.08:1.00. The Total Leverage Ratio that we must maintain decreases
	in each of the next five quarters, from 2.70:1.00 as of March 31, 2017 to 2.30:1.00 as of March 31, 2018, and remains at 2:30:1.00
	for each quarter thereafter. If we were to default on this financial covenant, such default, if not waived by our Lenders, could
	severely limit our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital that we might need to maintain and grow our business, could
	restrict our opportunities to participate in mergers and acquisitions and potentially constrain our ability to cost effectively
	execute on our business plan. Furthermore, we are dependent upon our Lenders for our revolving borrowing arrangement, which we
	rely upon as a source of borrowing for our operations. If we do not maintain compliance with the financial covenant under the Financing
	Agreement, we may lose our ability to draw upon the revolver arrangement and the Lenders may accelerate our obligation to repay
	the amounts due. Should the funding under the Financing Agreement become unavailable to us, we may not be able to find alternative
	sources of financing, and we may not be able to pay our liabilities and expenses when due, which could result in the suspension
	of some or all of our current operations. It could also adversely affect the willingness of our vendors and employees to continue
	to work with us. 


	 


	Our ability to comply with these provisions may
	be affected by events beyond our control. Complying with these covenants also may have a material adverse effect on our financial
	condition.


	 




	If we are unable to make payments as they
	come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default under the terms of such
	agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment. Failure to maintain existing financing or to secure new financing
	could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.






	 




	If we are unable to make payments as they come
	due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the Financing Agreement, there could be a default under the terms of the agreement.
	In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under the Financing Agreement, including pursuant to the cross-default provisions
	of the Financing Agreement, the Lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts
	borrowed due and payable. Furthermore, our Lenders could foreclose on their security interests in our assets, including the equity
	interests in our material subsidiaries. Borrowings under any other debt instruments of ours that contain cross-acceleration or
	cross-default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable. If any of those events occur, our assets might not
	be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if
	we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not
	be able to amend the Financing Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs.
	Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.


	 




	If our Lenders foreclose on their security
	interests in our assets, they will have the right to sell those assets in order to satisfy our obligations to them.






	 




	Our obligations under the Financing Agreement are
	secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. In the event
	of foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding relating to us or to our subsidiaries that have guaranteed
	our debt, the Lenders will have prior claims on our assets. Those claims include the right to foreclose and take possession of
	our assets, including equipment that is necessary for the conduct of our operations, which would restrict our ability to continue
	to conduct business. There can be no assurance that we would receive any proceeds from a foreclosure sale of our assets that constitute
	collateral following the satisfaction of the secured lenders’ priority claims.

	We rely on our outsourced technology development
	partner for our software and technology development services and support.






	 




	Much of our technology and development is conducted
	through a consulting arrangement with Bravo Studio d.o.o. Pursuant to the consulting arrangement, Bravo Studio d.o.o. provides
	us with ongoing software and technology development services and support. The consulting arrangement is terminable by either party
	upon 15 days’ prior written notice to the other party. If Bravo Studio d.o.o. were to terminate our relationship, we would
	be adversely and materially affected and our revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted.


	 




	We have a few key vendors from whom we obtain
	necessary services to continue our business, which may adversely affect our ability to replace such vendors and minimize our costs.






	 




	We have a few key vendors from whom we obtain necessary
	services to continue to efficiently and effectively operate our business. For example, our three largest cost of revenue vendors
	accounted for 18.0%, 17.1% and 15.6% of our cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no cost of revenue
	vendors which accounted for 10% or more of our cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Such concentration exposes
	us to increased risk in the event any one of these vendors becomes unable or unwilling to provide us with the services we need
	or significantly increases the cost of such services. In such event, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to find a replacement
	vendor to provide services on terms comparable to our current arrangements. If our vendor costs increase, we may be required pass
	the increased cost on to our clients, which may harm our competitive position. The inability to replace our key vendors or significant
	increases in cost for the services provided by our key vendors would adversely and materially affect our revenues and results of
	operations.


	 




	Our business depends on our ability to collect
	and use data to deliver ads, and to disclose data relating to the performance of our ads, and any limitation on these practices
	could significantly diminish the value of our solutions and cause us to lose customers and revenue.






	 




	Our ability to optimize the placement and scheduling
	of advertisements for our advertisers and the targeting of advertisements, and accordingly our ability to grow our revenue, depends
	on our ability to successfully leverage certain data that we collect. Our ability to successfully leverage such data, in turn,
	depends on our ability to collect and obtain rights to utilize such data. This data includes data from advertisers and device users
	and it also includes data from our publishers and third parties such as data providers. When we deliver an ad to an Internet-connected
	device, we are able to collect information about the placement of the ad and the interaction of the user with the ad, such as whether
	the user clicked on an ad, visited a landing page or watched a video. We are also able to collect information about the user’s
	IP address, device and some demographic characteristics. We may also contract with one or more third parties to obtain additional
	anonymous information about the user who is viewing a particular ad, including information about the user’s interests. As
	we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and
	scheduling of ads across the advertising opportunities available to us. Any interruptions, failures, or defects in our data collection,
	mining, analysis, and storage systems could limit our ability to aggregate and analyze user data from our clients’ advertising

	could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenue may decline.

	Our business practices with respect to data
	could give rise to liabilities, restrictions on our business or reputational harm as a result of evolving governmental regulation,
	legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.






	 




	In the course of providing our solutions, we transmit
	and store information related to Internet-connected devices, user activity and the ads and other content we place. Federal, state
	and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, processing, retention, sharing and security of data that we
	collect across our solutions. The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, has also announced that it
	is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting
	some targeted advertising practices. The FTC has also adopted revisions to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act that
	expand liability for the collection of information by operators of websites and other electronic solutions that are directed to
	children.


	 


	We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations,
	policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data collection, processing use and disclosure. However, the applicability
	of specific laws may be unclear in some cases and domestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices
	and data tracking technologies is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. In addition, it is possible that these requirements
	may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is new or inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other
	rules or our practices. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could also force us to incur substantial costs or require
	us to change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our
	growth strategy. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. federal, state or international laws, including laws
	and regulations regulating privacy, data, security or consumer protection, or disclosure or unauthorized access by third parties
	to this information, could result in proceedings or actions (including class actions) against us by governmental entities, private
	parties or others. Any such proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, result in significant expense to defend, distract
	our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our solutions and ultimately result in the
	imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our clients from the costs
	or consequences of litigation resulting from using our solutions or from the disclosure of confidential information, which could
	damage our reputation among our current and potential clients, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources
	and cause us to lose business and revenue.


	 




	The data we collect from consumers, advertisers
	and publishers may decrease, which may make our solutions less valuable and adversely affect our business.






	 




	We participate in industry self-regulatory programs
	under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection
	and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising. In addition, consumers can currently opt out of the placement
	or use of our cookies for online targeted advertising purposes by either deleting or disabling cookies on their browsers, visiting
	websites that allow consumers to place an opt-out cookie on their browsers, which instructs advertisers and their service providers
	not to use certain data about the consumer’s online activity for the delivery of targeted advertising, or by downloading
	browser plug-ins and other tools that can be set to: (1) identify cookies and other tracking technologies used on websites; (2)
	prevent websites from placing third-party cookies and other tracking technologies on the consumer’s browser; or (3) block
	the delivery of online advertisements on websites and applications. If there is a material increase in the number of consumers
	who choose to opt out or are otherwise using browsers where they need to, and fail to, configure the browser to accept cookies
	(or similar tracking technologies), our ability to collect valuable and actionable data may be impaired, which may make our solutions
	less valuable and adversely affect our business.


	 


	Furthermore, in order to effectively operate our
	advertising campaigns, we collect data from advertisers, publishers, and other third parties. If we are not able to obtain sufficient
	rights to data from these third parties, we may not be able to utilize such data in our solutions. Although our arrangements with
	advertisers and publishers generally permit us to collect non-personally identifiable and aggregate data from advertising campaigns,
	sometimes an advertiser or publisher declines to permit the use of this data. For example, publishers may not agree to permit us
	to place our data collection tags on their sites or agree to provide us with the data generated by interactions with the content
	on their sites. The inability to collect or use data from advertisers and publishers may limit the usefulness of the data that
	we do collect and use. In addition, advertisers may request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have
	already been aggregated with other advertisers’ campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these
	requests, and complying with these kinds of requests could cause us to spend significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures
	or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions
	regarding the collection, use and processing of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze the data from our customers’
	advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertising
	customers, which could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose customers and our revenue may decline.

	New laws and regulations applicable to Internet
	advertising, privacy and data collection and protection, and uncertainties regarding the application or interpretation of existing
	laws and regulations, could harm our business.






	 




	Our business is conducted through the Internet
	and therefore, among other things, we are subject to the laws and regulations that apply to online businesses around the world.
	These laws and regulations are becoming more prevalent in the United States, Europe and elsewhere and may impede the growth of
	Internet marketing; and consequently our services. These regulations and laws may cover user privacy, data collection and protection,
	content, use of “cookies”, access changes, “net neutrality,” pricing, intellectual property, distribution,
	protection of minors, consumer protection and taxation.


	 


	Many areas of the law affecting the Internet remain
	largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been legislative action. This uncertainty can be compounded when services hosted
	in one jurisdiction are directed at users in another jurisdiction. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether and how existing
	laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and data collection and protection, libel, marketing, data security
	and taxation, apply to the Internet and our business.


	 




	If we fail to detect fraud or other actions
	that impact ad campaign performance, we could lose the confidence of advertisers or agencies, which would cause our business to
	suffer.






	 




	Our business relies on effectively and efficiently
	delivering advertising campaigns for advertisers. We may in the future be subject to fraudulent and malicious activities such as
	the use of bots, non-human traffic delivered by machines that are designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user
	traffic. These activities could overstate the performance of any given ad campaign and could harm our reputation. It may be difficult
	to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not rely solely on our own content and rely in part on publisher partners
	for controls with respect to such activity. While we routinely assess the campaign performance on our digital media properties’
	websites and our partner publishers’ websites, such assessments may not detect or prevent fraudulent or malicious activity.
	If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others, and we fail to detect or prevent it, the affected advertisers
	may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed. High levels of fraudulent or
	malicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions, refusals to pay, refund demands or withdrawal of future business.
	If we fail to detect fraud or other actions that impact the performance of our ad campaigns, we could lose the confidence of our
	advertisers or agencies, which could cause our business to suffer.

	performance of our solutions, which we utilize to place advertisements, monitor the performance of advertising campaigns, manage
	our ad opportunities and content inventory and respond to advertiser, publisher, third party application developer and other partner

	failures that interrupt our ability to deliver advertisements and provide access to our solutions, including technological failures
	affecting our ability to deliver advertising quickly and accurately and to process viewers’ responses to video content or
	fill publisher content requests, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our solutions and reduce our revenue. Any steps
	we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing technological
	errors and system failures. Any such technological errors or system failures could harm our ability to attract potential clients
	and retain and expand business with existing clients and, as a result, our business, financial condition and operating results
	could be adversely affected.


	 




	Defects or errors in our solutions could harm
	our reputation, result in significant costs to us, impair our ability to deliver advertising campaigns and impair our ability to
	meet our obligations to our partners, publishers and content providers.






	 




	The technology underlying our solutions, including
	our proprietary technology and technology provided by third-parties, may contain material defects or errors that can adversely
	affect our ability to operate our business and cause significant harm to our reputation. This risk is compounded by the complexity
	of the technology underlying our solutions and the large amounts of data we utilize. Although we test technologies before incorporating
	them into our solutions, we cannot guarantee that all of the technologies that we incorporate will not contain errors, bugs or
	other defects. Errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems in our solutions could result in the incomplete
	or inaccurate delivery of an ad campaign or other content, including serving an ad campaign in an incomplete or inaccurate manner.
	Any such failure, malfunction, or disruption in service could result in damage to our reputation, our clients withholding payment
	to us, advertisers, third party application developers, other partners, publishers, content providers or other partners making
	claims or initiating litigation against us, and our giving credits to our clients toward future services.


	 




	We depend on third party Internet and telecommunication
	providers to operate our business. Temporary failure of these services, including catastrophic or technological interruptions,
	would reduce our revenues and damage our reputation, and securing alternate sources for these services could significantly increase
	our expenses.






	 










	Each of our third party Internet and telecommunication
	providers may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions in services, at the current cost or at all. Moreover,
	as technology advances occur, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructure and technologies. Although there may be overlap
	between the companies that provide such services, any such disruption in services, even if temporary, may negatively impact our
	performance.


	 


	Our servers and communications systems could be
	damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God,
	computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause deterioration
	in performance or interruption in these systems, delays, loss of critical data and lost revenues. Further, because our California
	headquarters and server location site are in seismically active areas, earthquakes present a particular serious risk of business
	disruption.

	We collect, store and transmit advertising information
	relating to our audience, advertisers, third party application developers, publishers, content providers and other partners and
	we store information about our employees and the company (such as contracts and company confidential information). We take steps
	to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of such information, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized
	use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts.
	Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our
	systems or those of our information technology vendors in the future. Security breaches, computer viruses or other harmful software
	code and computer hacking attacks could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or loss of information, legal claims and
	litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory fines and penalties, contractual obligations and liabilities, and other liabilities.
	In addition, if our security measures or those of our vendors are breached or unauthorized access to data otherwise occurs, our
	solutions may be perceived as not being secure and advertisers, third party application developers, publishers, content providers
	and other partners may reduce the use of or stop using our solutions, a government entity may bring a claim for inadequate data
	protection and our own employees may bring claims against our company for breaches of confidentiality. Any of the foregoing could
	damage our reputation among our current and potential clients, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources
	and cause us to lose business and revenue.


	 




	Our failure to protect our intellectual property
	rights could diminish the value of our services, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.






	 




	We regard the protection of our intellectual property
	as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on contractual restrictions. We enter
	into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with
	third parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our intellectual property and
	proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual
	property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies
	by others. In addition, we have licensed in the past, and may license in the future, some of our proprietary rights to third parties.
	These licensees may take unauthorized actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation

	.

	We may, in the future, seek to protect our intellectual property in new ways, such as by registering our trademarks and
	copyrights or applying for patents for technology we develop. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent
	protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of
	defending our rights. Protecting our intellectual property through federal and state filings in the future may prove expensive
	and time-consuming.


	 


	Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual
	property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation
	of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce,
	our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. The laws in the United States
	and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure
	to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically
	advanced features, which could significantly reduce demand for our solutions. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate
	infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and
	may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation
	results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able
	to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.

	Companies in the online advertising industry are
	often required to defend against litigation claims that are based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual
	property rights. Our success depends, in part, upon non-infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and being
	able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation without major financial expenditures or adverse
	consequences. In the future, we may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property
	rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. Such claims may be made by competitors
	or other parties. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or infringing or misappropriating other intellectual
	property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend, and can impose a significant
	burden on management and employees. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may receive unfavorable interim
	or preliminary rulings in the course of litigation. There can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in
	all cases. We may decide to settle lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Some of our competitors have substantially
	greater resources than we do and are able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree
	and for longer periods of time than we could. Claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights could:

	of the right to use any of these on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could result in delays in producing or delivering
	our solutions until equivalent data, other technology, or intellectual property is identified and integrated, which delays could
	harm our business. In this situation we would be required to either redesign our solutions to function with technology, data or
	intellectual property available from other parties or to develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs.
	Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future solutions. If we fail to maintain or renegotiate
	any of these technology or intellectual property licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting
	to develop similar or replacement technology, or to license and integrate a functional equivalent of the technology or intellectual
	property. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

	Our business will suffer if we are unable
	to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.






	 




	Part of our overall growth strategy is to acquire
	businesses, personnel and technologies that are complementary to our existing business and expand our employee base and the breadth
	of our offerings. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition and investment
	candidates at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates and the availability of financing
	to complete larger acquisitions. Future acquisitions or investments could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity securities,
	use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and
	other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The benefits of
	an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition
	or investment will produce the intended benefits.


	 


	Integration of a new company’s operations,
	assets and personnel into ours will require significant attention from our management. The diversion of our management’s
	attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our ability to manage our
	business. Future acquisitions will also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with any acquired liabilities,
	the integration of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, information security vulnerabilities,
	the diversion of resources from our existing businesses, sites and technologies, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to
	offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers,
	partners and suppliers as a result of the integration of new businesses.


	 




	We may need additional capital in the future
	to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms,
	or at all, which could compromise our ability to meet our financial obligations and grow our business.






	 




	We may need additional capital in the future to
	expand our marketing and sales and technology development efforts, to make acquisitions or to pay the $16,000,000 of deferred payment
	obligations to the Transferors under the Exchange Agreement, and to refinance our Term Loan obligations, which become due on January
	28, 2019. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable
	terms, we may be unable to fund the expansion of our marketing and sales and technology development efforts or take advantage of
	acquisition or other opportunities, which could harm our business and results of operations.


	 


	Financing, if any, may be in the form of debt or
	additional sales of equity securities, including common or preferred stock. The incurrence of debt or the sale of preferred stock
	may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations, any of which may be burdensome
	to us. The sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, would result in dilution to the current stockholders’
	ownership.


	 






	Our results of operations and financial condition
	may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic conditions.






	 




	In the event that the United States and/or Europe
	experiences an economic downturn or the current economic climate worsens, our advertisers’ ability to spend on Internet advertising
	could be reduced. A reduction in spending on Internet advertising could reduce the use of our products and services, which would

	Geo-political uncertainties and instabilities

	As we expand our business globally, we depend on
	a stable geo-political environment in the regions in which we operate. Should there be instabilities in regions where we sell,
	wish to sell or have outsourced development operations, we may find it difficult to maintain or grow our business. As we expand
	our advertiser base to cover Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, geo-political instabilities could have an adverse
	impact on our business. Additionally, we outsource our technology development to an engineering firm located in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
	The region has a history of geopolitical unrest and should a period of instability ensue, our technology development capabilities
	could be jeopardized.


	 


	Risks Related to Our Company and Our Securities


	 




	The majority of our common stock is beneficially
	owned by certain former members of Propel Media, which makes it possible for them to determine the outcome of all matters submitted
	to our stockholders for approval. This control may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.






	 




	Certain former members of Propel Media, including
	Jared Pobre, our Chairman of the Board, collectively own approximately 61.7% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of their
	stock ownership, these former members of Propel Media will be able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders,
	including, but not limited to:


	 







	●




	the
	election of directors;






	 




	 




	 








	●




	mergers,
	consolidations or acquisitions, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and
	other decisions affecting our capital structure; and






	 




	 




	 








	●




	our
	liquidation, winding up and dissolution.





	 


	The interests of these former members of Propel
	Media may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders in these matters. In addition, this concentration of stock
	ownership may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages
	in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders. Such persons’ stock ownership also may discourage a potential
	acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock
	price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.


	 


	Furthermore, under the stockholders’ agreement
	entered into between us and these former members of Propel Media, as long as these former members own at least 50% of our outstanding
	common stock, they will have the right to designate a majority of the directors of our board and, as long as they own at least
	20% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate at least 40% of the directors of our board. As a result
	of their right to designate a majority of the directors, these former members of Propel Media will have even greater influence
	over the management of our business.


	 




	We do not intend to pay cash dividends on
	our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on your investment will occur only through appreciation of
	our common stock.






	 




	We have not paid any cash dividends on our common
	stock to date and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain earnings to finance the growth
	of our business. In addition, the Financing Agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, any
	return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.

	There can be no assurance that the price of our
	common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and
	volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and
	that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The market prices
	of stock in technology and advertising companies have been especially volatile. You should also be aware that price volatility
	might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low.


	 




	We will have the ability to issue “blank

	Our certificate of incorporation allows our board
	of directors to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of such preferred
	stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock.

	The requirements of being a public company,
	including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may strain our resources and distract our management, and we may
	be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.






	 




	Prior to the Transactions, neither we nor Propel
	Media had any history operating as a public company. Following consummation of the Transactions, as a public company, we and our
	subsidiaries, including Propel Media, are required to comply with certain laws and regulations and reporting requirements that
	are not applicable to private companies, including the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, certain corporate governance
	provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws, regulations and rules of the SEC. In order to
	maintain compliance with these laws, rules and regulations, we must, among other things:


	 







	●




	maintain
	a more comprehensive compliance function;






	 




	 




	 








	●




	design,
	establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting
	in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board;






	 




	 




	 








	●

	If we are unable to maintain compliance with our
	public reporting requirements or the other requirements that apply to public companies, we may be subject to sanction or investigation
	by the SEC. In addition, we incur significant expense to comply with these statutes, regulations and requirements, as a result
	of expenses associated with director and officer liability insurance, investor relations, audit work, legal counsel, regulatory
	requirements and the establishment and maintenance of heightened corporate governance measures and management oversight. In addition,
	compliance occupies a significant portion of our board of directors’ and management’s time.


	 




	Our failure to achieve and maintain effective
	internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a restatement of its financial statements,
	cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.






	 




	As a public company, our internal accounting controls,
	including those applicable to our subsidiaries, are required to meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded
	securities. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to help mitigate the risk of
	fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal
	control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations
	of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Furthermore, we are required to include in this Form 10-K and in
	our future annual reports an assessment by our management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
	and, if we cease to be a non-accelerated filer as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC, a report by our independent registered
	public accounting firm that attests to our internal control over financial reporting. The requirement for a report by our independent
	registered public accounting firm will apply starting with the annual report for the first fiscal year in which we have a public
	float of at least $75,000,000 as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of such fiscal year.


	 


	In performing the required tests under Section
	404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify significant deficiencies
	or errors that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance. In such event, we may not be able to
	conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of
	the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue a favorable assessment.
	If either our management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent
	registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report, investors could lose confidence in our reported
	financial information and our company, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to
	fail to meet our future reporting obligations, which in turn could impact our ability to raise additional financing if needed in
	the future. If we fail to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to internal control
	over financial reporting in a timely manner, we may also be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such
	as the SEC. In addition, testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting can divert our management’s attention
	from other matters that are important to our business.

	Because our securities are not listed on a national securities

	not required to have a majority of independent directors, a separate audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors
	or a separate compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors. In addition, we are not required to have our
	board nominees selected, or recommended for the board’s selection, either by a nominating committee comprised entirely of
	independent directors or by a majority of our independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections
	afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to the corporate governance requirements applicable to listed companies.

	From time to time, we may be involved in litigation

	were expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on us.


	 


	In December 2013, an action entitled Intrepid Investments,
	LLC (“Intrepid”) v. Selling Source, LLC (“Selling Source”), et al., Index No. 65429/2013 was filed in the
	Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This is an action commenced by Intrepid to collect on a Junior Secured
	Promissory Note signed by Selling Source in the original principal sum of $28,700,000 (the “Note”). The Company is
	not a signatory to the Note but Kitara Media did sign an August 31, 2010 Security Agreement (“Security Agreement”)
	pledging all of its accounts, cash and cash equivalents, chattel paper, contracts, deposit accounts, documents, equipment, fixtures,
	general intangibles, all other goods, all shares of capital stock of any companies it owned, all instruments including all promissory
	notes, all intellectual property, all insurance policies and all proceeds thereof, all inventory, all other investment property,
	all letter of credit rights, all other tangible and intangible personal property and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, as security
	for the Note. At the time Kitara Media signed the Security Agreement, it was wholly-owned by Selling Source. On July 1, 2013, Kitara
	Media merged with one of Kitara’s then wholly-owned subsidiaries, with Kitara Media surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Kitara. Accordingly, it is no longer wholly-owned by Selling Source, although it is still an affiliate of Selling
	Source. In the action, Intrepid seeks to foreclose on the security interest. Both Selling Source’s and Kitara Media’s
	obligations to Intrepid under the Note and Security Agreement were subordinate to obligations Selling Source had to two groups
	of prior lenders (“Senior Lenders”). The right of Intrepid to compel payments under the Note and/or foreclose the lien
	created by the Security Agreement was subject to an Inter-creditor Agreement by and between the Senior Lenders and Intrepid. Under
	the terms of the Inter-creditor Agreement, Intrepid could not take steps to compel Selling Source to make payment on the Note or
	foreclose the Security Agreement so long as the obligations to the Senior Lenders remained outstanding. In addition, under the
	terms of the Inter-creditor Agreement, the Senior Lenders had the right to have the lien released on any of the collateral pledged
	as security under the Security Agreement. In the New York action, Intrepid has challenged the Senior Lenders’ authority to
	release the lien and also challenged the enforceability of the Inter-creditor Agreement generally.  The Court has not yet
	ruled on the merits of that challenge.  In addition, Selling Source’s obligations to the Senior Lenders remains outstanding.

	The second matter is Intrepid Investments, LLC v. Selling
	Source, LLC et al., Index No. 654309/2013, which was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This
	matter was originally limited to claims asserted by Intrepid against Selling Source regarding an earn-out calculation entered into
	between it and Selling Source, and confirmed by an arbitrator earlier this year. In August, 2014, Intrepid amended its complaint
	to include various breach of contractor claims against a variety of those defendants, including Kitara. The new defendants, including
	Kitara, answered the amended complaint on November 7, 2014, denying liability for all claims. On February 19, 2015, the Court entered
	an order granting Selling Source’s motion to affirm the arbitration results. On March 3, 2015, Selling Source filed a motion
	for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of eleven of Intrepid’s remaining claims, and, in September 2015, the New
	York Supreme Court granted this motion for summary judgment. The claims asserted against Kitara were not among those addressed
	in Selling Source’s motion.


	 


	Based on these facts, Propel believes Intrepid’s
	claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. In any event, Selling Source has acknowledged an obligation to indemnify
	and defend Kitara Media from any liability to Intrepid arising out of the Note and Security Agreement. The parties have exchanged
	pleadings and Selling Source has provided documents and written interrogating responses to Intrepid.

	We intend to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on
	our common stock for the foreseeable future. The determination to pay dividends in the future, if any, will be based upon our revenues
	and earnings, if any, capital requirements and our general financial condition, as well as the limitations on dividends and distributions
	that exist under the terms of the Financing Agreement and the laws and regulations of the state of Delaware. Under the terms of
	the Financing Agreement, Propel can only pay dividends in the form of common equity interests, such as shares of stock or warrants,
	options, or rights on stock.

	2016 Performance Highlights


	 


	Propel Media produced 2016 Adjusted EBITDA
	(a non-GAAP measure) of $3,258,000, $5,562,000, $6,135,000 and $6,977,000 for the quarters ended March 31, June 30,
	September 30 and December 31 of 2016, respectively.


	 


	These 2016 quarter-over-quarter performance improvements
	are principally the result of our success in shifting our user base mix. During 2016, we were aggressive in developing our owned
	and operated user audience, which we have grown through our own media buying activities. Advertising served to this owned and operated
	audience yields higher margins due to its higher audience quality attributes, including higher click-throughs and audience profiles
	aligning with advertiser requirements. The growth in the owned and operated audience helped us replace revenues earned on advertising
	served to users through third party application partners, which declined. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 77% and 10%
	of our revenues were from advertising served to our owned and operated user audience and to our third party application partner
	user audience, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 46% and 26% of our revenues were from advertising served
	to our owned and operated user audience and to third party application partner user audience, respectively.


	 


	In April 2016, as part of a strategic plan designed
	to improve operational and cost efficiencies, the Company completed a workforce reduction and the consolidation of office facilities.
	This restructuring reduced our 2016 employee expenses by approximately $1,953,000. These savings were offset by one-time charges
	of $794,000 for severance and $489,000 stock-based compensation for accelerated vesting of certain stock options. In connection
	with the restructuring, we reduced certain technology development costs within our publisher business, resulting in improvements
	of approximately $849,000 in our profit during 2016.


	 


	Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016
	was $61,226,000, a decrease of $17,554,000, or 22%, as compared to $78,780,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our 2016 revenue
	decrease was principally on account of the shift of the sources of our user audience. Although our owned and operated audience
	has been growing through 2015 and 2016, that growth was not able to outpace the declines in the third party application partners’
	user audience and the effects on our revenues from cuts made to remove certain unprofitable publisher accounts. During the fourth
	quarter of 2016, we saw a leveling of revenue from advertising served through third party application partners. In the fourth quarter
	of 2016, revenues from our owned and operated user base represented 82% of our revenues as compared to 32% in the first quarter
	of 2015.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company
	met all of its debt obligations and covenant ratios. Based upon our current projections, we believe that we will meet these requirements
	over the next twelve months.

	Business Description






	 




	Propel is a diversified online advertising company.
	Propel generates revenues through the sale of advertising to advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and internationally
	to promote their products and services.


	 


	Propel delivers advertising, including via its
	real-time, bid-based, online advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform allows advertisers to
	target audiences and deliver video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform provide advertisers
	with an effective way to serve, manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing. Propel offers both
	a self-serve platform and a managed services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online audiences and acquire
	customers. Propel has over 1,400 advertiser customers and serves millions of ads per day.


	 


	Propel primarily serves its advertising to users
	who are part of our owned and operated member-based network or the member-based networks of our third party application partners.
	Propel provides its audience with access to its premium content for free and obtains the users’ permission to serve advertising
	to them while they peruse content on the web. In this model, Propel also serves advertising through partners who acquire users
	by providing a variety of applications free of charge in exchange for the ability to serve ads to their users. In this model, advertising
	units are served directly to users through a browser extension or other software installed on the user’s computer.


	 


	Propel has also developed a publisher business
	model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply channels expand our ability to serve advertising.
	In this model, the advertising units are served to users through websites, and we serve the advertising in coordination with the
	publisher, network or exchange.

	Consolidated revenue for the year ended December
	31, 2016 decreased by $17,554,000, or 22%, to $61,226,000 as compared to $78,780,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. As disclosed
	above, the decline in revenue was principally on account of a year-over-year decline in the user audience to whom we serve advertisements.
	During the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from our owned and operated user base increased by $10,898,000, or 30%, to $47,347,000
	from $36,449,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue from our third party application
	partners’ user base declined by $14,660,000, or 70% to $6,236,000, from $20,896,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015.
	The decline in the third party application user base was principally on account of policy changes regarding the distribution of
	applications instituted by those who operate the marketplace’s largest web browsers, which significantly impacted the user
	acquisition strategy of our third party application partners and limited the ability of these third party application partners
	to acquire users. The revenue growth from our owned and operated properties was based, first, upon our significant emphasis placed
	on media buying efforts and related enhanced content offers to draw users deemed highly desirable to our advertisers to our properties
	and, second, upon effectively serving more targeted advertising to those users. We have realized higher advertiser demand for our
	owned and operated user audience, and as a result, we have been able to realize a greater overall return, or higher lifetime value,
	from our media buy spend to acquire these users. This growth in our owned and operated user audience has lessened our dependency
	on the lower lifetime value users from our third party application partners. Third party application partners’ user were
	largely concentrated in international markets and our international revenue decreased significantly due to the decrease in users
	in such markets. Revenues attributable to the user base of our domestic third party application partners stabilized, albeit at
	a lower level, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lastly, the remaining decline in revenue of $6,631,000 was from our publisher-based
	video syndication business, where we made cuts to narrow our offerings to reposition and improve the profitability of this publisher-based
	sector of our business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s overall revenue trend is stable and we believe it provides
	a good foundation for growth in 2017.


	 



	Gross profit



	 


	Gross Profit for the year ended December 31, 2016
	decreased by $5,141,000 or 12% to $39,516,000 as compared to $44,657,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. As discussed above,
	during the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues declined by $17,554,000, or 22%. However, our cost of revenues decreased
	by $12,413,000 or 36% over the same period, driving our gross margin to 65% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to
	57% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in gross margin percentage was attributable principally to the higher yield,
	or lifetime value, earned on the owned and operated audience base, as compared to the yield earned on the less profitable user
	audience base of the third party application partners, as well as to a reduction during the year ended December 31, 2016 of approximately
	$4,364,000 in media and publisher costs on account of the sale of our Health Guru operation and our cuts made in the video syndication
	business. As our user audience has shifted substantially to that of our owned and operated properties, and away from that of our
	third partly application partners, our costs of revenues and gross profit are increasingly sensitive to our media buy spending
	(to draw user audience to our owned and operated properties), rather than the costs of the commissions paid to the third party
	application partners based directly on ads served by us to the users from the third party application partners.

	Operating income



	 


	Operating income for the year ended December 31,
	2016 decreased by $1,945,000 or 10% to $16,667,000 as compared to $18,612,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating income
	as a percentage of revenue increased to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 24% for the year ended December 31, 2015.
	The decrease in operating income was principally on account of a decline in gross profit of $5,141,000, as discussed above, offset
	by a reduction in operating expenses of $3,196,000, due principally to the April 2016 operating restructuring and related workforce
	reductions.


	 



	Cost of revenues



	 


	Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31,
	2016 decreased by $12,413,000, or 36%, to $21,710,000 as compared to $34,123,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 was attributable principally to the shift in spending for user acquisition toward media buy
	spending to grow our owned and operated properties and away from commissions paid for third party application partners. As a result,
	for the year ended December 31, 2016, commissions paid to our third party application partners declined by $7,192,000 or 71% to
	$2,835,000, and publisher ad serving video costs declined by $4,364,000 to $4,761,000 on account of the sale of our Health Guru
	operation and our cuts made in the video syndication business. These reductions were offset by an increase of $2,599,000 to $12,710,000
	in domestic media buying costs incurred in support of our owned and operated user audience.


	 



	Salaries, Commissions, Benefits and Related Expenses



	 


	Salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $760,000, or 5% to $14,123,000 as compared to $14,883,000 for the year ended
	December 31, 2015. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to reductions of approximately $1,700,000 in salary
	and related benefit costs savings, principally in connection with the April 2016 workforce reductions, offset by related increased
	severance costs of $379,000 and accelerated stock-based compensation of $489,000.


	 



	Technology, development and maintenance expenses



	 


	Technology, development and maintenance expenses
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $504,000 or 13%, to $3,488,000 as compared to $3,992,000 for the year ended
	December 31, 2015. The decrease was principally due to an optimization of technology resources to support our revenue and media
	buying initiatives.


	 



	Other Costs and Operating Expenses



	 


	Other costs and operating expenses (sales and marketing,
	general and administrative, and professional services) for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $2,019,000 or 41%, to
	$2,913,000 as compared to $4,932,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of the total decrease, $1,429,000 was due to lower rent,
	bad debt, travel and office expenses, resulting in part from our April 2016 operational restructuring and the closing of our offices
	in New York and New Jersey. We also realized decreases in legal, accounting and tax service fees of $606,000, which were higher
	during the year ended December 31, 2015 in support of our merger and becoming a public company.


	 



	Depreciation and Amortization



	 


	Depreciation and amortization expenses for the
	year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $205,000 or 11%, to $2,142,000 as compared to $1,937,000 for the year ended December
	31, 2015. The increase was principally a result of amortization for capitalized software for a large project being placed in service
	and amortized in connection with the Company’s ongoing technology development.

	Impairment of software and intangible assets



	 


	Impairment charges for the year ended December
	31, 2016 decreased by $118,000 or 39% to $183,000 as compared to $301,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was
	a result of an $183,000 impairment during 2016 as a result of writing off the carrying amounts of Health Guru Media’s software
	and video library due to declines in the performance of the related business. During 2015, the Company recorded a full impairment
	in the amount of $301,000 for the trade name acquired in connection with the reverse merger with Kitara.


	 



	Other income (expense)



	 


	Interest expense, net, decreased by $1,180,000
	to $12,311,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $13,491,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease
	was principally due to the decrease in the balances of the Term Loan and Revolving Loan. The decrease in interest expense also
	reflects the benefit of a one-time favorable interest reduction of $190,000 from the Lenders related to the revolver.


	 


	On June 30, 2016, our former Chief Executive Officer
	forgave a promissory note due from the Company to him on January 1, 2023. As a result, we recognized a gain of $106,000 from the
	extinguishment of debt.


	 



	Net income



	 


	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016
	was $581,000, as compared to net income of $35,711,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Income before income tax expense was
	$4,478,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to income before income tax benefit of $5,121,000 for the year ended
	December 31, 2015. The decrease in the income before income tax expense of $643,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 was
	principally on account of a decline in operating income of $1,945,000 offset by a decrease in interest and other (income)/expense,
	net of $1,302,000. The 2016 income tax expense includes a charge of $1,956,000, principally to reflect adjustments to the deferred
	asset accounts for updated estimated state apportionment factors for future state income taxes. The 2015 income tax benefit was
	principally to recognize deferred tax assets for the step up in basis for income tax purposes in connection with the change in
	income tax status of Propel Media. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily to the increase
	in income tax expense.


	 



	Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure)  



	 


	In addition to the results presented in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, which
	is based upon the adjusted EBITDA which we report to our Lenders, and is a key measurement monitored by management, and is determined
	by taking net (loss) income and adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, stock based compensation,
	bank fees, losses from extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring items, noncash items, merger and other onetime expenses and severance.
	We believe that this non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP results, provides useful information
	to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results. The non-GAAP measure presented herein may not be comparable
	to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Please refer to page 34 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net
	income.


	 


	Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016
	decreased by $2,018,000, or 8%, to $21,932,000 as compared to $23,950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Overall the decrease
	in Adjusted EBITDA was principally due to the decrease of $5,141,000 in gross profit which was offset by the decrease of operating
	expenses by $3,196,000.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, our cash on hand was $2,823,000
	and we had a working capital deficit of $3,714,000. We recorded net income of $581,000 for year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting
	an income before income tax of $4,478,000, less income tax expense of $3,897,000.


	 


	We have relied on cash flows provided by operations
	to fund operations and operating obligations. As discussed above, we have been growing our owned and operated user audience, which
	has been helping us to grow our revenues. We have also lowered our operating costs, which have helped to soften the impact from
	our lower revenues. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA has improved over the four calendar quarters of 2016.


	 


	We are a party to the Financing Agreement with
	Kitara and Propel Media, as Borrowers, certain of their subsidiaries, as Guarantors, and with certain Lenders. The Financing Agreement
	provides us with the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, we had indebtedness and
	other commitments that principally consisted of $67,531,000 for our Term Loan (bearing interest at approximately 10% per annum)
	and $0 for our Revolving Loan (bearing interest at 7.0% per annum for loans based upon the LIBOR and 9.5% per annum for reference
	rate loans). In addition, we have $10,000,000 (which can be satisfied with cash or stock as per the terms of the Exchange Agreement)
	and $6,000,000 (which can be satisfied only with cash as per the terms of the Exchange Agreement) of deferred payment obligations
	to the Transferors. Mr. Jared Pobre, one of the former members of Propel Media, on behalf of the Transferors, is permitted to elect,
	during the ten day period following each December 31st, commencing December 31, 2016, to receive any unpaid amount of such $10,000,000
	deferred obligation in shares of the Company’s common stock. In addition, we have a $12,500,000 obligation due to the Lenders
	pursuant to the Financing Agreement. We are obligated under our Financing Agreement to fund a principal reduction of $1,750,000
	at the end of each calendar quarter. Our Term Loan matures in January 2019. Amounts due to the Transferors are due in 2019, as
	well as the $12,500,000 payment due to the Lenders pursuant to the Financing Agreement


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, there was an outstanding balance
	of $0 and the borrowing base under the Revolving Loan was approximately $4,072,000. As of December 31, 2016, there was capacity
	of $4,072,000 to be drawn under the Revolving Loan.


	 


	The Financing Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain
	a Total Leverage Ratio as of each calendar quarter end. Total Leverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of certain debt on such date
	to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing 12-month period. Under this covenant, we were required to maintain a Total Leverage
	Ratio of no more than 3.25:1.00 as of December 31, 2016. Our Total Leverage Ratio as of such date was 3.08:1.00. The balance of
	our Term Loan decreases at the end of each calendar quarter as we remit a principal reduction of $1,750,000 each quarter. The
	Total Leverage Ratio that we must maintain decreases in each of the next five quarters, from 2.70:1.00 as of March 31, 2017 to
	2.30:1.00 for March 31, 2018 and remains at 2.30:1.00 for each quarter thereafter. The Financing Agreement also contains negative
	covenants that, among other things, (i) limit the amount we may invest in capital improvements; (ii) limit the amount we may incur
	in additional debt; and (iii) require the delivery of certain periodic financial statements and an operating budget.




	 




	We
	are currently in compliance, and, as of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance, with all covenants under the Financing Agreement
	and other loan documents. However, our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of
	factors, whether currently known or unknown, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause us to fail to meet such
	covenants. Readers are cautioned to review the risks set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” for information
	relating to the risks surrounding our continued compliance with such covenants.

	Management believes that the Company’s cash balances

	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of cash in-flow from accounts receivable, in conjunction with the reverse-merger in
	year 2015.

	year ended December 31, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 is principally attributable
	to the purchases of property and equipment, primarily for internally developed software and computer equipment. The net cash provided
	by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was mainly composed of the cash acquired in connection with the reverse
	merger with Kitara Media Corp offset by purchases of property and equipment.

	During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash flows used in financing activities consisted of a $7,000,000 principal reduction
	of the Term Loan and net repayments of $1,762,000 under the Revolving Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows
	from financing activities consisted principally of the financing through the Financing Agreement, offset by the amounts funded

	We generate revenue from advertisers by serving our ads
	to a user audience consisting of our private owned and operated member-based network, users of our third party application partners’
	properties and users from our publisher-based traffic. In all cases, our revenue is generated when an advertisement is served by
	us or when a user action occurs based on the advertisement we served (such as, for instance, a view, a click or a conversion action).
	 There is a specific transaction that triggers a billable instance.


	 


	We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards
	Codification (“ASC”) Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition” (“ASC 605”). Accordingly, we recognize
	revenue when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, no significant Company obligations
	remain, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and the amounts are fixed and determinable. The gross advertising
	campaign revenue is recognized in the period that the advertising impressions, clicks or actions occur, provided that all other
	revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our agreements have not required a guaranteed minimum number of impressions, clicks
	or actions. With respect to advertising campaign activities, we act as a principal in that we are the primary obligor to the advertiser
	customer.


	 


	The amounts on deposit from customers are recorded as
	an advertiser deposit liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

	Property and equipment


	 


	Property and equipment are stated at historical cost
	less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense are computed using the straight-line method
	over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally, three years for computer equipment and purchased software, three to five
	years for furniture and equipment, the shorter of the useful life and the term of the lease for leasehold improvements.


	 


	We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances
	have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed
	assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets with definite
	lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
	Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360 “Property, Plant, and Equipment” whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
	by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be
	generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount
	by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted
	cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability.


	 


	We capitalize certain costs related to our software developed
	or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation
	activities are expensed as incurred. Internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage, including upgrades
	and enhancements representing modifications that will result in significant additional functionality, are capitalized.  Software
	maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are
	amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful life. We evaluate these assets for impairment whenever
	events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.


	 


	In accordance with ASC 985-20 “Accounting for the
	Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,” software development costs are expensed as incurred
	until technological feasibility (generally in the form of a working model) has been established. Research and development costs
	which consist primarily of salaries and fees paid to third parties for the development of software and applications are expensed
	as incurred. We capitalize only those costs directly attributable to the development of the software. Capitalization of these costs
	begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Activities undertaken after the products are available for release
	to customers to correct errors or keep the product up to date are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs
	will be amortized over the estimated economic life of the software once the product is available for general release to customers.
	Capitalized software development costs will be amortized over the greater of the ratio of current revenue to total projected revenue
	for a product or the straight-line method. We will periodically perform reviews of the recoverability of such capitalized software
	costs.


	 


	At the time a determination is made that capitalized
	amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software, any remaining capitalized
	amounts are written off. No impairment losses were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.


	 


	Debt Issuance Costs


	 


	Debt issuance costs (principally legal and other fees)
	are charged as debt discounts and are amortized over the term of the related loan using the effective interest method. Amortization
	of debt issuance costs amounted to $243,000 and $244,000

	 

	for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
	and is included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated income statements.

	Business Combinations



	 


	For a business combination, the assets acquired, the
	liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, measured at their
	fair values as of that date. In a business combination achieved in stages, the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as
	the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, are recognized at the full amounts of their fair values. In a bargain purchase in
	which the total acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration
	transferred plus any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, that excess in earnings are recognized as a gain attributable to
	the Company.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 


	Our management, with the participation of our Chief
	Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
	(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we
	refer to as the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
	Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, these controls and procedures were effective
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
	processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
	forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed by us in the report that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
	our chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Limitations on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


	 


	An internal control system over financial reporting
	has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
	can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
	evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
	conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations
	are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce,
	though not eliminate, this risk.

	Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting


	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
	the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
	assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
	made only in accordance with the authorization of our board of directors and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding
	prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
	on our financial statements.


	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation
	of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial and principal accounting officer, we performed
	a complete documentation of the Company’s significant processes and key controls, and conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

	Internal Control—Integrated Framework

	issued
	by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, management concluded
	that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	This Form 10-K does not include an attestation
	report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as such report
	is not required for smaller reporting companies.


	 


	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting


	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over
	financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect our internal control over financial reporting.

	the Board of Directors and Stockholders of




	Propel
	Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Propel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
	of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ deficit equity
	and cash flows for the years then ended.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
	statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
	of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
	as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
	opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
	financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
	the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
	financial position of Propel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its
	operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America.

	Propel
	Media, Inc. (“Propel”), a Delaware corporation, is a diversified online advertising company. Propel generates revenues
	through the sale of advertising for advertisers who want to reach consumers in the United States and internationally to promote
	their products and services. Propel is a holding company for Propel Media LLC (“Propel Media”), a California limited
	liability company, and Kitara Media Corp. (“Kitara”), a Delaware corporation (Propel, Propel Media and Kitara and
	their respective subsidiaries, together, the “Company”).




	 




	Propel
	delivers advertising via its real-time, bid-based, online advertising platform called Propel Media Platform. This technology platform
	allows advertisers to target audiences and deliver video, display and text based advertising. Propel and its Propel Media Platform
	provide advertisers with an effective way to serve, manage and maximize the performance of their online advertising purchasing.
	Propel offers both a self-serve platform and a managed services option that give advertisers diverse solutions to reach online
	audiences and acquire customers. Propel has more than 1,400 advertiser customers and serves millions of ads per day.




	 




	Propel
	primarily serves its advertising to users who are part of its owned and operated member-based network or the member-based networks
	of its third party application partners. Propel provides its audience with access to its premium content for free and obtains
	the users’ permission to serve advertising to them while they peruse content on the web. In the owned and operated model,
	advertising units are served directly to users through a browser extension or other software installed on the user’s computer.
	Under the third party application model, Propel serves advertising through its partners who are providing a variety of applications
	free of charge in exchange for the ability to serve ads to their users.




	 




	Propel
	has also developed a publisher business model with a channel of direct publishers, networks and exchanges. These supply channels
	expand our ability to serve advertising. In this model, the advertising units are served to users through a website, and we serve
	advertising units to the user in coordination with the publisher, network or exchange.




	 




	Propel
	was formed on October 7, 2014. On January 28, 2015, Propel consummated the “reverse business combination” (the “Reverse
	Merger” or the “Transactions”) as contemplated by (i) the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger
	Agreement”), dated as of October 10, 2014, by and among Kitara, Propel, which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of
	Kitara, and Kitara Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Propel, and
	(ii) the Unit Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of October 10, 2014 and amended as of December
	23, 2014, April 29, 2015 and January 26, 2016 by and among Kitara, Propel, Propel Media and the former members of Propel Media
	(“Transferors”) (See Note 4 – Reverse Business Combination and Recapitalization). Prior to the Transactions,
	Kitara was a public operating company and Propel Media was a private operating company. Upon the closing of the Transactions,
	Propel became the new public company and Kitara and Propel Media became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Propel.




	 




	On
	January 28, 2015, in connection with the closing of the Reverse Merger, Propel, Kitara and Propel Media as “Borrowers”
	and certain of their subsidiaries as “Guarantors” entered into a financing agreement (“Financing Agreement”)
	with certain financial institutions as “Lenders.”




	 




	The
	Financing Agreement provided the Borrowers with (a) a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $81,000,000 (the “Term
	Loan”) and (b) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time outstanding
	(the “Revolving Loan” and, together with the Term Loan, the “Loans”). The Loans will mature on January
	28, 2019 (“Final Maturity Date”).




	 




	Immediately
	following the Reverse Merger, the Transferors collectively owned 61.7% of the merged company and the former stockholders of Kitara
	owned 38.3% of the merged company.




	 




	As
	a result of the Reverse Merger, the Transferors acquired a majority of Propel’s common stock and both Propel Media’s
	and Kitara’s officers became the officers and directors of Propel, including the Company’s prior Chief Executive Officer,
	Mr. Robert Regular, who later left the Company on April 30, 2016. For accounting purposes, the Reverse Merger has been treated
	as an acquisition of Kitara by Propel Media whereby Propel Media was deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The historical consolidated
	financial statements prior to January 28, 2015 are those of Propel Media. In connection with the Reverse Merger, the equity accounts
	of Propel Media have been restated on a recapitalization basis so that all equity accounts are now presented as if the member
	interest exchanged for shares of Propel Media common stock had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

	On
	April 26 and April 27, 2016, Propel notified its employees about plans to reduce the Company’s workforce by approximately
	20% percent. These actions were part of a strategic plan designed to improve operational and cost efficiency. For the most part,
	the employee reductions were in the Company’s publisher business.




	 






	Sale
	of Health Guru Operations






	 



	On April 27, 2016, the Company sold substantially all the assets
	constituting the ongoing operations of its Health Guru business, and subsequently changed the name of Health Guru Media to “Tek
	Array, Inc.” Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, the Company received a cash payment of $54,000 at closing. The
	Company is eligible to receive the following contingent consideration: (i) upon each closing of a capital raise from an outside
	third party conducted by the purchaser for the Health Guru business, up to $200,000 in the aggregate among all such closings,
	provided that only 5% of the net proceeds (after deducting commissions and expenses) from any such raise shall be used to satisfy
	this payment obligation and (ii) quarterly payments over the 36 months following the closing date equal to 50% of the quarterly
	profits generated in full, or in part, by the assets, provided that such contingent payments shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the
	aggregate. Through December 31, 2016, other than the gross cash proceeds from seller of $54,000, the Company has received no other
	consideration from the sale of the Health Guru business.



	 





	Note
	2 – Liquidity and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company’s cash on hand was $2,823,000 and the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,714,000.
	The Company recorded income of $581,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net income for the year ended December 31, 2016
	reflected an income before income tax of $4,478,000 and an income tax expense of $3,897,000. The 2016 income tax expense includes
	a charge of approximately $1,956,000, principally to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax accounts for updated estimates
	for state apportionment factors. The Company has historically met its liquidity requirements through operations.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, the borrowing base and outstanding balance under the Revolving Loan were approximately $4,072,000 and $0,
	respectively, leaving $4,072,000 available to be drawn under the arrangement.




	 




	Cash
	flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $7,000,000 of principal repayments on the
	Company’s Term Loan and repayments, net of borrowings, of $1,762,000 of the Revolving Loan.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Financing Agreement, the Company is subject to a leverage ratio requirement as of the end of each calendar quarter. The
	Company was in compliance with such leverage ratio requirement as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	Management
	believes that the Company’s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations and borrowings available
	under the Company’s Revolving Loan will be sufficient to fund the Company’s net cash requirements through March 2018.

	Basis

	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding consolidated financial information.




	 






	Principles
	of Consolidation








	 






	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances
	and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.




	 






	Use
	of Estimates








	 






	The
	Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.
	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to the accounts
	receivable allowance, the forfeiture of customer deposits, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, valuation of goodwill
	and intangibles, recognition of revenue, and the valuation of stock options.




	 






	Cash








	 






	The
	Company’s credit facility includes the Revolving Loan. The Company classifies a negative balance outstanding under the Revolving
	Loan as cash, as this amount is legally owed to the Company and is immediately available to be drawn upon by the Company.




	 






	Restricted
	Cash








	 






	Restricted
	cash as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $94,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, restricted cash is comprised
	of a cash deposit to collateralize a letter of credit issued in favor of a landlord. The cash deposit was then released during
	2016 after the Company moved out of its New Jersey office.




	 






	Accounts
	Receivable






	 




	Accounts
	receivable are stated at a gross invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts.




	 




	The
	Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating specific accounts where information indicates the Company’s
	customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations, such as customer payment history, credit worthiness and receivable
	amounts outstanding for an extended period beyond contractual terms. The Company uses assumptions and judgment, based on the best
	available facts and circumstances, to record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These
	allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received.




	 




	The
	allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $266,000 and $290,000, respectively.

	Depreciation






	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense
	are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally, three years for computer
	equipment and purchased software, three to five years for furniture and equipment, the shorter of the useful life and the term
	of the lease for leasehold improvements.




	 




	The
	Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful
	life of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived
	assets and certain identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360 “Property,
	Plant, and Equipment” whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
	be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets
	to future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered
	to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
	fair value of the assets. The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed
	assets in measuring their recoverability.




	 






	Intangible
	Assets








	 






	The
	Company’s long-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
	there may be an impairment. These assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and
	assets not acquired in acquisitions were recorded at historical cost. However, if their estimated fair value is less than the
	carrying amount, other intangible assets with indefinite life are reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment
	charge to our condensed consolidated statements of operations




	 






	Capitalization
	of Internally Developed Software







	 





	The
	Company capitalizes certain costs related to its software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40.
	Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal and external
	costs incurred during the application development stage, including upgrades and enhancements representing modifications that will
	result in significant additional functionality, are capitalized. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.
	Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s
	estimated useful life ranging from 12 months to 36 months. The Company evaluates these assets for impairment whenever events or
	changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Based upon the decline in performance of

	Goodwill








	 






	Goodwill
	represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired. Goodwill and other
	intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead
	tested for impairment at least annually. An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events
	or circumstances lead to a conclusion that is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its
	carrying amount. If an entity determines that qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value
	of the entity exceeds the carrying amount, the two step quantitative evaluation is not necessary. Under the two-step quantitative
	impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
	value, including goodwill.




	 




	In
	the event the estimated fair value of the Company is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The
	additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that
	goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts
	assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and
	the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair
	value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results
	of operations and stockholders' equity.




	 




	On
	January 28, 2015, in connection with the Reverse Merger, the Company used both a discounted cash flows approach and a guideline
	companies’ model approach to estimate the current fair value of Kitara in connection with the reverse business combination
	of Kitara. The guideline companies’ method utilizes financial and market data on publicly traded securities of companies
	engaged in business pursuits similar to those of Kitara, from which prevailing investor attitudes and expectations are developed.
	Differences between the publicly traded companies and Kitara are analyzed and considered in order to develop representative market
	multiples, which, in turn, were applied to Kitara’s operating results to develop an indication of value.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company evaluated goodwill for potential impairment. Pursuant to the accounting guidance, the Company
	elected to initially assess certain qualitative factors in order to determine whether a quantitative analysis was required. Since
	the carrying amount of the Company’s reporting unit was negative, in evaluating the qualitative factors, the Company was
	required to determine whether there were any adverse qualitative factors pointing to a conclusion that an impairment of goodwill
	exists. If so, then the Company would need to conduct the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the amount of
	impairment, if any. In its evaluation, the Company evaluated macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, trends in financial
	performance, Company specific events which might adversely impact the fair value of the reporting unit, as well as whether there
	were any significant differences between the carrying amounts and the estimated fair values of the reporting unit's assets and
	liabilities, and/or the existence of significant unrecognized intangibles. Based upon this qualitative evaluation, the Company
	determined that as of December 31, 2016, in the aggregate, such factors did not point to a conclusion that an impairment of goodwill
	would exist. Based upon this evaluation, the Company concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2016.

	providing refunds or reactivations to customers for which it does not have the contractual obligation to do so for business development

	the Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, no significant
	Company obligations remain, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and the amounts are fixed and determinable.
	The gross advertising campaign revenue is recognized in the period that the advertising impressions, clicks or actions occur,
	provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company’s agreements do not require a guaranteed
	minimum number of impressions, clicks or actions. With respect to advertising campaign activities, the Company acts as a principal
	in that it is the primary obligor to the advertiser customer.

	Income

	Effective
	January 28, 2015, the Company completed its Reverse Merger, whereby Propel Media (a limited liability company) was deemed to be
	the accounting acquirer of Kitara (a C corporation). The historical financial statements were those of Propel Media. From the
	date of the Reverse Merger, the Company’s results of operations began to be taxed as a C corporation. Prior to the
	Reverse Merger, the Company’s operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the Company elected to be taxed
	as a partnership and the income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their separate income tax returns.
	Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods
	prior to January 28, 2015.




	 




	This
	change in tax status to a taxable entity resulted in the recognition of a net deferred tax asset based on the expected tax consequences
	of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the Company’s assets at the date of the Reverse Merger. This
	resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $31,735,000 being recognized upon the consummation of the Reverse Merger, and was determined
	using an effective tax rate of 38.9%. This tax benefit was principally on account of a step up in basis of Propel Media for income
	tax purposes. There was no step up in basis for accounting purposes.




	 




	In
	connection with the Reverse Merger with Kitara, the Company recorded deferred tax assets of $2,843,000, representing principally
	net operating loss carryforwards (“NOL’s”).




	 




	The
	unaudited pro forma computation of income tax expense included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December
	31, 2015, represents the tax effects that would have been reported had the Company been subject to U.S. federal and state income
	taxes as a corporation for all periods presented. Pro forma income tax expense is based upon the statutory income tax rates and
	adjustments to income for estimated permanent differences occurring during each period. Actual rates and expenses could have differed
	had the Company actually been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes for all periods presented. Therefore, the unaudited
	pro forma amounts are for informational purposes only and are intended to be indicative of the results of operations had the Company
	been subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes as a corporation for all periods presented.

	The
	Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
	in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between
	the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which
	the differences are expected to reverse. The Company estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carryforwards will result
	in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards
	is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized
	in future periods. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets
	would be reduced. Tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
	by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely
	to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed
	in the Company’s tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related
	interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions
	as a component of income tax expense.

	per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares
	outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of
	stock options and warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company excluded potential common shares resulting from
	the exercise of stock options (23,351,875 potential common shares) and of warrants (6,363,636 potential common shares) as their
	inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company excluded potential common shares resulting
	from the exercise of stock options (28,755,000 potential common shares) and of warrants (6,363,636 potential common shares) as
	their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.





	 







	Stock-based

	The
	Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC
	718”). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC
	718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense
	over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company’s
	common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility,
	dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company calculates the expected volatility using the historical
	volatility for a pool of peer companies over the most recent period equal to the expected term and evaluates the extent to which
	available information indicate that future volatility may differ from historical volatility. The expected dividend rate is zero
	as the Company does not expect to pay or declare any cash dividends on its common stock. The risk-free rates for the expected
	terms of the stock options are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company has not
	experienced significant exercise activity on stock options. Due to the lack of historical information, the Company determined
	the expected term of its stock option awards issued using the simplified method. The simplified method assumes each vesting tranche
	of the award has a term equal to the midpoint between when the award vests and when the award expires. The Company expenses stock-based
	compensation by using the straight-line method.

	The
	Company accounts for stock options granted to consultants pursuant to the accounting guidance included in ASC 505-50 “Equity-Based
	Payments to Non-Employees” (“ASC 505-50”). Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date and at
	the end of each reporting period for unvested awards, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over
	the consultant’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company’s
	stock options granted to consultants are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
	expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. In accordance with ASC 505-50, the Company
	recorded adjustments at the end of each reporting period to reflect the mark-to-market adjustment of the fair value of unvested
	awards granted to consultants. In connection with the mark-to-market adjustments at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company utilized
	the closing price of the Company’s common stock, as published on the OTC Pink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group (“OTC
	Pink Market”), as an input to the Black Scholes option-pricing model for the fair value of its common stock.

	of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”). This standard is
	intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization’s
	ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are
	prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited
	circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting.




	 




	The
	going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring
	and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, US GAAP lacks guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate
	whether there is substantial doubt about the organization’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related
	footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization’s management, with principles and definitions that are
	intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the
	financial statement footnotes. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
	within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods
	for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company has adopted ASU 2014-15 effective December 31,
	2016 and such adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.




	 




	In
	September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments”.
	ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.
	Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the
	adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been
	completed at the acquisition date. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016 and such adoption did not have
	a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

	On
	March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update requires
	that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies arising from share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense
	or benefit on the income statement. The amendment also states that excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income
	tax cash flows as an operating activity. In addition, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate
	the number of awards expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of this update are effective for

	Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-10”). ASU 2016-10 clarifies the following two aspects of Topic
	606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for
	those areas. ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
	December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard
	will have on its consolidated financial statements.

	“Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU 2016-12”). The core principal of ASU 2016-12
	is the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
	consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The provisions of this update

	of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”). The amendments for this update provide guidance
	on the eight specific cash flows: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent
	consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the
	settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests

	In
	November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-18 “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
	Cash” (“ASU 2016-18”). The amendments in this update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change
	during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
	equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with
	cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash
	flows. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
	application permitted. The amendments in this update do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restrict cash equivalents.
	The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In
	January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2017-04 “Intangibles-Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying
	the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2014-04”). To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the Board
	eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had
	to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized
	assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
	assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this Update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim,
	goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize
	an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss
	recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider
	income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment
	loss, if applicable. The Board also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount
	to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
	Therefore, the same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill
	allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform
	the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The provisions
	of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early application permitted
	after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated
	financial statements.

	The

	On
	January 28, 2015, Propel, Propel Media and Kitara consummated the Transactions.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Exchange Agreement, as amended, the Transferors exchanged all of the outstanding Propel Media limited liability company
	interests for (i) $80,000,000 in cash, (ii) 154,125,921 shares of Propel common stock, (iii) the right to receive performance-based
	“earn out” payments that enables the Transferors to receive up to an additional $40,000,000 in cash or stock consideration
	based on Propel Media reaching certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) levels
	during the 2015 to 2018 fiscal years, (iv) the right to receive on or prior to June 30, 2019, a $10,000,000 payment (the “Deferred
	Obligation”) in cash and/or shares of Propel common stock, and (v) the right to receive immediately after the payment of
	certain fees to Highbridge on or about January 28, 2019, the $6,000,000 Deferred Payment in cash (the “Exchange”).




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Exchange Agreement, as amended on January 26, 2016, the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation is payable in cash and/or stock
	not later than June 30, 2019. The Company can pay the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation from the raising of capital via an equity
	financing or from available working capital. The Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to complete equity financings
	that would raise sufficient net proceeds to pay the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in cash to the Transferors on or before June
	30, 2019 (the “Equity Financing Period”). In addition, the Company’s board of directors, at least two times
	per year during the Equity Financing Period is obligated to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the amount, if any,
	of the Company’s working capital available to be used to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in
	cash, taking into account such factors as it may deem relevant. If the Company’s board of directors determines that there
	is available working capital to pay all or a portion of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation, the Company must use its reasonable
	best efforts to promptly obtain any required lender consent and, if such consent is obtained, must promptly pay to the Transferors
	an amount in cash equal to such available working capital. Finally, Mr. Jared Pobre, one of the former members of Propel Media,
	on behalf of the Transferors, is permitted to elect, during the ten day period following each December 31st during the Equity
	Financing Period, commencing December 31, 2016, to receive any unpaid amount of the $10,000,000 Deferred Obligation in shares
	of the Company’s common stock. For such issuance, each share of the Company’s common stock will be valued at the closing
	market price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ or such other national securities exchange on which the
	Company’s common stock is listed (or if not so listed, the bid price on the OTC Pink Market) on the date prior to the date
	on which such shares are issued to the Transferors.




	 



	The Company recorded the obligations for the $10,000,000 Deferred
	Payment and the $6,000,000 Deferred Payment, (in the aggregate, “Deferred Payments to Transferors”) to Transferors
	at fair value. Fair value was determined by recording the fixed obligations at their net present value, discounted at an interest
	rate of 10% per annum. The discount rate used was based upon the interest rate of the Term Loan. The Company is amortizing the
	discount utilizing the interest method over the periods for which future amounts are due. On January 28, 2015 upon the consummation
	of the Exchange, the Company recorded the fair value of the Deferred Payments to Transferors of $12,696,000, reflecting a discount
	of $3,304,000. As discussed above, on January 26, 2016, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the transferors agreed to defer receipt
	of the $10,000,000 until June 2019. This extension of the timing to remit payment was evaluated for extinguishment accounting.
	The amendment was determined to be a modification for accounting purposes, and as such, the unamortized discount for the $10,000,000
	obligation on the date of the amendment was $418,000, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the obligation. As a
	result, subsequent to the amendment date, the effective interest rate on the obligation was reduced to 1.25%. During the years
	ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded discount amortization of $645,000 and $1,227,000, respectively. The unamortized
	discount was $1,431,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $2,077,000 as of December 31, 2015.



	 




	Propel
	agreed to reimburse the Transferors for all transaction expenses paid by Propel Media, its subsidiaries or the Transferors on
	or before the closing, and assumed all of their unpaid transaction expenses as of such date. During the year ended December 31,
	2015, the Company paid $867,000 of these expenses to the Transferors.

	In connection with the acquisition of Kitara, the Company assumed
	two notes payable to Mr. Regular, a shareholder and the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer. The first note had a balance
	of $102,000 and was repaid immediately after the closing of the Reverse Merger. The second note had a face value of $200,000 with
	an annual interest rate of 1% that would have matured on January 1, 2023. The second note accrued interest that would have been
	due at the time the principal became due and payable. As of December 31, 2015, the net outstanding balance on the second
	note was $106,000 (net of a discount of $94,000). The Company calculated the discount at the acquisition date using a market rate
	of 10%. The second note bore a below market interest rate of 1%. As such, the Company determined a market rate of 10% and recorded
	a discount which was amortized over the remaining term of the loan. The market rate was determined based upon the interest rate
	of the Term Loan. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Regular forgave the second note payable due to him in exchange for a $5,000 cash payment
	and the rights to a website, domain name, and email member databases. The Company realized a gain of $106,000 as a result of the
	extinguishment of the second note.

	The
	Financing Agreement provided for certain fees to be paid, including (i) a closing fee of $2,880,000 which was withheld from the
	proceeds of the Term Loan and was accounted for as an original issue discount and is being amortized to interest expense using
	the interest method over the term of the Term Loan and (ii) a (“Deferred Fee”) of $12,500,000 payable to the Lenders
	and due upon the fourth anniversary of the inception of the Term Loan. The Company is accreting the Deferred Fee as a finance
	charge over the term of the Term Loan. The Company recorded amortization of the closing fee as interest expense of $762,000 and
	$767,000, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The balance of the closing fee original issue discount
	was $1,360,000 and $2,122,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is reflected within the Term Loan obligations
	on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded as interest expense accretion of the Deferred Fee of $3,227,000 and $3,117,000,
	for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The balance of the accreted Deferred Fee as of December 31, 2016
	was $6,344,000, and is reflected within the Term Loan obligations on the consolidated balance sheets.




	 




	In
	addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $916,000 in connection with the Loans which has been accounted for as debt
	discount and is being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the Term Loan. The Company recorded as interest
	expense amortization of the debt issuance costs of $243,000 and $244,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
	The balance of the unamortized debt issuance costs of $428,000 and $671,000 is reflected within the Term Loan obligations on the
	consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	 




	The
	Financing Agreement and other loan documents contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants,
	including covenants that restrict the Borrowers’ ability to, among other things, create certain liens, make certain types
	of borrowings and engage in certain mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, asset sales and affiliate transactions. The Company
	is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement as of the end of each calendar quarter. The Financing Agreement provides for customary
	events of default, including, among other things, if a change of control of Propel occurs. The Loans may be accelerated upon the
	occurrence of an event of default. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants and the leverage
	ratio requirement under the Finance Agreement.

	on the last day of each March, June, September and December commencing on March 31, 2015, except that the payment due on March
	31, 2015 was $1,219,000. The remainder of the Term Loan is due and payable on the maturity date, except in certain limited circumstances.




	 



	Subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement, the Term Loan
	or any portion thereof shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding, from the date of the
	Term Loan until repaid, at a rate per annum equal to 9.00% plus either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
	(but not less than 1% and not more than 3%) for the interest period in effect for the Term Loan (or such portion thereof), or
	(ii) the bank’s reference rate. For each interest period, the Company may choose to pay interest under either the LIBOR
	or reference rate method. During the year ended December 31, 2016, interest on the Term Loan bore an effective interest rate of
	approximately 10.0% per annum.

	a one-time favorable interest reduction of $190,000 from the Lenders related to the Revolving Loan.

	The
	Company has outsourced technology development services and other administrative services to a technology company in Eastern Europe
	(“Technology Vendor”). This technology company is owned by an individual who through October 6, 2014 owned more than
	10% of the member interest in Propel Media and subsequent to which such ownership was transferred to certain trusts. The technology
	development services and other administrative services provided to the Company by this related party during the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, totaled $3,283,000 and $2,735,000 respectively. These amounts were included in property and equipment and operating
	expenses, as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. Certain of the
	costs incurred for the technology development services described above were for the development of internal-use software, which
	were capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life. In addition, the Company had amounts due to this entity of $7,000
	and $3,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are reported within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance
	sheets.




	 




	On
	January 28, 2015, in connection with the Reverse Merger, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Howard Yeaton as the
	Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yeaton is the Managing Principal of Financial Consulting Strategies LLC (“FCS”).
	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has incurred a total of $194,000 and $525,000, respectively, representing
	Mr. Yeaton’s services as the Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer and other financial advisory and accounting
	services provided by FCS. The balance due to FCS was $0 and $7,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was included
	within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.

	On
	December 10, 2008, the Company entered into a non-cancelable lease agreement for its Irvine, California office facility expiring
	on August 31, 2014. On March 30, 2011, the Company amended the agreement to substitute the premises for a new location and to
	extend the lease term to July 31, 2018. The lease agreement for the new office facility provides for increases in future minimum
	annual rental payments. The agreement requires the Company to pay its portion of certain executory costs (real estate taxes, insurance
	and repairs).




	 




	On
	March 11, 2016, the Company signed a lease agreement for a New York, New York office location, with a month to month rental of
	$8,245 per month. On April 28, 2016, the Company gave its 30-day termination notice for this lease and accordingly, this lease
	was terminated as of May 31, 2016.




	 




	On
	April 1, 2016, the Company terminated its Jersey City, New Jersey lease whereby the Company’s last rental payment for this
	lease was through March 31, 2016. In addition, as part of the lease termination, the Company paid to the landlord a termination
	fee of $95,330 and paid its brokers $48,170 ($24,085 paid on June 1, 2016 and $24,085 paid on July 5, 2016). Lastly, as part of
	the lease termination, the Company transferred to the landlord the security deposit it received from its subtenant from the sublease
	agreement ($16,674).

	On
	March 6, 2015, the Company entered into an employment agreement (each an “Employment Agreement” and collectively the
	“Employment Agreements”) with each of Jared Pobre, Robert Regular, Marv Tseu and David Shapiro (each an “Executive”
	and collectively the “Executives”). Mr. Regular’s employment was terminated on April 22, 2016 (see below).




	 




	Effective
	April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Regular, who until April 30, 2016 served as the Company’s
	Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the separation agreement, the Company will pay Mr. Regular (i) $536,986 in 12 monthly installments,
	(ii) all valid expense reimbursements through April 30, 2016, and (iii) all accrued but unused vacation pay through April 30,
	2016. In addition, an option to purchase 2,400,000 shares at $0.20 per share held by Mr. Regular will fully vest and be exercisable
	until June 30, 2018 and an option to purchase 2,100,000 shares at $0.55 per share held by Mr. Regular will fully vest and be exercisable
	until April 30, 2017. Non-cash charges for the acceleration of these stock-based compensation awards were approximately $489,000.
	The employment agreement, as modified by the separation agreement, will restrict Mr. Regular from disclosing confidential information
	concerning the business of the Company, will contain customary restrictive covenants relating to noncompetition and non-solicitation,
	which continue to run until January 28, 2017, and Mr. Regular has agreed to release and waive all claims against the Company.
	On June 30, 2016, Mr. Regular forgave a note payable due to him in exchange for a $5,000 cash payment and the rights to certain
	website, domain name, and email member databases (See Note 4).




	 




	Effective
	April 30, 2016, Jared Pobre resigned at Executive Chairman of the Board and ceased to be an officer and employee of the Company. He
	continues to serve as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.    




	 




	The
	Employment Agreements with each of Messrs. Tseu and Shapiro are for a term of three years, unless earlier terminated as provided
	in the agreement or unless extended by mutual written agreement of the Company and the Executive. If the Executive continues to
	work for the Company after the expiration of the term, his employment is on the same terms as the Employment Agreement, except
	that he is an “at will” employee and the severance provisions described below will no longer be in effect.




	 




	The
	Employment Agreements, as amended, provide for base salaries of $486,000 for Mr. Tseu and $350,000 for Mr. Shapiro. Each of the
	Executives are reimbursed for their reasonable business expenses, subject to an exception for certain costs of commuting for Mr.
	Tseu.




	 




	Each
	of Messrs. Tseu and Shapiro is eligible to earn bonuses during the course of each year of his employment based on reaching individual
	and Company performance objectives in accordance with the existing quarterly bonus program of Propel Media. Under the quarterly
	bonus program, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company evaluates the financial performance of Propel Media and the performance
	of Messrs. Tseu and Shapiro and then calculates the bonuses for each Executive for such quarter.




	 




	The
	Employment Agreements provide that, in the event of a termination of an Executive’s employment by the Company without “cause”
	or by the Executive for “good reason” (each as defined in the Employment Agreements), the Company will pay him (i)
	an aggregate amount equal to 100% of his base salary, payable over the course of 12 months, subject to the Executive executing
	a general release of all claims against the Company, (ii) all valid expense reimbursements, and (iii) all accrued but unused vacation
	pay. In addition, all of Executive’s equity awards, including the options described below, will fully vest and be exercisable
	for one year following the termination of employment.




	 




	Each
	of the Employment Agreements restricts the Executive from disclosing confidential information concerning the business of the Company.




	 



	The Company also has in place with certain of its other executives
	agreements which provide for severance or salary continuation upon certain events, such as upon a change of control of the Company.

	In
	December 2013, an action entitled Intrepid Investments, LLC (“Intrepid”) v. Selling Source, LLC (“Selling Source”),
	et al., Index No. 65429/2013 was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This is an action commenced
	by Intrepid to collect on a Junior Secured Promissory Note signed by Selling Source in the original principal sum of $28,700,000
	(the “Note”). The Company is not a signatory to the Note but Kitara Media did sign an August 31, 2010 Security Agreement
	(“Security Agreement”) pledging all of its accounts, cash and cash equivalents, chattel paper, contracts, deposit
	accounts, documents, equipment, fixtures, general intangibles, all other goods, all shares of capital stock of any companies it
	owned, all instruments including all promissory notes, all intellectual property, all insurance policies and all proceeds thereof,
	all inventory, all other investment property, all letter of credit rights, all other tangible and intangible personal property
	and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, as security for the Note. At the time Kitara Media signed the Security Agreement, it
	was wholly-owned by Selling Source. On July 1, 2013, Kitara Media merged with one of Kitara’s then wholly-owned subsidiaries,
	with Kitara Media surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kitara. Accordingly, it is no longer wholly-owned
	by Selling Source, although it is still an affiliate of Selling Source.




	 




	In
	the action, Intrepid seeks to foreclose on the security interest. Both Selling Source’s and Kitara Media’s obligations
	to Intrepid under the Note and Security Agreement were subordinate to obligations Selling Source had to two groups of prior lenders
	(“Senior Lenders”). The right of Intrepid to compel payments under the Note and/or foreclose the lien created by the
	Security Agreement was subject to an Intercreditor Agreement by and between the Senior Lenders and Intrepid. Under the terms of
	the Intercreditor Agreement, Intrepid could not take steps to compel Selling Source to make payment on the Note or foreclose the
	Security Agreement so long as the obligations to the Senior Lenders remained outstanding. In addition, under the terms of the
	Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Lenders had the right to have the lien released on any of the collateral pledged as security
	under the Security Agreement. In the New York action, Intrepid has challenged the Senior Lenders’ authority to release the
	lien and also challenged the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement generally.  The Court has not yet ruled on the
	merits of that challenge.  In addition, Selling Source’s obligations to the Senior Lenders remains outstanding.




	 




	The
	second matter is Intrepid Investments, LLC v. Selling Source, LLC et al., Index No. 654309/2013, which was filed in the Supreme
	Court of the State of New York, County of New York. This matter was originally limited to claims asserted by Intrepid against
	Selling Source regarding an earn-out calculation entered into between it and Selling Source, and confirmed by an arbitrator. In
	August, 2014, Intrepid amended its complaint to include various breach of contractor claims against a variety of those defendants,
	including Kitara. The new defendants, including Kitara, answered the amended complaint on November 7, 2014, denying liability
	for all claims. On February 19, 2015, the Court entered an order granting Selling Source’s motion to affirm the arbitration
	results. On March 3, 2015, Selling Source filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of eleven of Intrepid’s
	remaining claims, and, in September 2015, the New York Supreme Court granted this motion for summary judgment. The claims asserted
	against Kitara were not among those addressed in Selling Source’s motion.

	The
	Company maintains a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Plan”). Participating
	employees may defer a percentage of their eligible pre-tax earnings up to the Internal Revenue Service’s annual contribution
	limit. All full-time employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Plan.




	 




	The
	Plan does not permit investment of participant contributions in the Company’s common stock. Company matching contributions
	to the Plan are discretionary. The Company recorded contribution expense of $222,000 and $187,000 during the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately
	$5,221,000 which were acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kitara. Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section
	382 limits the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards upon a change in control of a company.   Pursuant to
	IRC Section 382, changes in control occur when the stock ownership of one or more 5% shareholders (shareholders owning 5% or more
	of the Company’s outstanding capital stock) has increased on a cumulative basis by more than 50 percentage points. Management
	cannot control the ownership changes occurring as a result of public trading of the Company’s Common Stock. Accordingly,
	there is a risk of an ownership change beyond the control of the Company that could trigger a limitation of the use of the loss
	carryover. In connection with the acquisition of Kitara, the Company prepared an analysis under IRC Section 382 and determined
	that (i) there was a more than 50% ownership change on January 28, 2015 and (ii) that of the $8,200,000 acquired net operating
	losses, only $6,535,000 would be eligible for carryover to future periods.   The net operating losses are expected to
	expire in the years 2029 through 2034.

	The
	aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the weighted average exercise price of the underlying outstanding
	stock options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock, based upon the closing price of the Company’s common
	stock as reported on the OTC Pink Market on December 31, 2016. The Black-Scholes method option pricing model was used to estimate
	the fair value of the option awards using the following range of assumptions.  The simplified method was used to determine
	the expected life of grants to employees, as these granted options were determined to be “plain-vanilla” options.
	The full term was used for the expected life for options granted to consultants.
