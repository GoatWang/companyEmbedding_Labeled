Let Global Link Sourcing become your partner in worldwide manufacturing and we’ll put our expertise to work for you by providing the following services:
Every supplier is fully audited and qualified.   You deal directly with us, not with biased agents or trading companies. There are tens of thousands of manufacturers globally and without tremendous knowledge and experience, it’s hard to know who is reputable and who is not. We take responsibility for your project and guarantee to meet agreed upon product specifications and quality standards.  The buck stops with us.
Our payment terms improve your cash flow.   Payment is made after receipt and inspection of the goods, which eliminates your risk of paying up front with offshore manufacturers, agents or trading companies. *With approved business credit.
On-site QC throughout production.   This ensures all products are correct through every stage of production. Less mistakes in manufacturing means less hassle, aggravation, missed deadlines and money wasted for you.
Seamless communication with a US team.   Enjoy the ease of dealing with a local team of people who will handle all of the communication barriers, cultural differences and opposite time zone issues that are an inherent part of manufacturing overseas.
One-stop-shop for all your packaging needs.   The fewer sources you have to rely upon to meet your different packaging needs, the more control you maintain. We will handle the entire process for you, from concept through completion, and with our own 25,000 square foot state-of-the-art packing and assembly workshop in Southern China, we can also offer multiple component assembly.  This value added service enhances our ability to deliver you a finished custom product in a time and cost efficient manner.
To find out more about how Global Link Sourcing can work for your business specifically, contact us today! We look forward to speaking with you.
