History[edit]
The company was founded in 1994 as a film production company. It underwent a comprehensive expansion into the media industry through investing and now produces and operates movies, TV shows, talent agencies, music labels, and movie theaters.[4] In February 2011, Huayi Brothers revealed their plans to create the largest TV and film studio complex in East Asia.[5] Also, they announced that they aim to earn 10 billion yuan in the box office by 2016.[6] As of April 2015, the company was worth US$7.9 billion.[7]
In 2014 the company announced that it had agreed to invest as much as $150 million in Studio 8, the production company launched by former Warner Bros. executive Jeff Robinov, but the partnership never materialized. Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun International later signed a deal to invest in Robinov's company instead.[8]

  If Huayi Brothers has spent the last ten years securing its
  status within the film industry, then over the next ten years,
  the company must develop out of the traditional film business and
  into new enterprises.

  When it came out last year that Huayi Brothers were leaving the
  film studio that put out the top three highest-grossing domestic
  films, many took it as a sign they were “getting away from
  movies”, but from their actions, it seems the Huayi Brothers are
  actually getting closer to the Web.

  Businesses under the Huayi Brothers brand have been organized
  into three groups: film and television, brand licensing and live
  entertainment, and online entertainment.

  Online entertainment includes new media, games, and other
  Internet related products. In the first quarter of this year,
  online entertainment generated more than 410 million yuan in
  revenue, accounting for 66.65% of total revenue. Online
  entertainment accounted for the biggest portion of first-quarter
  revenue, and was also the fasted growing, increasing 14,000 times
  over last year.

  “Huayi listed five years ago, so we’re just in time for this
  stage where the Internet in China is exploding,” said Huayi
  Brothers chairman, Wang Zhongjun. He continued by saying: “So now
  we have this huge business area, online entertainment.”





  Wang Zhongjun put up the initial funding to develop Huayi
  Brothers’ online business. The most direct result of this is his
  generosity in giving out stock incentives. When the new media
  division underwent equity reform, almost 50% of stocks were given
  to the team. “We hope to encourage online innovation and use new
  shares to attract talent,” Wang explained.

  According to a stock transfer report revealed by the National
  Small and Medium Enterprise Stock Transfer System, Huayi
  Brothers’ subsidiary, Beijing Huayi Brothers Chuangxing
  Entertainment Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly Huayi Brothers New
  Media Technology Co., Ltd.), currently holds 53.14% of shares in
  Huayi Chuangxing, while Brothers & Sisters (Tianjin) Cultural
  Information Consulting Partnership holds 46.86%.

  Huayi Chuangxing owns 100% of Beijing Huayi Brothers Digital
  Media Technology Co., Ltd., 100% of Star Movies Alliance
  (Tianjin) New Media Technology Co., Ltd., 100% of shares of Huayi
  Brothers New Media (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., and 19.61% of Yi Ming
  Commodities (Tianjin) E-commerce Co., Ltd.

  Huayi Brothers New Media Company CEO Hu Ming revealed that in
  spinning off an independent online entertainment company, they
  intend for it to one day go public on its own.

  It is clear that the core reason for the partition is the
  interaction between Huayi Brothers and New Media. They have
  different corporate genes, and partitioning reduces obstacles to
  online innovation.

  Investing in all stages of the production chain, making games the
  focus

  Internally, Huayi Brothers has made sufficient structural
  adjustments. Externally, the company is investing in and making
  acquisitions at all stages of the production chain.

  In 2014, Huayi Brothers merged with online ticket sales platform
  Maizuo.com. At the same time, they invested in technology
  companies supplying 60% of China’s movie theaters with projection
  equipment.

  In May, Chaofan, an online marketing platform in which Huayi
  Brothers owns shares, listed shares on Hong Kong’s Growth
  Enterprise Market. Chaofan provides digital marketing services,
  including digital advertising, social media management, and
  creative and technical services.

  In July, Chinese life services platform, Dmall, reached a
  strategic partnership agreement with Huayi Brothers.

  Huayi Brothers appears to be getting poised for the future. In
  April, a fully owned subsidiary of Huayi Brothers, Huayi Brothers
  (Tianjin) Interactive Entertainment Limited, invested 24 million
  yuan in Baofeng Magic Mirror, giving them an 8% share in the
  company. Baofeng Magic Mirror develops and operates virtual
  reality technology.

  But what people are most interested in is what Huayi Brothers is
  doing in the gaming field. The company’s earnings report for the
  first half of 2015 estimates profits to be between 450 and 540
  million yuan, an increase of 10 - 30% over the previous year.
  Profits from their primary business were estimated at 150 to 240
  million yuan - triple last year’s profits. This can all be
  credited to Huayi Brothers’ gaming expansion.

  In their June financial report for the first half of the year,
  not long after acquiring Yinhan Games, Huayi Brothers’ revenue
  from games was only 75 million yuan, just 15.5% of total income.

  By the third quarter of 2014, the company’s reports showed game
  revenue at 289 million yuan, accounting for 30% of overall
  income.

  Game revenue has since been grouped together under online
  entertainment, so it is impossible to know the exact numbers for
  Huayi Brothers’ game revenue. However, online entertainment is
  growing rapidly. In the first quarter of this year, online
  entertainment revenue was 419 million yuan, more than half as
  much as the total online entertainment revenue for all of 2014.

  Game companies are more liquid than film and television
  companies. By acquiring stock in a gaming company and issuing
  consolidated financial statements, a film and television company
  can become more profitable.

  At the same time, by developing and publishing games, the game
  company helps the film company to accumulate intellectual
  property. Wang Zhongjun himself said publicly: “I look forward to
  Huayi’s game business joining the troika of film, talent
  management, and television to become the fourth horse pulling our
  carriage.”

  Tencent and Alibaba providing an Internet shot in the arm

  Aside from Huayi Brothers’ own adjustments to its strategy
  described above, infusions from outside are also an important
  part of the company’s Internet strategy. On August 21, Huayi
  Brothers completed a 360 million yuan private placement, giving
  Alibaba, Tencent, and Ping An 8.08%, 8.08%, and 2% shares in the
  company respectively.

  Following the completion of private placement, Huayi Brothers and
  Tencent will cooperate on intellectual property. Alibaba has
  stated that over the next three years, they will work with Huayi
  Brothers on film production, advertising, distribution and
  merchandising through their ecommerce platform.

  As recently as the evening of July 27, Huayi Brothers released a
  public statement saying the company was planning a major foreign
  business investment project; the project would mainly involve
  film and the Internet, and the amount invested would exceed one
  billion yuan.
