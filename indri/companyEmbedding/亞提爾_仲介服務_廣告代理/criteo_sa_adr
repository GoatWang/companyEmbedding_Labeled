                                Now Criteo is encouraging retailers, publishers and brands to pool their data together to stand a better chance of getting new and existing customers to purchase their products outside the Amazon ecosystem. The idea is that with more accurate data covering consumers’ offline and online shopping habits, retailers and brands can better target ads at people who are most likely to make purchases.

Criteo SA (ADR) Serves Up Another Quarterly Beat

Mobile ads drove more than 50% of Criteo's revenue ex-TAC during the quarter.
Shares of Criteo SA (ADR)  may have fallen 5% Wednesday after the advertising-retargeting specialist announced first-quarter 2015 results Wednesday morning. But don't take that to mean the company's performance was sub-par. Let's take a closer look at how Criteo kicked off the new year.

ex-TAC = excluding traffic-acquisition costs; YOY = year over year. Data source: Criteo S.A. 
What happened with Criteo this quarter?
Revenue ex-TAC climbed 41% year over year on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted net income grew 34.8% year over year, to $28.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 54% (56% at constant currency), to $48.8 million. 
By comparison, both the top and bottom lines were above expectations; Criteo's guidance provided last quarter called for lower revenue ex-TAC of $153 million to $158 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $36 million to $41 million.
Cash flow from operations was $18.9 million, down from $41 million this time last year, while free cash flow declined to $6.8 million from $28.1 million.
Both figures were negatively affected by an unusual change in working capital on higher income tax paid.
Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland explained during the subsequent conference call that "the working capital pattern we saw in Q1 2015, specifically on the payable side, was quite unusual and have since normalized."
The quarter ended with cash and equivalents of $386 million, up from $354 million at the end of 2015.
Criteo added more than 760 net clients in Q1 and maintained client retention at 90%.
Existing clients at the end of last year's first quarter generated 21% more revenue ex-TAC at constant currency in the latest quarter, speaking to Criteo's ability to expand revenue within its existing customer base.
More than 50% of revenue ex-TAC was generated from mobile ads during the quarter.
CEO Eric Eichman said during the subsequent conference call that "virtually all clients are using our complete multi-screen solution."
Nearly 5,000 advertisers are live on Facebook mobile via Criteo's integration with dynamic product ads as of the end of the quarter, up from just over 3,000 at the end of Q4 2015.
On a geographic basis:
Americas region revenue ex-TAC rose 43% year over year (48% at constant currency) to $56 million, or 35% of Criteo's total.
Europe, Middle East, and Africa revenue ex-TAC increased 26% (30% at constant currency) to $68 million, or 42% of the total.
Asia-Pacific revenue ex-TAC grew 53% (52% at constant currency) to $38, or 23% of Criteo's total.
What management had to say "We are making advertising accountable to performance metrics through innovation and technology," Eichmann said. "2016 is off to a strong start and our pipeline of exciting new products will continue to fuel high growth."
"We delivered fast growth and increased profitability," Fouilland succinctly added. "This combination remains a unique feature of our business model."
Looking forward For the current quarter, Criteo expects revenue ex-TAC between $158 million to $162 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $32 million and $36 million. With the caveat that we don't lend much credence to Wall Street's near-term demands, analysts' consensus estimates similarly called for second-quarter revenue of $161.1 million.
For the full year 2016, Criteo continues to expect revenue ex-TAC growth of between 30% and 34% at constant currency, while adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue should increase between 60 and 100 basis points.
All things considered, this was another solid showing from Criteo despite broad advertising industry headwinds, especially as it reiterated the strong full-year guidance that had the market so excited three months ago. As long as Criteo can sustain this momentum as it builds on its steadily growing base of loyal clients, I think long-term investors should be pleased with where it stands.

	                                                “Market Capitalization” is a measure of the estimated value of the common equity securities of the company or their equivalent. It does not include securities convertible into the common equity securities. “Market Capitalization” is derived from the last sale price for the displayed class of listed securities and the total number of shares outstanding for both listed and unlisted securities (as applicable). NASDAQ does not use this value to determine compliance with the listing requirements.

NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ: CRTO), the performance marketing technology company, today announced the launch of Criteo Predictive Search, a groundbreaking product that brings the Company's proven, performance-based approach to Google Shopping. Criteo Predictive Search, available immediately in the US, offers an automated, end-to-end solution, based on powerful machine-learning, that eliminates guesswork and systematically improves results from Google Shopping using precise, predictive optimization across every aspect of the campaign.
Early adopters of the new solution, who have taken part in beta tests, have seen as much as a 22-49 percent lift in revenue at constant cost. These clients include 30 of the leading U.S. retailers, such as Revolve Clothing, Teleflora and Camping World.
Search is the largest digital channel for marketers, garnering 45 percent(1) of digital ad spend with Product Listing Ads comprising 21 percent(1), making the ad tech side of the industry prime for disruption.  Marketers are actively seeking more impactful solutions to reach their target consumers. Criteo's unique approach to search offers the first end-to-end solution on the market for Google Shopping, delivering performance at scale.  With increasing competition in the Shopping channel, retailers are losing out on significant opportunities as a result of the extensive time it takes to realize gains from manual, reactive optimization approaches.
"Google Shopping is a huge opportunity for retail marketers, with Shopping quickly becoming the biggest ecommerce performance driver for retailers," said Jason Lehmbeck, General Manager, Search, Criteo. "Yet, the tools available today are overly complex and time-consuming, and do not sufficiently help marketers connect with consumers who are actively shopping for their products. Our goal with Predictive Search is to eliminate the guesswork of managing Shopping Campaigns while delivering unbeatable performance for retailers."
"With consumer trends and inventory constantly evolving, our team found that a standard Google Shopping campaign structure was limiting our performance," said Ben Shum, Search Engine Marketing Manager, REVOLVE Clothing. "With Criteo Predictive Search, we're able to tap into Criteo's wealth of knowledge and expertise in product feeds, user data, campaign structure and have since seen our return on ad spend increase by over a third."
"Criteo's management of our Google Shopping program has generated incredible results," said David Gottesman, director of digital marketing, Teleflora. "Criteo Predictive Search has really helped fine-tune our bidding strategy and increase our impression share. Our year-over-year performance has grown by triple digits in just six months."
A Criteo-sponsored Forrester survey found that as paid search matures and more companies get the basics down, competition rises and marketers look to new search capabilities for differentiation in an increasingly crowded space. These capabilities add to the complexity of executing effective paid search campaigns.
Criteo Predictive Search, based on Criteo's proven machine-learning technology, continuously optimizes remarketing lists, campaign structure, campaign settings, and bidding, allowing Paid Search Marketers to:

    --  Re-engage high-value users via behavioral targeting technology that
        programmatically sets bids based on each user's propensity to make a
        purchase.


    --  Increase ROI with multi-dimensional bidding that reflects a granular
        understanding of product characteristics, performance history, user
        intent, device, and user behavior.
    --  Consistently meet targets, even during seasonal and promotional peaks,
        with campaigns that automatically and accurately adapt.

Predictive Search expands Criteo's product portfolio and strengthens its performance marketing platform by bringing its sophisticated technology for predictive bidding to a new marketing channel, helping advertisers capitalize on today's $80 billion search market(2).
Criteo Predictive Search is available immediately in the U.S, with further global availability to be added throughout 2017. To learn more visit http://www.criteo.com/products/criteo-predictive-search.

NEW YORK, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ: CRTO), the performance marketing technology company, today announced that Greg Archibald has joined the company as Executive Vice President, Americas. The appointment of Archibald, who brings over 20 years of experience in omni-channel, digital and mobile platform development, will drive continued demand for Criteo's portfolio of performance marketing offerings. In his new role, Archibald will oversee the Americas sales team responsible for all revenue operations inclusive of strategic planning, budgeting and national sales execution. He will report directly to Mollie Spilman, Criteo's Chief Revenue Officer.
Archibald's expertise in multi-product sales will be core to the Americas sales strategy, as Criteo continues to innovate and expand its core business with an expanded portfolio. Recent new product additions include Criteo Predictive Search and Criteo Sponsored Products.

Before joining NinthDecimal, Archibald held senior-level strategic revenue positions at Datalogix, Yahoo and Intuit. Prior to his career in business, he served for nine years as a pilot in the U.S. Navy.

Criteo SA (ADR) Serves Up Another Quarterly Beat
The advertising-retargeting company rode mobile strength to a solid first quarter.











                Steve Symington

Mobile ads drove more than 50% of Criteo's revenue ex-TAC during the quarter.
Shares of Criteo SA (ADR) (NASDAQ:CRTO) may have fallen 5% Wednesday after the advertising-retargeting specialist announced first-quarter 2015 results Wednesday morning. But don't take that to mean the company's performance was sub-par. Let's take a closer look at how Criteo kicked off the new year.

ex-TAC = excluding traffic-acquisition costs; YOY = year over year. Data source: Criteo S.A. 
What happened with Criteo this quarter?






Revenue ex-TAC climbed 41% year over year on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted net income grew 34.8% year over year, to $28.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 54% (56% at constant currency), to $48.8 million. 
By comparison, both the top and bottom lines were above expectations; Criteo's guidance provided last quarter called for lower revenue ex-TAC of $153 million to $158 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $36 million to $41 million.
Cash flow from operations was $18.9 million, down from $41 million this time last year, while free cash flow declined to $6.8 million from $28.1 million.

Both figures were negatively affected by an unusual change in working capital on higher income tax paid.
Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland explained during the subsequent conference call that "the working capital pattern we saw in Q1 2015, specifically on the payable side, was quite unusual and have since normalized."

The quarter ended with cash and equivalents of $386 million, up from $354 million at the end of 2015.
Criteo added more than 760 net clients in Q1 and maintained client retention at 90%.
Existing clients at the end of last year's first quarter generated 21% more revenue ex-TAC at constant currency in the latest quarter, speaking to Criteo's ability to expand revenue within its existing customer base.
More than 50% of revenue ex-TAC was generated from mobile ads during the quarter.
CEO Eric Eichman said during the subsequent conference call that "virtually all clients are using our complete multi-screen solution."
Nearly 5,000 advertisers are live on Facebook mobile via Criteo's integration with dynamic product ads as of the end of the quarter, up from just over 3,000 at the end of Q4 2015.
On a geographic basis:

Americas region revenue ex-TAC rose 43% year over year (48% at constant currency) to $56 million, or 35% of Criteo's total.
Europe, Middle East, and Africa revenue ex-TAC increased 26% (30% at constant currency) to $68 million, or 42% of the total.
Asia-Pacific revenue ex-TAC grew 53% (52% at constant currency) to $38, or 23% of Criteo's total.


What management had to say "We are making advertising accountable to performance metrics through innovation and technology," Eichmann said. "2016 is off to a strong start and our pipeline of exciting new products will continue to fuel high growth."
"We delivered fast growth and increased profitability," Fouilland succinctly added. "This combination remains a unique feature of our business model."
Looking forward For the current quarter, Criteo expects revenue ex-TAC between $158 million to $162 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $32 million and $36 million. With the caveat that we don't lend much credence to Wall Street's near-term demands, analysts' consensus estimates similarly called for second-quarter revenue of $161.1 million.
For the full year 2016, Criteo continues to expect revenue ex-TAC growth of between 30% and 34% at constant currency, while adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of revenue should increase between 60 and 100 basis points.





All things considered, this was another solid showing from Criteo despite broad advertising industry headwinds, especially as it reiterated the strong full-year guidance that had the market so excited three months ago. As long as Criteo can sustain this momentum as it builds on its steadily growing base of loyal clients, I think long-term investors should be pleased with where it stands.
