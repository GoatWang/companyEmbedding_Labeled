PRECIOUS METALS & STONES


Precious metals include gold, silver and platinum. They are less reactive than most elements; have a high luster, and are usually ductile. They have many applications but are commonly used for jewellery and also as investment products.  
Precious stones are gemstones commonly used for jewellery.  

GOLD



            Historically, gold is one of the least reactive elements with properties that make it dense, soft, ductile and malleable.  This makes it an ideal material for jewellery-making and ornamental purposes.  In the modern world, it has been used as an investment product as well as in high-tech applications such as medical devices, pollution control, mobile phones and computers.
       



     Blumont Group Ltd. has < 5% interest in Elysium Resources Limited ("Elysium"), an Australian Securities Exchange-Listed, is currently at the exploration and project planning stage.



       

    Elysium is focused on the 100% owned Burraga Project located 60km south of Bathurst in the Central West of New South Wales, Australia.

UPDATE ON USE OF THE NET PROCEEDS      The Board of Directors of Blumont Group Ltd. (博 诺 有 限 公 司 ) (the ?Company?, and together    with its subsidiaries, the ?Group?) refers to the Rights Issue 2013 completed on 21 October    2013, which raised net proceeds of approximately S$42.67 million (the ?Net Proceeds?) (after    deducting expenses of approximately S$380,000).      Further to the Previous Announcements, the Company wishes to announce that the Net    Proceeds have been further utilised as follows:      (a) approximately S$7.65 million for the business expansion of the Group (equivalent to    approximately 17.9% of the Net Proceeds), comprising:      (i) S$0.60 million for completion of the fifth tranche of subscription of shares in Cokal    Limited, as announced on 20 November 2013       (ii) S$0.63 million advanced to Cokal Limited under a loan facility of up to US$8.00    million, as announced on 5 November 2013       (iii) S$0.58 million drawn down by Celsius Coal Limited under the Convertible Note    Deed, as announced on 7 February 2013       (iv) S$0.26 million drawn down by Azarga Resources Limited under the Azarga    Facility, as announced on 28 August 2013       (v) S$1.14 million advanced to Resource Generation Limited (?RES?) as part payment    of the AUD$2.50 million advance payment under the deed of settlement dated 18    December 2013 in relation to the subscription of shares in RES by the Company,    as announced on 18 December 2013 and      (vi) S$4.44 million for the repayment of an interest-free director?s loan which was    utilised as follows:      1. (A) S$1.24 million for the subscription of shares in Cokal Limited (B) S$0.45    million for the subscription of shares in Kidman Resources Limited and (C)    S$1.34 million for the subscription of shares in Discovery Metals Limited, as       announced on 8 July 2013, 13 August 2013 and 19 September 2013    respectively       2.

As the Company has and is expected to have sufficient cash or funds from operations to meet    its existing and future general working capital requirements the Company has re-allocated    S$6.73 million previously allocated for general working capital purposes for use in the business    expansion of the Group.      3.
