actually here's the real scoop!!!!!-- hide signature --SANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2000--firstsource

corp(SM), the leading provider of e-procurement solutions, today

announced that Onvia.com Inc. (Nasdaq:ONVI), a leading

Data, DBL, SP Richards and United Stationers.

According to Dave Hagan, CEO, firstsource corp, Onvia will invest

$2 million in firstsource, which will manage, operate and be

responsible for all aspects of Onvia's product business under a

private label that maintains the Onvia name and service levels. The

move will benefit Onvia's customers, as the firstsource agreement will

immediately expand the product inventory sixfold, to more than 240,000

leading online content providers and aggregators including RExoffice,

the largest commercial real estate management company in the United

States; All Business, a leading content site; BuyerZone, a leading RFQ

Well I suppose you could always wait to find out.  I on the other

hand will place my orders here in Canada just to be safe.  I

couldn't imagine onvia selling the US operation and not the

Canadian.  Oh well...  I've been with them since megadepot and I

can say this will be said if we lose such a great E-tailer for

Canadians.Jim T

Sorry to hear about the ONVIA wows.  I assume this is the US Onvia

still free shipping and some good prices.  Wonder if the change is

on the way here as well?Dave Schambach
