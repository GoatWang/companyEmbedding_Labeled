For the quarter, the company reported revenue of $500,591 compared to $82,303 for the same period last year, an increase of 608%, and is largely attributable to the 2016 acquisition of Tel3, a business segment of an existing retail calling minutes company, and which contributed revenues of $500,327 during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income attributable to the company was $811,458 or 0.03 per fully diluted share compared to a loss of $754,877 for the same period of 2016.

Next Group Holdings Announces Completion of the Transaction for Acquisition of Accent Intermedia (AIM), a Program Manager for Financial Stored Value Solutions

MIAMI, July 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) (the "Company") today announces that it has signed definitive Agreements with Dean Keatin Marketing, LLC ("DKM"), which completes the transaction to acquire a controlling interest (64% of shares) in Accent Intermedia LLC ("AIM"). AIM is a successful Stored Value Program Manager that has generated over $1 Billion of stored value activations through its PCI Compliant system and has been the go to FinTech (Financial Technology vertical) solution for the Internet Retailer 500.
AIM provides the support infrastructure that allows national brands to host Closed Loop (Gift Card) and Open Loop (Prepaid Debit / General Purpose Reload) card programs. AIM has developed its own in-house fraud prevention tool that reduces "card not present" fraud to less than 1%.
AIM currently provides infrastructure and program services to Harley Davidson, AMC Theatres, Super Valu, Applebee's, IHOP and other industry leading companies.
"I am pleased to complete the AIM acquisition. We promised in early January 2016 that we would acquire several strategic companies to make NXGH the leader in the Mobile Banking market. We are proving NXGH to be a unique value proposition in the Mobile Banking space. This acquisition allows NXGH to have two independent banks under our NEXTCALA & AIM agreements, respectively. This gives NXGH the diversity to secure its footprint as a force to be reckoned with, in the global financial market," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO.  
"NXGH, together with its proprietary financial technology and its next generation HD Video platform AVYDA will revolutionize the customer service experience and our rewards program for our growing Financial services customers. This will change the traditional way companies have been communicating for the past several decades and will improve and modernize the collaborative customer service experience," said Dennis Varghese Principal & Managing Director of DKM. "After AIM being in business for over 10 years, I am proud to see AIM integrate with NXGH, a leader in next generation financial services for the consumers that adapt their banking services with mobile video banking," added Varghese.
"The AIM acquisition is an important cornerstone that strengthens the NXGH foundation now and in the future. AIM's decade strong propriety technology solution will help expedite NXGH's execution as a Program Manager for Stored Value products including Prepaid Gift Cards, General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) card programs and verticals," said Michael De Prado NXGH's President & COO. "AIM's data facility is highly secure and has redundant infrastructure services with a "zero single point of failure infrastructure", multiple power grid supplies, 24/7/365 monitored infrastructure, multi-tiered support, intrusion detection and loss prevention systems. AIM's data facility will help us prepare, and fortify the upcoming 2016 prepaid gift card holiday season and revenues," added De Prado.

Next Group Holdings Agrees to Acquire Tel3 from Arik Maimon

MIAMI, June 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) announced today that it has signed an agreement with Arik Maimon, who serves as NXGH's CEO and Chairman, under which, subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion from an independent expert on such transactions, NXGH will acquire the telecom marketing brand "Tel3" together with the assets and client database of Tel3 from Mr. Maimon.  NXGH's Board of Directors approved the transaction unanimously and expects to close the acquisition of Tel3 by June 20, 2016.
Tel3 is a marketing group that had revenues over $3 million in 2015 with 31.5% gross margin, 25,000 active customers, and a database of 300,000 current and former clients. 
Mr. Maimon, who recently acquired Tel3 from a third party, has agreed to sell Tel3 to NXGH on substantially similar terms to the terms of the transaction under which he personally acquired the Tel3 assets, subject to the fairness opinion, a unanimous vote in favor of the transaction by all disinterest members of NXGH's board, and other regulatory considerations. 
"I believe that NXGH's acquisition of Tel3 will provide great value and substantial benefits to NXGH and its shareholders, as this deal will bring us a significant new revenue stream, additional profits and a large new customer base', said Michael De Prado, President and COO of NXGH. "This is a major step forward that will enhance NXGH's position in the markets for its telecommunications and its financial products", added De Prado.
NXGH plans to offer enhanced financial and telecom services and products to those Tel3 customers that opt-In to receive special offers and rewards based on their daily use of NEXTCALA and M&M Telecom offerings. 
NEXTCALA financial products will provide attractive pricing and extra benefits to unbanked and underbanked consumers.  Rewards programs will also help to lower costs and improve lifestyle and family connections.
NXGH, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Meimoun & Mammon LLC (which does business as M & M Telecom) expects to increase the revenue streams that were historically achieved by Tel3.  M & M Telecom has had FCC 214 "Common Carrier" Authority since 2011, and is a contributor to the FCC Universal Service Fund. As a result of NXGH's acquisition of Tel3, M & M Telecom will be able to offer and provide extra services, benefits and rewards to customers. 
"NXGH's acquisition of Tel3 assets will represent a major step forward to help us develop M & M Telecom into a major telecom provider and bring NEXTCALA to the forefront in the everyday financial solutions markets," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's chairman and CEO. "We believe that bringing Tel3 under the umbrella of M & M Telecom will produce significant revenue growth and profitability for NXGH."

Next Group Holdings Rewards Shareholders with Special Dividend


By August Patterson, Senior Staff Writer, Online Media Group, Inc.
MIAMI, FL, June 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Investors often take positions in companies with pending litigation, hoping that a favorable judgment will load corporate coffers and provide a boon in market valuation. On Friday, May 27, Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) put a unique spin on the pending lawsuit of plaintiffs Next Communications, Inc. (an affiliate of NXGH) and NxtGn, Inc. (a subsidiary of NXGH) versus defendant Viber Media, Inc.  
The litigation, being heard in New York Southern District Court, asserts that Viber misused confidential information that the plaintiffs communicated to Viber pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement. Publicly available documents show that on March 30, 2106, District Judge Richard J. Sullivan denied Viber's motion to dismiss on three of the four claims in the lawsuit.
In any lawsuit, the outcome is always pure speculation, but Next Group Holdings intends to share any net proceeds from a favorable ruling with its shareholders. This is being committed to through the issuance of a special dividend of newly created Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock. NXGH shareholders are eligible to receive one share of the new class of stock for each share of NXGH common stock held as of the record date of June 10, 2016. Only non-insiders of NXGH are eligible for the special dividend.
OTC Markets shows 28.78 million shares of NXGH in the public float.
"Redeemable" stock simply means that the company is going to buy the shares back. Within six months of the final resolution of the lawsuit, Next Group will redeem the Class D preferred stock at the greater of two defined prices. On the low end, should the litigation deliver an unfavorable result, the shares will be redeemed at par value, which is fixed at $0.001 per share. This means that an investor will receive $1 for every 1,000 shares held.
Should the lawsuit result in a favorable verdict for the plaintiffs, Next Group Holdings will divide up amongst special dividend shareholders 9.03% of the net proceeds (the total amount less expenses, taxes, etc.) it receives from the judgment. In a phone conversation, Michael De Prado, President and COO of Next Group Holdings, confirmed that every brokerage house where NXGH stock is held is participating in the special dividend program. 
Upon redemption of the shares, Next Group Holdings is returning the stock to the treasury for retirement, meaning there is no dilution associated with the dividend.  
An interesting point to consider with the NXGH dividend is underscored by reports from BuyIns.net, a firm regarded as an expert provider of short-sale data. A recent report from BuyIns.net states that shorts have been "aggressively shorting NXGH on a daily basis" with an average of 33.8% of daily trading volume being short selling. If naked shorting is happening, which is always difficult to prove, requiring manual certification of ownership to receive the dividend has the potential to expose the naked shorts.
To participate in the upside of a cash redemption sent directly to a shareholder, Next Group Holdings has provided guidelines for receiving the dividend, including a simple form that must be submitted to a brokerage house to verify ownership of shares.  Interested parties can learn more about the special dividend by visiting the company's website (www.nextgroupholdings.com) and by reading the official press release on the dividend provided below.
Next Group Holdings Announces Special Dividend and New Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock
MIAMI, FL, May 27, 2016 /CNW/ - Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) (the "Company") today announces a special dividend for shareholders. The Company has completed and filed requisite paperwork to issue a special dividend of one share of the new Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for each share of NXGH common stock held. To receive the special dividend, NXGH shareholder need only to take the appropriate steps with their brokerage house to verify their position in the Company.
Next Group Holdings will redeem the Class D Redeemable Preferred shares from each shareholder subsequent to a court ruling in the litigation with Viber Media, Inc. ("Viber"). On May 12, 2016, our Board of Directors created a new class of Preferred Stock. The Board also declared a special stock dividend consisting of our newly designated Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the dividend, the special stock dividend will be distributed to owners of the Company's common stock as of the record date in a ratio of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for every 1 share of common stock owned as of the record date. The Company has set the record date as June 10, 2016. The Class D Preferred Stock must be redeemed within six (6) months (or as soon thereafter as permitted by law) following final resolution of the Corporation's affiliates lawsuit against ViberMedia, Inc. (Next Communications, Inc. and NxtGn, Inc. v. Viber Media, Inc.) which is, as of the date of this resolution, pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or any successor or other lawsuit relating to the subject matter thereof in which the Corporation (or any successor-in-interest) is named as a plaintiff (the "Lawsuit").
The Designation fixes the redemption price of each share of class D Preferred stock as the greater of par value or the amount obtained by dividing (a) 9.03 percent of the net proceeds to the Corporation of the Lawsuit after payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with such law suit and the resolution of any creditor claims against Next Communications and all taxes on net income accrued or paid with respect to such amount, by (b) the total number of shares of Class D Preferred stock issued and outstanding as of the Redemption Date, which amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. In the event of an unfavorable result, we will still redeem the Class D preferred stock at par within six months of the case's final disposition.
"This new dividend demonstrates the optimism we have about our future and our unwavering commitment to deliver value to our loyal shareholders," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO. "I want to personally thank each investor and encourage everyone to verify their position in NXGH with their broker immediately to receive their dividend."
Next Group Holdings has provided the stockholder letter necessary to request the Class D preferred stock certificate from the Company free of charge at www.nextgroupholdings.com under "Investors Relations" in the main menu and "Dividend" tab.

Next Group Holdings Announces Strategic Partnership with CP+B


Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Love Made Visible ("LMV"), CP+B's Product & Brand Invention Group (CP+B). They will assist NXGH's subsidiary Next CALA, Inc. ("NEXTCALA") in the design, launch and marketing of NXHG's prepaid family portfolio here at http://www.nextcala.com, along with NXGH's other subsidiary NxtGn HD video platform and telepresence products and services.
"Through our non-traditional business model, we've built an engine to generate strong valuation increases through a partnership framework that significantly mitigates risk while building irrational loyalty with our audience. We are not ad people. We are cultural change agents, brand inventors, artists, technologists, anthropologists, and everything in between. Our goal always being to disrupt conventions, not just through branding and design, but in everything we do - product development, sourcing, manufacturing & going to market. We look forward to taking a deep dive into NXGH's brands, understanding the personalities and needs of its customers and helping them connect these brands to culture in a meaningful way," said Neil Riddell, CP+B's EVP/Executive Director.
Love Made Visible has developed new agency-owned brands and partnership opportunities. These partnerships include the prospering bike-sharing system B-Cycle, the environmentally minded mechanic brand Green Garage, and the award winning spirit brands - Angel's Envy Bourbon and the Hemingway-inspired Papa's Pilar Rum. The success of these ventures has now led an expansion into other categories like lifestyle/fashion brands, natural foods, as well as the tech sector.
"Our plans to work with CP+B to disrupt the telepresence and broadcast live video landscape represents the next step in democratizing people's ability to broadcast live," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO. "We have created Intellectual Property (IP) that will put telepresence capabilities that were previously available only to Fortune 100 companies, into the hands of everyday people. This changes single point to multi-point broadcasting in a big way. It's part of what we see as an evolution from Skype (limited to 8 people), and Periscope/Meerkat (which integrates live video and texting interaction), to our platform that offers Live Video / Interactive / HD quality over very low bandwidth, and allows as many as 10,000 concurrent users a seamless interface between laptop, tablet, mobile device. With our planned technology, consumers, celebrities, politicians, and organizations will be able to publicly broadcast in HD directly to as many as 10,000 fans. Unlike our competitors' existing live video technologies, the viewers can be seen by the broadcaster and chosen to interact with by simply touching their HD video feed, creating a closer connection with their fan base."

Next Group Holdings Announces Plans to Extend its Reach in the Mobile HD Video Market


Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: PLKD) announced today that it plans to aggressively extend its market reach and subscriber base in the mobile HD video space throughout the remainder of 2016, through its subsidiary NxtGn, Inc.
NxtGn plans to launch its AVYDA Powered by Telarix mobile application for iOS devices in April 2016. The AVYDA cloud platform will allow from two people to thousands of people located all over the earth to simultaneously join video rooms to connect with friends, family members, celebrities, live entertainment events, doctors, classrooms, and more. With a heavy focus on user experience, the application will be simple to use: just click on an access link or notification to connect. The platform allows carrier service providers to monetize HD video communication, changing the landscape of how subscribers communicate with one another.
"We are very happy to see that 5 years of research and development, and relationship building, are about to make our unique new HD video platform a reality for millions of people around the world," said Michael De Prado, PLKD's President.
Mr. De Prado continued, "as our sister company NxtGn, Inc. begins to roll out several exciting new products and services, the Next CALA Rewards program will offer Next CALA subscribers the ability to use NxtGn's proprietary HD Personal Telepresence products to participate in health care consultations, distance learning, and exclusive live entertainment events. I am proud that Next CALA Rewards will soon allow our subscribers to use HD telepresence services that until recently were within reach only of Fortune 500 companies and very high net worth individuals. I believe these synergies will give both Avyda and our Next CALA Prepaid Visa cards sustainable competitive advantages in the marketplace."

	On
	August 25, 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive Market Partner Agreement with InsightPOS, LLC (“POS”),
	for distribution, market development and revenue sharing in a new, exciting cash register Interactive Point Of Sale (POS) system.
	Due to qualifying conditions that had to be met before the agreement was fully accepted, this agreement was fully accepted on
	September 7, 2016 and can now be considered a “Definitive Material Agreement”.




	 




	InsightPOS
	is a “State of the Art”, “Super Functional Point Of Sale” system that has received great attention due to
	its sleek, modern, efficient design and amazing combination of tools that make the retail experience friendlier, quicker and better
	both for the shopper and for store management. InsightPOS will allow retailers to sell and manage their store’s inventory,
	with over 50 million SKUs already in the system and increase customer loyalty by offering important services and benefits. These
	additional services include, but are not limited to, long distance telecom products, cellular account payments (US and International),
	utility bill payments (electric, water, cable, satellite, etc.) and others. InsightPOS will provide the ability for each retail
	store to offer financial services, including gift cards, reloadable debit cards and potentially money transfer services, which
	will increase store revenue organically in a manner few have imagined possible. Insight POS can replace the entire cash register,
	inventory and management system.

	NXGH
	has secured vendor financing to provide and install terminals at no cost to qualified retail establishments, including training
	upon approval by InsightPOS. The revenues generated by system utilization should maintain the system at no cost to each retailer.
	NXGH will market major brand services along with its own branded services, GPR (General Purpose Reload) and reward cards.




	 




	NXGH,
	through its affiliate, Next Communications, Inc., has the right to sell STI Mobile, Next Cala and any Next products to 8,800 locations
	that were serviced by a prepaid distribution network. NXGH will offer the InsightPOS system to clients of this distribution network
	as well via direct sales through its own sales force and affiliates. When a system is installed, NGH receives 50% of the gross
	profits received by InsightPOS after retailer commissions are paid.

	CALA






	 





	Our
	Next CALA subsidiary promotes and distributes NextCALA-branded Prepaid Visa® General Purpose Reloadable (“GPR”)
	prepaid debit cards, bearing the Next CALA Debit™ and Visa® logos. Customers may register for our prepaid debit card
	at

	http://www.nextcala.com

	. Each of our cards is issued by The Bancorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.




	 




	Based
	on projections by industry experts, we believe that prepaid debit cards are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial
	sector. The number of cards sold is expected to grow 22% annually from 2016 to 2020, according to projections by the Consumer
	Financial Protection Bureau. Millions of individuals in the U.S., including those in various minority communities, are unable
	to obtain access to the banking system due to various reasons, including but not limited to poor credit scores or a lack of exposure
	to the U.S. banking system. Prepaid debit cards are a convenient option for such individuals. Prepaid debit cards may also be
	an intermediate step toward such individuals ultimately joining the financial system. In addition, prepaid debit cards are a popular
	option for gift-giving due to fraud protection in the case of loss or theft. We believe that prepaid debit cards are replacing
	cash as a preferred gift for these reasons, in certain regards.




	 




	Card
	holders can upload funds onto their NextCALA prepaid cards via ACH wire transfer, online, or in person using Vanilla Reload machines,
	which are stationed in over 50,000 locations throughout the U.S., including but not limited to Walmart, CVS, Dollar General, Rite
	Aid and Walgreens retail stores, and anywhere in the Mio Reload Network, which includes more than 450,000 retail locations throughout
	the world. The card can be used like a traditional credit card or debit card and is accepted wherever Visa Debit® cards are
	accepted. Money spent using the card is deducted from the total balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded on the card. Unlike
	a credit card, prepaid debit card holders do not have the ability to spend more than the balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded
	on the card. Prepaid debit cards can be used and spent online and can be used at an ATM machine to retrieve cash.




	 





	Contractual
	Relationships with InComm, Bancorp, and Visa.

	Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards are distributed and serviced by prepaid
	industry leader, InComm Financial Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of InComm Holdings, Inc. (“InComm”). Next CALA
	has been indemnified by InComm, which possesses money transmitter licenses in all 50 states. InComm specifically also indemnifies
	Next CALA with respect to Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Client US banking regulations, as they capture and verify all of
	this as part of our agreement. In addition, The Bancorp Bank (“Bankcorp”), a member of the FDIC, pursuant to a license
	from Visa USA, Inc., acts as program manager and as clearing house and provides banking capacities in transactions involving the
	cards. Prepaid card deposits are held by Bankcorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.

	US retailers with electronic and hard plastic stored value open and closed loop licenses, products and our very own brand along
	with licensing their MIO brand that is branded at every 210,000 InComm retailer and online footprint. We are currently negotiating

	InComm
	may use its best efforts to introduce our call center enablement for better quality customer

	off to Incomm for any financial Ccard customer service.







	 





	However,
	there is no guarantee that InComm will agree to any of these terms, and such terms remain subject to further negotiations between
	us and InComm.




	 





	Customer
	Service

	. Next CALA Prepaid Visa® GPR cards offer free customer service and reloads 24 hours per day.




	 





	Load
	Limits Per Card.

	The maximum load amount per registered Next CALA Prepaid Visa® is $10,000. Customers can load between
	$20 and $500 per load into a Next CALA Prepaid Visa® GPR card.




	 





	FDIC
	Insurance.

	Each Next CALA Prepaid Visa® GPR card account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for a

	and account numbers.




	 





	Retail
	and ATM Locations Accepting the Next CALA Card.

	Next CALA cards are accepted wherever Visa Debit® cards are accepted,
	and can be used for purchases at retail locations, online, and over the phone, as well as for ATM withdrawals and other ATM functions,
	remittances, bill payments, mobile-banking, and virtual digital wallet functions.




	 





	Reloads

	Mobile
	Apps.

	Earlier this year, Next CALA released its NEXTCALA Mobile applications for both Android and iOS. The NEXTCALA mobile
	Android and iOS applications give users access to mobile banking and banking services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Users
	are able to use the application to make mobile-to-mobile payments, to transfer funds to family, friends, and retailers, and to
	see all balances and transactions, including retail transactions made online or in physical retail locations with the Next CALA
	Prepaid Visa® card associated with the app user’s account. With the NEXTCALA Mobile app, users not only have an easier
	way to bank, they also earn points that can be redeemed towards long distance calls either via voice or HD Video among other benefits
	provided under the NEXTCALA Rewards program.

	Prepaid
	Card Solutions Democratize Banking and Payments

	. Prepaid cards democratize electronic payments and remittances for those outside
	the traditional banking system. The growing popularity of prepaid card solutions for both banked and unbanked consumers is driven
	by the prepaid card’s unique ability to solve almost any payment need.





	 






	Rapid
	Growth of the Mobile Banking Market

	. Based on projections by industry experts, the Company believes that prepaid debit cards
	are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial sector.
	The Prepaid Unbanked and underbanked segments of the USA, specifically the Latin demographic, is expanding rapidly and will reach
	approximately $421 billion in the United States and approximately $822 billion worldwide by 2017.




	 





	NEXTCALA
	Rewards

	. Through our Next CALA Rewards program, we offer benefits including allowing Next CALA subscribers to earn points
	for use in remittance transactions, or to be credited into reloadable international and domestic long distance calling cards for
	voice or HD video calls. During the second half of 2017, as Next CALA’s sibling company NxtGn, Inc. begins to roll out new
	products and services, the Next CALA Rewards program will also offer Next CALA subscribers the ability to use NxtGn’s proprietary
	HD Personal Telepresence products to participate in health care consultations, distance learning, and exclusive live entertainment
	events. The NEXTCALA Rewards platform is currently being developed and scheduled for release in the second half of 2017.




	 





	Advertising
	and Promotion

	. Next CALA will increase its market presence and reach by aggressively advertising. CP &B is a 4% equity
	owner of NXGH and promoting its products and services. In the initial phase of the launch campaign which will begin upon release
	of the NEXTCALA Mobile applications, Next CALA will use advertising to increase consumer awareness and stimulate trial of the
	NEXTCALA Mobile apps and Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards during the second half of 2017. Throughout the launch campaign,
	Next CALA will promote NEXTCALA Mobile apps and Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR card enrollments by pushing promotional videos
	and offers to the Company’s telephony mobility users and to millions of existing customers of marketing partners who provide
	products and services to under-banked, non-banked, low-income Americans, immigrants, teens, and other natural niche markets for
	the Next CALA’s products and services.




	 





	Strategic
	Alliances with Marketing Partners

	. Next CALA intends to build strategic alliances and joint venture marketing partnerships
	with Lifeline service providers (who provide federally-subsidized free cell phones and free telephony services to millions of
	under-banked or non-banked low-income Americans) and other companies and affinity groups which provide products and services to
	under-banked or non-banked immigrants, teens, and other emerging niche markets for mobile banking and prepaid card solutions.

	consumer awareness and trial of the NEXTCALA Mobile apps and Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards in carefully selected target

	Next
	Mobile 360

	. Our Next Mobile subsidiary is a mobile virtual network operator (or “MVNO”) which provides NextMobile360™
	branded mobile phones and prepaid voice, text, and data mobile phone services to a customer base currently consisting of approximately
	2,500 MVNO Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Virgin Mobile have been successful at creating a brand, and not own the hardware
	or network. Next Mobile operates this business pursuant to contracts with Sprint Corporation which allow Next Mobile to use Sprint’s
	network infrastructure to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing voice, text, and data services of essentially
	the same quality as those Sprint provides to its own retail subscribers.




	 





	 




	As
	customers worldwide continue to migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions, the Company’s
	technological advantage and the synergies created by its unique combination of reloadable bank card and mobile virtual network
	operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to unserved, under-banked, non-banked and other emerging niche markets.




	 





	Joint
	Venture

	. Because MVNO marketing is capital intensive, Next Mobile intends to sell a 50% interest in its MVNO rights to an
	operating partner who will be responsible for funding all future marketing expenses of the MVNO. The Company has been introduced
	to interested purchasers by Sprint, and believes it will be able to sell a 50% interest in the MVNO for $1.5 million in cash plus
	a commitment to fund all of the joint venture’s future marketing expenses.

	Owning
	our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information
	contained in this information statement. If any of the following risks occur, the business, financial condition, liquidity, results
	of operations or as well as our ability of to make distributions to our shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected.
	In that case, the market price of our common shares could decline significantly, and you could lose all or a part of the value
	of your ownership in our common shares. Some statements in this information statement, including statements in the following risk
	factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this information statement entitled “Forward-Looking
	Information.”

	Related to Next Group Holdings.





	 






	You
	will not be afforded an opportunity to choose our future investments, which means we may invest in a company, including a company
	affiliated with a member of our Management team, even though you do not support such an investment. Furthermore, our management
	has broad discretion to use the proceeds from this offering, which it may not use effectively.






	 




	We
	may decide to invest any net capital we receive from operations or future investment in other companies that are affiliated with
	members of our Management team. Accordingly, investors will need to rely on the judgment of Management with respect to the use
	of these net proceeds and investors will not have the opportunity to assess whether such proceeds are being used or invested appropriately.
	Further, we cannot predict that the proceeds will be used to yield a favorable return and our failure to apply such proceeds effectively
	could diminish the value of your investment.

	We
	have a limited operating history and therefore we cannot ensure, either in the near- or long-term, that we will be able to generate
	cash flow or profit or execute our business plan.






	 




	The
	Company is now engaged in new businesses started in each 2016 and 2015. As a result, we have a limited operating history upon
	which you may evaluate our business and an investment in our common stock may entail significantly more risk than the shares of
	common stock of a company with a substantial operating history. Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties,
	expenses and difficulties associated with early stage enterprises. You should consider an investment in our company in light of
	these risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties. Such risks include: the absence of a lengthy operating history; insufficient
	capital to fully realize our operating plan; our ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market; a competitive environment
	characterized by well-capitalized competitors; our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel; our reliance on
	key management personnel.




	 




	Because
	we are subject to these risks, evaluating our business may be difficult. We may be unable to successfully overcome these risks,
	which could harm our business and prospects. Our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks
	we face in a cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to successfully address these risks, there may be an adverse effect
	on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	 






	We
	may never achieve profitability from operations or generate sufficient cash flows to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders.






	 




	We
	may never achieve profitability from operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we cannot assure you that we will be able
	to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. There can be no assurance that future operations
	will be profitable or that we will be able to make or sustain distributions to our shareholders from cash from operations. Revenues
	and profits, if any, will depend upon various factors, including whether we will be able to successfully implement our business
	plan and operating strategy. We may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse
	impact on us. In addition, an inability to achieve profitability could have a detrimental effect on the long term capital appreciation
	of our common stock.




	 






	The
	Company has not yet achieved profitability from its business operations and is reliant on outside financing to fund operations.








	 






	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $9,723,119 and an accumulated deficit of $13,946,938 including
	net losses after non-controlling interests of $9,890,111 and $1,199,925 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. This
	raises substantial doubt around our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent on obtaining additional
	financing through equity or debt offerings which may cause future dilution.




	 






	Due
	to existing contractual obligations we may not achieve profitability.

	We
	are an early entrant in an emerging industry, and the long-term viability of our business strategy is unproven.






	 




	As
	an early entrant in this emerging industry, we are subject to the risk that our business model and business plan may not prove
	to be a viable long-term business strategy. If it turns out that our strategy is not a viable long-term business strategy, we
	may not be able to generate meaningful cash flows, which would materially and adversely affect the viability of our business and
	stock price.




	 






	We
	have well-financed, well-managed competitors and may not be able to adequately compete in our market.






	 




	Most
	of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors
	have seasoned management teams with more experience and expertise in our industry than we do. Some competitors may enjoy significant
	competitive advantages that result from, among other things, having substantially more available capital, having a lower cost
	of capital, having greater economies of scale, and having enhanced operating efficiencies compared to ours.




	 






	We
	may not be able to secure sufficient capital to effectively execute our business plan.






	 




	We
	may not be able to attract and obtain sufficient capital from the equity and debt markets, or any other capital markets, to execute
	our business plan and grow our business. If we do not have access to sufficient funding in the future, we may not be able to make
	necessary capital expenditures necessary to execute our business plan, and in that event our ability to generate revenue may be
	significantly impaired.




	 






	If
	we cannot obtain financing, our growth may be limited.






	 




	Recent
	events in the financial markets have had an adverse impact on the credit markets, and, as a result, credit has become significantly
	more expensive and difficult to obtain, if available at all. Some lenders are imposing more stringent credit terms and there has
	been and may continue to be a general reduction in the amount of credit available. Many banks are either unable or unwilling to
	provide new asset-based lending. Tightening credit markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable
	terms, thereby increasing financing costs and/or requiring us to accept financing with increasing restrictions. If adverse conditions
	in the credit markets, in particular with respect to our industry, materially deteriorate, our business could be materially and
	adversely affected. Our long-term ability to grow through additional investments will be limited if we cannot obtain additional
	financing. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
	debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms.




	 






	We
	anticipate being involved in a variety of litigation.






	 




	Although
	we have not been subject to any litigation to date, we anticipate being involved in a range of court proceedings in the ordinary
	course of business as we continue to operate our business. While we intend to vigorously defend any non-meritorious action or
	challenge, no assurance can be given that we will not incur significant expense relating to these matters or that they will not
	require significant management attention and adversely affect us.




	 






	Our
	business plan involves a number of assumptions that may prove inaccurate, which may cause us to realize substantially different
	operating results than we hope for.






	 




	In
	developing our business plan and business model, we made a number of assumptions, including assumptions related to annual operating
	costs, market size and demand, customer retention rates, customer drop-out rates, default rates, and local, national, and worldwide
	economic conditions. These assumptions may prove inaccurate, causing us our performance and operating results to differ significantly
	from the performance and operating results we have projected while developing our business plan and business model.




	 






	Operating
	our business on a larger scale could result in substantial increases in our expenses.






	 




	As
	our business grows in size and complexity, we can provide no assurance that we can successfully enter new markets or grow our
	business without incurring significant additional expenses, that our management platform will ultimately prove to be scalable,
	and/or that we will be able to achieve economies of scale or we will be able to operate our business on a larger scale than the
	scale we have historically operated on.

	Debt
	service obligations could adversely affect our operating results, and could adversely affect our ability to make or sustain distributions
	to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock.






	 




	Incurring
	debt could subject us to many risks, including the risks that: our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to make required
	payments of principal and interest; our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; we will
	be subject to restrictive covenants that require us to satisfy and remain in compliance with certain financial requirements or
	that impose limitations on the type or extent of activities we conduct; and we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion
	of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders,
	funds available for operations and capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other purposes. Additionally, if we
	do not have sufficient funds to repay any debt we incur when it matures, we may need to refinance the debt or raise additional
	equity. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on refinancing,
	increases in interest expense could adversely affect our cash flows and, consequently, cash available for distribution to our
	stockholders. To the extent we are required to raise additional equity to satisfy such debt, existing stockholders would see their
	interests diluted. If we are unable to refinance our debt or raise additional equity on acceptable terms, we may be forced to
	dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses or the incurrence of special taxes and fees that apply
	to dispositions of assets. To the extent we cannot meet any existing or future debt service obligations, we will risk losing some
	or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Any unsecured debt agreements we enter into
	may contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right
	to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances.




	 






	Our
	financial results in future periods may not be reflective of our earning potential and may cause our stock price to decline.






	 




	Our
	financial results in future periods may not be representative of our future potential. Since we expect to experience rapid growth,
	we will have a greater percentage of our portfolio invested in assets in the process of stabilization than we would expect to
	have as a more mature operation. It will take time and significant cash resources to implement our business plan. In addition,
	future equity or debt financings may impact our financial results in the fiscal periods following such financings for the same
	reasons listed above.




	 






	Security
	breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and
	reputation to suffer.






	 




	In
	the ordinary course of our business we use sophisticated call processing engines and other sophisticated telecommunications technology
	platforms, and we acquire and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and
	personally identifiable information of our prospective and current tenants, our employees and third-party service providers on
	our networks and website. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business
	strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers
	or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information
	stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could
	result in revenue losses, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information,
	regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation, which could
	adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position.




	 






	We
	are dependent on our executive officers and dedicated personnel, and the departure of any of our key personnel could materially
	and adversely affect us.






	 




	We
	rely on a small number of persons to carry out our business and investment strategies. Any member of our senior management may
	cease to provide services to us at any time. The loss of the services of any of our key management personnel, or our inability
	to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. As
	we expand, we will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior management but may not be able to do so
	on acceptable terms or at all.

	The
	implementation of our business plan may require that we employ additional qualified personnel. Competition for highly skilled
	managerial, telecommunications, financial and operational personnel is intense, and we cannot assure our stockholders that we
	will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel
	as required, our growth and operating results could be adversely affected.

	We
	are subject to a comprehensive federal anti-money laundering regulatory regime that is constantly evolving. The anti-money laundering
	regulations to which we are subject include the BSA, as amended by the Patriot Act, which criminalizes the financing of terrorism
	and enhances existing BSA regimes through: (a) expanding AML program requirements to certain delineated financial institutions;
	(b) strengthening customer identification procedures; (c) prohibiting financial institutions from engaging in business with foreign
	shell banks; (d) requiring financial institutions to have due diligence procedures and, where appropriate, enhanced due diligence
	procedures for foreign correspondent and private banking accounts; and (e) improving information sharing between financial institutions
	and the U.S. government. Pursuant to the BSA, we have instituted a Customer Identification Program, (CIP). The CIP is incorporated
	into our BSA/anti-money laundering compliance program. We are increasingly facing more stringent anti-money laundering rules and
	regulations, compliance with which may increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and disrupt our business”
	for additional information. Our subsidiary, Next CALA, is or may become subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements related
	to anti-money laundering compliance obligations arising under the Patriot Act and its implementing regulations. In addition, provisions
	of the BSA enacted by the Prepaid Access Rule issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), impose certain obligations,
	such as registration and collection of consumer information, on “providers” of certain prepaid access programs, including
	the prepaid products issued by our Next CALA subsidiary, and our issuing banks for which we serve as program manager. In order
	to qualify for certain exclusions under the Prepaid Access Rule, some of our content providers were required to modify operational
	elements of their products, such as limiting the amount that can be loaded onto a card in any one day. In addition, pursuant to
	the Prepaid Access Rule, Next CALA and some of our retail distribution partners have adopted policies and procedures to prevent
	the sale of more than $10,000 in prepaid access (including closed loop and open loop products that fall under the monetary thresholds
	outlined above) to any one person during any one day.

	foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation
	of weapons of mass destruction, and other entities that pose threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the
	United States. As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by,
	or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries, as well as those such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under
	programs that are not country-specific and with whom U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing. The Foreign Corrupt Practices
	Act, or FCPA, prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery
	provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	The statute has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign
	official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens affiliated with foreign government-run or government-owned
	organizations. The statute also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls
	to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Abuse of our prepaid products for purposes of financing sanctioned countries,
	terrorist funding, bribery or corruption could cause reputational or other harm that could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, results of operations and financial condition” for additional information.

	At
	the federal level, Congress and federal regulatory agencies have enacted and implemented new laws and regulations that affect
	the prepaid industry, such the CARD Act and FinCEN’s Prepaid Access Rule. Moreover, there are currently proposals before
	Congress that could further substantially change the way banks, including prepaid card issuing banks and other financial services
	companies, are regulated and are permitted to offer their products to consumers. Non-bank financial services companies, including
	money transmitters and prepaid access providers, are now regulated at the federal level by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
	(the CFPB), which began operations in July 2011, bringing additional uncertainty to the regulatory system and its impact on our
	business. We are increasingly facing more stringent anti-money laundering rules and regulations, compliance with which may increase
	our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and disrupt our business. Abuse of our prepaid products for purposes of
	financing sanctioned countries, terrorist funding, bribery or corruption could cause reputational or other harm that could have
	a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with, or further expansion
	of, consumer protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
	condition. Failure by us to comply with federal banking regulation may subject us to fines and penalties and our relationships
	with our issuing banks may be harmed.

	For
	some of our prepaid products, we or our issuing banks are required to remit unredeemed funds to certain (but not all) states pursuant
	to unclaimed property laws. However, unclaimed property laws are subject to change. Costs of compliance or penalties for failure
	to comply with or changes in state unclaimed property laws and regulations and changes in state tax codes could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 






	We
	are subject to Money Transmitter Licenses or Permits

	Most
	states regulate the business of sellers of traveler’s checks, money orders, drafts and other monetary instruments, which
	we refer to collectively as money transmitters. While many states expressly exempt banks and their agents from regulation as money
	transmitters, others purport to regulate the money transmittal businesses of bank agents or do not extend exemptions to non-branch
	bank agents. In those states where we are required to be licensed, we are subject to direct supervision and regulation by the
	relevant state banking departments or similar agencies charged with enforcement of the money transmitter statutes and must comply
	with various restrictions and requirements, such as those related to the maintenance of certain levels of net worth, surety bonding,
	selection and oversight of our authorized delegates, permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations
	with respect to some of the products subject to licensure, recordkeeping and reporting, and disclosures to consumers. We are also
	subject to periodic examinations by the relevant licensing authorities, which may include reviews of our compliance practices,
	policies and procedures, financial position and related records, various agreements that we have with our issuing banks, retail
	distribution partners and other third parties, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to
	our business. As a regulated entity, Next CALA may incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance. We anticipate
	that compliance costs and requirements will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries and that additional subsidiaries
	will need to become subject to these or new regulations. If we fail to maintain our existing money transmitter licenses or permits,
	or fail to obtain new licenses or permits in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition could
	be materially and adversely affected.





	 





	We
	are subject to Privacy Regulation.






	 




	In
	the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store or may collect and store personally identifiable information about customers,
	holders of our cards, subscribers, and users. This information may include names, addresses, email addresses, social security
	numbers, driver’s license numbers and account numbers. We also maintain or may maintain a database of cardholder data for
	our proprietary cards relating to specific transactions, including account numbers, in order to process transactions and prevent
	fraud. These activities subject us to certain privacy and information security laws, regulations and rules in the United States,
	including, for example, the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, various other federal
	and state privacy and information security statutes and regulations, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. These
	federal and state laws, as well as our agreements with our issuing banks, contain restrictions relating to the collection, processing,
	storage, disposal, use and disclosure of personal information, and require that we have in place policies regarding information
	privacy and security. We have in effect a privacy policy relating to personal information provided to us in connection with requests
	for information or services, and we continue to work with our issuing banks and other third parties to update policies and programs
	and adapt our business practices in order to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations. Certain state laws also require
	us to notify affected individuals of certain kinds of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information.
	These laws may also require us to notify state law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data
	breach. Failure to comply with, or further expansion of, consumer protection regulations could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A data security breach could expose us to liability and protracted
	and costly litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues.

	We
	are subject to regulation by foreign governments and must maintain permits and licenses in certain foreign jurisdictions in order
	to conduct our business. Foreign regulations also present obstacles to, or increased costs associated with, our expansion into
	international markets. For example, in certain jurisdictions we face costs associated with repatriating funds to the United States,
	administrative costs associated with payment settlement and other compliance costs related to doing business in foreign jurisdictions.
	We are also subject to foreign privacy and other regulations. These foreign regulations often differ in kind, scope and complexity
	from U.S. regulations. We are subject to added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks associated
	with our international operations. We operate in a highly and increasingly regulated environment, and failure by us or the businesses
	that participate in our distribution network to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject, or to
	which we may become subject in the future, may materially increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating revenues and
	disrupt our business.




	 






	We

	In
	addition to the federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations discussed above, we, our Next CALA subsidiary
	and our issuing banks, are also subject to card association and debit network rules and standards. The operating rules govern
	a variety of areas, including how consumers and merchants may use their cards and data security. Each card association and network
	organization audits us from time to time to ensure our compliance with these standards. Noncompliance with these rules or standards
	due to our acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of businesses that work with us could result in fines and penalties or the
	termination of the card association registrations held by us or any of our issuing banks. Changes in card association rules or
	standards set by Visa or Vanilla Reload, or changes in card association and debit network fees or products or interchange rates,
	could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern district of New York against Viber Media, Inc.  Plaintiffs
	filed an Amended Complaint asserting four claims: misappropriation of a business idea, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach
	of contract, and unjust enrichment.  Viber moved the Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint.  On March 30, 2016, U.S.
	District Judge Richard Sullivan issued an opinion and order on Viber’s motion to Dismiss.  Specifically, Judge Sullivan
	ordered that Viber’s motion to dismiss is granted on Plaintiffs’ misappropriation of a business idea claim, but denied
	as to their misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment claims.


	 


	On September 20, 2016, the Company received
	a notice it has been named as a defendant in a suit brought against Next Communications, an entity controlled by our CEO. In addition
	to being named a defendant, it was requested the Company provide certain documents for the discovery process. Due to the original
	suit being filed against a related party and not against the Company or its subsidiaries, we believe it likely the Company and
	its subsidiaries be dismissed as defendants and has not accrued a contingent loss as of December 31, 2016 as a result.

	Market Information



	 


	Our common stock is thinly traded. Without an active public
	trading market, a stockholder may not be able to liquidate their shares. The price for our securities may be highly volatile and
	may bear no relationship to our actual financial condition or results of operations. Factors we discuss in this report, including
	the many risks associated with an investment in our securities, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common
	stock.


	 


	The ability of individual stockholders to trade their shares
	in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state. A number of states require that an issuer’s
	securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade
	in that state. Presently, we have no plans to register our securities in any particular state.


	 



	Holders of Common Stock



	 


	As of December 31, 2016, we had 249,225,683 common shares and
	10,000,000 series B preferred shares issued and outstanding.


	 



	Dividends



	 


	The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our
	Board of Directors and depends, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements, our financial condition, and other
	relevant factors. We have not paid any dividends upon our common stock since our inception although a dividend was declared during
	the year ended December 31, 2016. By reason of our present financial status and our contemplated financial requirements, we may
	not pay additional dividends upon our common or preferred stock in the foreseeable future.


	 


	We have never paid any cash dividends. We currently intend to
	pay cash dividends for the dividend declared during the year ended December 31, 2016 but may not pay additional cash dividends
	in the foreseeable future on the shares of common or preferred stock. We intend to reinvest any earnings in the development and
	expansion of our business. Any cash dividends in the future to common stockholders will be payable when, as and if declared by
	our Board of Directors, based upon the Board’s assessment of:


	 





	●

	contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We caution you not to put undue reliance on any
	forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Our actual results or actions may differ materially
	from these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere
	in this annual report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
	with the financial statements and related notes and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different
	from what we currently expect.

	OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK



	 


	The Company was incorporated in September
	2005 to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries in the technology, telecom and banking industries.



	 




	Going Concern



	 


	The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain
	financing and upon future profitable operations. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and
	public offering of its common stock, if necessary. Our auditors have expressed a going concern opinion which raises substantial
	doubt about the Issuers ability to continue as a going concern.

	working capital deficit of $9,723,119. Current assets as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $256,302 of cash, accounts
	receivable net of allowance of $9,661, finance deposits of $25,000, prepaid expenses of $48,091, a related party receivable
	of $36,000 and current assets from discontinued operations of $225,884.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $18,047 of cash, total
	current assets of $111,861 and total current liabilities of $4,204,340 creating a working capital deficit of $4,092,479. Current
	assets as of December 31, 2015 consisted of $18,047 of cash, accounts receivable net of allowance of $26,900, finance deposits
	of $25,000, and related party receivables of $41,914.


	 


	The Company expect to fund operations through the foreseeable
	future through debt financing, equity financing or a combination of both. We cannot be assured there will be a capital market robust
	enough for us to raise debt or equity based financing in the foreseeable future.




	 



	GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company’s consolidated financial statements
	are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does
	not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating
	costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Under the going concern assumption, an
	entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of
	liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities
	are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course
	of business.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually
	attain profitable operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary
	if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  


	 








	 



	22



	 







	 




	 


	During the next year, the Company’s
	foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing
	and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with research
	and development associated with the launch of the company’s Cuentas branded NextCala general purpose reloadable card. The
	Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


	 


	Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated
	funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital
	through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there
	can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and
	adverse affect upon it and its shareholders.  




	 






	Operating activities




	 




	The Company used $929,442 of cash

	The change in accounts payable increased during the year ended
	December 31, 2016 due to increased legal fees associated with completing our reverse acquisition and increased costs associated
	with maintaining public filings. Additionally, we experienced increased costs associated with our Tel3 business and decreased cash
	flows from our day to day operations from which to pay these obligations. Non-cash expenses and gains increased during the year
	ended December 31, 2016 due to the amortization of debt discounts, stock based compensation and impairment losses that were not
	present during the year ended December 31, 2015.

	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company relied
	less on related party loans and more on financing from convertible debt which resulted in an increase in proceeds from convertible
	notes payable of $1,019,130 and decrease in proceeds from related party loans of $596,584. The total increase in cash provided
	by financing activities of $456,330 during the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the increased costs of operating our business
	post reverse acquisition.


	 


	Since inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements
	through issuance of common stock, related party advances and debt. As we expand our activities, we may, and most likely will, continue
	to experience net negative cash flows from operations. Additionally, we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations
	through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our
	working capital. In the future we need to generate sufficient revenues from sales in order to eliminate or reduce the need to sell
	additional stock or obtain additional loans. There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds to
	execute our business plan.


	 


	We anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next
	twelve months. Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects
	must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of
	development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an
	evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth.


	 


	To address these risks, we must, among other things, obtain
	a customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continually develop and upgrade our website,
	respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will
	be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects,
	financial condition and results of operations.


	 



	Off-balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements and does not
	anticipate entering into any such arrangements in the foreseeable future.


	 



	Impact of Inflation



	 


	The Company does not expect inflation to
	be a significant factor in operation of the business.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
	between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on financial conditions,
	changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
	that is material to stockholders.

	Going Concern



	 


	The Company has a working capital deficiency
	of $9,723,119 and accumulated deficit of $13,499,303 as of December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability
	to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise
	additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
	if the company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our
	accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements, which we discuss under the
	heading “Results of Operations” following this section of our MD&A. Some of our accounting policies require us to
	make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.


	 


	We set forth below those material accounting policies that we
	believe are the most critical to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and condition and that require complex
	management judgment.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of the Company’s financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates. The Company’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable,
	disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations
	of the Company.


	 




	Fair value of financial instruments




	 


	The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash,
	accounts payable and related party payables approximate the respective fair values due to the short maturities of these items.
	The Company does not hold any investments that are available-for-sale.


	 


	As required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic
	of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
	fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted
	prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is
	little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.


	 


	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


	 


	Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are
	accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;


	 


	Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs
	that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;


	 


	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs
	that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

	Impairment of long-lived assets





	 



	The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance
	with ASC Topic 360-10-05, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires
	that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost
	or carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset
	by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash
	flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s
	carrying value and its fair value or disposable value. At December 31, 2016, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined
	the present value of future cash flows from its investment in a certain subsidiary to be $0. As such, impairment losses of $2.7
	million and $1.2 million were recorded on goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. There was no
	impairment loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 




	Share-Based Compensation Expense





	 



	We calculate share-based compensation expense
	for option awards and warrant issuances (“Share-based Awards”) based on the estimated grant/issue-date fair value using
	the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (“Black-Scholes Model”), and recognize the expense on a straight-line
	basis over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions
	including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period of the Share-based
	Award in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards. Although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation
	expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which are open to interpretation and
	inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded
	in a given period.


	 



	New Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting
	pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
	disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might
	have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







	 


	Our Principal Executive Officer, Arik Maimon, and Principal
	Financial Officer, Michael DePrado, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
	under the Exchange Act) as of the year end covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, they have concluded that, as of December
	31, 2016 and 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to
	provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
	Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
	information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
	officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control, as is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These internal controls are designed to provide
	reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments
	inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
	system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an effective internal
	control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.


	 


	Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies
	and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
	(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles and the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made and in accordance with
	our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection
	of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.


	 


	Management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in the Internal Control –
	Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon
	this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during
	the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weakness
	identified:


	 


	Lack of appropriate segregation of duties,


	 


	Lack of control procedures that include multiple levels of supervision
	and review, and


	 


	There is an overreliance upon independent financial reporting
	consultants for review of critical accounting areas and disclosures and material, nonstandard transactions.




	 



	Implemented or Planned Remedial Actions in response to the
	Material Weaknesses



	 


	We will continue to strive to correct the above noted weakness
	in internal control once we have adequate funds to do so. We believe appointing a director who qualifies as a financial expert
	will improve the overall performance of our control over our financial reporting.


	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
	to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
	or procedures may deteriorate.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial
	reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
	Officer and Principal Financial Officer, do not expect that its disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors
	or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
	that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
	are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
	in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
	if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
	can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.

	Family Relationships



	 


	Natali Dadon and Arik Maimon are siblings.


	 



	Indemnification of Directors and Officers



	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws both provide for the
	indemnification of our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law.

	Limitation of Liability of Directors



	 


	Pursuant to the Florida Statutes, our Articles of Incorporation
	exclude personal liability for our Directors for monetary damages based upon any violation of their fiduciary duties as Directors,
	except as to liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
	misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or any transaction from which a Director receives an improper personal benefit. This
	exclusion of liability does not limit any right which a Director may have to be indemnified and does not affect any Director’s
	liability under federal or applicable state securities laws. We have agreed to indemnify our directors against expenses, judgments,
	and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim against a Director if he acted in good faith and in a manner he believed
	to be in our best interests.








	 



	Election of Directors and Officers



	 


	Directors are elected to serve until the next annual meeting
	of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until the meeting of
	the Board of Directors following the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified.


	  



	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings



	 


	No Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation has been
	the subject of any Order, Judgment, or Decree of any Court of competent jurisdiction, or any regulatory agency permanently or temporarily
	enjoining, barring suspending or otherwise limiting him/her from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer
	in the securities industry, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of an investment company, bank, savings and loan association,
	or insurance company or from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection
	with the purchase or sale of any securities.


	 


	No Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation has been
	convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations) or is the subject of a criminal proceeding which is currently
	pending.


	 


	No Executive Officer or Director of the Corporation is the subject
	of any pending legal proceedings.


	 



	Audit Committee and Financial Expert



	 


	We do not have an Audit Committee. Our directors perform some
	of the same functions of an Audit Committee, such as: recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit
	the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditor’s independence, the financial statements and their audit report;
	and reviewing management’s administration of the system of internal accounting controls. The Company does not currently have a
	written audit committee charter or similar document.


	 


	We do not have a financial expert. We believe the cost related
	to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because of our start-up operations, we believe the services
	of a financial expert are not warranted.


	 



	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance



	 


	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
	(the “Exchange Act”), requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent
	of an issuer’s common stock, which has been registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file initial reports of ownership
	and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Based upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations
	from our executive officers and Directors, we believe that as of the date of this filing they were all current in their filings.


	 



	Corporate Governance



	 



	Nominating Committee



	 


	We do not have a Nominating Committee or Nominating Committee
	Charter. Our Board of Directors performs some of the functions associated with a Nominating Committee. We have elected not to have
	a Nominating Committee in that we are an initial-stages operating company with limited operations and resources.

	Next
	Group Holdings, Inc.




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Next Group Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the
	related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the two years
	in the period ended December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
	also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
	overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
	financial position of Next Group Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their
	cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
	As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss before non-controlling interest of
	$10,041,385 and $1,193,987 and net cash used in operating activities of $929,442 and $794,377, for the years ended December 31,
	2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has a working capital deficit of $9,723,119 and $4,092,479, an accumulated deficit of
	$13,499,303 and $4,026,827 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans
	in regard to these matters are also described in Note 4. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.

	Next Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”)
	invests in financial technology and currently derives its revenues from the sales of prepaid calling minutes. The Company has an
	agreement with Incomm, a leading processor of general purpose reloadable (“GPR”) debit cards, to market and distribute
	a unique line of GPR cards targeted towards the Latin American market. The Company intends to launch the cards upon successful
	completion of appropriate financing and had yet to generate revenues from this activity.


	 


	Next Group Holdings, Inc was incorporated
	under the laws of the State of Florida on September 21, 2005 to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries, both current and
	future. Its subsidiaries are Meimoun and Mammon, LLC (100% owned), Next Cala, Inc (94% owned), NxtGn, Inc. (65% owned) and Next
	Mobile 360, Inc. (100% owned) and Transaction Processing Products (100% owned). Additionally, Next Cala, Inc. has a 60% interest
	in NextGlocal, a subsidiary formed in May 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired a business segment,
	Tel3, from an existing corporation. Tel3 was merged into Meimoun and Mammon, LLC effective January 1, 2017.


	 




	Meimoun and Mammon, LLC (“M&M”)
	was formed under the laws of the State of Florida on May 21, 2001 as a real estate investment company. During the year ended December
	31, 2010, M&M began winding down real estate operations and engaged in telecommunications services. M&M acquired telecom
	registrations, licenses and authorities to provide telecom services to the retail and wholesale markets including sales of prepaid
	long distance telecom services and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services. The services are sold under the brand name
	Next Mobile 360 and through the subsidiary of the same name.


	 



	Next
	Cala, Inc, (“Cala”) was formed under the laws of Florida on July 10, 2009 to the purpose of offering prepaid and reloadable
	debit cards to the retail market. Cala serves consumers in the underbanked and unbanked populations through Incomm, a leading
	provider of payment remittance services worldwide.




	 




	NxtGn,
	Inc. (“NxtGn”) was formed under the laws of Florida on August 24, 2011 to develop a unique High Definition telepresence
	product (AVYDA) which allows users to connect with celebrities, public figures, healthcare and education applications via a mobile
	phone, tablet or personal computer.




	 




	On
	January 1, 2016, NGH completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pleasant Kids, Inc. (“Pleasant
	Kids”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, NGH Acquisition Corp. (“Acquisition Sub”), pursuant to which NGH merged
	with Acquisition Sub and Acquisition Sub was then merged into PLKD effective January 1, 2016. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
	the NGH shareholders received shares of PLKD common stock such that the NGH shareholders received approximately 80% of the total
	common shares and 100% of the preferred shares of PLKD issued and outstanding following the merger. Due to the nominal assets
	and limited operations of PLKD prior to the merger, the transaction was accorded reverse recapitalization accounting treatment
	under the provision of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) 805 whereby
	NGH became the accounting acquirer (legal acquiree) and PLKD was treated as the accounting acquiree (legal acquirer). The historical
	financial records of the Company are those of the accounting acquirer (NGH) adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the accounting
	acquired (PLKD).


	 


	As the transaction was treated as a recapitalization, no intangibles, including goodwill,
	were recognized. Concurrent with the effective date of the reverse recapitalization transaction, the Company adopted the fiscal
	year end of the accounting acquirer of December 31.




	 




	On
	May 27, 2016, Next Cala entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Glocal Payments Solutions,
	Inc (“Glocal”) to form a joint venture, NextGlocal, in which Cala has a 60% controlling interest and Glocal has a
	40% interest. The Joint Venture will seek to launch and activate up to 45,000 prepaid debit cards under the Cala brand by
	December 31, 2016 and 360,000 additional cards during the 2017 calendar year. Either party may terminate the agreement at
	December 31, 2016 if certain objectives are not met.




	 




	On
	July 22, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Transaction Processing Products, Inc. (“TPP”) which has a
	64% interest in Accent InterMedia, LLC (“AIM”) and no other assets or liabilities. AIM operates as a leading gift
	card provider and in business activities very synergistic with those the Company is currently engaged in. See Note 16.




	 



	On August 10, 2016, M&M, a wholly
	owned subsidiary of the Company, closed the acquisition of Tel3 from a related party. Tel3 provides prepaid calling cards to consumers
	directly and operates in a complimentary space as M&M. Tel3 was originally acquired by the Company’s CEO in a private
	transaction and sold to the Company for $10 cash. See Note 16.

	NOTE

	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	This
	summary of accounting policies for Next Group Holdings, Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial
	statements. The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America (“GAAP” accounting) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Estimates are used when accounting for allowances for bad debts, collectability of loans receivable, potential impairment losses
	of the capitalized license fee, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangible assets, stock based compensation and fair value
	calculations related to embedded derivative features of outstanding convertible notes payable.




	 





	Cash





	 




	For
	purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
	three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company held
	no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not hold cash with any
	one financial institution in excess of the FDIC insured limit of $250,000.




	 





	Revenue
	recognition





	 





	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99
	of the FASB

	Accounting Standards Codification

	for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized
	or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all the following criteria are met:
	(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
	(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company primarily generates
	revenues through the sale of prepaid calling minutes to consumers through its Tel3 division. While the Company collects payment
	for such minutes in advance, revenue us recognized upon delivery to and consumption of minutes by the consumer. Next Cala generated
	revenues from commissions earned from Incomm, a leading financial services provider, and NxtGn generated revenues from the sale
	of voice over IP platform software during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	 






	Property
	and equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization
	using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to five years.

	 

	Maintenance
	and repair costs are expensed as they are incurred while renewals and improvements which extend the useful life of an asset are
	capitalized. At the time of retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and
	amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated results of operations.




	 





	Impairment
	of Long-Lived Assets




	 


	In accordance with ASC Topic 360, formerly SFAS No. 144,

	Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
	of Long-Lived Assets,

	the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based
	on the Company’s ability to recover the carrying value of its asset based on estimates of its undiscounted future cash flows.
	If these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized for the
	difference between the asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value. The Company recorded impairment losses of $3,916,976,
	of which $1,243,430 is included in losses from discontinued operations, and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
	Refer to Note 15 for further discussion.

	Non-Controlling
	Interest





	 




	The
	Company reports the non-controlling interest in its majority owned subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets within the
	stockholders’ deficit section, separately from the Company’s stockholders’ deficit. Non-controlling interest
	represents the non-controlling interest holders’ proportionate share of the equity of the Company’s majority-owned
	subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is adjusted for the non-controlling interest holders’ proportionate share of the
	earnings or losses and other comprehensive income (loss) and the non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share
	of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.




	  




	Derivative and Fair Value of
	Financial Instruments



	 


	Fair value accounting requires bifurcation
	of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments and measurement of their
	fair value for accounting purposes. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt
	host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
	If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt under ASC 470, the Company will continue its evaluation process
	of these instruments as derivative financial instruments under ASC 815.


	 


	Once determined, derivative liabilities
	are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded
	in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.


	 



	Fair
	value of certain of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, account payable, accrued expenses,
	notes payables, and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports
	fair value in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure” defines fair value, establishes a
	framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair
	value investments.

	value, as defined in ASC 820, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best
	use by market participants, principal (or most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair
	value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company’s credit
	risk.





	 





	Valuation
	techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The
	selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the
	characteristics of the asset or liability, and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
	value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides
	fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:




	 




	Level
	1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.




	 




	Level
	2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
	in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that
	are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;
	and




	 




	Level
	3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant
	to the fair values.




	 




	Fair
	value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements
	in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to
	expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes
	during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating
	those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported
	in the statement of income.

	Note 7 – Derivative Liabilities

	the Company did not identify any other assets or liabilities that
	are required to be presented on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with ASC 825-10 as of December 31,
	2016 and 2015. 




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	Income
	taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
	future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Use
	of net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes may be limited by Internal Revenue Code section 382 if a change of
	ownership occurs.




	 





	Basic
	Income (Loss) Per Share





	 




	Basic
	income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average
	number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available
	to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average
	number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.




	 



	At December 31, 2016, the Company had
	fifteen outstanding convertible notes payable with conversion rights that are exercisable. The remaining convertible notes outstanding
	at December 31, 2016 were not convertible until six months after issuance, or January 2017. The amount of outstanding principal
	on these convertible notes total $1,056,897 plus accrued interest of $202,068 for total convertible debts as of December 31, 2016
	of $1,258,965 representing 75,347,762 new dilutive common shares if converted at the applicable rates. The effects of these notes
	have been excluded as the conversion would be anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred in each period presented.



	 





	Dividends





	 




	The
	Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown.




	 




	As
	discussed in the 8K filed on May 18, 2016, the Company declared a special dividend on its outstanding common stock of one share
	of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock.  Pursuant to the dividend, the special stock dividend will be distributed to owners
	of the Company’s common stock as of the record date in a ratio of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock common stock
	for every 1 share of common stock owned as of the record date.  The Company originally had set the record date as June 10,
	2016 but was later modified to July 22, 2016. The Class D Preferred Stock must be redeemed within six months within six (6) months
	(or as soon thereafter as permitted by law) following final resolution of the Corporation’s affiliates lawsuit against ViberMedia
	, Inc. (Next Communications, Inc. and Nxtgn, Inc. v. Viber Media, Inc.) which is, as of the date of this filing, pending in U.S.
	District Court for the Southern District of New York or any successor or other lawsuit relating to the subject matter thereof
	in which the Corporation (or any successor-in-interest) is named as a plaintiff (the “Lawsuit”). The Designation fixes
	the redemption price of each share of class D Preferred stock as the greater of par value or the amount obtained by dividing (a)
	9.03 percent of the net proceeds to the Corporation of the Lawsuit after payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with
	such law suit and the resolution of  any creditor claims against Next Communications and all taxes on net income accrued
	or paid with respect to such amount, by (b) the total number of shares of Class D Preferred stock issued and outstanding as of
	the Redemption Date, which amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.




	 




	The
	Company has accrued common stock dividends payable of $30,000 and $0 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

	Pursuant
	to Section 850-10-20 the Related parties include (a) affiliates of the registrant; (b) entities for which investments in their
	equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section

	pursuing its own separate interests.




	 




	The
	financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
	allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
	in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall
	include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) description of the transactions, including transactions to which
	no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other
	information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar
	amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the

	Derivative Liabilities



	 


	The Company records a debt discount related
	to the issuance of convertible debts that have conversion features at adjustable rates. The debt discount for the convertible instruments
	is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds as an increase in additional paid-in capital and as a reduction
	to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features. The debt discount
	will be accreted by recording additional non-cash gains and losses related to the change in fair market values of derivative liabilities
	over the life of the convertible notes. Changes in value of the derivative liabilities that result from conversions of the underlying
	instrument to common stock are written off to additional paid in capital.

	certain closed loop general purpose reloadable debit cards for an initial term of three years. The Company remitted $250,000 as
	a license fee in connection with the agreement which it is recognizing over the initial term of the agreement on a straight line
	basis. The unamortized balance of the license fee was $118,056 and $201,385 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	During December 2015, the Company

	within the cancellation period that would allow for a refund of the deposit made. However, the Company has not yet received the
	refund due and is currently working with the advisory firm to return the funds which we expect will occur during the third quarter
	of 2017. The Company carried a current asset of $25,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflecting the amount of deposit due.

	In
	April 7, 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update “ASU” 2015-03 on “Interest — Imputation of Interest
	(Subtopic 835-30)” To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update would require that debt
	issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent
	with debt discounts or premiums. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs would not be affected by the
	amendments in this Update. This ASU 2015-3

	is effective for annual periods ending after
	December 15, 2015, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter.

	We reviewed the provisions of this ASU and determined
	there was an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), that outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle
	that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
	the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB approved
	a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the beginning of 2018 for public companies, with an option that would
	permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date of 2017. The updated standard will replace most
	existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective
	basis whereby it would be applied to new contracts and existing contracts with remaining performance obligations as of the effective
	date, with a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings at the effective date for those contracts.
	The updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 and we do not plan to early adopt. We have not yet selected
	a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial
	statements and related disclosures. 




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires
	an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases. The ASU will also
	require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the
	amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-02 and its impact on its consolidated financial
	position or results of operations.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations.”
	This Update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers
	when another party, along with the reporting entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. In these circumstances,
	an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that
	is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is,
	the entity is an agent). The amendments in the Update clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
	The Update is effective, along with ASU 2014-09, for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption
	of ASU 2016- 08 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)” (“ASU 2016- 09”).
	ASU 2016-09 requires an entity to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
	income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
	flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company
	has implemented ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.




	 




	In
	April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
	and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-1O”). The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606: identifying
	performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The
	entity first identifies the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity evaluates
	whether promised goods and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether an entity’s
	promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied
	at a point in time) or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The Company is currently
	evaluating ASU 2016-10 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326).” For most financial
	assets, such as trade and other receivables, loans and other instruments, this standard changes the current incurred loss model
	to a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses.
	The new standard is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. Entities are required to apply the provisions
	of the standard through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating
	the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.



	 


	I

	n
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)”,
	which provides guidance for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
	ASU 2016-15 is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
	within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard is effective for the Company at the beginning
	of fiscal year 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and
	do not expect adoption to have a material impact.



	 



	In
	November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which
	requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 will
	be effective for interim and annuals periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively.
	Early adoption of the standard is permitted. The new standard is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2017.
	We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect adoption
	to have a material impact.



	 



	Other
	accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption
	until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.




	 





	NOTE
	3 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS






	 




	The Company has classified its former
	gift card processing business as discontinued operation. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company ceased activity in this
	business segment and disposed of its ownership interest. On April 26, 2017, the Company entered into and completed the sale of

	NOTE
	4 – GOING CONCERN





	 



	The Company’s consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business.

	The Company had a net loss before non-controlling interest
	of $10,041,385 and $1,193,987 and net cash used in operating activities of $929,442 and $794,377, for the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has a working capital deficit of $9,723,119 and $4,092,479, and an accumulated deficit
	of $13,499,303 and $4,026,827 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	These conditions raise substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.



	 




	The
	Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expense, has experienced losses from operations
	since inception, and it does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. Its continued existence is
	dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There
	can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the
	Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	Management
	plans to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing. Debt instruments may be convertible or non-convertible
	and will vary based on the Company’s needs and financing options available at such times.




	 





	NOTE
	5 – LOANS RECEIVABLE





	 



	At the time of the reverse recapitalization
	discussed in

	Note 1 – Organization and Description of Business

	, the Company had a loan that was made to an individual
	totaling $40,000. This loan was not memorialized in writing and accordingly, carried no terms as to repayment, interest or default.
	The loan was determined to be uncollectible and written off during the year ended December 31, 2015. The write off is included
	in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.


	 


	Additionally, the Company acquired a total
	of $83,353 of loans receivable through its acquisition of TPP as discussed in

	Note 1 – Organization and Description of
	Business

	. The Company exited this business in December 2016 and the loan is included in assets from discontinued operations
	as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	As discussed in

	Note 8 – Related Party Transactions

	, during the year ended December 31, 2014,
	the Company made a series of loans to the sister of Mr. Arik Maimon, our Chief Executive Officer totaling $60,000. These loans
	were not memorialized in writing and accordingly, carry no terms as to repayment, interest or default. The loan was determined
	to be uncollectible and written off during the year ended December 31, 2015. The write off is included in general and administrative
	expenses in the statements of operations.

	The
	Company acquired $4,572 of equipment net of accumulated depreciation of $1,430 through the reverse recapitalization discussed
	in

	Note 1 – Organization and Description of Business.

	The Company disposed of this property in April 2016 and recorded
	a loss on disposal of $2,926 during the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 




	Additionally,
	the Company acquired a total of $123,013 of equipment at fair value through its acquisition of TPP as discussed in

	Note 1 –
	Organization and Description of Business.

	The Company exited this business in March 2017 and the fixed assets are included
	in assets from discontinued operations as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	Depreciation
	expense was $41,021, of which $40,804 is included in loss from discontinued operations, and $0 during the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015.




	 




	The
	Company had no property or equipment as of and December 31, 2016 or 2015.




	 





	NOTE
	7 – CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE






	 





	The
	Company has entered into a series of convertible notes payable to fund operations. While with differing noteholders, the terms
	of the outstanding convertible notes are substantially similar and accrue interest at 8% annually with a default interest rate
	of 24% and allow for the conversion of outstanding principal and interest to common stock at a price equal to a 45% to 50% from
	the lowest trading price in the preceding 20 days.




	 





	In February 2017, the Company agreed
	with certain noteholders to extend a redemption freeze agreement whereby the convertible note holders agreed to not convert outstanding
	principal and accrued interest into common stock for a period of 60 days. Upon the expiration of these agreements, a 90 day extension
	was executed whereby the noteholders agreed to not convert additional amounts through the first week of July 2017. Under the terms
	of the extension, each noteholder was granted the right to convert a limited amount of outstanding principal to common stock at
	a rate equal to the stated rate in the convertible note payable but not less than $0.02 per share and extended the due dates of
	the notes to July 2017. The convertible notes outstanding contain cross default features and the Company defaulted on all notes
	in November 2016.

	NOTE
	8 – DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES





	 




	The
	Company analyzed the conversion features of the convertible notes payable as discussed in Note 7 for derivative accounting consideration
	under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging” and determined that the embedded conversion features should be classified
	as a derivative liability because the exercise price of these convertible notes are subject to a variable conversion rate with
	a floor of $0.02 per share.  The Company has determined that the conversion feature is not considered to be solely indexed
	to the Company’s own stock and is therefore not afforded equity treatment. In accordance with AC 815, the Company has bifurcated
	the conversion feature of the note and recorded a derivative liability.




	 




	The
	embedded derivative for the note is carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value.  The derivative liability
	is marked-to-market each measurement period and any unrealized change in fair value is recorded as a component of the income statement
	and the associated fair value carrying amount on the balance sheet is adjusted by the change.  The Company fair values the
	embedded derivative using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The aggregate fair value of the derivative at the reverse
	capitalization date of the convertible notes payable was $1,236,007 which was recorded as a derivative liability on the balance
	sheet.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company had a $1,210,281 derivative liability balance on the balance sheet and recorded a gain from
	derivative liability fair value adjustment of $1,217,271 and excess value of derivative liabilities upon initial measurement of
	$333,482 as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016.  The derivative liability activity comes from
	convertible notes payable as discussed in Note 7. In addition to derivative liabilities associated with convertible notes payable,
	the Company recorded a derivative liability due to a ratchet strike price feature associated with the options issued in the acquisition
	of TPP. The options are exercisable at $0.18 per share unless the Company’s common stock is quoted at a price greater than
	$0.50 per share at which point the options are exercisable at $0.001 per share.

	the 10,000,000 options issued vested immediately upon execution of the related agreement, resulting in an immediate stock based
	expense of $558,323 being recognized. The remaining shares of this issuance vest based on performance milestones which the Company
	believes is less than50% likely of occurring resulting in stock based expense of $558,328. The remaining fair value of the unvested

	exercisable at $0.001 per share if the Company’s common stock trades at a price greater than $0.50 per share. The options

	on August 9, 2016 in which the option owners forfeited these options. The fair value of the 1,000,000 stock options granted with

	At
	the time of incorporation, the Company was authorized to issue 60,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001
	of which 50,000,000 was designated Series A and 10,000,000 as Series B. With the completion of the recapitalization as discussed

	If
	the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
	can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the
	assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
	cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable
	and material, would be disclosed.




	 




	On
	April 7, 2016, the Company executed an agreement with a third party to provide certain services for the Company. The agreement
	requires 1% of the outstanding common share equivalent to be issued to the third party when the market capitalization of the Company
	reaches $500,000,000 and an additional 1% when it reached $750,000,000. The probability of this event is uncertain at present
	and the Company has not accrued a contingent loss as of December 31, 2016 as a result.




	 



	On October 14, 2014, one of our operating
	subsidiaries, NxtGn, Inc. and Next Communications, Inc., an entity controlled by our CEO, (collectively the “Plaintiffs”)
	filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern district of New York against Viber Media, Inc.  Plaintiffs
	filed an Amended Complaint asserting four claims: misappropriation of a business idea, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach
	of contract, and unjust enrichment.  Viber moved the Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint.  On March 30, 2016, U.S.
	District Judge Richard Sullivan issued an opinion and order on Viber’s motion to Dismiss.  Specifically, Judge Sullivan
	ordered that Viber’s motion to dismiss is granted on Plaintiffs’ misappropriation of a business idea claim, but denied
	as to their misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment claims. The Company has not accrued any
	gains or losses associated with this case as it would be a contingent gain and recorded when received.



	 




	On
	September 20, 2016, the Company received a notice it has been named as a defendant in a suit brought against Next Communications,
	an entity controlled by our CEO. In addition to being named a defendant, it was requested the Company provide certain documents
	for the discovery process. Due to the original suit being filed against a related party and not against the Company or its subsidiaries,
	we believe it likely the Company and its subsidiaries be dismissed as defendants and has not accrued a contingent loss as of December
	31, 2016 as a result.




	 



	During the year ended December 31, 2014,
	a former employee of Pleasant Kids (PLKD), Franjose Yglesias-Bertheau, filed lawsuit against PLKD claiming unpaid wages of $622,968
	and was initially awarded that amount in a judgement. However, the judgement was later revised and the Company settled for $80,000
	in March 2017 which is included in accrued salaries as of December 31, 2016.

	We
	did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 due
	to the operating losses experienced during the year ended December 31, 2016. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset
	cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided a full valuation allowance
	on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry forwards, because management has determined that it is more
	likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.




	 




	The
	Company has not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the years
	ended December 2016 or 2015 applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain
	tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.
	All tax returns for the Company remain open.

	Company completed its acquisition of Transaction Processing
	Products, Inc. (“TPP”) on July 22, 2016. TPP operates as a gift card processor for retail stores which the Company
	can leverage as it launches its general purpose reloadable cards. Acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. The Company executed
	two separate agreements as part of the transaction; the first to purchase outstanding debt totaling $5.2 million owed by TPP to
	the seller in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of common stock and 7,500,000 options to purchase additional shares of stock at $0.18
	per share and the second to purchase the sellers interest in Accent InterMedia, LLC for cash consideration of $10. Where the agreements
	were executed simultaneously, they were accounted for as a single transaction. The common shares issued were valued at $1,270,000
	and the options issued at $898,490 resulting in total consideration of $2,168,500 when combined with the $10 of cash paid. The
	Company assumed net liabilities of $1,792,912 at fair value and identifiable intangible assets totaling $1,310,058, resulting

	Goodwill
	of $2.65 million represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired including identifiable
	intangible assets and liabilities assumed and is attributable to TPPs strategic position value and projected profits from new
	products.



	The preliminary purchase price
	allocation resulted in goodwill of $2.65 million, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill consists of the excess
	of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired assets and represents the estimated economic value attributable to future
	operations. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision. At this time, except for the items noted below,
	the Company does not expect material changes to the value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in conjunction with the
	transaction. Specifically, the following assets and liabilities are subject to change: 




	●


	Intangible customer contracts

	●


	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities.




	 


	As management receives additional
	information during the measurement period, these assets and liabilities may be adjusted. Under the acquisition method of accounting
	for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to
	uncertain tax positions during the measurement Example Disclosure: Accounting for Income Taxes 10 period and they relate to new
	information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement
	period adjustment, and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances
	and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our
	acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.

	expected future cash flows to present value. The Company will amortize the intangible assets on a straight line basis over their

	Company completed its acquisition of Tel3 on August 9, 2016 from a related party for

	CEO subsequently sold their interest in the business to the Company for minimal cash considerations. Tel 3 was merged into M&M,
	a subsidiary of the Company, effective January 1, 2017. As part of the acquisition, the company assumed net liabilities of $780,137
	whose book values equaled fair values at the time of acquisition. The Company did not record goodwill for the amount of consideration
	in excess of the fair values of net liabilities assumed due to the acquisition being from a related party. The excess instead was

	On
	February 1, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to settle a claim for accrued salary owed to a former employee of Pleasant
	Kids, Inc. for $80,000. The Company made a cash payment of $10,000 and entered into a convertible note payable for $70,000 as
	full settlement. The note carries interest at a rate of 8% and may be converted into common stock at the option of the noteholder
	at a rate equal to a 50% discount from the lowest trading price during the twenty days preceding the conversion with a $0.02 floor.

	holders agreed to not convert outstanding principal and accrued interest into common stock for a period of 60 days. Upon the expiration
	of these agreements, a 90 day extension was executed whereby the noteholders agreed to not convert additional amounts through
	the first week of July 2017. Under the terms of the extension, each noteholder was granted the right to convert a limited amount
	of outstanding principal to common stock at a rate equal to the stated rate in the convertible note payable but not less than
	$0.02 per share.
