08/11/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 08/11/2016 17:09
Leadmedia appoints Dave Moreau as new Chairman








[Attachment] Leadmedia has announced the appointment of Mr. Dave Moreau as Chairman and board member of the company Leadmedia Group, following the resignation of Mr. Bernard-Louis Roques, co-founder of the company Truffle Capital, who was holding this position since January 2016.
      

        Mr. Dave Moreau was successfully appointed member of the Board of Directors by cooptation before being nominated Chairman.
      

        Dave Moreau is a UK based highly experienced digital technology and media entrepreneur who has been involved in raising money from private equity and venture capital as well as multiple M&A transactions. A former journalist, Dave now sits as Chairman or non-executive director on the boards of several fast growth digital companies in Europe.
      

        Bernard-Louis Roques declared: 'In the last 18 months, Leadmedia succeeded to conduct with pace a refocusing on its technological heart of business in the Data Marketing field.  Definitively refocused on its key profitable assets, Leadmedia now recovers a sustainable financial model following the success of the recent capital increase open to all the shareholders.


Satisfied by this fast transition, the success of which would not have been achieved without the continuous and relentless efforts of the management, I am glad to leave the position to David Moreau to whom I wish to successfully accompany the development of Leadmedia through its value creation goals.'


Xavier Latil, CEO of Leadmedia Group: 'I am looking forward to work with Dave and I'm confident that under Dave's leadership, Leadmedia will growth, and for me this appointment represents the next chapter in our future'.


'I am delighted to be joining the Leadmedia Group Board as President and believe that Xavier and the team at Leadmedia have an exciting opportunity to continue to dominate in several international markets and see growth in both customers and territories. The future appears very bright for Leadmedia Group, with a talented international team,' said M. Moreau.
