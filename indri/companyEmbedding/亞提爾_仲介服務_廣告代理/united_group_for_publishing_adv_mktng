 This best-selling program is divided into nine chronological periods mirroring the structure of the new AP U.S. College Board Curriculum framework and reflects the Board's effort to focus on trends rather than isolated facts. Each period features a one-page overview suggesting various ways historians have studied the period and lists the three featured key concepts from the College Board Curriculum Framework. Each chapter concludes with historical perspectives, a feature that addresses the College Board emphasis on how historians have interpreted the events of the chapter in various ways. The chapter conclusion features a list of key terms, people, and events organized by theme, reflecting the College Board's focus on asking students to identify themes not just events. The chapter assessments include eight multiple-choice items, each tied to a source as on the new AP exam as well as four short-answer questions. Also included are period reviews with long-essay questions and document-based questions in the format of those on the new AP exam.

This best-selling program is divided into nine chronological periods mirroring the structure of the new AP U.S. College Board Curriculum framework and reflects the Board’s effort to focus on trends rather than isolated facts. Each period features a one-page overview suggesting various ways historians have studied the period and lists the three featured key concepts from the College Board Curriculum Framework. Each chapter concludes with historical perspectives, a feature that addresses the College Board emphasis on how historians have interpreted the events of the chapter in various ways. The chapter conclusion features a list of key terms, people, and events organized by theme, reflecting the College Board’s focus on asking students to identify themes not just events. The chapter assessments include eight multiple-choice items, each tied to a source as on the new AP exam as well as four short-answer questions. Also included are period reviews with long-essay questions and document-based questions in the format of those on the new AP exam.

Mestdaghon August 29, 2014Format: PaperbackAs a teacher of APUSH, I have purchased all the available review books that reflect the 2015 updates; seeing as the College Board has been less than helpful to teachers in this regard. Here is how I rank them:1) AMSCO (John Newman) is the best. This book offers eight stimulus-based multiple choice questions and six short answers per chapter (not period), and 6-10 long essays and a DBQ for each period of history. The drawback to this book, however, is that students cannot purchase an answer key (teachers can obtain one through the publisher, but it must be shipped to a school). There is also only one full-length practice exam.2) Kaplan is also good, as it offers five practice tests and 7-15 stimulus based multiple choice questions, at least two short answers, and either a long essay or a DBQ's for each period of history. This is what I will recommend to my students this year, as I will likely keep the AMSCO for myself to use for in-class assessments.3) Barron's is pretty substandard, for while it does offer three practice tests, it only offers 2-3 stimulus based multiple choice questions and zero short answers, long answers, DBQ's per period of history.4) 5 Steps to a 5, is the worst of the bunch with three practice tests, and no stimulus based multiple choice, short answers, long essays, or DBQ's associated with each period of history.If you are an APUSH teacher, I highly recommend this book.  Whether you spend the extra $6 to buy the answer key from the publisher is up to you.  If you are an APUSH student, I would also highly recommend this book; but would also tell you to consider the Kaplan book as they have a few more full-length tests and answers are included (although you sacrifice questions that are associated with each period).Read more66 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFirst Rate U.S. History Review Book (Says a History Teacher)ByD. M.on November 22, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAs a history teacher of 45 years, I've seen a lot of bad review books being hauled around by students.  This one is unusually good because it's simple, straightforward and uncomplicated.  The writing is clear, it covers the main topics, and the practice AP exam questions are generally good.  It's also not big and bulky like the more famous review books, most of which are overly complicated and no fun to use.  This one can be treated like a normal book, saved, and reused for years.  Worth the money.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsand it is perfect form of study materialByVVon July 28, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book is concrete and concise. It allows one to understand the material completely, and it is perfect form of study material. Regular history books have supernumerary information that one may not need in preparing for a American history test, but this book keeps it succinct. It develops the key points very well, and it allows one to understand not only the important people or historical dates but also the  "big picture," which is something that is often overlooked when students study history.Read more0Comment|

It is worth every cent, It has everything in it that you need for studying and it is extremely organized. Each grou of paragraph(s) has its own heading that clearly describes the following paragraph(s). Even if you are not taking the AP Exam for this class, it is extremely helpful for studying throughout the year. Use it to your advantage. My APUSH teacher had a few of these books in class to help us complete in class assignments and I liked it so much that I had to buy my own copy.If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBEST PREP BOOK EVERByHeidion September 1, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI got a 5 from reading this book, and my teacher taught us nothing. If it's on the AP exam, it's in the book. Memorize this book, do all the practice problems and you will get a five.The best part of this prep book is that it teaches you history like an actual textbook. In fact, it's 10x more concise than my textbook so it's really worth it. Instead of reading your textbook, this is a much quicker read and has all the important information (and more) that you need.I bought this book princeton, and a few others, but I loved this the best.Read more22 comments|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

 Why should I do business with you… and not your competitor?Whether you are a retailer, manufacturer, distributor, or service provider – if you cannot answer this question, you are surely losing customers, clients and market share. This eye-opening book reveals how identifying your competitive advantages (and trumpeting them to the marketplace) is the most surefire way to close deals, retain clients, and stay miles ahead of the competition.The five fatal flaws of most companies:• They don’t have a competitive advantage but think they do• They have a competitive advantage but don’t know what it is—so they lower prices instead• They know what their competitive advantage is but neglect to tell clients about it• They mistake “strengths” for competitive advantages• They don’t concentrate on competitive advantages when making strategic and operational decisionsThe good news is that you can overcome these costly mistakes – by identifying your competitive advantages and creating new ones.  Consultant, public speaker, and competitive advantage expert Jaynie Smith will show you how scores of small and large companies substantially increased their sales by focusing on their competitive advantages. When advising a CEO frustrated by his salespeople’s inability to close deals, Smith discovered that his company stayed on schedule 95 percent of the time – an achievement no one else in his industry could claim.  By touting this and other competitive advantages to customers, closing rates increased by 30 percent—and so did company revenues.Jack Welch has said, “If you don’t have a competitive advantage, don’t compete.” This straight-to-the-point book is filled with insightful stories and specific steps on how to pinpoint your competitive advantages, develop new ones, and get the message out about them.

"So many companies think that differentiation is the key to success.  It isn't. The key is knowing how to articulate what's different or better about your product. Creating Competitive Advantage is a must-have for any CEO's library." -- David Neeleman, CEO, JetBlue Airways"Jaynie Smith presents you with the most valuable marketing edge you can ever have -- and it won't cost you one cent… Just be sure that you unleash it before your competitors do… The sooner you read [Creating Competitive Advantage], the sooner you'll profit from it." -- Jay Conrad Levinson, author of Guerrilla Marketing"Any book that tells you how to be different from your competitors is worth reading. It's what good strategy is all about. Creating Competitive Advantage is just such a book." -- Jack Trout, author of Trout on Strategy“With engaging writing, telling insights, and inescapable logic, Jaynie Smith shows us how Creating Competitive Advantage is key to a successful business.” -- Robert B. Cialdini, author of Influence: Science & Practice “Creating Competitive Advantage is a weapon every business person needs in their arsenal to survive in today’s tough world.”–Jack Stack, President & CEO, SRC Holdings Corp., author of The Great Game of BusinessJaynie Smith’s experience as an advisor to scores of CEO’s has been distilled in this comprehensive look at sound competitive strategies. It’s back to the basics, an exercise every business needs to revisit!” -- Clark Johnson, former CEO, Pier I Imports"Compelling! The clarity with which Jaynie Smith presents her message is particularly valuable because the concept is, among business leaders, frequently discussed but often understood only superficially.  Finding and using your advantage is the key to not only survival but more importantly, attractively profitable survival. Should be required reading for business leaders." — Chuck Lillis, former CEO, MediaOne

I am always searching to mine some nugget of truth that not only impacts my approach to my clients but will enhance my business model. Creating Competitive Advantage exceeds that criteria. Author Jaynie L. Smith hits the bulls eye by revealing that most companies can’t successfully identify their competitive advantages (CA’s) and in turn can’t properly promote and grow their business. Jaynie asks the right questions to help the business leaders drill down to who they really are and how they are different or better than their competitors. Once the CA’s are identified then a marketing plan can be created around this proper foundation. This leads to positive business growth and sense of empowerment with a feeling of confidence that the business is going in the right direction.Once a business creates a list of CA’s it is important that they are verified by their customer base. Because the only perceptions that matter are those of the customer. This book is great mix of theoretical and practical examples from the hundreds of business clients she has served. It is a “must read” book for any business leaders library.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA great back to basics bookByEmmanuel Lon May 9, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseAs a strategist, lecturer and consultant in Africa this book offers me a great 'back to basics' read:--it is not too academic and neither is it motivational talk--it brings real business acumen to the table by focusing on your customers and how youcan please them for sustainable sales and profits...--by unearthing and exploiting a potent competitive advantage against competitors--it quickly goes to the heart of the matter of standing out among the crowd in a way that isrelevant to customers but lethal to competitors--it also has great case studies that bring Jaynies's concepts to life in an engaging wayAfter reading this book you will know how to think about your advantages and thus how to market them properly.I have read strategy tomes but i found this book on-point and accessible to all kinds of readers.Worth every cent indeed and occupying a proud space in my library!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsEasy to Read "How To" bookByNovaGirlon October 12, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI went into this book having tried to develop C.A. previously without much success for a commodity business.
