1985-1990
Rise of information products replaced declining consumer electronics.


1991-1995
Information electronics products became the mainstream in the rapidly transforming industry. 


1996-2000
Consumer electronics industries began to move to China and other countries.


2001-2005
Active development of network communication expanded  economic scale, ushering in an era of low profits for the distribution industry.


2006-2010
China became the world’s factory. Factories in Taiwan began to migrate.


2011-2015

China transforms itself from the world factory’s to the world’s market and creates new opportunities through products and technologies.


















1985-1990
The value of a distributor’s services is to fulfill customers’ needs and create value.


1991-1995
Under increasingly diversified products and technology development, other than sales activities, enhanced technologies increase the value of services.


1996-2000
Established logistics center and localized cash flow and logistics services to shorten delivery time in response to the customers’ demands for speedy services.


2001-2005

2006-2010
Sunnic set “sounds and images” as the core concepts for its technical marketing and created the brand “OGA”.

2011-2015
The Company continuously develops based on the concepts of technique marketing and provides a complete supply chain to the industry.

















1985-1990
Companies centered on distribution channel sales are unable to respond to the development of technology and services.


1991-1995
Under the mode of distribution channel sales, technology development is rather difficult and this bottleneck will impede growth of the company. 


1996-2000
Sunnic began development of basic technical support and small-scale support teams.


2001-2005
The Company launched development of four major technology areas: capture, display, storage, and communication and began the development of camera and multimedia solutions and products.

Integrated parts and components and system technologies, and began to offer solutions and module products through the “OGA” brand.


2011-2015

Company Description                    




                        SUNNIC was founded in 1985 to provide “A Complete Supply Chain for Electronic Industry” as the company’s upmost object. Through many years and under the extensive care and support from our customers, the company has grown to become a technical marketing oriented professional company as a long term cooperative agency for well-known manufacturers such as Sony, Sharp…etc., for products as small as semiconductors, solution plans, modules and systems to as large as plant automation equipments etc. tens of series of products to provide the industries and customers with complete supply chain services of versatile, diversified and vertical and horizontal integration. Under the quality policy of “Profession, Integration, Service and Cognition”, SUNNIC believes that customer satisfaction is the final goal of the enterprise’s management. If service quality can not satisfy customers’ needs then sustainable operation can not be realized. As ISO is currently the most complete and widely recognized quality standards by the immense industries, SUNNIC received the DNV ISO 2002 certification as early as in 1997 and the DNV ISO 9001 certification in 1999 with the hope to provide even better and professional service quality for our customers. Under the vigorous competition in the market of semiconductors and electronic parts, “minimal profit” has been the inevitable curse for distributors. How to avoid vicious price slashing competition and jump out of the traditional buy and sale marketing model has been our dedicated goal for a long time. Based on the foundation led by our techniques and through our distributor marketing platform to create a model different from minimal profit operation, we have built the company’s core value of “Technical Marketing”. The “Technical Marketing” provides a complete marketing aspect with horizontal lay-out and enhancement to acquire different resources of key components; and with vertical lay-out to continue technical development in depth and breadth. We took “Image Processing” as our core technical development and optoelectronic products as our technical development platform. Our researched and developed products including from Image Capture CCD, CMOS Analog, digital camera, Image Storage of Blue Ray DVD, H.264 HDD Player, High Resolution Image Display HD LCD TV, Internet TV to image communication Wi-Fi, Wi-Max and 3GPP transmissions are all based on such thoughts to commercialize different products and applications. We provide our customers with the Total Solution including Outlook, Mechanism, Software, Hardware and Firmware for One Stop Shopping. Under the added value of technical services, operation profits are generated through marketing of the products to enrich technical marketing activities with the effects of expansion and multiplication thus bringing more mixed effects to the sales business. For the booming development of electronic industry in the greater Chinese region, we have established our technical and marketing spots in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Kunshan and Xiamen and we are expecting to establish more spots in other regions to expand our market and business. In respect of future development planning and middle to long term goal, SUNNIC will not only continue to provide full electronic product supply chain services but also dedicate to achieve even higher development and maintain our leading position in the industry based on our existing businesses. Endless innovations and aggressive developments of markets are the continued businesses for SUNNIC and providing customers with diversified products and higher service quality are our forever dedicated goal and promise for SUNNIC.
