Company Description                    




                        Alltek Technology Corp. was founded in April 1991 as a professional communication components distributor and solution provider. The company invited experienced R&D talents from internationally reputable communications companies to provide total solutions to customers. Unlike conventional component representatives who provide only quotations and delivery dates, we offer customers more by helping customers to solve bottlenecks of product development via a comprehensive program, hence raising the overall quality of the industry. Ever since Alltek Technology Corp. was founded, the total solutions have become our main business strategy which relies on its strong technical developments and supports. Alltek equips the capacity for ASIC, module and system developments, as well as for customization and the software and firmware modification capabilities. Alltek’s veteran management team shares strong background in engineering, product research and development; they came from Siemens, IBM, Motorola, CSIST, Tatung, and Institute for Information Industry. Accordingly, humanity, flexibility and efficiency have become the main objectives when it comes to organization structure, system plan, and employee management. With the patented core technologies, integrated with the cutting edge R&D foundations, Alltek established its own lab to create modularized circuits, ASICs, and total system development complementing our authorized products. The research and development teams have many years of technical experience, specializing in wire networks, wireless communications, telecommunication equipment, data and network communications, development of information software and hardware, and digital circuit designs. Alltek commits to pursuit the maximum benefits of shareholders, customers, suppliers and its employees with the continuous devotions. “Think globally, act locally”. The company is dedicating to fulfill customer requests with local knowledge and international service standard to remain the leading competitive edges in the global IC distributor business.
