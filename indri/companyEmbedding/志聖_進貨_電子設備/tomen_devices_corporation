History




Developing as the Toyota Group's Trading Company






1946  Headquarters of Toyoda Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd.,(Toyota Kaikan)




Toyoda Kinyu Kaisha, the Company's predecessor, was a company established in 1936 to provide sales financing for Toyota vehicles. After World War II, holdings companies became prohibited by the second zaibatsu designation, which led to the dissolution of Toyoda Kinyu Kaisha (then known as Toyoda Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd.). However, the trading division of this company was transferred to Nisshin Tsusho Kaisha Ltd., Toyoda Sangyo's successor established in 1948. Nisshin Tsusho would later evolve to become today's Toyota Tsusho Corporation. The Company continued to grow as a general trading company and as a member of the Toyota Group, largely by exporting finished automobiles, and eventually came to be listed on both the Nagoya Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.







Trading division of Toyoda Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd., established as a separate company under the name Nisshin Tsusho Kaisha, Ltd.





Company name changed to Toyoda Tsusho Kaisha, Ltd.





Stock listed on the second section of the Nagoya Stock Exchange





Began exporting Toyota vehicles, starting with the Dominican Republic





Stock listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange








Stepping Up Overseas Forays as Toyota Globalizes






Maiden voyage of "Toyota Maru No.7" towards Central America.(1970)




During this period, Toyota Group companies began moving beyond simply exporting automobiles, and actually started conducting production in various countries overseas. To respond to the globalization of the Toyota Group, we accelerated our own overseas expansion, establishing a series of dealers and other bases overseas and commencing production of Toyota vehicles in Pakistan. However, our efforts were not limited to the automotive sector. For example, we formed a business alliance with Kasho Company in 1999.







Tokyo branch converted to head office, complementing the Nagoya head office in a two-head office system






Warrant bonds (US$70 million) issued on the European market
Company name changed to Toyota Tsusho Corporation






Business alliance formed with Kasho Company, Ltd.








Merging and Forming Tie-Ups to Expand Value Chains Outside of the Automotive Sector






New-build offshore drilling rig in Egypt.




In 2000, we entered into a capital and operational tie-up with Tomen Corporation and then merged with Kasho Company, Ltd. In 2006, the Company merged with Tomen, which had a broad customer base and diverse business ventures, giving birth to the present Toyota Tsusho. This move positioned us to commence our full-fledged advance beyond the automotive sector into fields such as infrastructure, chemicals, and foods, and our value chains were greatly expanded as a result.

Jun Karube, President & CEO at TTC and Richard Bielle, Chairman of the Management Board at CFAO




In the 2010s, we are accelerating investment in new business fields. For example, in 2012 we commenced capital participation in CFAO S.A., a French trading company that has automotive and pharmaceutical operations centered on Africa. A particular emphasis is being placed on renewable energy, businesses in Africa, and other areas that have been seeing significant expansion in demand from society and also represent areas in which the Company can leverage its strengths and generate synergies. By developing businesses in these areas, Toyota Tsusho will work to achieve sustainable growth.
