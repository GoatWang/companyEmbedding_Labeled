The NEU Nanofiber Electrospinning Unit uses electrospinning techniques to safely and easily produce nanofibers with diameters of 50 to 800 nm. This device is widely used in the automotive industry for research and development of filters and fuel cells. 

The NEU Nanofiber Electrospinning Unit is capable of producing 50 to 800 nm diameter fibers. The device’s biggest feature is the ability to produce nanofibers easily from a small amount of various polymers using an electrospinning technique.  Currently, use of nanofibers in raw materials, IT, biotechnology, and healthcare industries is expected to increase dramatically as manufacturers look to take advantage of increased surface area and finer fiber materials.

Nanofiber Electrospinning Unit 
Features 
Nano-fiber manufacturing principles 

As shown in the diagram, the electrospinning device consists of a pointed positive electrode (capillary) and a flat negative (ground) electrode.  High voltage is applied between the two electrodes, and the charged molten polymer or polymer solution coming from the capillary is attracted through the electric field toward the negative electrode.  At this point, polymers with low molecular cohesion become a spray, and those with high molecular cohesion are further separated into fibers that are attracted to the negative electrode, where they form a thin layer of fibers. 



Development history 
Despite active studies into electrospinning, only handmade devices were available. Although researchers at Drexel University attempted to manufacture a lab prototype, no company capable of producing a device with high accuracy could be found in the U.S. However, Kato Tech Co., Ltd. in Japan undertook the development of an electrospinning device for lab use and created a system that included a voltage generator and nozzle, roller movement, a quantitative syringe pump, and a draft function.  This device largely featured the ideas of Drexel University’s Dr. Frank Ko, a leading authority on electrospinning, and made it possible to create nanofibers easily using electrospinning.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
