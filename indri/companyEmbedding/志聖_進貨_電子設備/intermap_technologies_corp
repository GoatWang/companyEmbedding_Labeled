DENVER – March 23, 2017 (TSX: IMP) (ITMSF:BB) – Intermap Technologies Corporation (“Intermap” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.
All amounts in this news release are in United States dollars, unless otherwise noted.
During the second half of 2016, the Company undertook a number of measures to stabilize its operations, restructure its financial obligations, and return to profitable growth.
The Company announced changes to the Board of Directors, which resulted in a new composition of the full Board. Additionally, the Company announced changes in senior management and organizational restructuring necessary to align the Company’s resources with the on-going revenue opportunities.
In December 2016, the Company announced the restructuring of its outstanding debt agreements with Vertex One Asset Management Inc. The restructuring included a Bridge Loan for $6.0 million, to be repaid with the proceeds of a Rights Offering during the first quarter of 2017, the extension of the maturity date of all current promissory notes to September 1, 2020 and the elimination of interest, the cash sweep and the royalty payment obligations.
“These organizational changes and refinancing steps provided the liquidity to execute the Company’s business plan, and return to its core strategic focus towards data acquisition, value added data processing, and related application solutions and services,” commented Patrick Blott, Chairman and CEO of Intermap. In addition, the Company continued to invest in its core risk management business, where it has seen increased demand for risk management software and services related to flood underwriting. The Company is seeking to become a large participant in underwriting private flood risk, which is a growing market segment where many large surplus and admitted carriers have recognized the Company's unique products and have recently become customers.”
Moving into 2017, the Company announced major steps forward in its new strategic direction. It announced a comprehensive upgrade of its radar system, making it the most advanced commercial multi-frequency data acquisition platform available. It announced a task order to deploy its new system in Southeast Asia in 2017. And it added employees to its processing operation to absorb increased demand for services associated with these initiatives.
On February 24, 2017, the Company announced its plans to proceed with the previously announced Rights Offering. The Rights Offering Notice was mailed on March 2, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of March 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Rights Offering, one right was issued for each common share of the Company held and each right entitles the holder to subscribe for one common share of the Company upon the payment of the subscription price of C$0.06 or US$0.05 per common share. An aggregate of 101,344,582 rights were issued pursuant to the Rights Offering and, if fully subscribed and the subscription price is paid in US dollars, would result in gross proceeds of approximately US$5.0 million. The rights expire at 4:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on March 27, 2017. All proceeds received in connection with the Rights Offering will be used to repay the Bridge Loan referenced above and no proceeds will be retained by the Company. Details of the Rights Offering are available on the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com.

DENVER, Jan. 30, 2017 /CNW/ - Intermap (TSX: IMP), (ITMSF:BB), a leading geospatial intelligence Corporation, today announced that effective January 27, 2017, Mr. Philippe Frappier has joined the Board of Directors and will serve as Chairman of the Compensation Committee, while Mr. Andrew P. Hines has been appointed Chairman of the Audit Committee.
"As we further Intermap's transition towards profitable growth, we are taking another big step forward with the addition of Mr. Philippe Frappier to our board," commented Patrick Blott, Chairman and CEO of Intermap. "An experienced human capital manager, Philippe believes strongly that the best measure of Intermap's potential comes from its capacity to develop its talent and promote internally. He has been an integral architect of our corporate restructuring since October, including our executive team selection, incentive benchmarking, and human capital development. We acknowledge and appreciate all the efforts of our associates during this transition period and know they see the progress the Company is making."
The Company also reported that Mr. Michael Hoehn has resigned from both his Director and operating roles. "I want to thank Mike for his service to Intermap since 2015. We wish him well in his future endeavors," commented Patrick Blott, Chairman and CEO of Intermap.
Intermap also announced a Director Retention Program designed to incentivize active engagement by our experienced Directors to help the Company re-build. During this period, while we restructure the business and financial affairs of the Company, Intermap has been challenged to develop a compensation program for its executive officers and directors that recognizes the significant engagement required of its management and Board. Since the restructuring commenced on July 27, 2016, with the election of Mr. Blott as Executive Chairman, the Company has made retention cash payments of $510,000 ($250,000 to the Executive Chairman and CEO, $80,000 to the Chief Financial Officer and $180,000 to the remaining Directors), and granted options to purchase 4,125,320 common shares at C$0.08 per share.
The Company committed to issue an additional 2,704,680 options to purchase shares, following the annual shareholders meeting. The cash payments were advanced based on the achievement of certain strategic goals, including the two financings completed with the Company's largest shareholder and lender. Three of the current Directors of Intermap, including the Executive Chairman and CEO, also acquired from the Company's largest shareholder and lender, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,589,080 common shares of the Company at an exercise price of C$0.09 per share. Each Board members' agreement to acquire warrants from a third party provides a signal of the Board's strong commitment to the future of the Company.

The Bridge Loan will be repaid from the gross proceeds of the Rights Offering (including proceeds received in connection with the Standby Purchase Commitment). Any unpaid amounts under the Bridge Loan, following the Rights Offering, if any, will convert into a term loan with a maturity of September 1, 2020. The Bridge Loan is non-interest bearing.
“We are extremely pleased that our primary lender and largest shareholder, one of the stakeholders that knows Intermap best, has provided equity financing and a strong vote of confidence”, commented Patrick Blott, Executive Chairman and CEO of Intermap. “Vertex has agreed to make this investment available to all our existing shareholders.

History[edit]
Intermap was formed on January 31, 1996, and commenced active business operations on September 1, 1996. On November 11, 1996, the company acquired all of the assets comprising the image mapping services division of Intera Information Technologies Corporation (IITC). Many of the senior members of Intermap’s original management team were employees of IITC. Intermap originally focused on providing 3D digital elevation maps for customers under specific contract arrangements. Typically, these projects specified areas to be mapped and were generally procured by governmental mapping and/or defense agencies.
IFSAR Products[edit]
Intermap collects elevation data aerially, using aircraft equipped with Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) technology. Intermap’s IFSAR digital elevation model (DEM) and image products include:

Digital surface models (DSMs). A topographic model of the earth’s surface that includes buildings, vegetation, roads, and natural terrain features. The key benefit of the DSM is that it provides a geometrically correct base map.
Digital terrain models (DTMs). A "bare earth" topographic model that has had vegetation, buildings, and other cultural features digitally removed, enabling users to infer terrain characteristics possibly hidden in the DSM.
Orthorectified radar images (ORIs), a grayscale image of the earth’s surface that has been corrected to remove geometric distortions, accentuating topographic features far more than is possible with aerial photography.

The data, once processed, is included in nationwide digital elevation datasets called NEXTMap.
NEXTMap[edit]
In 2002, Intermap commenced its NEXTMap program, which is focused on collecting and processing 3D digital elevation datasets for entire countries, including Great Britain (published 2003), countries in Western Europe[2] (completed in July 2008), the United States[3] (completed in June 2010), and Southeast Asia. In contrast to historic mapping business models in which customers pay for the completion of specific mapping projects, Intermap is self-financing the NEXTMap program. The company then sells the use of its data through licensing agreements.
AccuTerra[edit]
In 2008 Intermap launched AccuTerra GPS Maps which combines Intermap's NextMap data with Intermap's detailed recreation based data to create highly accurate maps to be used on outdoor/recreation GPS devices. Currently Intermap has contracts to provide their high-resolution maps and data to the Magellan Navigation, Bushnell, Lowrance Electronics, and Pronounced GPS product lines, as well as the Apple iPhone. The AccuTerra iPhone App won "Best iPhone OS 3.0 Beta App" at Apple's Design Awards 2009. The Apple Design Awards recognize technical excellence and outstanding achievement in iPhone OS and Mac OS X development.
Customers[edit]
The company has attained digital mapping contracts with companies across various industries[4] and sectors, including geographic information systems (GIS), engineering, insurance risk assessment, oil and gas, environment, communications, transportation, and 3D visualization markets. In 2007, Microsoft[5] announced a partnership with Intermap to create an enhanced version of Virtual Earth 3D for Great Britain, although that 3D product was later dropped in November 2010.[6]

DENVER, BERLIN & GAIMERSHEIM, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intermap Technologies, the worldwide 3D digital mapping company and Audi 
      Electronics Venture GmbH (AEV), a wholly owned subsidiary of Audi AG, 
      today announced that Intermap´s accurate and uniform 3D 
      road geometries for all German roads have been delivered to the VW 
      Group to be added to its research and development platform.
    


      Intermap’s 3D Roads product is the only map dataset that covers all 
      classes of roads – featuring more than one million line kilometers of 
      accurate road centerline position and elevation data for the entire 
      country. Derived from the Company’s NEXTMap 
      database of uniformly accurate digital elevation models (DEMs) for all 
      of Western Europe, this product enables the VW group to test innovative 
      technologies throughout the entire country – from small rural roads to 
      the largest Autobahn.
    

      “This licensing agreement is another example of how our 3D Roads product 
      is being used to support ADAS 
      and energy 
      management applications that rely on the 100% road coverage that our 
      3D road vectors provide,” commented Eric DesRoche, senior vice 
      president, automotive at Intermap Technologies. “Volkswagen’s research 
      and development group understands the importance of having comprehensive

REDMOND, Wash., and DENVER — June 19, 2007 — Microsoft Corp. and Intermap Technologies Corp. today announced the launch of Microsoft’s enhanced Virtual Earth™ 3-D viewing platform based on Intermap Technologies’ highly accurate and up-to-date elevation data for all of Great Britain. Intermap is also creating similar maps for all of Western Europe and the continental United States. The resulting product delivers a more seamless and accurate 3-D experience for all Internet users visiting Microsoft’s Live Search Maps for England, Scotland and Wales. 
Intermap’s precise and uniform 3-D digital terrain model serves as the foundation for the placement and alignment of aerial photography and other geospatial images. These images are then layered upon this 3-D foundation to better align and place objects without distortion or undulation, thus creating a superior end product.  
“Microsoft is committed to delivering the highest-accuracy and highest-quality product for our Live Search Maps customers, and this enhancement is another step toward meeting this commitment,” said Aric Weiker, director of product management for the Virtual Earth platform at Microsoft. “Having Intermap’s highly accurate and reliable foundation layer under our imagery and building models allows us to provide one of the most accurate viewing experiences on the Internet today.” 
Live Search Maps is Microsoft’s online local search and mapping service that combines unique bird’s-eye imagery with advanced driving directions, Yellow Pages and other local search tools. Powered by the company’s Virtual Earth mapping and location platform, these features give users useful new ways to map and find directions to various locations, and to better visualize their surroundings from multiple aerial vantage points.
“This is a fundamental change for the industry as Microsoft raises the bar for accuracy and realistic 3-D experiences,” said Eric DesRoche, senior vice president of automotive and consumer electronics at Intermap. “While an accurate visualization application is important to deliver to consumers, our relationship with Microsoft begins to pave the way for the delivery of additional value-added products for the business and consumer markets within Great Britain, Europe and the U.S.”
As part of Intermap’s worldwide proactive data collection efforts, Great Britain is currently in the company’s data library. In addition, Intermap is now aggressively mapping Europe under its NEXTMap® Europe program. Data for the entire country of Germany is currently being placed in the Intermap library, and data collection for the remainder of Western Europe is scheduled for completion by the end of 2007. The continental U.S. is being mapped concurrently with the European initiative and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008.
