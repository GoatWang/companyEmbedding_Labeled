InfoSonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IFON) is a publicly traded telecommunications equipment provider based in San Diego, California.[2] It develops, manufactures, and distributes wireless handsets and accessories through its proprietary brand verykool and other private label brands.[3] InfoSonics sells its products through carriers, distributors and OEMs in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific and the United States.[6] It is best known for its line of inexpensive unlocked phones as well as its rugged phones in its verykool line of products.[7][8]
History[edit]
InfoSonics was founded in 1994 by Joseph Ram, the company's president and CEO. It became a public company in June 2004, and was initially listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol “IFO.”[9] In August 2006, the company transferred to the NASDAQ under the symbol “IFON.”[10] When the company first went public, it was primarily a distributor of products supplied by Samsung, VK Corporation, LG, Novatel and others. In 2005 it purchased Primasel S.A., a distributor of Samsung products primarily in Argentina.[11][12]




The verykool s400, T742, R800, and s470 from InfoSonics Corporation.


The company followed up with a secondary stock offering in 2006, offering 2.2 million shares.[13] The same year the company reached $240 million in sales.[13] 2006 was also the year it began to develop its own wireless handsets under the verykool brand.[14] InfoSonics ceased its distributing business in March 2012, primarily due to protective import tariffs that had been enacted on certain electronic devices since 2009.[14] After terminating its distributing business, it became solely a manufacturer and distributor of its own products under the verykool brand.[15]
InfoSonics entered into an agreement with Ingram Micro in December 2012 for the distribution of its verykool brand to customers in the United States.[16] It also launched an online store in the U.S. market for consumer purchase of the verykool product line.[17]
InfoSonics Corporation reported a second consecutive quarter of profitability after 2013 4th quarter results were announced.[18] The company had a 48% gross profit in the 4th quarter compared to 2012 with operating expenses declining 26% for the same period.[18] InfoSonics also reported gross revenue of $37.9 million, an increase of $3.6 million from the year prior.[19] It continued to increase sales by year-end 2014, bringing in $48.1 million, a 27% increase from the prior year.[5]

InfoSonics Corporation ceased its distribution business in 2012 and became solely a manufacturer of its own product line.[6] InfoSonics began shipping its first line of verykool products to Central America in 2007. This included the verykool i500 and i230 wireless handsets.[7]

Cautionary Statement for the Purpose of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The matters in this press release that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements about future revenues, sales levels, operating income and margins, wireless handset sales, stock-based compensation expense, gain/loss in value of derivatives, cost synergies, operating efficiencies, profitability, market share, and rates of return, are based on current management expectations that involve certain risks and uncertainties.  These risks and uncertainties, in whole or in part, could cause such expectations to fail to be achieved and have a material adverse effect on InfoSonics’ business, financial condition and results of operations, and include, without limitation: (1) intense competition internationally, including competition from alternative business models, such as manufacturer-to-carrier sales, which may lead to reduced prices, lower sales, lower gross margins, extended payment terms with customers, increased capital investment and interest costs, bad debt risks and product supply shortages; (2) dependency on Latin American sales a majority of which are from Argentina, which may be significantly reduced or eliminated as a result of the recently adopted tax/duty by Argentina; (3) the ability of the Company to successfully introduce and sell its verykool® products and the related inventory risk of such products; (4) extended general economic downturn; (5) inability to secure adequate supply of competitive products on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; (6) foreign exchange rate fluctuations, devaluation of a foreign currency, adverse governmental controls or actions, political or economic instability, or disruption of a foreign market, including, without limitation, the imposition, creation, increase or modification of tariffs, taxes, duties, levies and other charges and other related risks of our international operations, such as the recently adopted tax/duty change in Argentina on certain electronics (including cellular phones) which could significantly increase selling prices to our customers and end-users; (7) the ability to attract new sources of profitable business from expansion of products or services or risks associated with entry into new markets, including geographies, products and services; (8) an interruption or failure of our information systems or subversion of access or other system controls may result in a significant loss of business, assets, or competitive information; (9) significant changes in supplier terms and relationships; (10) termination of a supply or services agreement with a major supplier or product supply shortages; (11) continued consolidation in the wireless handset carrier market; (12) loss of business from one or more significant customers; (13) customer and geographical accounts receivable concentration risk and other related risks; (14) rapid product improvement and technological change resulting in inventory obsolescence; (15) terrorist or military actions; (15) the loss of a key executive officer or other key employees; (17) changes in consumer demand for multimedia wireless handset products and features; (18) our failure to adequately adapt to industry changes and to manage potential growth and/or contractions; (19) seasonal buying patterns; (20) uncertain political and economic conditions internationally; (21) the resolution of any litigation for or against the Company; and (22) the ability of the Company to generate taxable income in future periods in order to utilize and realize any quarterly tax benefits recorded.  Our actual results and condition could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.

InfoSonics has instituted in the past and continues to institute changes to its strategies, operations and processes to address these risk factors and to mitigate their impact on InfoSonics’ results of operations and financial condition. However, no assurances can be given that InfoSonics will be successful in these efforts. For a further discussion of significant factors to consider in connection with forward-looking statements concerning InfoSonics, reference is made to Item 1A Risk Factors of InfoSonics’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009; other risks or uncertainties may be detailed from time to time in InfoSonics’ future SEC filings.

InfoSonics Launches its First QWERTY Capacitive Touch Screen Product 

SAN DIEGO, May 31, 2012 – InfoSonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IFON) today announced the launch of its new verykool® i674 and i675 handsets.
“We are excited to release our newly designed model that has both a 2.8” capacitive touch screen and a QWERTY keypad,” said Joseph Ram, the company’s president and chief executive officer.  “This is our third product in a category we refer to as ‘smart feature phones,’ which also includes our previously released i725 and i285. These phones have many of the capabilities and feel of a smartphone, but without the high cost.  They have a graphical user interface, high quality touch screen, full internet navigation, e-mail and direct access to popular social media networks.  We are also planning to add a dedicated application store in the near future.  This new verykool® model has a superior mechanical design with a thickness of only 11 mm and an appealing finish.  It will be offered in two versions.  The i674 is a dual SIM version for the emerging markets within Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and the retail channel in Latin America.  The i675 is a single SIM version for operators mainly in Latin America.”
The Company noted the following additional details of the i674 and i675 handsets:

EDGE quad band (850/900/1800/1900)
Video recording and playback
Built-in FM radio and MP3 music player
Bluetooth, modem and USB data port
2MP camera
T-Flash memory expandable to 32GB (40MB embedded)
1000 mAh Li-ion battery
Speakerphone, 64 polyphonic ringtones, 3.5mm audio jack and stereo headset included

The verykool® i674 and i675 are available now.  To learn more about the device, visit our verykool® website at http://www.verykool.net/Products/i674.

Except for the factual statements made herein, the information contained in this news release consists of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.  Words and expressions reflecting optimism, satisfaction or disappointment with current prospects, as well as words such as “believes,” “hopes,” “intends,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “plans,” “anticipates” and variations thereof, or the use of future tense, identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and our actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, without limitation: (1) customer acceptance of the new i674 and i675 handsets; (2) our ability to continue to differentiate our products, including the i674 and i675, from the competition; (3) extended general economic downturn in world markets; (4) inability to secure adequate supply of competitive products on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; (5) inability to attract new sources of profitable business from expansion of products or services or risks associated with entry into new markets, including geographies, products and services; (6) significant changes in supplier terms and relationships or shortages in product supply; and (7) rapid product improvement and technological changes leading to changes in consumer demand for multimedia wireless handset products and features.  Reference is also made to other factors detailed from time to time in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date of this release.
