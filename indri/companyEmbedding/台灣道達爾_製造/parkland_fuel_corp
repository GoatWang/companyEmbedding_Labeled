CALGARY, Alberta--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Parkland Fuel Corporation (“Parkland”) (TSX:PKI), Canada’s largest and 
      one of North America's fastest growing independent marketers of fuel and 
      petroleum products, announced today the financial and operating results 
      for the three months ended June 30, 2017. All financial figures are 
      expressed in Canadian dollars.
    

      “Parkland consistently continues to deliver against its strategic plan. 
      Our second quarter results show organic volume growth across our entire 
      business with year over year adjusted EBITDA improvements in the 
      Parkland USA business and in our Retail Fuels business. Our Company 
      convenience-store channel experienced strong same-store sales growth of 
      6.0%, as a result of our ongoing marketing programs to improve our 
      offer. While volumes have been robust throughout the business we did see 
      margins soften in the wholesale business in our LPG and crude product 
      lines,” said Bob Espey, President and Chief Executive Officer at 
      Parkland. “On the acquisition front, we closed one of our most 
      significant acquisitions to date, the majority of the Canadian business 
      and assets of CST Brands, Inc., providing a large scale expansion into 
      Quebec and Atlantic Canada under the Ultramar brand, the most recognized 
      retail fuel brand in this region.”
    

      As a result of the closing of the acquisition of the majority of the 
      Canadian business and assets (the “CST Brands Canada Acquisition”) of 
      CST Brands, Inc. ("CST Brands Canada") from Alimentation Couche-Tard 
      Inc. ("Couche-Tard") in the second quarter, Parkland has increased its 
      2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $310 million to $340 million (“Revised 
      2017 Guidance Range”), see Additional Revised Guidance Considerations 
      section below.
    



KEY COMPONENTS OF PARKLAND’S STRATEGY – Q2 HIGHLIGHTS




GROW



        We achieved a 2.1% growth in volume, delivering approximately 2.6 
        billion litres of fuel and petroleum products in the second quarter of 
        2017, compared to 2.5 billion litres in the second quarter of 2016. 
        The volume increase was driven by growth in gas, diesel and propane 
        volumes in Commercial Fuels, and growth in gas and diesel volumes in 
        Retail Fuels and Parkland USA.
      

        Retail Fuels achieved an outstanding Company C-Store same-store sales 
        growth of 6.0% during the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the 
        second quarter of 2016, as a result of continued marketing efforts in 
        Parkland's convenience store offerings. The growth was observed across 
        both Western Canada and Eastern Canada.
      

        Commercial Fuels delivered 26% more propane than in the second quarter 
        of 2016 primarily due to strong organic growth efforts, the impact of 
        recent customer wins, and contributions from strategic business 
        acquisitions completed in 2016.
      


ACQUIRE



        On June 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the 
        Canadian business and assets of CST Brands Canada from Couche-Tard. 
        These businesses operate under a number of highly recognizable brands 
        including Ultramar, Dépanneur du Coin / Corner Store, Dépan Express / 
        ExpressMart and Pipeline Commercial.
      

        On April 18, 2017, Parkland announced it had entered into an agreement 
        with Chevron Canada Limited to acquire all of the outstanding shares 
        of Chevron Canada R & M ULC for US$1.1 billion plus working capital 
        (the "Chevron Canada Acquisition").
      


SUPPLY



        Supply and Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $17.8 million compared to 
        $23.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 primarily driven by 
        narrower margins, particularly in the crude and propane business.
      

        The Supply and Wholesale segment continued to drive higher propane 
        sales this quarter. Supply and Wholesale sold an additional 24 million 
        litres of propane in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the 
        second quarter of 2016.
      

        Diesel and biodiesel volumes in the Supply and Wholesale segment 
        increased by approximately 22% compared to the same quarter of 2016 as 
        a result of strong market share gains and strategic initiatives to 
        drive volume growth.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES




      Certain statements contained in this news release constitute 
      forward-looking information and statements (collectively, 
      “forward-looking statements”). When used in this news release, the words 
      “expect’’, ‘‘will’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘would’’, “well positioned,” ‘‘pursue’’ 
      and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
      statements. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking 
      statements with respect to, among other things, Revised 2017 Guidance 
      Range, the closing of the Chevron Canada Acquisition and the timing 
      thereof, the factors and assumptions that contribute to Parkland’s 2017 
      Revised Guidance Range, business objectives and growth strategies, the 
      strength of Parkland’s balance sheet and financial condition, sources of 
      growth, future acquisitions, capital expenditures, the anticipated 
      benefits and accretive effects of closed, announced and/or future 
      acquisitions, contribution of Distributable Cash Flow per Share from 
      acquisitions, and plans and objectives of or involving Parkland.
    

      These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events 
      to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking 
      statements. No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove 
      to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this news 
      release should not be unduly relied upon. These forward-looking 
      statements speak only as of the date of this news release. Parkland does 
      not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statements except as required by securities laws. Actual 
      results could differ materially from those anticipated in these 
      forward-looking statements as a result of numerous risks and 
      uncertainties including, but not limited to: failure to achieve the 
      results in the Revised 2017 Guidance Range, failure to close the Chevron 
      Canada Acquisition on the terms negotiated or at all, failure to achieve 
      the anticipated benefits of acquisitions (including but not limited to 
      the CST Brands Canada Acquisition and Chevron Canada Acquisition), 
      failure to obtain necessary regulatory or other third-party consents and 
      approvals required to complete announced acquisitions (including the 
      Chevron Canada Acquisition), failure to complete announced acquisitions 
      (including the Chevron Canada Acquisition), general economic, market and 
      business conditions, industry capacity, competitive action by other 
      companies, refining and marketing margins, the ability of suppliers to 
      meet commitments, actions by governmental authorities and other 
      regulators including increases in taxes, changes and developments in 
      environmental and other regulations, and other factors, many of which 
      are beyond the control of Parkland. See also the risks and uncertainties 
      described in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Information” and “Risk Factors” included in Parkland’s Annual 
      Information Form dated March 31, 2017, as filed on SEDAR and available 
      on Parkland’s website at www.parkland.ca.
    

Revised 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance considerations


      The Revised 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $310 million to $340 
      million includes growth scenarios that build off the 2016 Adjusted 
      EBITDA of $253.5 million and adds Adjusted EBITDA based on Parkland 
      management's estimate of how the business acquired in the CST Brands 
      Canada Acquisition will perform, whereby such estimate is based on prior 
      performance of the CST Brands Canada business. The Revised 2017 Adjusted 
      EBITDA guidance is also based on the assumption that general market 
      conditions, including but not limited to fuel margins and weather, will 
      remain the same for the remainder of 2017. Additionally, the lower end 
      of range accounts for potential adverse market conditions in Western 
      Canada and the Northern U.S. and the higher range accounts for 
      contributions from synergies relating to prior acquisitions and Parkland 
      achieving its previously disclosed average annual organic growth goal of 
      3-5%. The guidance does not include the Adjusted EBITDA impact of the 
      Chevron Canada Acquisition. Refer to this press release and Parkland’s 
      press release issued on March 2, 2017 on SEDAR at www.sedar.com 
      for more information.
    

Financial Measures


      This news release refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures that are 
      not determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
      Standards (“IFRS”). Distributable Cash Flow, Distributable Cash Flow per 
      Share, Adjusted Distributable Cash Flow, Adjusted Distributable Cash 
      Flow per Share, Dividend Payout Ratio, Adjusted Dividend Payout Ratio, 
      and Fuel and Petroleum Product Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures 
      recognized under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed 
      by IFRS. Management considers these measures to be important 
      supplemental measures of Parkland’s performance and believes these 
      measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other 
      interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industries. See 
      Section 6 of the Q2 2017 MD&A for a reconciliation of distributable cash 
      flow to cash flow from operating activities, the IFRS measure most 
      directly comparable to distributable cash flow. See Section 12 of the Q2 
      2017 MD&A for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and their 
      reconciliations.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are measures of segment 
      profit. See Section 12 of the Q2 2017 MD&A and Note 14 of the Interim 
      Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of these measures 
      of segment profit. Investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment 
      and the reasons Parkland considers it appropriate for supplemental 
      analysis.
    

      Investors are cautioned, however, that these measures should not be 
      construed as an alternative to net earnings determined in accordance 
      with IFRS as an indication of Parkland’s performance. The 
      forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly 
      qualified by this cautionary statement.

	How Parkland Fuel Corp. became Canada’s largest independent fuel distributor    
Large integrated oil companies no longer see the marketing of fuel as a strategic necessity

       By       Anthony A. Davis

For years, Jack Donald walked around with a mutilated penny in his pocket.
In 1975, with his wife Joan, the wily former mechanic and Petroleum Hall of Famer bought the controlling share of Parkland Beef industries, a 5,000-head cattle feedlot in Lacombe, Alberta. The Donalds, veering from bovines to fuel soon after, created the beginnings of what is now Parkland Fuel Corp., known now for its green-and-gold Fas Gas Plus stations and related Short Stop convenience stores sprinkled across Western Canada.
Donald, now 78 and still running his own property company, was president and CEO of Parkland Fuel Corp. from 1977 to 2001. He had hack-sawed a one-quarter-sized wedge out of that penny. The remaining disc of copper left behind was his symbolic peace-maker with consumers rankled by the high price of g asoline at the time. He took that coin to service clubs and other meetings around Alberta explaining that the remaining three-quarters of a cent represented the puny profit Parkland, headquartered in Red Deer, was making on each liter of gas it sold then. At the time, says Donald, Canadian consumers were complaining fuel distributors “were ripping them off.”
Complaints about fuel prices haven’t changed much since, but Parkland, now the country’s largest independent fuel distributor and marketer, with a market cap of $1.25 billion, certainly has.

Regardless of what miffed motorists were saying then and still say today, margins on the retail end of the oil business – the service stations and bulk fuel distributors who supply trucking fleets and the like – have always been notoriously slim. (Today, though, it ranges between six and eight cents per liter for gasoline.) And few industries compete as fiercely for such narrow profits, says Parkland’s current CEO, Bob Espey. “Retail fuel is probably one of the most competitive markets, because you have full price transparency,” he says. “Where else do you drive down the street and see the price of a product multiple times during the day?”
While not yet as obvious in Canada as elsewhere in the world, integrated oil companies – behemoths like Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil – have been rapidly closing or divesting themselves of their gas stations. The days where the major oil companies had wellhead to gas tank vertical integration are coming to an end. For the majors, the big money is in the upstream (finding and producing oil and gas) and midstream (refining) end of the oil business. Retail is, profit-wise, a poor cousin and a headache.
In 1989, there were more than 20,000 pumps across Canada. At the end of 2012, there were 12,285, according to MJ Ervin & Associates. Shell Canada Ltd. recently sold all of its service stations and convenience store operations east of Montreal, for example. Just 14 per cent of Canada’s gas stations are directly price-controlled by major oil companies, a two per cent drop from three years ago.
Retailing fuel has never been a core competency of big oil. Now they are getting out, explains Michael Ervin, president of the Calgary-based consultancy, “because integrated oil companies no longer see the marketing of fuel as a strategic necessity. They used to see it as a necessity when refineries were operating at far less than their optimal or full capacities. In that kind of operating environment, having a built-in, integrated marketing asset was providing an assured market for a lot of refinery production. That is no longer the case because refineries are operating at close to 100 per cent capacity.”
“Where else do you drive down the street and see the price of a product multiple times during the day?”
Though not particularly well known as a corporate entity, Parkland, with 1,179 employees around the country, has excelled at competing in this niche, growing into Canada’s largest independent fuel distributor and marketer. According to its 2012 annual report, 78 billion liters of fuel were sold in Canada last year. Parkland captured 5.2 per cent of that market.
Last year, through the 720 Fas Gas, Race Trac and Esso stations it now either owns or are dealer-operated around the country, Parkland Industries (renamed as Parkland Fuel Corp. at the end of 2010) pumped 1.8 billion liters of gasoline into motorists’ vehicles. Add the 1.5 billion liters of mostly diesel Parkland pumped into trucks and fleets through cardlocks and bulk fuel delivery, another 1.3 billion in home heating oil, propane and other fuels supplied around the country, and Parkland supplied Canadians with 4.6 billion liters of liquid energy. That earned the company $437 million in gross profits on $4.1 billion in operating revenue in 2012. It paid out $67.8 million in dividends to investors, a 12 per cent increase over the previous year.
Parkland has been impressing analysts with its high-octane performance. Calling its Q1 results “a big beat” on his forecasts, CIBC World Markets analyst Kevin Chiang praised Parkland for its well-disciplined and well-timed growth strategy, which has only accelerated as of late. Parkland has been seizing on a trend: The big boys are getting out of the service station business.

Espey is a former naval officer with an MBA from the Ivey School of Business who took over as Parkland’s CEO two years ago. He calls the downstream end of the oil business Parkland’s “sandbox.” It’s a place where Parkland plays better than the big kids in the oil business, who have by and large decided there are better places to deploy their capital than gas stations. Another thing about the major oil companies, adds Espey, is “the more they have to do detailed things with customers, the less that fits within their operating model. So that’s where we can come in. We can take it over. It’s our space.”






Parkland, says Espey, wants to be big oil’s distributor of choice when it comes to selling their end products, gasoline, diesel, bulk fuels, propane and lubricants. To that end, says the CIBC’s Chiang, Parkland has been busy buying up retail outlets and other fuel distribution channels around the country. “They have been a leader to consolidate this market. And despite what every company says, that they are disciplined in acquisitions and that they don’t want to pay too much, I would argue that Parkland has been quite successful in being disciplined around its acquisition strategy.”
Unlike branded dealer-owned service stations (think Shell, Petro-Canada and Chevron stations) who have to buy their fuel at fixed prices from a single supplier, Parkland is free to shop around and look for the best deals. Though it also now owns 24 Esso stations and supplies another 349 Esso dealers, Parkland buys fuel for them and its other holdings from every refiner in the country. It gives Parkland negotiating power with suppliers like Suncor, Exxon and Shell.
Retailing fuel has never been a core competency of big oil. Now they are getting out.
With its growing infrastructure, he adds, Parkland can solve refiners’ distribution issues better than other independent fuel marketers. It’s one of the only independents with its own storage terminals. And thanks to the $80-million purchase last December of Elbow River Marketing Limited, it has a fleet of 1,200 rail cars, some now being used to bypass the bottleneck in pipelines and ship crude for oil sands refiners, and extending Parkland’s supply capability in North America.
Well capitalized, and continuing to grow its brands, gas stations aren’t Parkland’s only channels of distribution. Aside from the familiar retail channel, the Fas Gas, Race Trac, Esso and some other lesser known branded stations such as Cango and Sunys in the east, Parkland has a bulk-fuel channel. It supplies home-heating fuels, propane, and, primarily, diesel to card-lock type trucking operations, fleets and even ships on the west coast through 119 commercial locations. Parkland is Shell’s largest distributor of branded diesel in Canada and the largest distributor of Shell-branded lubricants in North America. Parkland also has a wholesale channel supplying 100 other independent dealers with diesel, gasoline, propane, home heating oil and other products.
On May 13, Parkland made its first foray into Quebec, assuming the customers and assets of TransMontaigne Marketing Canada Inc. from financial services giant Morgan Stanley. That enhanced Parkland’s strategic supply infrastructure in central Canada. Says Espey, “We like to say our objective is to have a material supply advantage over any other independent in the marketplace.”
Parkland also has an advantage over other independents in that it supplies diesel and gasoline products, rather than just one or the other. The big-box retailers with stations, such as Costco and Safeway, focus on gas. A large independent like UFA, with mainly agricultural customers, focuses on diesel. “We come in and we have a very balanced barrel, and refiners like to produce both,” Espey says.
Last year Espey unveiled a five-year growth strategy called the Penny Plan, which, if successful, would increase Parkland’s fuel sales to seven billion liters of fuel a year and capture 10 per cent of the Canadian market by 2016. It would also, through improved operational efficiencies and increased economies of scale, save Parkland one cent per liter in costs. That could create $70 million in savings if Parkland reaches its sales goal in three years.
Still running through the company is the ethos of Jack Donald, who pulled Parkland into the fuel business and built it into a major company with only a high school degree, his mechanics certificate, and the kind of hard-earned experience that got a lot of oil under his fingernails. Now, as Parkland penetrates even more markets throughout the country, Donald looks at the company and says, “I am very proud of it. It turned out very well.” Parkland has merely been scaling up a strategy started by Donald, who built up the company and its Fas Gas brand both organically by building new stations, but also by buying up small independent stations and converting them over to Parkland brands.
“We are known in the industry in Canada as the go-to guys if you want to sell your business, so we do get unsolicited requests,” Espey says. “Ultimately everything is for sale.”
What’s in a name?

The first Fas Gas station was established in Red Deer in 1977 when a small station Jack Donald bought through his own private company two years earlier was traded to what was then called Parkland Industries Ltd. in exchange for shares. Donald got the Fas Gas name while on holidays in Texas and from his motel room balcony saw an abandoned gas station with the name on it. Liking the name and finding it wasn’t registered in Canada when he got back, he copyrighted it.
In those early days in Red Deer, when other stations closed at 7 p.m., Fas Gas stayed open until 11 p.m. In its constant search for an edge, Fas Gas, taking on municipal fire commissioners that argued it would be dangerous, had the first self-service pumps in Alberta. It also had the first keylock pumps.

Parkland Fuel Corporation (“Parkland”)

-1.92%


, Canada’s largest and 
      one of North America's fastest growing independent marketers of fuel and 
      petroleum products, announced today the financial and operating results 
      for the three months ended June 30, 2017. All financial figures are 
      expressed in Canadian dollars.


                                        








“Parkland consistently continues to deliver against its strategic plan. 
      Our second quarter results show organic volume growth across our entire 
      business with year over year adjusted EBITDA improvements in the 
      Parkland USA business and in our Retail Fuels business. Our Company 
      convenience-store channel experienced strong same-store sales growth of 
      6.0%, as a result of our ongoing marketing programs to improve our 
      offer. While volumes have been robust throughout the business we did see 
      margins soften in the wholesale business in our LPG and crude product 
      lines,” said Bob Espey, President and Chief Executive Officer at 
      Parkland. “On the acquisition front, we closed one of our most 
      significant acquisitions to date, the majority of the Canadian business 
      and assets of CST Brands, Inc., providing a large scale expansion into 
      Quebec and Atlantic Canada under the Ultramar brand, the most recognized 
      retail fuel brand in this region.”


                                        








As a result of the closing of the acquisition of the majority of the 
      Canadian business and assets (the “CST Brands Canada Acquisition”) of 
      CST Brands, Inc. ("CST Brands Canada") from Alimentation Couche-Tard 
      Inc. ("Couche-Tard") in the second quarter, Parkland has increased its 
      2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $310 million to $340 million (“Revised 
      2017 Guidance Range”), see Additional Revised Guidance Considerations 
      section below.


                                        



KEY COMPONENTS OF PARKLAND’S STRATEGY – Q2 HIGHLIGHTS




GROW












        We achieved a 2.1% growth in volume, delivering approximately 2.6 
        billion litres of fuel and petroleum products in the second quarter of 
        2017, compared to 2.5 billion litres in the second quarter of 2016. 
        The volume increase was driven by growth in gas, diesel and propane 
        volumes in Commercial Fuels, and growth in gas and diesel volumes in 
        Retail Fuels and Parkland USA.
      

                                    











        Retail Fuels achieved an outstanding Company C-Store same-store sales 
        growth of 6.0% during the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the 
        second quarter of 2016, as a result of continued marketing efforts in 
        Parkland's convenience store offerings. The growth was observed across 
        both Western Canada and Eastern Canada.
      

                                    











        Commercial Fuels delivered 26% more propane than in the second quarter 
        of 2016 primarily due to strong organic growth efforts, the impact of 
        recent customer wins, and contributions from strategic business 
        acquisitions completed in 2016.
      

                                    



ACQUIRE












        On June 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the 
        Canadian business and assets of CST Brands Canada from Couche-Tard. 
        These businesses operate under a number of highly recognizable brands 
        including Ultramar, Dépanneur du Coin / Corner Store, Dépan Express / 
        ExpressMart and Pipeline Commercial.
      

                                    











        On April 18, 2017, Parkland announced it had entered into an agreement 
        with Chevron Canada Limited to acquire all of the outstanding shares 
        of Chevron Canada R & M ULC for US$1.1 billion plus working capital 
        (the "Chevron Canada Acquisition").
      

                                    



SUPPLY












        Supply and Wholesale Adjusted EBITDA was $17.8 million compared to 
        $23.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 primarily driven by 
        narrower margins, particularly in the crude and propane business.
      

                                    











        The Supply and Wholesale segment continued to drive higher propane 
        sales this quarter. Supply and Wholesale sold an additional 24 million 
        litres of propane in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the 
        second quarter of 2016.
      

                                    











        Diesel and biodiesel volumes in the Supply and Wholesale segment 
        increased by approximately 22% compared to the same quarter of 2016 as 
        a result of strong market share gains and strategic initiatives to 
        drive volume growth.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES











Certain statements contained in this news release constitute 
      forward-looking information and statements (collectively, 
      “forward-looking statements”). When used in this news release, the words 
      “expect’’, ‘‘will’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘would’’, “well positioned,” ‘‘pursue’’ 
      and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking 
      statements. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking 
      statements with respect to, among other things, Revised 2017 Guidance 
      Range, the closing of the Chevron Canada Acquisition and the timing 
      thereof, the factors and assumptions that contribute to Parkland’s 2017 
      Revised Guidance Range, business objectives and growth strategies, the 
      strength of Parkland’s balance sheet and financial condition, sources of 
      growth, future acquisitions, capital expenditures, the anticipated 
      benefits and accretive effects of closed, announced and/or future 
      acquisitions, contribution of Distributable Cash Flow per Share from 
      acquisitions, and plans and objectives of or involving Parkland.


                                        








These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events 
      to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking 
      statements. No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove 
      to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this news 
      release should not be unduly relied upon. These forward-looking 
      statements speak only as of the date of this news release. Parkland does 
      not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statements except as required by securities laws. Actual 
      results could differ materially from those anticipated in these 
      forward-looking statements as a result of numerous risks and 
      uncertainties including, but not limited to: failure to achieve the 
      results in the Revised 2017 Guidance Range, failure to close the Chevron 
      Canada Acquisition on the terms negotiated or at all, failure to achieve 
      the anticipated benefits of acquisitions (including but not limited to 
      the CST Brands Canada Acquisition and Chevron Canada Acquisition), 
      failure to obtain necessary regulatory or other third-party consents and 
      approvals required to complete announced acquisitions (including the 
      Chevron Canada Acquisition), failure to complete announced acquisitions 
      (including the Chevron Canada Acquisition), general economic, market and 
      business conditions, industry capacity, competitive action by other 
      companies, refining and marketing margins, the ability of suppliers to 
      meet commitments, actions by governmental authorities and other 
      regulators including increases in taxes, changes and developments in 
      environmental and other regulations, and other factors, many of which 
      are beyond the control of Parkland. See also the risks and uncertainties 
      described in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Information” and “Risk Factors” included in Parkland’s Annual 
      Information Form dated March 31, 2017, as filed on SEDAR and available 
      on Parkland’s website at         www.parkland.ca

Revised 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance considerations









The Revised 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $310 million to $340 
      million includes growth scenarios that build off the 2016 Adjusted 
      EBITDA of $253.5 million and adds Adjusted EBITDA based on Parkland 
      management's estimate of how the business acquired in the CST Brands 
      Canada Acquisition will perform, whereby such estimate is based on prior 
      performance of the CST Brands Canada business. The Revised 2017 Adjusted 
      EBITDA guidance is also based on the assumption that general market 
      conditions, including but not limited to fuel margins and weather, will 
      remain the same for the remainder of 2017. Additionally, the lower end 
      of range accounts for potential adverse market conditions in Western 
      Canada and the Northern U.S. and the higher range accounts for 
      contributions from synergies relating to prior acquisitions and Parkland 
      achieving its previously disclosed average annual organic growth goal of 
      3-5%. The guidance does not include the Adjusted EBITDA impact of the 
      Chevron Canada Acquisition. Refer to this press release and Parkland’s 
      press release issued on March 2, 2017 on SEDAR at         www.sedar.com
 
      for more information.


                                        

Financial Measures









This news release refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures that are 
      not determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
      Standards (“IFRS”). Distributable Cash Flow, Distributable Cash Flow per 
      Share, Adjusted Distributable Cash Flow, Adjusted Distributable Cash 
      Flow per Share, Dividend Payout Ratio, Adjusted Dividend Payout Ratio, 
      and Fuel and Petroleum Product Adjusted Gross Profit are not measures 
      recognized under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed 
      by IFRS. Management considers these measures to be important 
      supplemental measures of Parkland’s performance and believes these 
      measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other 
      interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industries. See 
      Section 6 of the Q2 2017 MD&A for a reconciliation of distributable cash 
      flow to cash flow from operating activities, the IFRS measure most 
      directly comparable to distributable cash flow. See Section 12 of the Q2 
      2017 MD&A for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and their 
      reconciliations.


                                        








Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are measures of segment 
      profit. See Section 12 of the Q2 2017 MD&A and Note 14 of the Interim 
      Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of these measures 
      of segment profit. Investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment 
      and the reasons Parkland considers it appropriate for supplemental 
      analysis.


                                        








Investors are cautioned, however, that these measures should not be 
      construed as an alternative to net earnings determined in accordance 
      with IFRS as an indication of Parkland’s performance. The 
      forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly 
      qualified by this cautionary statement.

Canada's Parkland Fuel Acquires 393 Gas Stations
Pioneer Energy purchase boosts footprint to 1,000-plus locations.

September 18, 2014, 04:49 pm



 



ALBERTA, Canada — Parkland Fuel Corp. is expanding its reach in Ontario by acquiring the assets of Pioneer Energy for $378 million.
Pioneer's network of 393 gas stations includes 152 company-operated and 241 independent dealer stations. With the definitive agreement, Parkland adds 319 gas stations in Ontario and 74 gas stations in Manitoba, increasing its national footprint to more than 1,000 gas stations, or roughly 9 percent of the Canadian retail fuel market.
In addition, the deal includes 148 Pioneer-branded and 228 Esso-branded gas stations, many of which are in prime urban locations.
"We have long recognized the Ontario retail marketplace as a critical growth opportunity for Parkland, aligning with Parkland's overarching supply strategy. We also recognize Pioneer Energy as one of Canada's most respected independent retail fuel marketers, having built Pioneer into the strongest independent retail fuel brand in Ontario. Given The Pioneer Group's sophisticated understanding of the retail fuel industry, their investment in Parkland is a strong endorsement of our strategy, and we look forward to welcoming their team," said Bob Espey, president and CEO of Parkland.

Pioneer distributes more than 2 billion liters of fuel annually through its 393 gas stations and a recently acquired commercial operation in Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Pioneer currently distributes 5.1 percent of the total retail fuel volume across Canada and has a 12-percent share of the Ontario and Manitoba retail gas markets.
The acquisition price tag, which is in Canadian dollars, includes $259 million in cash, $119 million in common shares of Parkland, and the assumption of standard operating liabilities.
Integration of Pioneer operations into Parkland's portfolio is expected to occur over the course of 24 months.
Pioneer is jointly owned by The Pioneer Group Inc. and Suncor Energy Inc. As part of the definitive agreement, The Pioneer Group will receive $76 million or 39 percent of its total consideration in cash, and $119 million or 61 percent of its total consideration in common shares of Parkland. One-third of the common shares held by The Pioneer Group will be subject to a one-year minimum holding period, and the remaining two-thirds are subject to a two-year minimum holding period. Suncor Energy Inc. will receive $183 million in cash.
Tim Hogarth, CEO and executive chairman of Pioneer, is expected to be appointed to Parkland's board of directors upon completion of the deal.
"I want to thank everyone in the Pioneer family for their tremendous work and dedication over the years in making Pioneer a great success and one of Canada`s most respected independent fuel marketers," Hogarth said. "The Pioneer Group chose to invest the majority of its proceeds in Parkland because of our long-term industry commitment and belief in Parkland's ability to continue its aggressive growth path."

Including this acquisition, Parkland has successfully added 6 billion liters in petroleum volume, $115 million in annualized EBITDA through acquisitions and their associated synergies, and $11 million from the Give Me Five! initiative since 2011. With the Pioneer acquisition, Parkland is expected to attain its goal to add $125 million in additional adjusted EBITDA by 2015, a full year earlier than expected.
"Our five-year growth plan has progressed rapidly as a result of our team's ability to identify and execute disciplined transactions. We continue to anticipate additional accretive acquisitions, adhering to our disciplined approach to growth," Espey said.
