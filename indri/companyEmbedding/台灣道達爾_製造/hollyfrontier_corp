Our subsidiaries manufacture and market wholesale gasoline, diesel and ethanol-blended transportation fuels supplying automobiles, light trucks, aircrafts, trains and heavy equipment.

We manufacture and market asphalt and other heavy products at our five refineries and at our asphalt terminals in Arizona and New Mexico.  Our subsidiaries also manufacture and market lubricants and specialty products.  Our Petro-Canada Lubricants business produces more than 350 automotive, industrial and food grade lubricants and greases, base and process oils and specialty fluids sold worldwide.
