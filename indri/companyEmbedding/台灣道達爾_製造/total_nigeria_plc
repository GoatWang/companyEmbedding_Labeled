	Total in Nigeria


About us

	Total Nigeria Plc is a Marketing and Services subsidiary of Total; a multinational energy company operating in more than 130 countries and committed to providing sustainable products and services for its customers. For over 50 years, Total Nigeria Plc has remained the leader in the downstream sector of the Nigerian oil and gas industry with an extensive distribution network of over 500 service stations nationwide and a wide range of top quality energy products and services. TOTAL NIGERIA PLC (RC 1396) was incorporated as a private company on June 1, 1956 to market petroleum products in Nigeria. In September 11, 2001, the company had a successful merger which paved way for sustainable growth and continuous development. The share capital of the company after the merger is presently =N=169,761,000 made up of 50k ordinary shares authorised and fully paid up with Nigerian Citizens and Associations holding 38.28% of the share capital.

	Our Mission Statement

	Total Nigeria Plc is in business to ensure total customer satisfaction by the creation of quality products and services delivered with a strong commitment to safety and respect for the environment and the sustainable   development of resources

	Consistent Growth

	TOTAL Nigeria Plc commissioned its first Filling Station at Herbert Macaulay Street, Yaba, Lagos in 1956. Since then, the ever-increasing demand for convenient accessibility to petroleum products and services as well as the need to be closer to its customers made Total Nigeria Plc to invest in its network of over 500 service stations, 19 customer service centers, numerous industrial outlets, 5 depots, distribution plants and warehouses with high safety standards spread across the Western, Northern, and Eastern territories in Nigeria.  To satisfy the evolving needs of its customers, the company developed a ‘one-stop centre’ strategy whereby a variety of customers’ needs are met in one place, TOTAL service stations. Therefore, in addition to receiving premium customer service from service attendants, customers could purchase petroleum products, conveniently shop at Café Bonjour shops, and receive premium car maintenance and care services from our Auto Express and Auto Clean Deluxe Services. 

	In addition, the Company meets its corporate customers demand for bulk products through its Vendor Management Service. In order to maintain and consolidate its unique position in the oil and gas industry, the Company established three Lubricants Blending Plants at Koko in Delta State, Kaduna in Kaduna State and Apapa in Lagos State. It also invested in the bottling of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and has 5 LPG bottling plants strategically located in different parts of the country with a coastal storage in Apapa, Lagos. Due to the versatile, fast, clean, powerful, portable and most importantly, very safe nature of TOTAL Nigeria’s Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), it is in high demand in many homes and industrial concerns in the country.

	TOTAL Nigeria Plc, with the support of Air Total International (incorporated in Switzerland), is well established as one of the major suppliers of Aviation fuel to the Aviation Industry in Nigeria. Indeed, it is currently one of the two largest suppliers of JET A1 fuel in Nigeria today, offering excellent fuelling services at Lagos Airports (domestic and international), Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt Airports. 

	The Company has over 470 employees with which it enjoys a cordial management / staff relationship built over the years through progressive welfare and staff development schemes.  At the heart of the TOTAL Nigeria Plc’s core value is the Group's unwavering commitment to top quality products and safety of the environment and people

	The clear market leader

	Today, TOTAL NIGERIA PLC is a leader as well as the symbol of good service in the downstream sector of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. The Company maintains excellent corporate relations with the general public and investors' confidence in its performance is tremendous as depicted by the pricing of its share, which is highly sought after, in the Nigerian Stock Exchange. 

	Because TOTAL knows that building and sustaining trust is more important than ever in today’s global business environment, the company strives to conduct its businesses in a manner that reflects its passion for top quality products, customer service, Health, Safety and Environment. Little wonder why many people choose Total every day, it’s a matter of trust.

	HSEQ





Our commitment to safety
Total Nigeria Plc is committed to the highest standards of Health, Safety, Environment and Quality in its operations. This commitment is to the prevention of accidents to personnel and property, damage to the environment, product contamination, delayed deliveries, under deliveries in compliance with Statutory legislation and the Group's Health, Safety, Environment and Quality charters.
 
Total Nigeria's HSEQ Policy
Our HSEQ Policy is the foundation and driving force for the entire safety program. Total Nigeria's commitment to ensure health and safety of people, protection of the environment and quality delivery of our products is clearly stated in our HSEQ policy commitment.
 
Adoption of ISSSRS For Its Safety Management System (SMS)
Total Nigeria Plc has adopted the International Small Site Safety Rating System (ISSSRS) for its safety management system.  The ISSSRS is employed to measure the performance of the safety management system. The implementation of the ISSSRS has been successful. This success is evident in the safety performance records at certified sites, the growing number of certified sites implementing the program, and the commendable performance in the periodic DNV (Det Norske Veritas) audits. In Total Nigeria Plc the first deployment of the ISSSRS was at Apapa terminal in 2003 and the first baseline audit was carried out by DNV auditor in November 2004. The terminal was rated level 3 on a scale of 0 to 4, where 4 represents the highest level. This achievement was well beyond the initial target of level 2 towards which all actions had been geared at this initial stage. The company has made remarkable progress since then, achieving level 3 for Ibafon depot and Koko Plant in 2007. Recertification audits have since followed and in 2008, Apapa was rated level 4, while Ibafon and Koko maintained their level 3.
 
 
Other depots and facilities which have been audited by DNV include: the Joint Users Hydrant Installation (JUHI), which became certified at level 3 in 2005, then level 4 in 2008; the Joint Aviation Depot (JAD), Abuja which has been rated level 3 in its baseline audit in 2008 and Joint Aviation Depot (JAD), Port Harcourt which made a new entry to the ISSSRS program in 2011 and was rated level 2. The company now has six of her sites that are ISSSRS-certified and is closer to the target of adopting the ISSSRS for all its major facilities.
 
Environmental Impact Reduction
In 2012, our Lagos Plant and Apapa depot were certified to the ISO 14001:2004 standard making Total Nigeria Plc the first and only company in the downstream Oil sector in Nigeria to obtain such certification. As a demonstration of Total Nigeria Plc's commitment to environmental stewardship and the attainment of our sustainable development objectives, the scope of ISO 14001: 2004 certification will be expanded to cover more sites and facilities.
 
Contractors Monitoring
Total Nigeria Plc is committed to safety and environmental protection in its workplace as such Total expects contractors working on our sites to perform to the same high safety and environmental protection standards required of Total Nigeria employees.  Contractors' employee accounts for at least 60% of the total man-hours worked. To ensure that contractors are qualified for the work they are to perform and work to prevent accidents, the controls in place includes careful contractor's selection, analysis of information supplied in bidding process, contractor appraisals, risk assessments/analysis of the job, joint prevention plan, supervision and monitoring of contractors when working onsite, planned inspection of project site, weekly reports from project engineer, assessments and feedback.  Also a CONTRACTOR SAFETY POLICY has been deployed as part of the process to improve contractors' safety performance and ensure continuous improvement.
 
Safety Performance Indicators
The priority focus of Total Nigeria Plc is to reduce all categories of incidents using direct and indirect promotional approach such as safety awareness, road safety campaign, training, deployment of procedures, development of safety information program (Safety Handbook), inspections and tours, and the evaluation of safety performance on a regular basis.

Total Nigeria Plc has signed a Solar Home Solution distribution agreement with Blackbit Limited. This solar product distribution partnership is aimed at facilitating seamless nationwide access to solar energy products to bridge the energy gap in homes and optimally ensure customer satisfaction.
This partnership will enable Blackbit distribute Solar Home Solutions from the TOTAL Energy Solutions brand in outlets in Abuja and Lagos.
TOTAL Solar Home Solutions is a solar inverter kit that comprises our high quality panels from SUNPOWER, one of the world renowned manufacturers of the most efficient Solar Panels. These panels come with a 25 year warranty but have an expected lifespan of over 40 years, a solar inverter (5 years warranty) and batteries of premium quality.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Managing Director of Total Nigeria, Jean-Philippe Torres, expressed his joy over the development saying he was pleased with the partnership as this provides a channel for Nigerians to have easy access to reliable Solar Energy Solutions.
“Satisfying our unique customer needs is very important to TOTAL, which is why TOTAL is dedicated to continuous investment in research and innovation in pursuit of developing renewable energy products and services of the highest quality. This pursuit has led to the development of the Solar Energy Solutions from the TOTAL Energy Solutions brand, tailored to meet a wide range of home energy needs. Total Nigeria Plc is glad to be partnering with Blackbit Limited to make our quality Solar Home Solutions even more accessible and look forward to a fruitful relationship,” he said.(c)  2017 The Sun Publishing Limited.
