Puma Launches New European Away Kits
Feb 11 16
PUMA announced that it has launched the new European away kits for Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The five kits will be worn at the European Championships 2016 in France this summer, after all teams successfully qualified in November. All new away kits will debut on pitch in international friendlies next month as the teams prepare for the big tournament. Stepping away from Switzerland's traditional away designs of previous years, the new kit shows off a new and unique design. The shirt body features a horizontal stripe pattern that starts with the bold red chest band, which has the Swiss white cross placed centrally. Red horizontal stripes continue underneath the chest band, gradually thinning out down the shirt. The shirt's style is completed with further red detailing such as a contemporary red V-neck collar and red panelling on the sleeves. The shirt features the PUMA Cat on the right of the chest and the SFA badge is placed over the heart. The kit is completed with white shorts and white socks with red stripes to match the bold shirt. With a contemporary take on a heritage look inspired by the company and the OFB's longstanding history, the white shirt features black details including a V-neck collar and Form Stripe panels inserted along the sleeves and sleeve cuffs. The OFB badge is inserted over the heart and the PUMA Cat is placed on the right side. The kit is completed with black shorts featuring white Form Stripes on either side, and matching black and white socks. The Czech Republic's new away shirt design remains classic in white with understated royal blue detailing on the hem, collar and Form Stripe panels along the sleeves. The Form Stripe continues down on the shorts, creating a sleek appearance. The body of the shirt features tonal horizontal embossed hoops, which add a subtle hint of style to the overall sleek look. The PUMA logo and FACR badge are located on the left and right side of the chest, adding subtle red detail to the all white and blue kit. The new away kit looks sleek and modern in royal blue, paired with lighter blue Form Stripe panels which run along the sleeves and continue down through the matching shorts. Featuring a crew neck collar with the tape shaped off at the front centre, the shirt has a classic feel. The shirt also includes a vertical tonal striped pattern, which subtly enhances the overall design. The Slovak 'Coat of Arms' badge is placed over the heart to reflect the passion and pride of the Slovak football fans, whilst the SFZ logo and the PUMA Cat logo are positioned right and centrally on the chest. All new home shirts feature PUMA's new apparel technology ACTV Thermo-R, strategically inserted in both the front and the back of the shirt to help players maintain an optimum body temperature. A unique phase-change material is injected into the shirts' inner athletic tape which allows microcapsules to absorb excess heat and release it back to the body when needed. The taping in the shirts provides an extra snug fit, micro-massaging the skin in specific areas to enable a faster, more effective energy supply to the active muscles.

Key market statistics:

Terminals: 2
Storage capacity: 21,500m³
Retail sites: 57
Airports: 3

As with all markets that we enter, Zambia is seeing a rapid growth of oil consumption. As such, we are successfully growing our B2B portfolios in Zambia by providing fuels, lubricants and other oil products to key clients in sectors such as mining and transportation. We are bolstering our provision of services to the aviation industry; we are a trusted supplier of avgas and jet fuel in Zambia. We also operate one of the largest privately owned oil products storage facilities in the country. Our two terminals provide a storage capacity of 21,500m³.
We have expanded our retail network and we currently have 57 retail sites.
Several Puma Energy Foundation projects were implemented in Zambia, including Alive and Kicking – a social entrepreneurial project for local women who helped stitch more than 4,000 footballs, which were then sold in Puma Energy service stations.
We educate our drivers in road safety; spread awareness through initiatives such as our road safety radio show in Zambia; support national road safety campaigns; and use the latest tracking technology to improve driver behaviour.
