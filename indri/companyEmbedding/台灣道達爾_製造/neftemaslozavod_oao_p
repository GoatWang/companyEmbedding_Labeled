The structure and volume of lubricant production in Russia and CIS countries are analyzed. It is noted that the share of obsolescent lubricants is still quite high, and restoration of the lubricant range is occurring slowly. Steps are proposed for providing industrial branches with highly effective new lubricants.Key wordsplastic lubricant lubricant range lithium lubricants calcium lubricants lubricants based on inorganic thickeners hydrocarbon lubricants Translated from Khimiya i Tekhnologiya Topliv i Masel, No. 1, pp. 3 – 6, January – February, 2012.Copyright information© Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2012Authors and AffiliationsI. A. Lyubinin11.YkrNIINP “MASMA”KievBelarus
