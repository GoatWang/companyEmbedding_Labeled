BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, July 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Petrobras Argentina S.A. (the "Company") announced today the early tender results of the previously announced offer to purchase for cash (the "Offer") any and all of the Company's outstanding 5.875% Series S Notes due 2017 (CUSIP Nos. 71646J AB5 / P7873P AD8; ISIN Nos. US71646JAB52 / USP7873PAD89) (the "Notes") pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Company's Offer to Purchase dated July 6, 2016 (the "Offer to Purchase").  The early tender deadline for the Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 19, 2016 (the "Early Tender Deadline"). 








As of the Early Tender Deadline, U.S.$208,037,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes were validly tendered and not withdrawn, representing 69.35% of the total principal amount of Notes outstanding. The Company has accepted such Notes for purchase and will pay the Holders thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer. Such Holders will receive U.S.$1,041.25 for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted (the "Total Consideration") plus accrued and unpaid interest in respect of their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the Early Payment Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). The Total Consideration includes a payment of U.S.$30 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Early Tender Payment"). The Company expects the Early Payment Date to be July 25, 2016. 
Holders of Notes who still wish to participate in the Offer must tender their Notes by 11:59 P.M., New York City time on August 2, 2016, unless the offer is extended or earlier terminated (the "Expiration Time"). Such Holders will only receive the tender offer consideration of U.S.$1,011.25 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Notes (the "Tender Offer Consideration"), which is equal to the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment, plus accrued and unpaid interest in respect of their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the Final Payment Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). 
The Offer will expire at the Expiration Time.  Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline may not be withdrawn, unless required by law.
NEITHER THE OFFER TO PURCHASE NOR ANY RELATED DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, NOR HAVE ANY SUCH DOCUMENTS BEEN FILED WITH OR REVIEWED BY ANY FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY COUNTRY OUTSIDE ARGENTINA. NO AUTHORITY HAS PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THE OFFER TO PURCHASE OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENTS, AND IT IS UNLAWFUL AND MAY BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY.

The Company has engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to act as Dealer Managers in connection with the Offer.  Global Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as Information Agent and Tender Agent for the Offer.  Any questions or requests for assistance regarding the Offer to Purchase may be directed to Citigroup +1 (800) 558-3745 (toll free) or +1 (212) 723-6106 (collect) or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., at +1 (855) 287-1922 (toll free) or +1 (212) 250-7527 (collect).  Requests for additional copies of the Offer to Purchase or questions regarding the tendering of Notes may be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation at +1 212-430-3774 (banks and brokers) and +1 866-470-3900 (toll free).

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.36      Net Money Flow ($)  -3,932    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
