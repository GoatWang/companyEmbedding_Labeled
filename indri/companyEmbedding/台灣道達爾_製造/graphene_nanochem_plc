New Product Field Trial By A National Oil Company 
Graphene NanoChem (AIM:GRPH) is pleased to announce the first paid field trial of GraphSolve, the Group's latest oilfield solutions offering, following the receipt of the purchase order for GraphSolve from Scomi Oiltools for field deployment in Myanmar.
GraphSolve, a nano-enhanced bioremediation solution for the treatment of drill cuttings, offers a unique solution of enabling on-site treatment of drill cuttings waste, replacing the costly need to transport and treat the same at off-site treatment facilities.
Drill cuttings are heavily oil contaminated wastes generated during a well drilling process which need to be treated prior to disposal to comply with the environmental regulations for treatment of drilling wastes. An oil drilling process generates between 300MT to 600MT cuttings per well and the conventional method of treatment has been to collect and transport the cuttings to off-site incineration facilities, incurring expensive haulage and treatment costs. 
The dual chemistry function of GraphSolve effectively reduces the oil content in the cuttings to less than 1% to meet the environmental regulations for on-site disposal and enhances the biodegradation process to within 8 - 12 weeks, providing significant cost savings to operators and an improved carbon footprint as compared to transportation and treatment of cuttings at off-site facilities. Depending on the concentration of oil in the drill cuttings, GraphSolve is expected to reduce treatment costs by US$70 to US$200 per MT of cuttings. 
The first order of GraphSolve was made following successful testing and full lab trial by Scomi Global Research and Technology Centre in accordance with the rigorous standard and testing protocols set by the end customer, a leading national oil company in the region ("End Customer"). In its first paid field trial programme to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, GraphSolve is expected to be deployed in 3 wells in Myanmar. 
Jespal Deol, Chief Executive Officer of Graphene NanoChem, commented: "The advanced paid field trial of GraphSolve by the End Customer after successful lab testing provides a strong testament to the performance of our products as we continue expanding our product lines and market reach."

 For Immediate Release 
 

   20 January 2016 

  Graphene NanoChem PLC 

  ("Graphene NanoChem" or the "Group") 

  First Commercial Deployment of New Product Confi-Gel 

  Graphene NanoChem (AIM:GRPH), is pleased to announce the Group's first commercial order for Confi-Gel, its nano-engineered gelling agent or viscosifier developed using patented cavitation technology, SimPlat 5, is ready for deployment. 

  The purchase order valued at US$33,300 was secured for Confi-Gel following more than six months of comprehensive testing and full lab trials by Scomi Oiltools, for inclusion into its supply chain to service global market requirements. 

  The product will be deployed for use in Scomi's existing contract in Pakistan in Q1 2016 and gradually into further markets in Turkmenistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and India. 

  Confi-Gel is used as an additive in base-drilling fluids to decrease fluid loss to the well surroundings and ensure wellbore stability throughout the drilling activity.  The product was developed to complement the Group's PlatDrill Series. 

  The superior performance of the viscosifier is attributed to its microstructure.  This enables precise customisation and integration, ultimately translating into significant cost reduction for customers. 

  Viscosifiers form a significant component of drilling fluids and enables the Group to address Scomi's current order book and a market valued today at approximately US$20.0 million. 

  Jespal Deol, Chief Executive Officer of Graphene NanoChem, commented: 

  "Today's news marks another milestone for the Group and is in line with our strategy of developing the mainstream market for our products range. The oil and gas market has suffered significant downturn from the volatility of oil prices and the fact that our product addresses the industry pain-points has generated significant traction in the commercialisation of our oil and gas product range. The Group looks forward to capitalising on its leading product range further in today's global market. 

  "Separately, I am pleased to update that our debt-restructuring plan is still progressing and an announcement will be released in due course."

A lot of waste is generated when hunting for black gold... 








	GraphSolve, the latest solution from Malaysia headquartered Graphene Nanochem (LON:GRPH), is to be put to the test in the field for a national oil company in Mayanmar.

	It is a paid trial under the group's deal with Scomi Oiltools and the product is due to be used in three wells in work due to complete in the first quarter of 2016.

	GraphSolve is used to treat drill cuttings waste on-site, thereby ridding the costly need to transport and treat material away from the well.

	Drilling generates between 300 MT (Metric ton) and 600MT of cuttings per well.

	The latest product can reduce treatment costs by between US$70 and US$200 per MT of cuttings.

	Its dual  chemistry function effectively reduces the oil content in the cuttings to less than 1% to meet environmental regulations for on-site disposal

	It also speeds up the biodegradation process to within 8 - 12 weeks, providing cost savings to operators and an improved carbon footprint.

	Graphene's chief executive Jespal Deol said: "The advanced paid field trial of GraphSolve by the End Customer after successful lab testing provides a strong testament to the performance of our products as we continue expanding our product lines and market reach."

	Graphene and Scomi Oiltools, one of the Asia’s largest oilfield services companies, have a joint venture covering a number of oilfield drilling lubricants and products.

	Earlier this month, Graphene won a US$384,000 order for its water-based drilling additive PlatQuartZ from a Middle East oil company working in Turkmenistan.

	Shares were unchanged today at 13.25p.

New Product Field Trial

For Immediate Release

Graphene NanoChem PLC
("Graphene NanoChem" or the "Group")
New Product Field Trial By A National Oil Company 
Graphene NanoChem (AIM:GRPH) is pleased to announce the first paid field trial of GraphSolve, the Group's latest oilfield solutions offering, following the receipt of the purchase order for GraphSolve from Scomi Oiltools for field deployment in Myanmar.
GraphSolve, a nano-enhanced bioremediation solution for the treatment of drill cuttings, offers a unique solution of enabling on-site treatment of drill cuttings waste, replacing the costly need to transport and treat the same at off-site treatment facilities.
Drill cuttings are heavily oil contaminated wastes generated during a well drilling process which need to be treated prior to disposal to comply with the environmental regulations for treatment of drilling wastes. An oil drilling process generates between 300MT to 600MT cuttings per well and the conventional method of treatment has been to collect and transport the cuttings to off-site incineration facilities, incurring expensive haulage and treatment costs. 
The dual chemistry function of GraphSolve effectively reduces the oil content in the cuttings to less than 1% to meet the environmental regulations for on-site disposal and enhances the biodegradation process to within 8 - 12 weeks, providing significant cost savings to operators and an improved carbon footprint as compared to transportation and treatment of cuttings at off-site facilities. Depending on the concentration of oil in the drill cuttings, GraphSolve is expected to reduce treatment costs by US$70 to US$200 per MT of cuttings. 
The first order of GraphSolve was made following successful testing and full lab trial by Scomi Global Research and Technology Centre in accordance with the rigorous standard and testing protocols set by the end customer, a leading national oil company in the region ("End Customer"). In its first paid field trial programme to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, GraphSolve is expected to be deployed in 3 wells in Myanmar. 
Jespal Deol, Chief Executive Officer of Graphene NanoChem, commented: "The advanced paid field trial of GraphSolve by the End Customer after successful lab testing provides a strong testament to the performance of our products as we continue expanding our product lines and market reach."
