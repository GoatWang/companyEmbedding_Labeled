        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

© Copyright by the author 2 Preface
This book is intended to provide commerce students of international
trade and other readers with guidelines to the language of international
trade contracts as the name of the book suggests.
Despite the difficulty and complexity of the subject matter, the language
used in the book is straightforward and readily understood.
The book contains 11 parts. The first eights parts deal with legal aspects
and give examples of authentic language used to illustrate them. At the
end of each part, there are comprehension questions so that the students
can check their understanding. In the footnote from Part 1 to Part 8, four
or five words and/or expressions are listed with their context meanings
in Vietnamese.
Part 10 gives examples of authentic contracts from various Vietnamese
and foreign trading corporations. All of these contracts are bilingual:
English and Vietnamese. Part 11 includes the ICC Model Sale contract
and the remarks made on each individual provision in the light of the
civil code of the SRVN regarding civil contracts.
Although every effort has been made to ensure the reliability of the
information in the book, for readers of the book, the author is not
responsible for any losses resulting from using this book or specimen
contract clauses taken from therein. Before signing a contract, business
persons should take appropriate legal advice.
As mentioned the subject matter is very difficult and complicated, errors
and mistakes might have been made here and there in the book.
Constructive suggestions and corrections are, therefore, highly
appreciated. Prof. Dr. Nguyin Trong Dan
Hanoi, 2007 3 Acknowledgements

This book is, as mentioned, meant to be used, firstly by commerce
students at the Hanoi Foreign Trade University and otber business
persons. The focus of the book is on both the language and other legal
aspects of contracts.
Anyone who wishes to use the book effeciently should, first of all, attain
a fairly advanced level of English and then have a good understanding of
such key subjects as:
- Laws applied to international business operations
- Foreign Trade Organizations and Techniques
- International Payment
- Shipping, Transport and Insurance.
In order to understand, at the beginning, and be able to apply the contract
terms and conditions, the students, readers and users are required to work
through the book starting from Part I.
The working phases are recommended as follows:
Phase 1:
- Understanding technical terms
- Being able to analyze clause structure
- Understanding every single grammatical unit.
Phase 2:
- Understanding legal and technical aspects as explained in each
part
- Reading sample provisions - Reading and understanding short contracts, and then long ones
Phase 3:
- Translating some simple short contracts into Vietnamese, and
comparing them with the ones provided in the book
- Drafting short provisions, and then long ones
- Drafting a contract
- Discussing it with someone who is an authority on the subject
matter.
In the course of using this book, it should be kept in mind that laws are
constantly changing and it is the drafter, not the author of this book, who is
responsible for the effectiveness of the drafted contract clauses or the
contract itself. It is, therefore, essential and vital that the students, users
and readers should have a good command of English and a comprehensive
knowledege and experience in international business. Prof. Dr. NGUYEN TRONG DAN
2007 10 Part 1 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE LAW AND THE CONTRACT
1. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE LAW AND THE CONTRACT
When negotiators from different countries contract, they create a legal
instrument. What is the relationship between this legal instrument and the law
of the two countries?
Two parties may agree to bind themselves in any way they choose, provided
their agreement does not come into conflict with the public law (including the
constitution) of their countries or with stringent provisions of the private law.
The constitution of a country embodies the generally accepted principles that
govern the country. In addition to a constitution, each country has laws. In
general, laws establish two kinds of rights and duties: (a) the rights and duties
that each citizen owes to and receives from the state, and (b) the rights to and
duties that citizens owe each other. The law that regulates the relationship
between state and citizen is called public law. Private law regulates the
relationship between citizens.
The public law of a country controls, for example, taxation, immigration, the
formation of companies and similar matters. Criminal law is also public law.
The private law looks at the behaviour of citizens (and companies) toward each
other. One branch of private law looks at agreements which citizens or
companies make with each other - this is the Contract Law.
2. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LAW AND CONTRACT
Business is based on agreements or Contracts. During the performance of a
contract, the parties may disagree on a particular matter and then the two parties
will study their contract and ask what it provides in such a situation. If there is
bind: rang buac
criminal law: luat hinh
legal instrument: cOng cu phap ly
private law: tv phap provided: vdi diau kian la
public law: cong phap
stringent provisions: nhCing quy dinh nghiem ngat 11 no such provision, they must ask what, if anything, the law obliges them to do.
This raises the most basic question about contracts.
What is the relationship betweenc the contract and the law?
Example
BEC (British Export Co.) is an English company. It makes an offer to supply
the Power Co, (PC) of Vietnam with relays for 2 pounds each.
Under the English Contract Law, the English company has the right to cancel
its offer at any time before PC accepts it. Although BEC has this right, it may
agree with PC not to cancel its offer, say, before Sept. 30. In other words, BEC
can, if it wishes, give up or waive one of its rights under the Law of Contract.
The waivable rights are said to be disposive. Of course, BEC's waiver applies
to the offer it is making to PC only. It keeps its right to cancel offers made to
others.
Reinarks - This example shows exactly the relationship between the contract and the
law: a contract sets out the rights and duties that apply between the two
parties. A contract sets aside rights and duties that exist under private law
(e.g. BEC's right to cancel its offer) and creates new rights and duties (e.g.
the duty to deliver goods or the right to payment).
- And the public law? The provisions of the public law are never disposive.
For example, public law in Vietnam forbids the use of certain plastics in
the manufature of insulation for cable. Can BEC agree with PC that this
law does not apply to their contracts? Obviously not. Public law is not
disposive - the parties to a contract cannot set it aside.
- The idea of "law" that we have discussed so far is, of course, the traditional
western view. This view stresses that law and morality are close partners:
The purpose of law is to provide order, stability and justice. Thus viewed,
the law consists of relatively fixed rules which regulate conduct according
to the morality of the community. Proper conduct, as determined by the
community, should be allowed or required. Improper conduct should be
prohibited. Law then is a social institution, it is not an end in itself but is an
instrumentality for obtaining social justice (Anderson, 1980 p.17).
contract law: luOt help clong
disposive: co the khutc ter
oblige: bat buiic 12 waive: khutc tit
waivable rights: quyen co the khuUc tir
waiver: nguti khutc to quygn cluvc hutng - Nothing could be further from the traditional eastern view. In the extract
below, the long-standing Korean view of "Law" is presented:
The idea that law is an accumulation of collective experience never had an
existence in the Korean political tradition. Law was an instrument for
chastising the vicious and the depraved. It was sharply distinguished from
custom. It always signified a norm with physical force as a sanction behind
it. It was therefore synonymous with punishment, no more or less. It is little
wonder that the ruling elite considered law beneath its dignity. Indeed, the
concept that law applies only to the barbarians or to the ignorant masses
and never to the proper Chinese or to the rulers is strongly rooted in
Korean thought. When the present- day Koreans try to follow the AngloAmerican example, they have to depart so far from their traditional ways
of thinking that one cannot help wondering whether it is feasible, let alone
advisable to do so (Pyon-choon 1982 pp. 19 and 30).
If we accept this view as typically eastern, then clearly the gap between
easterner and westerner is wide. For a westerner, a contract is of the highest
significance. It put into words powerful moral forces as they apply to the case
in hand. Behind the contract stands a huge body of law and 3,000 years of
religious and moral tradition. For the easterner, the contract is a simple
agreement without such psychological and philosophical roots. Both sides
should be aware of this gap during contract negotiations. It is the source of
much misunderstanding.
3. EUROPEAN (CONTINENTAL) LAW AND ANGLO - AMERICAN LAW "Continental" law
The so-called "continental" law prevails in most of continental Europe, in
France and Germany for example. This law derives from a code which the
Roman Emperor Justinian developed 1,50Q years ago. For this reason, lawyers
often call it "Roman law". The Code Napoleon of 1803 developed and updated
Justinian's code and influenced many legal systems around the world including
those of Japan and most South American countries. The essence of
"continental" law is Codification. A clear code expresses what is legal and what
is not. The German BGC (Civil code) is an excellent example. The continental
accumulation: tich luy

Justice: c6ng ly
morality: dao dim

sanction: trirng phat
set aside: b6 qua, b6 ra ngoai
vicious: xali xa, deic ác 13 family of law has well developed private law, especially the contract and the
commercial branches.
"Anglo American" law
- Unlike Continental law, the Law of England, the United States (and many other
English - speaking countries) is not completely codified. The tradition of
uncodified law goes back to ancient kings who sat under oak trees and made
legal decisions case by case.
To achieve fairness, the king decided each case in line with earlier decisions in
similar cases, the so-called precedents. For this reason, lawyers often call
Anglo - American Law "case law".
Today, public law is generally codified, while private law remains largely case
law. The case - law system prevails in England, in the United States, and in
many ex - colonies of Britain such as Australia.
It is important to note that the USA has codified its commercial law - tidying up
the chaotic situation in which some fifty states followed often widely different
legal practices. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was written between
1941 and 1952. A 1962 revision was adopted by 49 states. A 1972 revision was
also widely adapted, although different states and courts interpret the UCC
differently, it offers a vital guide to current American thinking.
Because England and the United States were predominant in world trade until
recently, Anglo - American legal thinking strongly influences international
practice. The Anglo - American family has a fully developed private law. In
particular, the big trading countries have developed a strong commercial and
contract law.
Anglo American and Continental Law: the Differences
- Anglo - American contract law is largely case - law. Each decision on a new set
of facts or on the construction of a previously undisputed law by a judge creates
a precedent. This precedent may be binding, if so future judges will follow it.
The chart below compares how Continental and the Anglo - American law treat
the relationship between a case and the law. Anglo-American law: luat Anh-M2

philosophical: trial hoc, triet ly
psychological: tam ly
elite: tinh nhua, qui ph& The Anglo - American and the Continental approaches to law produce different
styles of legal argument, and very different contract language. Much of the
material in the following chapter explores these differences. Let's take a single
example for now: the length and complexity of Anglo - American contracts.
You have probably noticed that English and American lawyers draft long
contracts in difficult language. Why is it? Perhaps lawyers are paid by the
word, and a long contract makes more money than a short one! Although it was
true in the past, it is not the heart of the problem at present.
In the Anglo - American legal world, as we have seen, nobody knows the result
in any given case until the judge reaches a decision. If the parties want to avoid
surprises, they must draft a detailed contract covering all future possibilities.
This makes contracts long and full of exceptions and conditions. Further,
judges must take binding precedents into account when making their decisions.
Each case may have dozens (even hundreds) of precedents. 'Contract language
has developed over the centuries to "force" the judge to arrive at the same result
whatever precedent(s) he or she uses. One example, if a judge once refused
damages because the plaintiff had incurred "costs" while the contract spoke
only of "expenses". Future contracts will tend to speak of "costs and expenses",
and thus avoiding the problem. approach: phtrang phap tigp can exception: ngoai le incure: phat sinh plaintiff: nguyOn dan
take st into account: tinh den...
tend: cO xu fluting. 15 CONTINENTAL ANGLO-AMERICAN Start with a clear legal code Start with a case decided on its merits. When a case occurs, the judge simple
applies the code. Sometimes the
judge must interpret the code to see
how it applies in a particular case When a similar case occurs, the judge
decides the case on its merits and in line
with the precedent set by the first case. Very difficult cases go to a higher
court. The higher court interprets the
code and decides how it applies in
the difficult case. A huge body of case law develops with
many precedents in slightly different
cases. PERHAPS
The legislature passes a statute (= law)
that tidies up a complicated situation, or
it may pass completely new laws. Before applying a statute, a court may
evaluate its constitutionality . This
means that the courts may reject a
statute and refuse to apply it, if it is
found to be unconstitutional. Judges
also have wide powers to interpret
statutes; the court must decide what the
statute means. "The courrt's
interpretation is the law" (Groner, p.8)

legislature: co quan lap phap 16 merits: tinh fiat (cue vu kien)

statute: hanh vi lap phap, luat thanh van 4. THE APPLICABLE LAW No contract is complete. When the contract does not answer a question, the
answer lies in the applicable law, the law of a particular state or country. In
principle the parties are free to choose the law which applies to the contract.
What is important in choosing an applicable law? What happens if the parties
cannot agree on an applicable law?
The parties should agree on the applicable law before drafting a contract.
Without a defined applicable law, the parties may write unenforceable
provisions. Further, some applicable laws require a more detailed contract than
others. If the parties simply cannot agree on a law, then they must write a very
long contract.
If a contract is a fish, it swims in water. In principle the parties are free to
decide which water their fish will swim in. A Chinese - German contract could
choose German, Chinese, English, or, to oversimplify a little, any other national
law.
You often find the Applicable Law clause at the end of a contract. Even so, you
should turn to it first before reading the rest of the contract. Some provisions of
a contract change their meaning radically under different legal systems.
An example of a carefully worded applicable law provision: This contract, and all questions concerning its formation, validity, interpretation
and application shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
Study this wording. It says that the laws of the State of New York govern the
contract. That is clear enough. The clause also mentions four questions
governed by these laws: 4.1. Formation
Was the contract correctly formed? That depends on the applicable law. But if
the contract was not correctly formed, it does not exist, and so there is no
applicable law. And if there is no applicable law, it is impossible to decide if
the contract is correctly formed or not! This legal knot is easy to untie if the
applicable law: luat ap dung
defined: dich danh
formation: hinh thanh govern: chi ph6i
oversimplify: don gian h6a qua mut
unforceable: khOng c6 hie‘u lut
validity: thdi han hiau luc 17 parties agree that not only the contract itself but also the question of its
formation is subject to the laws of the State of New York.
4.2. Validity Is the contract valid? If not, the same problem (and the same solution) arise as
with Question 1, Formation.
4.3. Interpretation How is the contract to be interpreted? To understand this point we must
distinguish between substantive law and rules of procedure. Substantive law is
the law as it applies to the behavior of the parties. What does the law require
them to do? Rules of Procedure apply to the court and its way of conducting its
business. The rules of interpretation are procedural rules, not substantive laws.
This wording makes it clear that both the substantive laws and the rules of
interpretation are those of the State of New York.
4.4. Application How will the parties carry out their duties? What rules apply to the performance
of the contract? As with interpretation, a dispute might arise about a substantive
law and procedural rules. Again the wording makes the situation absolutely
clear.
An applicable law clause not only states the law applicable to the contract, it
sometimes states what law is not applicable. This clause is from a subcontract
for space technology. The main contractor is American; the subcontractor is
German. The contract shall be governed by, subject to, and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Florida; This Contract shall not include or
incorporate the provisions of the "United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods" be subject to: re thu'ec vao legal knot: chot phap ly
rules for procedure: quy tac ye thu tyc 18 substantive law: lust flux tai
untie: gO cal This contract was written at a time when both the United States and Germany
were in the process of ratifying the United Nations Convention (the so-called
Vienna Sales Convention). The parties wished to exclude its provisions from
their agreement. Since the matter is disposive, they had every right to do so.
What happens if during negotiations the two parties cannot agree on an
applicable law? If a French company, for example, will not accept Chinese law,
and its Chinese counterpart will not accept French law? First, the parties could
decide on a neutral law, for example, English law, or Swiss law as applied in
their respective countries. Second, the parties might agree to the law of one
side, but write a very detailed and extensive contract leaving almost nothing for
the applicable law to decide. Accepting the law of "the other side" is not
particularly dangerous if you research carefully and write a clear, detailed and
fair contract. There is a third possibility. If two sides reach no agreement, you
sometimes see a provision such as this: 13.1 During the performance of the Contract, any dispute in connection
with the Contract shall be settled by both parties through consultation
in the spirit of friendliness; If no agreement can be reached after such
consultation, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration 13.2 The arbitration shall be conducted in the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Sweden
13.3 The law applicable to the arbitration shall be neutral and be decided by
the arbitration committee arbitration: trong tai
construe: didn clich
consultation: hip thtrang
convention: cong vac dispute: tranh chap
neutral: trung lap
ratify: phO chudn
respective: mOi, ttrng, rieng 19 Allowing the arbitration committee to decide the applicable law is dangerous.
Neither party knows what law to apply to the contract. The results of fairly
common actions become unpredictable, and the chances of an expensive
dispute increase.
The next clause, taken from a contract to supply German equipment to the
United States, illustrates a fourth possibility: This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Federal
Republic of German. If, however, the German law conflicts with Texas or U.S.
federal laws regarding any dispute between the parties, then the parties agree to
use their best efforts to negotiate an equitable compromise acceptable to both
sides hereto; In the event that such a compromise cannot be reached in a timely
manner, then the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the separate
"Arbitration Agreement" between the parties The parties were (apparently) unable to agree on one applicable law, so they
named three. The clause foresees trouble, disputes and arbitration ahead
because of this awkward arrangement. In the end, the arbitrator will decide
what law really applies.
A surprising number of international contracts use the weaker options, in effect
allowing the court or arbitration to decide the applicable law. How does the
court, if required, make its decision? What does it take into account? The ICC
Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration 1988, says: In the absence of any indication by the parties as to the applicable law, the
arbitrator shall apply the law designated as the proper law by the rule of
conflict which he deems appropriate (Article 13.3)
This doesn't help much: the rules governing conflict of law are a study in
themselves, and so, for the parties to the contract, the arbitrator's decision is
unpredictable. As a rule of thumb, however, the court usually weighs four
factors, whatever conflict - of - law rules it is applying. awkward: vung ve

the work is actually done);
b. The place of execution (= signature) of the contract;
c. The language of the contract;
d. The currency or the weights and measures prescribed.
Taken together, these points show the gravity of a contract - it's "natural
weight". It practice, the place of performance, is often decisive. In an FOB
sales contract, this is the country of the seller. In a construction contract, that of
the buyer.
5. SOME SPECIMEN CLAUSES Applicable law This contract shall in all respects be construed and interpreted
in accordance with the law of the People's Republic of Bangladesh including
any such Laws passed or made or coming into force during the period of the
Contract Governing Law These General Conditions and the Contract are governed by
Italian Law Applicable Law Regardless of the place of agreement, the place of
performance, or otherwise, this agreement and all amendments, modifications,
or supplements hereto, shall be construed under, governed by, and the legal

regardless of: bat ke
designated: chi dinh rule of thumb: qui tbc thvc nghiem
gravity: trong diem specimen: mau 21 In each case, the water round the fish is labeled: Bangladeshi law, Italian law
the law of the Philippines. Even so, the third formulation is clearly better than
the other two: it takes into account most of the legal problems that arise in
disputes about the applicable law.
IMPORTANT REMINDER: The applicable law governs the disposive
provisions (or traditions) of the private law: things that the parties could decide
themselves but - for whatever reason - left unregulated. Public law always
applies, whatever the parties agree.
6. COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS 6.1. A Tax - Free Contract BEC, an English company, is selling switchgear for power stations in Vietnam.
The parties agree that "English law applies". BEC, however, wants to ensure
that it is not liable for tax under Vietnam tax law. Therefore the lawyer drafts
this clause:
All income taxes or other tax obligations created as a result of this contract
shall be assessed and regulated exclusively according to the English tax law in
force at the time of assessment I. Is BEC now free of Vietnam income taxes? (Choose one answer)
q YES
q NO - because tax law is public law and the parties cannot set it aside.
q NO - because the clause is worded too weakly. ensure: bac, dam hereto: 1. doi vUi hop clang nay

The clause below is from a contract for the sale of mining equipment to South
Africa:

with the Representative authorized by him to ensure that all work is being
carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Mine and Works Act,
1956, the Factories, Machinery and Building Works Act No. 22. of 1941 as

is a member of the continental law family.)

1. THE CONTRACT SENTENCE
The opening sections of an Anglo- American contracts are often puzzling: it is
hard to see how the whereas, the witnesseth, and the rest fit together. Sadly,
many international contracts are poorly drafted: the wording is often
ungrammatical and sometimes nonsense. What is the key to contract language?
Traditional English-language contracts are drafted as a single sentence: the
"contract sentence". In principle, all the parts of a contract fit into a single
grammatical unit .
Lawyers are conservative. Lawyers working in English today may still draft
contracts in the ancient style, even though these old forms internationally may
be a source of confusion. One tradition is the drafting of contracts as a single
sentence. This sentence pattern has three main variations.
1.1. "This Contract Witnesseth..." (Variation 1)
The lease on the next page illustrates the most common contract pattern. No
matter how long a contract is, it can still follow this one sentence pattern. Let's
look at the grammar of the sentence:
THIS LEASE... This lease is the subject of the contract sentence. Many contracts begin
with a similar subject: This Licensing Agreement, This Technical
Assistance Agreement, and so on.
BETWEEN... The. word between introduces the names of the two parties. Each party is
usually given a " hereinafter referred to" title: the buyer or the seller;
Employer or Contractor or whatever. conservative: beo thu
lease: hop dung cho thud va thud
puzzling: rec roi, khO hieu whereas: xet, vi rang
witnesseth: lam bang charg 25 THIS LEASE

Apartment 4 on the fifth floor in the building known as 13 Greek Street for the
term of three years commencing the first day of September 2000 and ending the
thirty-first day of August 2002 at the annual rent of $5,000 payable in equal
monthly installments in advance on the first day of each month during the said
term
In Witness Whereof,
Landlord and Tenant have respectively signed and sealed this lease as of the day
and year first above written. WITNESSE TH THAT .. This is a main verb. "This lease witnesseth that..." simply means "This
document is proof that..." (The -eth is an antique ending for the third
person singular, present tense.)
WHEREAS...
This lease contains no "whereas" clauses. It is commonly understood that
a string of whereas clauses at this point gives, if necessary, the
background to the agreement. commence: b6t dau contractor cht) than employer: chi.), chi.) dau ttr

26 hereby: theo hop dung nay
hereinafter referred to: sau day goi la ...
instalment: Pea dan ...THAT...
After the word that comes a string of noun clauses- a list of the agreed
rights and duties of the parties. Grammatically, of course, a noun clause
looks exactly like a sentence; for example: He said that he loves dogs but
his wife prefers horses.
The two clauses in italics are noun clauses, they are direct objects of the verb
"said". In structure, however, they are exactly like sentences. In the same way,
the many "sentences" in a contracts are noun clauses, direct object of the verb
"witnesseth". This means, of course, that the periods (full stop) at the end of
each provision in the contract are grammatically wrong, but in a long contract
they are unavoidable. (This also explains why the provisions of a contract are
often called clauses and not sentences).
IN WITNESS WHEREOF ....
The two parties sign the contract to "witness" it, in other words to "give
proof of their agreement". This use of the word witness can cause
confusion because, in many documents, the signatures of the parties must
themselves be witnessed. In this case, however, the signature of the
"witness" simply confirms that the signature of the party is genuine.
1.2. "Know All Men ..." (Variation 2)
This variation occurs in short document as Bid Bonds, less often in contracts.
The document below is a transfer of ownership for a new car. Again the
contract is a single sentence. a string of: mot loaf
bid bond: bao dam dot than

that "all men should know." As with Variation 1, any number of "whereas"
clauses can follow the word "That". bargain and sell: ban

IN WITNESS WHEREOF... The formula is the same as for Variation 1. (The seal in the case of a
Transfer of Ownership like this is important; since only one party signs
the document, the seal makes it legally binding.) 1.3. "The Parties Hereby Agree That..."'
The agreement on the next page is a standard form for selling a second-hand
car in the United States. It contains a heading that is not integrated into the
contract sentence, and then a double wording. The rights and duties of each
party exactly balance, resulting in two mirror-image sentences.
This form is fairly common in short agreements or in a "one-page" contract to
which many contract documents are annexed.
ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT The name of the agreement is, in this case, simply a title outside the
grammatical structure of the contract sentence.
BETWEEN... The word between introduces the name of the two parties. This contract
illustrates a common but old-fashioned usage. The first name is said to be
"of the first part" and the second name "of the second part" and "the party
of the second part". annex: kem, lam thanh phy lyc integrate: gQp, nha't the transfer of ownership: chuyen quyen so) hit 29 Articles of the Agreement

repetitious. A negotiator may try to simplify the English wording. But this is
sometimes dangerous.
Anglo-American contract law is mostly case law, so lawyers draft contracts
with cases (precedents) in mind. If a judge in the past based a decision on the
precise wording of a contract, later contracts may try to avoid or embrace the
implications of that decision. Further, to compensate for the absence of a
codified law, lawyers try to cover all eventualities in the contract itself. The
result is "contract English" - a language with rules of its own. The contractor shall be under no liability whatsoever by way of indemnity or
otherwise for or in respect of destruction of or damage to the Works or to the
Temporary works or any property whether of Government or third parties or for
or in respect of injury or loss of life which is the consequency, whether direct or
indirect, of the outbreak of war (whether war is declared or not) in which the
country shall be actively engaged, invasion of the country, act of foreign
enemies, rebellion, revolution or military or usurped power in the country, civil
war, or otherwise than amongst the contractor's own employees or the
employees of any subcontractor or a contractor executing any specialist works,
riot, commotion or disorder, (hereinafter comprehensively refereed to as "the
said special risks") and the government shall indemnity and save harmless the
contractor against and from the same and against and from all claims, demands,
proceedings and damages, costs, charges, and expenses whatsoever arising
therefrom or in connection therewith and shall compensate for contractor for any
loss damage to the property of the contractor used or intended to be used for the
purpose of the works, and occasioned either directly or indirectly by the said
special risks codified law: luat thanh van
embrace: bao gom
eventualities: tinh huOng co the xay ra lengthy: dai thing
repetitious: lap, trung lap
31 Anglo-American law is largely case-law: each decision by a judge may create a
precedent. If this precedent is binding, future judges always follow it. The
Anglo-American drafter knows this and writes the contract to avoid the
problems created by binding precedents in the past. Study. for example, the
language of the contract provision above. It is Clause 114 of the Conditions of
Contract of the Public Works Department of a country in East Asia within the
Anglo-American law family.
This clause uses the word or many times. In each case the drafter has a
particular problem in mind. Let's take three examples:
Example 1
The clause mentions "the outbreak of war". This seems clear enough, but the
drafter adds "whether war is declared or not" Why? The reference is probably
to the war in Vietnam. Officially the United States calls this a Conflict, not a
War, since war was not declared. During the 1970s, contracts that excluded
liability for problems caused by "war" ran into legal problem, and so drafters
adopted the habit of adding "whether war is declared or not".
Example 2
The drafter writes of "property... used for the purposes of the Works." The
wording here perhaps reflects a judgment in particular case where the judge
distinguished between property "used for the purposes of the Works" and
property delivered to the site but not yet in use. The drafter covers both
possibilities.
Example 3
One phrase here is typical of Anglo-American drafting: "all claims, demands,
proceedings, damages, costs, charges and expenses whatsoever". The drafter is
probably making no difference between claim, proceeding and demand or
between costs and charges and expenses. He used this list of terms for safety's
sake: whatever the situation, the contract covers it. This need for safety reflects
a major principle of case law: it is impossible to know the result until the case foreign enemies: ke thei ngoai bang
all claims, demands, proceedings damages: tat ca
thief hai
all costs, charges and expenses: tat cá chi phi
revolution: cach mang
in respect of: ve, co lien quan d6n
indemnify: b6i thutng 32 military or usurped power: th6 luc quen
su va ciao chinh
rebellion: not loan
riot: bao d6ng, not loan commotion: huyen rick
therefrom: of nhCing rut ro dOc biet nay
therewith: c6 lion quan d6n nhimg rui ro
da:c bet nay has been decided. So, don't simplify the language of an Anglo-American
contract until a lawyer has studied it carefully.
A case in point: Courts in the United State have trouble with know-how
contracts. Is know-how the same things as trade secrets? And do both mean the
same as confidential information? The position is unclear. Accordingly we find
in a lawbook this recommendation:
The following conclusion can be drawn from an analysis of the terminology
used by the courts: (a) the cases are not reconcilable if it is assumed that the
different phrases (know-how, trade secrets, confidential information) are
intended to define dissimilar legal concepts; (b) the contract drafter who
wishes to cover as many future contingencies as possible should use an
alternative expression [= an expression containing alternatives] on the
theory that subjects matter which might elude one label will surely be
covered by another. Thus an alternative phrase such as "confidential
information, Know-how, and/or trade secrets" should cover most
contingencies. The alternative "and/or" provides the projected enforcer with
maximum flexibility in selecting that specific characterization of the misused
property which appears best suited to the facts and the law of the forum
(Staples and Bertagnoly, p.264).
Two points emerge here: First, case-law leads to considerable confusion about
the meanings of words; it is often necessary to use several words rather than
one to ensure that the true meaning is covered. Secondly, using several words
rather than one gives the lawyer great flexibility if the contract becomes the
subject of a court case.
3. THE CLAUSES PATTERN IN CONTRACT ENGLISH Long sentences quickly become confusing in English. Especially in the
international arena, the drafter must know, and work within, the limits of basic
English clause structure when combining ideas into longer sentences.
Four basic patterns of combination are effective in English. Without making it
into a religion, many drafters try to limit themselves to these patterns,
especially if English is not the first language of either party. confidential information: th6ng tin bi mat
contingencies: cac tru'ang hgp bgt nga
distinguish: Oen bat
know-how: bi guy& alternative: co thg they the
creolize: hinh thanh ng6n ngir ti? 3 ter hai
ngOn ngt`r ban deu
emerge: not len reconcilable: co thg h6a giai
trade secret: bi mat nhe nghe
blurred: nhat
elude: khuygt 33 English is a mix of French (from the Norman conquerors of 1066) and AngloSaxon (the German dialect of the invaders who filled the vacuum left by the
Roman withdrawal from England). When languages combine (or creolize), two
results are common:
- An oversize vocabulary with blurred distinctions of meaning;
- A simplified grammatical structure with usage and idiom replacing
"logical" rules.
Both results occurred in the case of English. Because English grammar is thin
on rules and rich in "illogical" usage, it is difficult to express complex, logical
relationships among ideas. As a basis for expression, try to work with the four
basic clause structures that underlie most well written contract provisions.
Structure 1: Main Clause Plus Main Clause
Two sentences (main clauses) joined by and (or a similar conjunction) - this is
the most frequently used structure in the English language. Because most
languages freely use and, but, or between main clauses, this construction
presents no problems internationally. MAIN CLAUSE MAIN CLAUSE Example:
The stipulated prices are fixed, and they are to be understood delivered and
paid to the place of destination The headings and marginal notes in these General Conditions shall not be
deemed part of this Contract, and they shall not be taken into consideration
in the interpretation thereof
Structure 2: Main Clause Plus One Subordinate Clause
The simplest relationship between two ideas is to make one into a main clause
and the other into an explanatory or subordinate clause. These simple sentences
are sometimes enough to express quite elaborate contract provisions. conjunction: lien to
delivered paid to the place of destination:
ctrac van 6i a tra den nai den 34 marginal notes: ghi chO ben le
subordinate: menh de phy
thin on rules: lOng go ye qui tec MAIN CLAUSE SUBORDINATE CLAUSE Example: The Employer has the right to terminate this contract if construction work is
not carried out in accordance with local by-laws You can also begin with the subordinate clause, especially when using the ifclause; the addition of the word then makes the relationship particularly clear. SUBORDINATE CLAUSE MAIN CLAUSE If the construction work is not carried out in accordance with the local bylaw, then the employer has the right to terminate this contract Structure 3: The Chain: Main clause plus more than one subordinate
clause
In contracts, a string of conditions is often attached to a main provision. Then
you must "chain" the clause: MAIN CLAUSE SUBORDINATE
CLAUSE
(TYPE A) by-law : cac van ban chid lua't SUBORDINATE
CLAUSE
(TYPE A) SUBORDINATE
CLAUSE
(TYPE A) if - clause : menh de bet deu bang "if"
terminate : ket thuc 35 Naturally, the main clause can also come after the daisy-chain. You should
repeat the conjunction, for example, if, at the start of each clause. A ood
example occurs in these Terms for. Deliveries Abroad:
The delivery time has been adhered to if the consignment is ready for
dispatch ex works within the agreed period and if notice to this effect is sent
to the purchaser
This structure is common in whereas-recitals: "whereas ... whereas...,
whereas..., and whereas..."
Structure 4: Main clause between subordinate clauses
Where a sentence contain clauses of several types (let's say an if-clause and a
because-clause), you should place these clauses on either side of the main
clause:
SUBORDINATE
CLAUSE
(TYPE A) MAIN CLAUSE SUBORDINATE
CLAUSE
(TYPE B) Example:* Where the contract provides for deliveries in lots or installments, penalties for
late delivery shall be calculated on the basis of the value of each lot or
installment, provided that the late delivery does not impede the general
performance of the contract adhere to : tuan thu
consignment : chuyen hang
ex - work : tai )(clang
: ngan can, can tret
at one's discretion : dua vao su suy
)(et caa ai dO
36 muddle : Ion x6n
notice to this effect th6ng bao ye va'n de nay
penalties : phat
provided that : mien la, vdi dieu kin la
arbitrator : trong tai 4. THE PASSIVE FORM . Contract English is rich in passive verbs. Unluckily for lawyers, modern
English is moving away from the passive. Further, many languages have no
passive; their speakers have no "feel" for this form.
Avoid using passive verbs where active verbs convey your meaning clearly.
Passive verbs test out badly, especially in instructions. Readers respond slowly
and less accurately when instructions use passives. For example:
Passive For the watch to be set, both the command button and the recessed set button
must be used. If the set button is to be depressed, use should be made of a small
object such as paper clip. Damage could be incurred by the watch if a large
object is employed.
Active When you set your watch, you'll have to use both the command-button and the
recessed set-button. Use something small, a paper clip for example, to depress
the set-button. If you use something bigger, you could damage your watch.
The passive is sometimes dangerous if you assign a duty but fail to say who
must perform it. Just compfare the following Examples :
A monthly progress report should be The Contractor should send a
sent to the Employer at his registered monthly progress report to the
Employer at his registered office
office
Or
Payment is required on or before 13th
of each month The Licensee shall pay the Licensor
on or before 13th of each month The problem is acute with oriental languages which often have no passive form.
A Chinese-speaker, for example, may miss the difference between: defective : cO khigrn khuyet loophole : ke ha c6 the trenh ne dtrac purity : dq tinh khigt, thugn chgt assign : giao (vigc)
inaccurately : khOng chinh xec
paper clip : kep gigy 37 The Licensee's personnel were given training (Passive) and
The Licensee's personnel were giving training (Active)
Where possible, therefore, try to avoid the passive.
5. COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS 5.1. Study the form of the contract sentence in this Memorandum of
Understanding. How would you reword the document so that it makes sense
grammatically? Omit "witnesseth" or omit "expresses" an understanding and
add that after witnesseth. Memorandum of Understanding

Member (s) is (are) responsible whether the claim is attributable to his (their)
share(s) of supply or to a failure by him (them) to carry out his (their)
obligations under the Purchase contract in a timely and correct manner or to
any other reason, then the responsible Member(s) shall immediately save
harmless from all obligations the Member held liable by the Purchaser An explanation of the test may help you there. Briefly this is the situation. A
group of three suppliers (a consortium) is selling to a Purchaser. Each member
of the consortium has his own "scope of supply". If the Purchaser has a claim
against the consortium, he can bring it against any member; the members are
said to be "jointly and severally liable". Among themselves, however, the
members make an agreement. If the Purchase makes a claim against the "wrong
guy", then, of course, the "wrong guy" will have to pay, but the guilty party will
compensate the "wrong guy" in full.
(As a purchaser, you may sometimes deal with consortium agreements. It is
common practice for the employer to have the right to see the relevant
consortium contract of his contractors). guilty party: ben co 16i

scope of supply: pham vi cung cgp, d6i ttrang cua hop dong 42 Part 3 INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTRACT
1. THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS Anglo - American contracts often list "contract documents ". Why? And what
problems does this list may cause?
If the contract is the entire agreement, then outside documents are normally
excluded from the contract. Some contracts, however, include documents by
naming them specifically. This creates a problem if the included documents
contradict each other. For this reason, the drafter must rank documents in order
of priority.
Anglo - American law takes the contract as the entire agreement. In other
words, nothing outside the contract unless it is specifically referred to and
included as part of the agreement. In international practice, parties often wish to
"incorporate" (= include) outside materials into the contract such as: general
conditions, special conditions, subcontracts, the Incoterms of the International
Chamber of Commerce, and so on. To do this, the contract names such
materials as Contract Documents. For example: Contract and Contract Documents "Contract" means this Purchase Agreement itself, and all applicable General
Conditions of Purchase, Special Conditions of Purchase, specifications, the
Statement of Works, and manufacturing drawings contract documents: tai lieu hop deng contradict: mat./ thu6n entire agreement: hap clang Ong the
in order of priority: theo trot tiOn. interpretation: din giei
statement of work:: thuyet minh ye nha may
unless: trii phi (lieu khOng) 43 All contract documents and the clauses of this contract shall be read, if possible,
so as to be consistent. In the event of conflict, the order of precedence for the
provisions and documents which constitute this agreement is as follows:
I. Any alterations typed on the face of the printed Purchase Agreement
2. The printed text of the purchase agreement itself
3. Specifications
4. Statement of Works
5. Manufacturing Drawings
6. The Buyer's Special Conditions of Purchase
7. The Buyer's General Conditions of Purchase This clause is well drafted. It lists specific documents that are parts of the
contract (Don't worry if you don't know what all these documents are!), and
it accepts that with so many documents, contradictions are likely. To resolve
contradictions, it gives an order of precedence, or "seniority" among the
documents. The higher its place on the list, the greater the authority a
document has. Some specimen clauses
This clause from a shipbuilding contract incorporates the Incoterms into the
contract and establishes the precedence between the contract and the Incoterms. "Incoterms 2000" means Incoterms 2000, the international rules for the interpretation of its terms, published by the International Chamber of
Commerce. When a terms from Incoterms 2000 is used in the Contract, the
rules and definitions applicable to that term in Contract except insofar as they
may conflict with any other provisions of the Contract, in which case the
provisions of the Contract prevail alteration: thay ddi In the event of: neil c6 precedence: sv &Mg trtrdc
insofar as: MI mut 44 prevail: thong, dirdc xem xet truft tiOn
seniority: sv o trOn
specimen: mk In Section (e), the following clause from a procurement contract for a power
station allows the purchaser to regulate priority. The supplier is likely to be
unhappy about that.
The term Contract Documents shall mean and include the following which
shall be deemed to form an integral part of the contract:
a. Invitation to Bid, Instructions to Bidders, Contract Agreement,
General Conditions of Contract, and Special Conditions of Contract
b. Specifications of the equipment/ goods to be supplied and erected
under the contract as detailed in the accompanying Technical
Specifications
c. Supplier's bid proposal including the letters of clarification thereto
between the supplier and the Purchaser prior to the Award of
Contract
d. All the materials, literature, data and information of any sort given by
the supplier along with his bid, subject to the approval of the
Purchaser
e. In the event of any conflict between the above mentioned documents,
the matter shall be referred to the Purchaser whose decision shall be
final
2. THE WHEREAS - RECITAL Most Anglo - American contracts begin with a "whereas - recital"
Why? What should the "whereas - recital" include and exclude?
A contract states the rights and duties of the parties. It does not discuss the
motivation of the parties, the business situation, or other important background
information. Without such information, however, the judge cannot always
interpret the contract correctly. The Parol Evidence Rule forbids the Anglo award of contract: tuyen b6 trung theu
bid: On dv than final: cu6i ding
Parol Evidence Rule: qui rac khi chifp nhan
phan khau chimg doi vUi nhfing dieu khoan
da thoa thuan cua hop dung motivation: Bong cc
parol evidence: khdu chum
procurement: mua sa'm
integral part: bo: phan hop thanh
whereas - recital: lief Ice cac can cu de
hai ben ki hdp clang. 45 American judge to use background materials not expressly named as contract
documents. Accordingly the parties include matters of fact, expectation and so
on in the form of a whereas-recital.
Traditionally the Anglo - American contract is an "entire agreement".
Unfortunately, however, the text of a contract does not answer many important
questions: Why did the parties sign the contract? What circumstances make the
deal attractive? How long have the parties known each other? What future
business do they hope for? If a contract runs into trouble, the judge/ arbitrator
asks such questions in order to interpret the contract. Often the parties give
different answers. To prevent this uncertainty, lawyers write the answers to
these background questions into the contract. How? Through the whereas recital. Contracts often begin after "witnesseth that": This Procurement Contract
between
The Styropak Company of Nanamia:
and
Verbena Packaging LTD of Verbena
Witnesseth that WHEREAS the parties have for many years successfully traded together
AND WHERWEAS Styropak has recently developed biodegradable
Styrofoam packaging After this opening come the rights and duties agreed by the parties. The word
whereas means because or considering that. In other words, whereas - clauses
are not provisions, promises or conditions - they are explanations. file above
example is a typical whereas - recital. If you look at it quickly, you'll see that it
contains two types of background information. Such information is useful to an

In a contract written under a Continental Law, a recital (or preamble") is useful:
it prevents misunderstanding. In an Anglo - American contract that contains an
Entire Agreement clause, a recital is essential. Continental lawyers often avoid
the complicated grammar of the whereas - clause. They prefer simple sentences
under the heading Preamble. The legal result is, of course, exactly the same.
The body of the contract records the rights and duties of the parties; the recital
states their motivations, their goals, and other background information.
3. DEFINITIONS Continental law - makers include a precise definition of many important terms
in the law itself Because Anglo - American law is based on cases, it offers
many conflicting definitions. This leads to uncertainty, how will the judge
interpret a particular term if the contract gets into trouble? The Anglo American drafter must overcome this uncertainty. But how?
Anglo - American contracts often begin by listing definitions. The list defines
problem terms. It records special meanings that the parties have agreed. In
principle, definitions belong to "up front" in a clause of their own.
Let's begin with an example: BEC is negotiating a contract in India. The parties
agree that BEC's technical advisers shall have "holidays" free. To BEC,
Christmas and Easter are holidays. To the Indian company, they are not. To
avoid the problem, the lawyer must draft a definition of holidays.
In this contract "holidays" shall mean all legal holidays in the State of Kerala,
and, in addition, 24 and 25 December, Good Friday, Easter, Saturday, and
Easter Sunday
In international contracts, both continental and Anglo - American lawyers are
careful to include such definitions.
Some words always cause trouble unless drafters carefully define them. For
instance, the Conditions of contract published in 1987 by the Federation
Internationale des Ingeniurs Conseils (FIDIC) for Electrical and Mechanical
preamble: phan mo dau
assignee: nguti &Ito chuyen nhutng

Easter Saturday: Thu bay Le phuc sinh
Easter Sunday: Chu nhat Le phuc sinh up front: phan deu
Good Ftiday:thir turtle Phyc Sinh, tha 6 tuan Thanh
incorporate: gam, g6p
letter of acceptance: thtr chip nhan tre 47 Works begins with thirty - seven definitions. Some examples:
"Contractor" means the person whose tender has been accepted by the
Employer and the legal successors in title to the Contractor but not "except
with the consent of the Employer" any assignee of the Contractor "Contract" means the agreement between the Employer and the Contractor
for the execution of the works incorporating the Conditions, Specification,
Employer's Drawings and Contractor's Drawings, Price and completed
Schedules, Tender, Letter of Acceptance and such further documents as may
be expressly incorporated by the Letter of Acceptance "Foreign Currency" means a currency of a country other than that in which
the Plant is to be installed "Plant" means machinery, apparatus, materials and all things to be provided
under the Contract for incorporation in the works
A definition, as you see, performs two different tasks:
Task 1. Choosing a Meaning If a word has several meanings, a definition pinpoints the agreed meaning. The
FIDIC definition of foreign currency does this. (The word foreign changes its
meaning according to the nationality of the writer, so a single, agreed meaning
is essential).
Task 2. Assigning a Meaning If the parties attach a special meaning to a term - if they go beyond its normal
dictionary meaning - then the definition explains this special meaning. The
FIDIC definitions of contractor and contract work in this way. (No dictionary
defines contract as "the agreement between the Employer and the Contractor
for the execution of the Works, etc"). This is a special meaning agreed by the
parties)
48 Any defined term is usually capitalized throughout the text of the contract,
either the whole word or simply the first letter is printed in capital letters. This
alerts the reader to the special definition.
As a general principle: every term that the parties discuss in detail during the
negotiation is defined under Definitions at the start of the contract.
4. SOME SPECIMEN DEFINITIONS The most common wording at the start of the definitions section is like this: 1. Definitions
In this contract, the following terms shall be interpreted as indicated:
1.1. "The Contract" means the agreement entered into
The wording below is more careful:
1. Interpretations
The following interpretations of terms shall apply except where the context
otherwise indicates:
1.1. "Acceptance" means the issue of a Quality Assurance and Acceptance
Certificate by the Contractor subject to...
The purpose of writing "except where the context otherwise indicates" is to
avoid a common problem: the use of a defined word in a different context. For
example, some contracts define the word works: f. "Works" means all plant to be provided and work to be done by the
Contractor under the Contract alert: bao dQng
capitalize: vi6t hoa enter into: giao
pinpoint: khu bi6t, chi doh 49 If the contract somewhere speaks of "Delivery ex works", then clearly the
defined meaning of works cannot apply. The drafter avoids this problem with
the words "except where the context otherwise indicates".
A full definition often includes more than direct, formal definition. Sometimes
it adds examples or a "negative definition": a statement of what the term does
not mean. The definition below uses both examples and a negative definition. 1.12. "TECHNICAL DATA" shall mean any information
directly related to the design, engineering, development,
production, processing, manufacture, use, operation, overhaul,
repair, maintenance, modification or reconstruction of the MP2
system, associated equipment or spare parts Formal
Definition Such data includes, for example, information in the form of
blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, instructions, computer
software and documentation Examples It does not include information containing general scientific,
mathematical or engineering principles Negative

IN WITNESS whereof the parties hereto have caused this contract to be
executed in accordance with their respective laws the day and the year first
above written. 51 5.2. In 20..., Verbena Storage bought from Northern Chipboard technology for
making warehouse shelves from chipboard planks. For a period of five years,
Verbena Storage agreed to purchase the board directly from Northern.
Unfortunately, in tropical humidity, the boards bend under the weight of stored
components. Verbena Storage asks for help, Northern refuses. Verbena Storage
re-reads the contract. The relevant clause says : Northern warrants the suitability of the chipboard for the manufacture of
storage shelves without defects under normal conditions. This warranty does
not apply in the event of incorrect use of the Chipboard. Further, the
warranty is void if shelves are used under improper conditions Northern says tropical heat and humidity are not "normal conditions" and
installing shelves in tropical warehouses is "improper use". Verbena Storage
disagrees. Obviously the words normal and improper need interpretation. The
recital helps here: WHEREAS the Northern Chipboard Company has worldwide expertise in
the manufacture of chipboard for all types of storage.
AND WHEREAS the Chipboard has been successfully used in all parts of
the world for the manufacture of storage shelves... 1. Underline the words in the recital that help Verbena Storage.
2. Northern and Verbena Storage interpret normal and improper differently.
Which interpretation is supported by the recital? 5.3. Verbena Fan makes electric power fans for industrial applications. Verbena

For a period of five years after the coming into force of the contract, the
Supplier shall inform the Receiver of all modifications to technical data
without delay, and supply copies of modified technical data as necessary The maintenance manual for the fans uses many photographs to help repairmen
who speak little English. Four years after the contract comes into force, the
maintenance manual is revised. BEC sends Verbena Fan the text of the new
manual but not the new photographs. When Verbena Fan asks for the
photographs, BEC says that the photographs are not "technical data" but merely
an aid to repairmen.

without delay: ngay, khOng cham tre 53 Part 4 THE PARTIES TO A CONTRACT
1. THE NAMES OF THE PARTIES TO A CONTRACT International companies often have subsidiaries with similar names. This can
create confusion. Worse, it allows a deliberate "dirty trick" on the part of an
international company. What is this trick, and how can you prevent it?
It is essential to discover the exact name of the company with whom you sign a
contract. If you notice a difference between the name on the contract and the
name on the company's letterhead, start asking questions: you may be dealing
with an undercapitalized subsidiary.
On the first page of most contracts is the name of each party. When it first
appears, the name is normally the full, registered name of the company. Often a
few words of description follow, perhaps the state of registration or the place of
the company's head office.
Some companies have complex names, for example, The Smith, Jones,
Wrangel and Ironside Supply Company Inc. To avoid repeating this formula
during the contract, a short - form follows the first use of the name. The short form may be a specific name:
The Smith, Jones, Wrangel and Ironside Supply Company Inc., a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, having
offices in San Francisco, California, hereinafter called "SMITH"
Or a generic description: The Verbena Docklands Procurement Company, a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of the Republic of Verbena having offices in Port
Mary, Verbena hereinafter called "BUYER"
dirty trick: tro bgn thiu hereinafter: sau day 54 subsidiary: cling ty con
undercapitalized: kh6ng du vdn The use of short - forms saves space and reduces the risk of mistyping. If a
name appears in different forms in a contract, there can be legal problems.
Many contracts capitalize the short - form throughout the contract; this tells
readers that a short - form is used.
2. THE SIGNATURE The formulas used to sign contracts are sometimes antiquated and hard to
understand. Although serious mistakes are unlikely, it helps to understand the
meaning behind the formulas.
In the Anglo - American tradition, the parties sign the contract to "witness" it,
that is, to prove that they reached this agreement.
Anglo - American contracts and it is always the case with Vietnamese
contracts, are sometimes "sealed", i.e., a company seal is fixed to the contract.
a company seal is fixed to the contract. The use of the seal sometimes changes
the way that the law applies to the contract.
Sometimes the signatures of the parties are themselves "witnessed". This means
that a third party states that the signature is genuine.
Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a "signature" is anything that a
party uses to authenticate the agreement.
The traditional formula at the end of a simple agreement says:
In Witness Whereof,
We have this 16 th day of March 2000 made and signed this Agreement In Anglo - American contracts, the formula sometimes includes mention of a
seal:
In Witness Whereof,
The parties hereto have set their hands and seals this 16 th day of March 2000 antiquated: co to authenticate: chimg thut generic description: m6 6' dac tinh chung
mistyping: danh may sai 55 The seal was once a large disk of red wax with an impression on it. Mostly
today seal is replaced by the two letters L.S. (Latin Locus sigilli = the place of
the seal). What is the significance of the seal? Ever less. Under some laws
within the Anglo - American family, some ancient rules still apply, for
example:
- An offer under seal is not revocable;
The Statute of Limitations is longer on a sealed contract. (This means
the right to raise a legal action running for a longer time);
A contract under seal requires no consideration.
The UCC has radically changed the rules in the United States:
Seals inoperative
§2.203. The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an
offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing, a sealed instrument
and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract
or offer.
In plain language, a seal on an offer or a procurement contract has no major
significance.
You may see an even longer formula on some contracts:
Signed, Sealed and Delivered...
The meanings of Signed and Sealed are clear - but what is Delivered ? "Delivered"
means physically giving the signed and sealed contract to the other person. The
usage comes from the law of sealed instruments. Until a contract under seal has
been physically given - delivered - to the other person, it is not valid.
Sometimes when the parties sign a contract, the signatures are "witnessed" (the
genuineness of the signature is confirmed) by a third party - a marriage contract
is the classic case. In commercial contracts, the applicable law decides about
the witnessing of signatures. Consult your lawyer for the appropriate formula.
In the Anglo - American world, simpler formulas are gaining favour. For
example:
THE PARTIES, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, have executed
this agreement as of the date first set forth above
seal: con clau, (big dau 56 statute of limitation: 144 thai hle'u Naturally international contracts written in English but under a Continental Law
also favour shorter, clearer formulas.
3. THE ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES A contract that allows assignment (= sale, gift, etc.) of rights and duties is
dangerous. It allows the parties to pass on their duties to third parties, perhaps
to subsidiaries or even total outsiders.
Most applicable laws allow assignment of rights but not of duties. Normally, do
not accept a contract that allows assignment of duties. A clause expressly
forbidding all assignment without the agreement of both parties is often useful.
Sometimes a contract contains a clause like this:
Assignment Neither the rights and duties under this contract nor the contract itself may be
assigned by either party, either in whole or in part, without the prior written
approval of the other party
Assignment is a general word for transfer. Sale is a kind of assignment, as are
gift and exchange. Unless the parties agree otherwise, most legal systems allow
the assignment of rights but forbid the assignment of duties. In general, this is
fair. The assignment of a right (the right to collect payment, for example) hurts
no one. The assignment of a duty (for example, the duty to carry out research
and development into a new process) can change a contract completely.
In principle, try to forbid assignment without the consent of both parties.
Some specimen clauses The clause below is a standard provision in tender documents; it simply restates
the normal legal position.
The supplier shall not assign, in whole or in part, its obligation to perform
under the Contract, except with the purchaser's prior written consent

by and between
The HURD COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION
a Delaware corporation,
with offices at 4848 Main Street, Cardiff, California
(hereinafter called HCC or BUYER)
and
the VERBENA PARTS PROCUREMENT COMPANY
with facilities at 10 Francis Street, Verbena City
(hereinafter called VERBENA PARTS or SELLER).
1. What is the meaning of the expression "a Delaware corporation"?
2. If you had received letters from Hurd under the letterhead Hurd
Communication Inc., what action would you take?
3. In this contract, each company has two names (HCC or BUYER, and
CERBENA PARTS or SELLER). What is the reason for this double
wording? 58 4.2. The UCC contains three main provisions on signatures: A contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not
enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing to
indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed
by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent
or broker "Signed" includes any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present
intention to authenticate a writing Authentication may be printed, stamped or written. It may be by initials or
thumbprint. It may be on any part of the document, and in appropriate cases,
be found in a billhead or letterhead. No catalog of possible authentications
can be complete and the court must use common sense and commercial
experience in passing on these matters. The question is always whether the
symbol was executed by the party with the present intention to authenticate
the writing In the eyes of the UCC, which of the following are properly authenticated
agreements?
1. A contract bearing two authorized signatures q NO
q UNCLEAR q YES
2. An unsigned Confirmation of Order on company stationery q NO
q UNCLEAR q YES
3. An agreement "signed" with an X
q YES q UNCLEAR q NO
59 4. An agreement bearing the initials of one of the parties and the note
"Still needs a couple of changes" q NO
q YES q UNCLEAR
5. The same agreement as in 4, but without the note q NO
q YES q UNCLEAR
6. A tape recording of one of the parties saying "I agree to the whole text
exactly as it stands" q NO
q YES
q UNCLEAR 60 Part 5 GOODS AND DELIVERY, PRICE AND PAYMENT
The first question about a contract concern the exchange: "What am I giving?"
and "What am I getting?". This part studies the underlying "deal": what will the
seller deliver, how and when; what will the buyer pay, how and when. In more
formal terms, Scope and Delivery, Price and Payment.
1. SCOPE AND DELIVERY A scope clause explains (often in outline only) what the seller must supply. The
delivery clause establishes how delivery is to be made, what counts as delivery,
the delivery date, and what counts as delay. It regulates the passage of risk and
title, and it states the consequences of non-excusable delay.
The scope provisions in a contract take so many forms and are so technical that
a full discussion is well beyond our present purposes. In fact, contracts often
recognize this fact: the scope clause can be very short, referring the reader to
technical specifications else where. For example: Performance of the Contract and Technical Requirement
The requirements of the Contract and any amendments thereto shall be
performed in accordance with the Order issued by the Supplier to the Purchaser
The Supplier is required to deliver an Item or Items which meet the
requirements of the Specification shown in the Order in all respects non-excusable: kh6ng the tha 1110' chtdc order: Lenh, chi th! scope: pham vi, d6i tucing ale hp (king 61 or
Scope of Services The Contractor agrees to carry out a feasibility study according to the Statement
of Work (SoW) (Annex 2) prepared on the basic of the Ministry Requirement
(MR) (Annex 1)
This separation of obligations and specifications is valuable source of clarity:
the manager or risk analyst gains an overview of the contract without drowning
in technical detail.
Step 1. How will Delivery be made? In a simple sales contract, a key provision explains how the seller will make
delivery. For example:
For the equipment listed in Annex 1 the price is for delivery free on board the
carrying vessel designated by the Buyer at the port of Hai Phong including
expenses for the stowing and packing, as well as expenses incurred before
loading the equipment on board the carrying vessel
The ways in which a seller delivers goods are few and standard. For this reason,
contracts often use a standard term: the Incoterms are best known. The 13
Incoterms have clearly established meanings; the ICC lays down exactly the
duties of the buyer and the seller for each term. The 13 terms are grouped in
four categories: E-term, F-terms, C-terms and D-terms. clarity: sang saa
drown: chim, ch6t du6i
stowing: san x6p 62 Group Term Term in full When Delivery made E- Term EXW Ex Works When goods are available at

free on board: giao lOn tau C- Terms D- Terms 63 Using the Incoterm FOB, the complicated delivery clause above reads:
The equipment listed in Annex 1 shall be delivered FOB Hai Phong (Incoterms
1990) Step 2. What if the Goods are ready but Delivery is Impossible?
FOB delivery takes place when the goods cross the ship's rail. Payment is
usually tied to delivery. What happens, though, if the ship is late? The goods
are ready, but the seller, through no fault of his own, cannot deliver. The careful
seller makes a special provision to cover this problem: If the vessel named by the buyer fails to arrive on or before the agreed delivery
date, then the seller may at his discretion deliver the goods to a bonded
warehouse in the port of Hai Phong, and shall be deemed to have fulfilled its
delivery obligations under this contract
This is only one example. If the parties foresee any kind of problem, they,
should regulate it in the contract.
Step 3. What is the Date of Delivery?
Normally a delivery date is clearly fixed - but there can be problems. "Delivery
shall be made on or before 11 April 20..." looks clear, but is delivery at thirty
seconds past midnight on 12 April also timely? In most cases, probably it is.
In some situations, however, exact timing is essential, for example `just in
time" delivery of components to a modern production line. In such cases,
lawyers say that "time is of the essence". Some contracts have time is of the
essence stamped on them to make the point clear. Buyers often add a clause
like the one below to a procurement contract: at one's discretion: dkra vao sir suy xot
be tied to: On yen
bonded warehouse: kho ngoai quan
ship's rail: Ian can tau
64 Time is, and shall remain, of the essence of this agreement, and no acts of the
Buyer, including without limitation to, modification of this order or acceptance
of late deliveries, shall constitute waiver of this provision
The Seller shall immediately notify the Buyer of any actual or potential event,
including in particular any labor dispute, which is delaying or threatens to delay
the timely performance of this agreement Step 4. When do Risk and Title Pass? Risk means legal responsibility for goods; title means ownership of goods. In
theory at least, the two problems are entirely separate. First then, assuming the
use of Incoterms, let's look at risk.
Transfer of Risk The risk for loss of or damage to the goods... passes from the seller to the
buyer when the seller has fulfilled his obligation to deliver the goods
(Incoterms 1990, p.117.)
That is the general principle: risk passes not with physical delivery, but when
the seller has fulfilled his obligations to deliver. This can be earlier than
physical delivery if the buyer "does not take delivery as agreed or fails to give
such instruction... as the seller may require in order to fulfill his obligation to
deliver the goods "(p.117). At what point, then, does risk normally pass? The
chart below shows the point for each of the Incoterms. It's important to note
that risk passes for the three most common terms (FOB, CFR, and CIF) at the
ship's rail. assuming: gia SCI, cho rang
physical delivery: giao hang mang tinh vat chat
risk: rui ro
title: sa hitu 65 E- Term EXW When goods are at the disposal of the buyer at the place

destination DDP When goods are at the disposal of the buyer at the place of
destination C- Terms D- Terms Transfer of Title
The problem of title ownership) is more complicated. An example: an
aircraft engine is ordered from England by a French shipping company on
behalf of a Nepalese buyer who wants to take delivery in Bangladesh. Half the
price is paid in advance. The ship stops in Portugal where its cargo is
impounded by a court order issued in Germany for a debt contracted by the
ship-owner in Norway. Who owns the engine? Heaven knows!
impounded: ttch thu 66 Many sellers want to retain ownership of their goods until the buyer has paid
for them. Problems in retaining ownership arise when goods are partly paid for,
when the buyer goes bankrupt and has many creditors, and in many other
situations. What are the ground- rule? In 1989, the ICC published Retention of
Title: A Practical Guide to 19 National Legislations. As the name of this book
suggests, this question is still a matter of national rather than international
practice.
Step 5. What Delay is Excusable?
A seller who agrees to deliver on a particular date must accept that late delivery
will be "punished" in some way. Accordingly sellers try to add provisions to a
contract that soften the delivery date, while buyers resist such softening. You
have probably met two softeners: (a) the grace period and (b) the force majeure
provision.
Grace Period
The grace period is usually expressed at the beginning of the clause dealing
with the consequences of delay: If delivery is not effected within two weeks of the agreed delivery date for
reasons other than Force Majeure, then the seller shall pay...
In other words, problems begin only when delivery is two weeks late. The
effect of this two-week grace period is not quite the same as a delivery date two
weeks later, the seller has an early good-faith target to meet: the buyer can exert
a great deal of moral pressure before the mechanism of the "penalty" takes
over. Even so, grace periods are not common. Force Majeure
The force majeure provision is normal practice. The seller says: "I'll do my
part, but if something happens that is beyond my control, you can't expect me
to pay a "penalty" excusable: co the tha tht? duvc grace period: an han ground-rules: quy thc can ban
good faith: thin chi, tinh ngay that national legislations: quyen lap phap cOa cac quOc gia
retention of the title: quyen so him
retain: gill' duvc 67 Force Majeure If either party is prevented from, or delayed in performing any obligation under
this contract by reason of a force majeure event, then this party is not
considered to be in default and no remedy, be it under this contract or
otherwise, is available to the other party
Force majeure events include, but are not limited to: wars, riots, insurrections,
acts of sabotage, or similar occurrences; strikes, lockouts, or other labor unrest;
newly introduced laws or government regulations; fire, explosion, or other
unavoidable accident; flood, storm, earthquake, or other abnormal natural
events
Some items on the list are controversial: strikes and lockouts, for example.
Since the term "force majeure" is not a traditional Anglo- American term and
has no generally accepted definition, international contracts often agree a list of
force majeure events.
The ICC has developed an alternative strategy. It has drafted a detailed
comprehensive force majeure provision of nine clauses. In summary:
1. The principle of force majeure: some events are simply beyond the
control of the parties;
2. A list of such events;
3. A list of events that are not force majeure events;
4. The duty to notify the other party of the event;
5. The time at which the duty to perform is suspended;
6. What duties are suspended;
7. How long the suspension may continue;
8. The right of termination after a certain time;
9. Financial settlement if the contract is terminated.
Few contracts contain such detailed and valuable stipulation. If force majeure is
likely to be a problem in your own contracts, you should study the ICC
provision in detail. If you like it, you can incorporate the provision into the
by reason of: vi
default: CO 161
force majeure: bat kha khang 68 contract by using the reference clause. For example:
The Force Majeure (Exemption) clause of the International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC Publication No 421) is hereby incorporated in this contract
Close to the issue of force majeure is the issue of hardship - frustration and
impossibility. This subject is discussed as part of the legal framework of the
contract.
Step 6. What are the consequences of Non- Excusable Delay?
The consequences of a failure to perform any of the major duties under the
contract - in particular delivery, payment and making good of defects - are
much the same: the party at fault can pay money, or the party not at fault can
end the contract. This is a complicated issue involving at least three major
contract provisions. Accordingly you will find a full - length discussion of
consequences in the following parts.
2. PRICE AND PAYMENT Payment follows much the same pattern as delivery: how payment must be
made; what counts as payment; when payment is due; what counts as delay;
and the consequences of delay.
Deciding the right price for goods and services is a commercial problem, not a
legal one; lawyers are more interested in payment. Construction contracts,
however, involve complex pricing strategies.
Payment is often a simple enough procedure, but unfortunately payment
provisions in many contracts lack important detail, for example, this clause was
part of an international contract:
The price payable for the equipment specified in Annex 3 is USD500,000 (five
hundred thousand US dollars); The full contract price is payable within thirty
days of receipt of invoice frustration: kh6ng the thur hien duvc (hqp dOng)
frustration and impossibility: kh6ng the trait hien duvc (hqp dOng)
make good: 1)0 dap
reference clause: dieu khan tham khao, hOi chi suspend: glen doer?, treo
suspension: su• glen doan
terminate: k6t thOc
termination: stf Vet thuc
the party at fault: ben c6 loi 69 If payment is delayed in such a case, the seller is unsure of his rights, and the
buyer does not know what claims can be made against him - a dangerous
situation for both sides. Careful drafting of a price and payment clause follows
five steps:
Step 1. How will payment be made?
Trade within a country is based on a mixture of trust and the close proximity of
courts of law. International business is not so blessed: Trust is rare, and the
courts are far away and unpredictable. Payment is, therefore, tightly controlled.
The most common type of payment is the confirmed, irrevocable letter of
credit. Typically a contract stipulates: The Buyer, on receipt of the Confirmation of Order from the Seller, shall at
least 20 days prior to the date of delivery open a confirmed, irrevocable letter of
credit with a first class international bank; 20% of credit shall be available
against the Seller's draft accompanied by invoice; the remaining 80% shall be
available against the Seller's draft accompwlied by the shipping documents
If the buyer is to pay by normal "inland" means s'ich as a check or bank
transfer, then a bank guarantee or a stand-by letter of credit removes the seller's
risk - and these instruments are cheaper for the buyer. The seller usually wants
to specify the currency of payment.
Step 2. What counts as Payment?
When Ali Aziz instructs his bank in sunny Verbena to pay BEC in rainy
Europe, he begins a chain of events that often takes months to complete.
Perhaps the National Bank of Verbena has no funds to make foreign transfers;
perhaps inefficiency delays payment. Of course, the Letter of Credit avoids
such problems, but payment against invoice is still common and buyers must
prefer to pay in this way. To avoid the dangers of late payment, sellers try to
protect themselves with a clause like this:
Payment shall be deemed to have been made only when the contract sum is
paid into the Seller's bank account and is at the Seller's full disposal confirmed irrevocable letter of credit: tin dung thtr khong the h6y ngang durfc xac nhan
due: den han thank toan
proximity: svgan, la can 70 Step 3. What is the Date of Payment?
The date of payment for a single sale is simply regulated, in an ongoing
contract - a construction contract, a patent licence or a spare parts supply
contract, for example - the parties must agree a chain of dates. These are either
calendar dates (for example, 30 th June) or interval times (for example, within 30
days of the date of invoice). When work is carried out over a long period, the
parties agree an elaborate system of stage payments (often called "milestone
payment").
Step 4. What Delay is Excusable?
As with delivery, delay in payment might be excused during a grace period,
though this is very unusual. More commonly, a force majeure event excuses
delay. (One wording of a force majeure provision was given in the previous
section). In fact, the force majeure excuse for delay seldom makes sense in the
context of payment; most sellers try to resist it.
Step 5. What are the Consequences of Non Excusable Delay?
- The cost of late payment is easily assessed: the buyer must pay interest on the
outstanding sum. Typically, the rate of interest is geared to interest rates in the
seller's country. The Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs - Conseils
(FIDIC) suggest in the 1987 version of their Conditions of Contract for
Electrical and Mechanical Works the following provision: Delayed Payment 33.6
If payment of any sum payable... is delayed, the Contractor shall be entitled to
receive interest on the amount unpaid during the period of delay. Unless
otherwise stated in Part II the interest shall be at an annual rate three percentage
points above the discount rate of the central bank in the Contractor's country;
The Contractor shall be entitled to such payment without formal notice and
without prejudice to any other right or remedy at one's disposal: do ai d6 doh doat
draft: ho'i phi6u
stand-by letter of credit: tin dung thy dt..v phOng
at annual rate: theo 4%10 thuting nien elaborate: chi tiet h6a
gear: dik chinh theo...
make sense: c6 nghia
outstanding sum: khoan tien chua tra
without prejudice: khOng bat) In
(trach nhi0m) 71 An earlier version of these Conditions was, arguable, more favorable to the
buyer:
...the Contractor shall be entitled... to receive interest calculated at the rate or
rates which the Contractor's bank, named in the Appendix to the Tender, would
have charged the Contractor to borrow the amount of the delayed payment
during the period of delay
The principle is clear: the seller is entitled to compensation for losses due to
late payment.
3. COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS 3.1. The clause below is typical of the terms dictated by a strong seller to a
weak buyer
Delay in Delivery 1. Dates of delivery are the date of despatch ex the supplying works
2. The delivery dates apply only on condition that all details of the Order are
promptly and completely clarified and any domestic and foreign certificates
required are promptly submitted
3. In the event of the Seller being unable to despatch the goods in due time for
reasons beyond the Seller's control, the delivery dates shall be deemed
complied with upon the Seller notifying the Buyer that the goods are ready
for despatch
1. Clause 2 mentions four things the buyer must do in order to make the
seller keep the delivery dates. What are these four things?
a c d 2. Of these four things, how many are objective conditions? In other words,
is it possible for both sides, or an outsider, to agree on the exact meaning

2. With the Coming Into Force of the contract, the Buyer shall furnish the
Seller with an unconditional bank guarantee issued by a first class bank for
fifteen percent of the contract sum. The guarantee shall conform with the

3. Within twenty days of receiving the Seller's shipping advice, the Buyer shall
open with a first class bank an Irrevocable Letter of Credit in favor of the
Seller and valid for one year. The Letter of Credit shall be for seventy - five

1. WARRANTY AND GUARANTEE
A guarantee is a promise about somebody else's performance. A warranty is a
promise about your own. When businessmen speak of the "seller's guarantee"
or "warranty" they mean the seller's liability for defects. To avoid confusion,
many drafters today use the term Defects Liability Provision.
A warranty is a promise you make about your own performance. The word is
used in several contexts. A warranty of title, for example, is a promise to a
buyer that the seller really owns the goods he is selling. A product warranty is a
promise by the seller to make good any defects in his products. And there are
two parties to warranty: the buyer and the seller
A guarantee, on the other hand, involves three parties. The guarantor makes a
promise to one party on behalf of another
Internationally, the distinction between warranty and guarantee is not so clear.
First, businessmen loosely use the two words as though they mean the same
thing. This is confusing. Others believe that a warranty covers materials and
workmanship, while a guarantee covers specifications. This is a mistaken idea.
Does it matter? In fact, yes. Confusion between warranty and guarantee
could be dangerous. Let's say a contract is written in English, but German law
applies. German law makes a clear distinction between a "warranty"
(guarantee) The seller's obligations are different under a "guarantee". So loose
English could get you into trouble!
- guarantee: bao lanh, bao hanh guarantee and warranty: = defect liabilities: trach nhiOm d6i vdri khiem khuye't product warranty: bao hanh san pha'm
warranty: bao dam, bao hanh
warranty of title: bao dam quyen so hCru 75 As a general rule, incorrect use of "guarantee" causes trouble: use the word
only if you mean a third - party guarantee.
Many contracts avoid the problem by speaking of defects liability rather than of
warranty. This is exactly the right concept, as we shall see in the next section.
2. THE DEFECTS LIABILITY PERIOD A warranty protects both seller and buyer. The seller is protected against the
accusation that he has breached the contract if some goods are defective. The
buyer is protected against defects in the goods he buys. Some defects are
apparent when the goods are delivered, but this is unusual. Most defects are
latent. Defects are of three kinds: workmanship, materials, and design. Failure
to meet specifications is a design defect. Problems caused by misuse or wear
and tear are not defects.
A defects liability provision (or warranty) puts into words what everyone
accepts: not all products are perfect on delivery. This provision covers defects
that are present at the moment of delivery. Normally quality control prevents
products with obvious defects from leaving the factory, so "defects" normally
means hidden or latent defects. Defects may be in workmanship, in materials,
or in design.
The defects liability period (or warranty period) is the period during which the
seller is liable for, and must make good any defects that are apparent on
delivery or that come to light later.
A defects - liability provision, then, covers defective workmanship, materials
and design. Just as important is what it does not cover. The two most common
exclusions are (a) fair wear and tear and (b) misuse by the buyer.
A specimen clause
The defects liability provision below is taken from a standard procurement
contract for a major aircraft project. hidden: an latent: Sn
76 Warranty
The Supplier warrants that each Item supplied under this contract (and each
part thereof) shall at the date of its acceptance:
(i) be free from defects in material
(ii) be free from defects in workmanship including but not limited to
all manufacturing processes
(iii) be free from defects inherent in design including but not limited to
selection of materials, and
(iv) be fit for the purpose for which the Item is normally used
If it is discovered in the Item or in any part thereof any defect or deficiency,
then the Supplier shall either repair or replace such item or rectify such
deficiency
The warranty above is subject to the purchaser having adhered to the
procedures or instructions applicable to the use, storage, installation or
operation of the Item and expressly excludes all damage arising from wear
and tear to the Item in normal use 3. REMEDY The seller normally wants to control over how he will correct defects. If the
buyer is allowed to repair the goods, the contract must specify the
circumstances exactly.
The defects liability provision allows the seller to put problems right. Usually
the seller can either repair or replace a defective product. Who decides? The
seller likes to include the words "at his discretion"; buyers normally resist this: If, during the defects liability period, any defect comes to light in any item of
supply, then the seller shall, at his discretion, repair or replace the item
Another common choice, especially for superficial defects is reduction of the
price, with the consent of the buyer, of course. inherent: a bOn trong/ an
wear and fear: hao mem tin nhiOn rectify: seta china
at one's discretion: theo su suy xet cCia ai db 77 Some contracts allow the buyer to repair the product, perhaps at the seller's
expense. If the repair simply involves replacing a throw - away module, the
seller is probably with this procedure.
Two specimen clauses
The provision below makes the seller's responsibilities particularly clear: Defects Liability
The Seller shall warrant that the goods are made of the best materials, with
first class workmanship, are brand new, unused, and comply in all respects
with the quality and performance specifications given in Annex B. The seller
shall warrant that the goods, when correctly mounted and properly operated
and maintained, shall give satisfactory performance for a period of twelve
months
If any defect in materials, workmanship or design or any discrepancy with
specifications comes to light during the warranty period, and if the Buyer
makes the defect or discrepancy the subjects of a claim, the Seller shall at his
own cost and expense satisfy the claim, subjects to the agreement of the
buyer, in one of the following ways:
a. Agree to the rejection of the goods and refund to the Buyer the value
of the goods rejected
b. Reduce the price of the goods according to the degree of inferiority,
to extent of damage, or amount of loss suffered by the buyer
c. Replace the defective goods with new goods which conform to the
quality and performance specifications given in Annex B
d. Repair the defective goods to bring them in conformity with the
quality and performance specifications given in Annex B
e. Allow the Buyer or a third party appointed by the Buyer to repair
the defective goods and to bring them in conformity with the quality
and performance specifications given in Annex B at the Seller's risk
and cost consent: them th4n, dung }"/
superficial: ben ngoai, hien till
mount: hip rap 78 Such a clause is tough on the seller. Some contracts go even further especially
in a "Buyer's market". The following clause (from a spare - parts supply
contract) imposes an onerous duty on the seller:
When a latent defect or other warranty claim in the supplies occurs to the
same item of supply more than once, the Supplier shall, at its own expense,
correct or replace all like items already delivered or to be delivered
Sellers are unhappy about such unusual demands; they carefully price the risk
involved and increase the contract price accordingly. This is, of course, a
general rule: the tougher the warranty, the higher the contract price.
4. THE TIMING OF TIIE DEFECTS LIABILITY PERIOD
The defects liability period presents four separate timing problems. Many
contracts regulate only one. What are the other problems, should you regulate
them, and, if so, how?
The parties always fix the length of the defects liability period. Also important,
however, are (a) the time allowed to the buyer to notify the seller of a defect,
(b), the time the seller has to correct the defect, and (c) the period during which
the buyer can raise a legal action. Because national laws differ widely, the
parties often regulate these matters. 4.1. The Notification Period
In practice, many contracts do not put a precise time limit on the Notification
Period. Two examples: The buyer shall notify the Seller of defects without undue delay
or
If any such defect appears or damage occurs, the Employer of the Engineer
shall forthwith notify the Contractor thereof onerous duty: b6n phan Ong ne
at the seller's risk and cost: ngutri ban chiu moi rui ro ye phi ton extent: mCrc db
79 If both parties act in good faith, this "soft - edged" timeframe works well. If a
legal problem arises, the Anglo - American judge makes a fair estimate of
"undue delay", a :'reasonable time" or "forthwith". Such concepts are well
known to the law.
4.2. The Rectification Period
Rectification is similar to notification: the making good of defect without undue
delay" or "within a reasonable time" is a fair and normal contract requirement.
FIDIC (1987) says:
The Contractor shall make good the defect or damage as soon as practicable
and at his own cost @ 30.2).
4.3. The Legal action Period
After a lapse of time, legal claims become unenforceable. This "legal action
period" differs with the applicable law. In Germany, for example the Civil
Code (BGB) defines a legal action period equal to and concurrent with the
defects liability period.
5. WHO PAYS FOR CLAIMS UNDER WARRANTY? Who pays for making defects good? Normally the seller, but there are
exceptions. Further, if a machine breaks down, the buyer can face enormous
consequential losses. How does the contract handle this problem?
There are no standard defects liability provisions. The parties must negotiate
carefully. The stronger the buyer, the heavier the seller's liability.
A product warranty usually requires the seller to make good defects "at his own
expense". Some warranties, as we shall see in the Comprehension Questions,
are less generous to the buyer. Sometimes, the buyer must share the costs of
repair, must pay for shipping defective parts, or must pay the cost of sending a
repairman to the site. There are no standard clauses - The parties must negotiate
carefully every provision of a warranty.
The real risk for the seller is not, in fact, the cost of repairing and replacing
defective goods. That risk is in the price. The big risk is that he has to
compensate the buyer for "consequential damage" or "consequential loss".
Consequential losses (often called indirect loss) are dangerous. Most sellers try
to include a clause that limits their responsibility to direct losses only, for
example: .
forthwith: tut thi, trong vOng 24 giet concurrent: 00 hop vai
rectification: diet, chinh, sera chira lapse: qua di
consequential loss: ton thgt gian tigp (tOn thgt 0 hau qua cem vigc gi dO) 80 The Contractor shall not be liable to the Employer by way of compensation
for any loss of use of the works (whether complete or partial) or for any loss
of any profit or for any indirect or consequential damage that may be suffered
by the Employer
On the other hand, a strong buyer makes the seller accept such risks:
The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer against any loss or
damage whether direct or indirect suffered by the Buyer as the result of
defective or faulty goods delivered by the Seller 6. DEFECTS LIABILITY AND MAINTENANCE A strict line must be drawn between defects liability and maintenance. The
danger of a poorly drafted defects liability provision is that it shades over into a
maintenance clause.
The seller usually words the defects liability provision so that his only duty is
the making good of defects. If the buyer wants maintenance, then the parties
normally conclude a separate maintenance contract.
We have seen that a defects liability provision is normally limited "hidden"
defects in workmanship, materials or design. Sometimes, however, the supplier
agrees to keep equipment running despite fair wear and tear, misuse, accident,
and even force majeure events. This is not a defects liability provision - it is a
maintenance clause.
Under a maintenance clause, the seller says: "Whatever the cause of the
problem, I will keep your machine in working order". Normally the buyer pays
extra for this expensive service. For this reason, maintenance is often the
subject of a separate contract. For the seller, the danger is that: he writes a
warranty so badly that he accidentally adds maintenance to his normal duty to
repair and replace. It is also dangerous for the buyer. If maintenance is
important, then the supplier must carry it out faultlessly merely fulfilling
warranty obligations is not good enough for example. misuse: lam dung
shade over into: a mau thanh hold harmless = save harmless: lam cho ai clO khOng phai chiu (trach nhiam) ve... 81 Maintenance Period
a. The maintenance Period is a period of one year starting from the date
of the take - over of the works by the Purchaser
b. To the extent that the Works shall comply in all respects with the
contract, the Seller shall execute all such work of repair, amendment,
reconstruction, rectification and making good of defects,
imperfections, or other faults as may be required by the Engineer 7. COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

Many international contracts strengthen their provisions with penalties,
especially the provisions concerning delivery, payment and defects liability.
The value of the penalty is in terrorem (Latin for "as a means to terrorize").
Anglo - American courts, however, do not enforce penalties. Your contracts
may need rethinking if an Anglo - American law applies.
If one party suffers a loss because the other party fails to perform, then the
party at fault, must pay compensation. Some losses are exact. If exact
prediction is impossible, the contract often stipulates lump-sum compensation
for liquidated damages. This sum is normally payable regardless of the actual
loss incurred. If the lump - sum figure is far too high and if its purpose is to
force (or "terrorize") one party into performance, then it is a penalty.
We have talked about non-excusable delay: delivery is late and there are no
excuses, the seller has breached the contract. What happens in such cases of
non-performance?
If the contract says nothing, then the innocent party (in the case of late delivery,
the buyer; in the case of late payment, the seller) goes to law to obtain a
remedy- compensation for the loss he has suffered.
To avoid the expense and uncertainty of legal proceedings, most international
contracts specify the consequences of certain breaches, particularly late
payment, late delivery, and failure to repair under warranty.
If the buyer pays late, he must pay interest to the seller. The thinking is clear: if
the seller must borrow money from a bank because the buyer has not paid, tie
must pay interest to the bank. The bank interest is the harm the seller suffers. It
non performance: kh6ng thur hien - breach of contract: vi pharn hop d6ng 87 is easy to give a figure for the harm, and so the contract specifies compensation
equal to the harm: Delayed Payment If payment of any sum payable is delayed, the contractor shall be entitled to
receive interest on the amount unpaid during the period of delay
The interest shall be at an annual rate three percentage points above the
discount rate of the central bank in the Contractor's country
(FIDIC, 1987, @336)
2. LIQUIDATED DAMAGE: PROBLEMS National laws differ widely in their treatment of damages. Few generalizations
are possible. Most questions relating to damages are normally, however,
disposive. The parties can make whatever arrangements they wish. Clear
contracts regulate all potential problems.
Let's look at this typical liquidated damages clause: Liquidated Damages If the Seller fails to supply any or all of the Goods within the time period
specified in the Contract, the buyers shall notify the Seller that a breach of
contract has occurred and shall deduct from the Contract Price per week of
delay, as liquidated damages, a sum equivalent to one half percent of the
delivered price of the delayed Goods until actual delivery up to a maximum
deduction of 10% of the delivered price of the delayed Goods This clause covers the basic points: the breach of contract that triggers payment
of liquidated damages. It is required at that the buyer notify the seller that the
breach has occurred and of the amount of the damages and the ceilling. Many
contracts go no further than this. Unfortunately, however, several questions still
lack answers. disposive: khOng bAt buOc typical: dien hinh 88 Are Liquidated Damages Payable When There is No Loss?
The principle behind liquidated damages is this: if an objective condition
occurs (for example, delivery is a week late) the party at fault will compensate
the injured party, usually by paying money.
One immediate question arises. It is a principle of Anglo - American justice that
if you have suffered no loss you can claim no compensation. How does this
apply to late delivery? Often delivery a week late is a problem but sometimes
the delivered goods sit unused in a warehouse for weeks after delivery. There is
no loss at all. If there is no loss, are damages still payable? National attitudes
vary on this problem. In the U.S., for example, a court usually enforces the
Damages clause if the figure is a fair estimate, with or without loss (Groner,
p.326) Judges applying Swedish law might reach a different conclusion (ICC,
1990, p.40). For the contract drafter, the answer is to regulate the matter in the
contract:
Payment of liquidated damages is contingent exclusively upon late delivery
of the goods; in no case shall the buyer be required to substantiate any claim
for payment of liquidated damages with proof of loss or damage
Are Liquidated Damages Payable When There is No Fault?
A second problem: fault. If late delivery (or whatever) occurs but is not the
fault of the supplier, must the supplier still pay liquidated damages? The
question of force majeure was discussed in Part 4. Does force majeure excuse
payment of liquidated damages?
Normally, yes. But "normally" is not good enough for the careful drafter. Let's
modify an earlier example to clarify the issue of fault: Liquidated Damages
If the Seller fails to supply any or all of the Goods within the time period
specified in the Contract for reasons for which he is at fault, then the Buyer
shall deduct from the Contract price per week of delay, as liquidated
damages, a sum equivalent to one half percent of the delivered price of the
delayed Goods triger: lam ph& sinh
ceilling: gia tran, gia cao nhal contingent upon: le thueic
substantiate: an chCrng 89 Or, more favorably for the buyer: "whether or not the Seller is at fault". Is Payment an Alternative to Performance?
Sometimes a seller treats the liquidated damaged clause as an option - either
deliver on time or pay. Sometimes the seller may find it more convenient to
pay! To prevent this, the courts in many countries give the buyer a Decree of
Specific Performance; this forces the seller to deliver the goods.
Specific performance or an injunction may be granted to enforce a duty even
though there is a provision for liquidated damages for breach of that duty
Again national laws differ. Under Swiss law, "the exclusive penalty clause is a
special case which allows the promisor, if he so chooses, to pay the amount of
the penalty instead of performing the principal obligation" (ICC, 1990, p.42).
The promisor has the duty, however, of proving that the penalty clause in
question expressly allowed him that right.
The practical answer, once again, is careful contract drafting: The payment of liquidated damages shall not excuse the Seller from full
performance of any of his obligations under this Contract Is Compensation Allowed Beyond Liquidated Damages?
Under most laws, payment of liquidated damages satisfies the buyer's claim
against the seller. In the U.S., for example, "Enforceable liquidated damages
clauses take the place of judicial determination of damages" (Hoeber, p.345).
The situation under German law is, however, somewhat different: "In principle
the payment of the penalty does not stop the promise from proving the existence
of greater damage and claiming full compensation" (ICC, 1990, p.333). Paying
a penalty does not cut of further claims. In this case the naming of the clause is
all important. The matter, like most aspects of damages, is disposive under
most laws: the parties can agree to any arrangement they wish. Generally, the
seller prefers wording like this: to the exclusion: loai frit
cancellation: hay b3
at law: theo luat
in equity: theo le
full and complete satisfaction: thaa man day dei ye hoan town 90 The payment of liquidated damages shall comprise the full and complete
satisfaction of any claim the Buyer may have against the Seller; Any further
remedy, be it under this contract, at law or in equity, is expressly excluded
This is the basic Anglo - American understanding. The buyer, on the other
hand, prefers wording that follows the German line of thought: The payment of liquidated damages shall not limit the Buyer's right to seek
other remedies under this contract or otherwise; In particular, the right to seek
compensation for consequential damage shall not be excluded
Interestingly, the FIDIC Conditions make no direct reference at all to damages,
or to penalties. The result of late delivery is simply a reduction of the contract
price for each day of delay. The key wordir g is this: Delay in Completion
... Such reduction shall be to the exclusion of any other remedy of the
Employer in respect of the Contractor's failure to complete within the Time
for Completion
3. TERMINATION
When delay becomes intolerable, the buyer may wish to end the contract.
quick, clean death is better than a long, messy one. How is it achieved?
A full termination -fir - cause provision specifies exactly when the buyer can
end the contract; often it also protects the seller's rights.
According to at:: UCC, cancellation occurs when one party asks a court to end
a contract because the other has breached it. Cancellation is expensive, mesry
and unpredictable. For the seller, the danger is that he/she may receive no
payment for services rendered or goods delivered.
Termination (as the UCC conceives it) is an altogether tidier procedure:
to tt3 exclusion: d6i v6i viec loci trig
intolerable: khong the tha tin? duvc
conceive: nghi ra, tvang tuvng
termination - for - cause: k6t thQc co nguyOn cd outstanding sum: khoan chits thanh Oar) 91 contract provision states the circumstances under which the buyer can end or
terminate the contract. Such termination is often "for convenience": in this case,
the contract includes a winding - up procedure for final deliveries, final
payments, and so on. An example:
Termination for Convenience
1. The Purchaser may, by written notice to the Supplier, terminate the
contract in whole or in part, at any time for its convenience; The notice
of termination shall specify the extent to which performance of the work
under the Contract is terminated, and the date upon which such
termination becomes effective
2. The Goods that are complete and ready for shipment within 30 days after
the Supplier's receipt of the notice of termination shall be purchased by
the Purchaser at the Contract terms and prices
Termination 'for default" means that, under closely specified circumstances,
the buyer can end the contract:
Termination for Default
The Purchaser may, by written notice of default sent to the supplier, terminate
this contract in whole or in part:
a. If any delay in delivery due to force majeure exceeds 75 days; or
b. If any delay in delivery for reasons other than force majeure exceeds
30 days
This clause states two events that can trigger termination, but (at least) two
problems remain: (a) how does the buyer obtain the goods he contracted for and
urgently needs, and (b) how is the seller compensated for deliveries made so
far? The clause might go on to specify:
If the Purchaser terminates the Contract in whole or in part, then the
Purchaser may procure, upon such terms and in such a manner as it deems
termination "for default" : ke't th6c vi kh6ng c6 kith 'fang
the Wan
expire: het han 92 buyer - oriented: hutng toi ngtrai mua appropriate, goods similar to those undelivered, and the Supplier shall be
liable to the Purchaser for the excess cost of goods so procured over their
Contract price
If the Purchaser terminates the Contract, in whole or in part, then the
Purchaser shall pay the Seller all outstanding sums due for goods delivered
under this Contract, less any sums due to the Purchaser as liquidated damages
or for any other purpose; Payment of such sums shall be made only when all
warranties made by the supplier have fully expired
Such a clause, though it seems buyer - oriented, protects the rights of the seller
too. Cancellation of the contract and a court settlement are sometimes rather
less generous.
4. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY It is easy to stipulate a clause refusing to accept any liability whatsoever for
anything. But it is difficult to persuade the other party to accept it and to avoid
overstepping the limit of what the courts are ready to enforce.
With a few exceptions, the courts allow businessmen freely to allocate between
them the risks of doing business. Your contract can limit your risks as long as
the other side agrees to the limitation.
Openness and clarity are the keys; the courts do not enforce tricky wordings.
There are briefly four ways each side can limit its liability. Since many business
risks are taken by the seller, he or she normally adds limitation of liability
clauses to the contract. The buyer, on the other hand, tries to reduce their
impact. The four ways are as follows:
1. Ceilling
2. Roadblock
3. Iron curtain
4. Buck passing overstep: vtigt qua (gidi hen)
allocate: phan bo
tricky: bip bgm pinpoint: c6 dinh, an dinh
exposure: rdi ro ca the c6
impact: anh twang, tac dOng The worst comes to the worst: dieu xau nhat xay ra 93 4.1. The Ceiling
In analyzing the risks of a contract, the seller pinpoints his "exposure" (= his
possible loss) if the worst comes to the worst. In this process, he tries to set a
ceilling on payments for which he is liable: Delay
For each week of delay, the Seller shall pay 1% of the contract price up to a
maximum of 10% of the contract price
This wording puts a money ceilling on the seller's liability for delay. Another
common ceilling is the extent of insurance cover. Compensation
The Seller shall be obliged to compensate and save harmless the Buyer for
personal injury and property damage to the extent that the damage concerned
is covered by the Seller's insurance. On the Buyer's request, the Seller shall
hand over for inspection to the Buyer a copy of all relevant insurance policies
Similarly the seller often tries to limit his total liability under the contract: Total Liability
The total liability of the Seller for all claims for damages made against him
by the Buyer under this Contract or otherwise shall not exceed 10% of the
Contract price
Or Aggregate Damages
The aggregate amount of all damages (excluding liquidated damages as
referred to in @ 23 of this Contract) costs and expenses recoverable from the
money ceilling: s6 tion 161 da
insurance cover: pham vi bao hiem
total liability: trach nhiem t6i da
aggregate damage: ton that tong hop 94 recoverable: cO the hoar) tra
to be restricted to: hen the den (mire) Contractor is restricted to and in no case may exceed 3% of the Contract
value
In both these examples, the sum payable is fixed as a percentage of the contract
price; this is normal. Sometimes a money ceilling is set (for example,
"$50,000"). Sometimes, the calculation is more complicated (for example "$10
for every meter of cable delivered"). The parties agree whatever is appropriate
to their situation.
Ceillings are often set for a particular time; in this case guillotine is perhaps a
better word: Liabilities after Expiration of Defects Liability Period
The Contractor shall have no liability to the Employer for any loss of or
damage to the Employer's physical property which occurs after the expiration
of the Defects Liability Period unless caused by Gross Misconduct of the
Contractor (FIDIC, 1987, @42.3)
The "fiction" of delivery in accordance with the contract is a time - ceilling
favored by many sellers: Notification of Defects
If within twenty - one days of receipt of any consignment from the Seller, the
Buyer does not notify the Seller that the consignment is defective and submit
samples as evidence of defect, then the consignment shall be deemed to
comply in all respects with the specifications and the Buyer shall forego all
rights to reject the consignment
Such provision are usually enforceable provided they are not hidden or
obscurely worded * . physical property: tai san vat chat
gross misconduct: pham loi re' rang Ong tivn)
fiction: tuVng tuvng, hu'clu thoroughgoing: thang than, haan toan, dirt khoat 95 4.2. The Roadblock For the seller, risk attacks down many roads. The seller tries to block of as
many of these roads as possible. One ocmmon roadblock was discussed in Part
4: the force majeure provision. Force Majeure If either party is prevented from. or delayed in, performing any obligation
under this contract by reason of a force majeure event, then this party is not
considered to be in default and no remedy, be it under this contract or
otherwise, is available to the other party
An especially dangerous road for the seller is his liability for consequential loss
or damage. In Part 5, we saw the danger of a warranty claim going beyond the
simple duty to repair or replace. Sellers usually try to add a thoroughgoing
rejection of liability for consequential loss: Consequential Loss or Damage Performance of the said duty to repair or replace defective items or to pay
liquidated damages in the agreed amount shall constitute full and complete
satisfaction of any claim of the Buyer under this warranty. The Seller shall
not be liable to the Buyer, by way of compensation, for any loss of profit or
for any loss or consequential damage that may be suffered by the Buyer, or
for any other loss, injury, harm or damage however arising
As we have already seen, the buyer's interests are directly opposed: Seller's Liability The Seller shall indemnify and save harmless the Buyer against any loss or
damage whether direct or indirect suffered by the Buyer as the result of
defective or faulty goods delivered by the Seller
Unusual roads are open in many contract situations; again the seller tries to
block them off. In the clause below, for example, a contractor working on a
power plant in South Africa tries to limit his liability for sabotage: he says, in
effect, that sabotage by his workers is not breach of contract: 96 Contractor's Liability
The Contractor shall be liable for all acts and omissions of his servants,
agents, workmen and personnel. However, damage caused by the willful
intent of Contractor's servants, agents, workmen and personnel shall not give
rise to any claim for compensation for the Contractor
A common problem in international contracts is patent rights. If a French
supplier sells a machine to Verbena and a law suit begins in Verbena because a
local company claims patent rights over part of the machine, then who is liable
and who pays? Both the seller and the buyer have an interest in blocking off
this road. The clause below is from a contract between a Chinese importer and
a German supplier of steel-making machinery. The clause favors the Chinese
buyer:
Settlement of Claims by Third Parties
The Seller shall be responsible for taking up and settling all challenges,
claims or law suits brought by individuals, manufacturers, companies and
authorities of any country in connection with the know - how transferred to
the Buyer under this Contract. The Buyer shall take no responsibility, legal,
financial or otherwise, for such challenges, claims or law suits
The general rule: Wherever you foresee a risk in the contract, draft a roadblock
clause to reduce the risk or exclude it altogether.
4.3. The Iron Curtain "Everything that is not allowed is forbidden". This principle is helpful,
especially to the seller. Like the iron curtain of the post - war years, it blocks
off all avenues of approach apart from those deliberately kept open. Three
examples of iron - curtain clauses:
Comprehensiveness
The rights and duties provided for in this Contract are the only rights and
duties in case and in consequence of a breach of this contract by either party
and all further rights and duties, be they under this contract or otherwise, are
hereby expressly excluded sabotage: su pha hoai
omission: be) sOt to give rise to: lam phat sinh
challenge: tranh chgp, thach thitc willful: c6 .}"/ 97 Limitation of Liability
The Buyer's sole remedies for claims of any kind with respect to the products
furnished under this Agreement and with respect to all other performancs by
the Seller, under or in connection with this agreement or with respect to or in
any way connected with the manufacture, sale, handling use, repair,
maintenance or replacement of the products including liability arising out of
contract, strict liability, negligence, or any other tort shall be limited to those
remedies prescribed in the warranty section of this Agreement Exclusive Remedies
The Employer and the Contractor intend that their respective rights,
obligation and liabilities as provided for in these Conditions shall alone
govern their rights under the Contract and in relation to the Works. Accordingly, the remedies provided under the contract in respect of or in
consequence of:
a. any breach of contract, or
b. any negligent act or omission, or
c. death or personal injury, or
d. loss or damage to any property
are, save in the case of Gross Misconduct, to be the exclusion of any other
remedy that either may have against the other under the law governing the
Contract or otherwise. (FIDIC. 1987, @42.4)
In other words, "Everything that is not allowed is forbidden".
4.4. Passing the Buck
An indemnity passes your responsibilities to somebody else. This is fine, as

licensor: Nguti cap gigy phap long as the other side agrees to it. An indemnity simply says: "If anyone makes
me pay, then I will pass the bill to you, and you can pay it". The example below
comes from the procurement contract for an aircraft project: Product Liability The Supplier shall fully indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and
against any loss, liability or claim in respect of personal injury to, or the
death of, any person or any loss of or damage to any property of any kind
whatsoever arising out of or in connection with the possession, ownership,
use and operation of the Item by the Purchaser or any third party approved
by the Purchaser whether such Item is installed in an Aircraft or not Similar clauses occur in contracts where local taxation is a problem for a
foreign company: the local company agrees to "compensate and save harmless"
the foreigner.
Patent license agreements often indemnify the patent holder: If a lawsuit is
brought against him in the licensee's country, the licensee must "compensate
and save harmless" the licensor.
Indemnity clauses are, by their nature, unbalanced. They are usually a sign that
one side, buyer or seller, has the upper hand.
5. COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
5.1. A Fine Contract The following clause is (lightly) adapted from a contract for the construction of
a hydroelectric project. Fine Payable If the Contractor fails to complete the work at the fixed date, a fine shall be

fins shall be as follows:
2% for the first week, or any part of it;
4% for the second week, or any part of it;
6% for the third week, or any part of it; 99 8% per week for the fourth week, or part of it, and for all succeeding
weeks.

5.6. Contract Terms Inc Over a period of years, Smith hired equipment from South Wales Switchgear.
Each rental was the subject of a simple form contract provided by South Wales
Swithchgear. The contract stated that General Conditions of hire were available
"on request". In fact, South Wales had produced three editions of these
"General Conditions", the most recent in March 1990.
In 1987, a machine hired by Smith broke down and Smith lost a lot of money as
the result. Smith demanded compensation from South Wales. South Wales
pointed to their current (1990) General Conditions which disclaimed all
liability. Smith sued. The issue was this: Was South Wales' disclaimed all
liability part of their agreement or not?
Smith had never requested a copy of the 1990 General Conditions; however, he
had had a dispute in 1989 with South Wales Swichgear, and he had received at
the time a copy of the 1989 General Conditions (Smith v. South Wales

1. SOME LEGAL ASPECTS The package of rules governing business relationships is a very complex one.
Some rules are enforceable and some are only applicable if not otherwise
agreed. A certain practice may have developed in a certain field of business.
This section is not meant to be complete. It only gives the reader a general
introduction to the subject by explaining the fundamental rules of trade.
Whenever money is involved, disputes can arise even between best friends. A
written contract stating all agreements as detailed as possible is therefore
recommended for all purchases from local as well as from foreign sources.
A contract is binding whether it is written or oral. In the event an oral contract
between a supplier and a buyer is later confirmed in writing. The written
confirmation is binding on both parties if no objection is raised within a
reasonable time.
It is important to note that when a contract is reduced to writing, the written
evidence supersedes all prior oral evidence. This means that a buyer cannot
legally rely upon a vendor's oral statements concerning a material's
performance or warranty, unless the statements have been included in the
written agreement.
Consequently, from a legal standpoint, a buyer should consider carefully the
content of his oral negotiations with a vendor and ensure that he has reduced to
writing the relevant date which he wants to include as part of the contract. The
buyer should also be aware of the fact that courts have rules that written or
typed statements take precedence over printed statements on the contract form,
should conflicting statements appear in the document. package of rules: chon b6 cac quy tac enforceable: cteng cha, bat bu6c applicable: c6 the ap dung 104 oral: bang miang
supersede: v6 hiau h6a
vendor: nguti ban hang Almost every action a buyer takes has some legal significance, so he does need
to know the consequences of his actions, and must be able to recognize
problems requiring expert legal assistance.
Many orders are preceded by several meetings between the Buyer and the
Seller, settling specifications, approving samples, establishing prices, etc.
Unless these discussions negotiations are conducted with care, the parties could
find themselves contracted orally so the subsequent order becomes merely a
document for accountancy purposes. There is a real danger during these
meetings of creating a legally binding contract with the enthusiasm of
concluding the deal. Remember, as we said before, contracts for the supply of
goods and services do not have to be in writing to be legally enforceable.
Another important point to bear in mind in respect of oral contracts is that any
limitation placed on an individual's power to commit his organization is purely
an administrative device and will not affect the validity of the oral contract
unless the other party knews of the limitation. Unless care is taken during the
negotiation, binding oral contracts in excess of one's limits of authority - either
on the part of the Buyer or, as is equally important, on the part of the Seller can easily be created.
On the other hand many orders, especially for standard components, are placed
without any prior negotiation. They are acknowledged by the Seller. The goods
are delivered, the invoice is passed for payment, and then something is
discovered with respect to the goods which was not quite as expected the Buyer
on questioning the Seller is referred to Seller's Conditions of Sales. Someone
forgot to study the Acknowledgement of Order and the Buyer finds himself
faced with a conflict of conditions.
It is thought that this does not happen in business organisations but it is
surprising how many times it does happen with the pressures Buyers find
themselves under today.
To create a contract there must be an "offer" and an unqualified "acceptance" of
that "offer". The "offer" can be either the Seller's Quotation or the Buyer's
Order depending on which document is the initial one. The "acceptance" can be
either the Buyer's Order or the Seller's Acknowledgement issued in
consequence of an "offer". This is the most common way to conclude a
contract. Unfortunately, in practice, many transactions take place without these
formalities having been completed. However, big contracts are often signed in
to take precedence over: tinh trtrOc den
preced: di trutc, thing trutc
merely: chi la purely: thuan ttly
device: phuvng tin 105 two identical copies by both parties. Every clause has been discussed and
negotiated upon. The risks for conflicting statements in the documents have
been carefully examined but the risks for interpretation disputes can not be
eliminated.
According to the general conditions ECE 188 there are only two situations
when a contract is considered to have been formed.
1.1. Paragraph 2.1. says "The Contract shall be deemed to have been entered into when, upon receipt of
an order, the Vendor has sent an acceptance in writing within the timelimit (if
any) fixed by the Purchaser".
This says that a contract has been formed when the buyer has issued an order
and the Seller has accepted or acknowledged it. The Seller's written acceptance
or acknowledgment shall be sent by the Buyer within the stipulated time. If
there is no such time limit the Seller is obliged to have sent his acceptance
within a"reasonable" time.
1.2. The other situation is described in paragraph 2.2 "If the Vendor in drawing up his tender has fixed a timelimit for acceptance, the
Contract shall be deemed to have been entered into when the Purchaser has sent
an acceptance in writing before the expiration of such timelimit, provided that
there shall be no binding Contract unless the acceptance to reache the Vendor
not later than one week after the expiration of such timelimit".
The Seller has sent his quotation in which he has stated a timelimit within
which the Buyer must have acceptance to reach the Vendor not later than one
week after the expiration of such timelimit".
The Seller has sent his quotation in which he has stated a timelimit within
which the Buyer must have accepted the offer. The contract is here entered into
when.
- the Purchaser has sent an acceptance in writing
- the acceptance - Order - has been sent within the timelimit.
- the acceptance is received by the Seller not later than one week after the
expiration of such a timelimit.

initial: ban deli
identical: giong het nhau

passivity: tinh thy eking
counter offer: hoen gia The two rules require activity from the party which has received the order or
the quotation. This stresses the fundamental rule: never to think a party's
passivity binds him.
When the Buyer's Order is the Offer, the Seller's Acknowledgment, if
unqualified i.e. it does not differ in any essential point from the details of the
Order, is the acceptance and a contract exists between the parties. However, if
the Acknowledgement of Order shows that the Seller intends his own
conditions to apply then this constitutes a counter - offer and no contract exists
at that point. A statement on the Order excluding the Seller's Conditions is no
protection for the Buyer and does not legally affect the counter - offer situation.
Always check for a possible conflict of conditions.
An offer may be accepted by conduct, e. g. by dispatching goods in response to
an offer to purchase (an Order) without prior acknowledgement of the order.
Similarly, an offer to supply goods made by the Seller, (this offer may be in the
form of a counter - offer to the Buyer's Order) can be accepted by the Buyer by
the latter taking delivery of, and using, the goods. Where a contract has been
formed by conduct, it is often difficult to say exactly what terms have been
agreed. The Buyer may find himself bound to the Seller's conditions.
Post contract negotiations cannot affect the terms of the contract unless those
negotiations themselves result in an offer and an acceptance constituting a
contract, the intention of which being to amend the previous contract.
The existence of the contract does not necessarily mean that all of the
obligations of the Buyer and the Seller have been fully specified at the time of
forming the contract. There are instances such as variation of orders where,
under the terms of the contract themselves, the subject matter of the contract
may be changed according to procedures set out in the contract.
There is a situation, however, where the roles of Seller and Buyer are, to a
degree, reversed. This is where an inquiry and a tender are involved. An inquiry
is not an offer, it is an invitation to do business (in legal terms "to treat"). The
Seller's tender is the offer and the Buyer's order, the acceptance. Providing the
terms of the tender and the order agree there is a contract, and an
acknowledgement of such an order is merely a courtesy and cannot affect the
contract. Therefore, where a tender and an order have been exchanged and a
contract formed, neither party can introduce any new terms.
The order in which a contract document shall take precedence over other conduct: cir chi, ti6n hanh
post contract negotiations: dam phan trutc khi ky k6t hap dong 107 documents should normally be stated in the contract. Such a clause could have
the following wording:
"The folowing documents shall be deemed to form and be read and construed
as part of this Agreement, viz:
a. The Special conditions
b. The Tender
c. The Tender Invitation
d. Technical specifications
e. General conditions;
The conditions of The Contract shall prevail over any of the referred
documents. The above contract documents are to be taken as mutually
explanatory of one another but in case of ambiguities or discrepancies the same
shall taken precedence in the same order they are listed in".
2. THE OFFER An offer is usually defined as an act on the part of one person whereby he gives
to another the legal power of creating the obligation called contract.
The offer must be carefully distinguished from preliminary negotiation. An
offer can be accepted and can thereby become a contract. Preliminary
negotiations may lead to the making of an offer.
The offer begins to run at the time it is received by the person to whom the
offer is made, unless otherwise stated in the offer. It continues in effect until it
accepted or rejected by the recipient, until it is withdrawn by the offerer, or
until it lapses.
Once an offer is terminated, by whatever means and for whatever reason, it
cannot be revived.
The form of the offer is also important. All documents intended to be
incorporated must be expressly referenced and made a part of the offer. Mere
attachment to or enclosure with the offer will not be sufficient.
An offer if made by a vendor can be equally valid, either in writing or verbally. prevail over: clutc xem xet truUc, th,ing
referred documents: cac tai lieu dutc dan
ambiguilty: toi nghia
discrepancy: su• khac nhau 108 3. THE PURCHASE ORDER
Generally, the purchase order is regarded as containing the buyer's offer and
becomes a legal contract when accepted by the vendor. Many purchase order
forms have a copy that includes provision for acknowledgement or acceptance.
Some companies' forms use the reverse side for printing their standard
conditions of purchase. Other companies may include a separate printed sheet
stating their terms and conditions.
4. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS
Having placed an order with a vendor, the purchasing officer wishes to assure
that the order has been accepted. It is customary to insist upon a definite vendor
acknowledgement, usually in written form.
The acceptance may conflict with some of the conditions stated in the purchase
order.
If a careful comparison is not made of all conditions stated in the offer with all
conditions stated in the acceptance, the result will be an unclean acceptance. If
the buyer does not make any claim against the conditions within a reasonable
be time period, the contract will get legal status and he binding on both parties.
Please keep in mind that advertisements and price lists do not constitute legal
offers unless specifically directed to the buyer.
5. GENERAL CONDITIONS
General conditions can, be grouped in 4 different groups depending on how you
categorize the issues:
- international organizations
- business associations
- individual companies
The first three categories represent a thorough evaluation of both buyer's and
seller's risks in a certain business situation. Their general conditions reflect the
will of both parties in a common wording. General conditions issued by
individual companies are more detailed and specific in their wording and are
most often written to protect the seller's interests...
The problem in international trading is that only one party's national law can
govern a contract. The other party is very often unfamiliar with that law.
General conditions are most often written by qualified experts. By referring to a
certain set of general conditions the parties can protect themselves from many
verbally: bang Idri, bang miOng reverseside: mat sau, trang sau categorize: phan logi 109 conflict situations. Therefore you should avoid making any changes in the
"system".
6. ECE GENERAL CONDITIONS The most common general conditions used in international trading are issued
by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) in cooperation
with the International. Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit)
and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
They are referred to as "General Conditions for the Supply of Plant and
Machinery for Export", ECE 188 for Western European countries and ECE 574
for Eastern Europe. (See Appendix on Page 440).
The main differences between the two are:
- the transfer of risks of damage to the goods, in case ECE 574 does not
refer to Incoterms.
- reliefs (force majeure), in case ECE 574 does not include any examples
of cases of reliefs.
- the arbitral proceedings shall according to ECE 574 not automatically
be conducted according to the arbitration rules of the ICC.
7. APPLICABILITY Standard conditions of contract should form the foundations on which the
contract is built. As such they should define the general rights and obligations
which experience has shown, it is reasonable for the parties to ask for and
accept. They should therefore be as comprehensive as possible and drafted in
such a way that they require the minimum of alterations to meet the widely
varying circumstances in any given field of purchasing.
The conditions should be a simple and clear explanation of the rights and
obligations under the contract. Clarity and simplicity should be the keynote
throughout.
What conditions shall apply on a contract is a matter of strengtheness of
business attractiveness except in some cases when they are issued by national
authorities. Such conditions are often governed by enforceable rules of national
laws or regulations, i.e. a buying officer of a public institution must follow
reflect: phan anh
Unification of Private Law: th6ng nhal to
applicability: kha nang Org dung
arbitual proceedings: thu tuc trong tai 110 will: y chi
keynote: then ch6t
acquisition process: qua trinh mua ban certain rules in the acquisition process and is prohibited from accepting
conditions which are not in agreement with applicable instructions.
If a set of general conditions apply to an agreement between two parties, the
parties must expressly have agreed upon this in a certain clause in the contract
of, for instance, the following wording: "The attached General Conditions no...
issued by... (enclosure no...) shall apply".
8. GENERAL NOTE ON NEGOTIATION Always specify in the inquiry order that it is a condition of the order that the
standard conditions are to be accepted. If the Seller raises any objections, these
can then be the basis for negotiation, subject to legal guidance. Avoid
attempting to amend the Seller's conditions to meet one's own requirements.
The above represents the ideal. It is recognised that on occasions, as a matter of
commercial expediency, risks will have to be taken and departures made from
the practice and principles set out above. Such deviation, however, should be
the exception rather than the rule.

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT
Industrial plant construction contracts, differ from the purchase contracts we
have mostly studied so far in at least three ways. They involve more parties,
they involve works in addition to goods, and they take many years to run their
course. This is not the place for a full discussion of construction contracts; this
part simply tries to show the main differences between such contracts and the
purchase contracts discussed so far. The part makers frequently refer to a recent
UNCITRAL publication, Legal Guide on Drawing Up International Contracts
for the Construction of Instructrial Works. The reader who needs to know more
is recommended to study this book.
1. UNPACKAGING, TENDERING AND NEGOTIATION Today most plant construction contracts are "unpackaged" and subject to
tender. How does this affect contract negotiation? How does it affect the form
of the contract?
Turnkey projects have lost favor in recent years. Each phase of plant
construction is now "unpackaged" and made the subject of a separate tender.
The tendering system, unfortunately, works against careful and expert
negotiation of a contract. Only finger-tip control of tendering procedures
achieves first-class results.
What are the alternatives? Today, many construction contracts are
"Unpackaged". Unpackaging means developing a separate contract for a
project. For example, a typical project to build a factory involves at least the
following senquence of contracts:
1. A consulting contract for a feasibility study.
2. A consulting contract for a design (or engineering study)
3. A consulting contract with an engineer to oversee the construction
. installation and testing.
4. A construction contract to build the plant
5. A supply contract to deliver and install machinery
114 Why should five unpackaged contracts be written when one "umbrella" contract
can also do the job? One obvious advantage of unpackaging is that local
companies can carry out part of the constructions work; this increases local
skills and saves foreign currency.
A popular approach to large construction contracts today is for the employer
and the contractor to join forces and form a joint venture. Let's take an
example: a small island in the Vietnam is made of almost pure marble. Vietnam
Rock approaches an Italian quarrying company for know-how necessary to set
up the quarry and export the marble. It can draft the specifications and invite
tenders for the construction work.
Thus we have three approaches to construction contracts:
1. The Turn-key project
2. The unpackaged project
3. The joint Venture contract
All the three approaches generally involve Tendering: inviting suppliers or
contractors to bid for the job.
Tendering, in the best international practice, is a highly regulated procedure. In
brief the system is this: in an optional first step, the employer (i.e. the party
paying for the work) invites companies, usually by means of a public
advertisement, to prequality for tendering. Companies that want to tender must
now show (a) that they have the expertise to do the job, and (b) that they meet a
number of formal requirements, for example they must be registered
companies, have no record of bankruptcy, and so on.
Next, the employer issues an invitation to tender. This invitation is often public,
or it is perhaps restricted to certain firms, for example, those who prequalify, or
companies on a list of acceptable contractors. A company that wants to tender
receives a list of the tender documents, specimens of documents, and a
statement of the tendering procedure.
An effective tendering system also establishes sub-procedures to regulate such
issues as:
1. The submission of tenders that comply with the invitation;
2. The submission of alternative or partial (non-compliant) tenders;
3. Withdrawal of a tender;
4. Posting of guarantees;
5. Opening, examination and evaluation of tenders;
6. Acceptance and rejection of tenders.
115 Although most tendering procedures are already highly regulated, a 1988
UNCITRAL report suggests still tighter regulation. Each country, UNCITRAL
says, could pass laws to regulate tendering "procurement laws". Procurement
laws would cover all tenders submitted to ministries, state enterprises, private
companies, and so on. Such laws would have three main goals:
1. Integrity
2. Efficiency
3. Promotion of special national Objectives
The Integrity of the tendering process is very important internationally.
Tendering must work fairly, openly and within a well established legal
framework because only a trust worthy, law-based system encourages serious
bids by the best companies. A clear, fair system established by law also helps
achieve the goals of efficiency and the prdinotion of national objectives, for
examples the development of local expertise.
So far, however, few countries have passed procurement laws. Why not? One
reason is the basis conflict between tendering and contract negotiation ever
more difficult.
A first-class agreement takes into account the true interests of both sides; both
sides feel happy with it. Normally a first-class agreement requires skillful and
flexible negotiation. Tendering, however, is an inflexible procedure. In fact,
tendering is the natural enemy of negotiation. Some sets of tender documents
recognize this by allowing a company to submit a non-compliant tender, (ie. a
tender that does not perfectly agree with the project specifications).
Unfortunately, non-compliance works against the main principle of tendering,
that is the job goes to the lowest bidder. Only if the tenders are identical in all
respects can the employer decide whose price is lowest. For this reason, serious
centracters sometimes submit compliant tenders with which they are unhappy
and which do not represent state - of - the - art technology. They fear that
employers seldom properly consider a non-compliant tender. This vicious circle
is hard to escape.
The effect of tendering on technology transfer is particularly negative. For
decades, many developing countries believed that buying plant and equipment
would automatically bring in technology: know-how and technical expertise.
All too often, this belief has proved false. The transfer of technology depends
on three factors: documentation, training and technical assistance. In each case,
the necessary contract provisions must be tailor-made for the project. Training
is a particular problem: a proper training program always requires sensitive
negotiation.
116 Tendering and negotiation: the two procedures are hard, but not impossible to
reconcile. The most important principle is that the tendering procedure must not
become so rigid that it makes a first-class agreement impossible. Well
conceived tenders often leave specially sensitive areas such as training open for
later negotiation with the successful bidder.
The effect of tendering process on the shape of the contract is well known: a
short contract and many volumes of contract documents.
The government of Vietnam hereinafter called the Employer and the Supper
group hereinafter called the Contractor hereby agree that in consideration of the
price specified in Annex B being paid to the CONTRACTOR by the
EMPLOYER, the CONTRACTOR shall complete the work specified in Annex
A in accordance with the agreed General and Special Conditions
Singed, for and on behalf of...
A handful of words are, often, the "contract". The technical specifications in the
Annexes are beyond our present scope. What lies within the General and
Special Conditions is explained in the next section.
2. THE PARTIES
In a simple sale, two parties are involved, buyer and seller. In building a plant,
countless technical experts, subcontractors and suppliers all confuse the picture.
How does the contract regulate so many different interests and levels of
control?
The employer (the buyer) uses an engineer to supervise the works. The contract
must specify in careful detail the relationship between the engineer and the
contractor (the seller). The suppliers and subcontractors are normally within the
responsibility of the contractor; the contract considers their work as if it were
the contractor's own work.
Construction of a large plant takes many years and involves often hundreds of
suppliers and subcontractors. For these two reasons, time scale and complexity,
a plant construction contract differs, at least superficially, from the "standard"
Purchase Contract we have discussed so far.
The principal parties to a plant construction contract are two: the Employer (or
the purchaser) and the constructor (or supplier). However, other parties, the
engineer and any number of subcontractor, play a central part. 2.1. The Engineer
The engineer (sometimes called the employer's representative) is a consultant 117 who oversees the works on behalf of the employer. Often, more than one kind
of expert is needed: an architect perhaps, a civil engineer, an electrical
engineer, and so on. These specialists work directly under the engineer. (Some
international contracts call these specialists the engineer's representatives) With
so many lines of control running between employer and'contractor, conflicts are
a matter of certainty.
Obviously the contract must specify the exact degree and nature of this control.
Some extracts from the Conditions of Contract for Electrical and Mechanical
Works published by FIDIC offer a possible model:
Engineer's Duties
2.1. The Engineer shall carry out the duties specified in the Contract...
Except as expressly stated in the Contract the Engineer shall have no authority to
relieve the Contractor of many of his obligation under the Contract
2.2. The Engineer's Representative shall be appointed by and shall be responsible
to the Engineer and shall carry out only such duties and exercise such
authority as may the delegated to him by the Engineer
2.3. The Engineer may from time to time delegate to the Engineer's
Representative any of the duties vested in the Engineer and may at any time
revoke such delegation
Any such delegation or revocation shall be in writing and shall not take effect
until a copy thereof has been delivered to the Contractor and the Employer...
2.4. Whenever under the Contract the Engineer is required to exercise his
discretion by:
a. Giving his decision or consent, or
b. Expressing his satisfaction or approval, or
c. Determining value, or
d. Otherwise taking action which might affect the rights and obligations of
the Employer or the Contractor;
He shall exercise such discretion impartially within the terms of the Contract and
having regard to all the circumstances
2.5. The Contractor shall proceed with the decision and instructions given by the
Engineer in accordance with these conditions
2.6. The Contractor may require the Engineer to confirm in writing any decision
or instruction... 118 With so many parties interacting, precise regulation is essential. The most
difficult of the FIDIC conditions to enforce is probably 2.4, the requirement
that the engineer be impartial. The engineer himself, under contract to the
employer, often (reasonably perhaps) expects their engineers to be "on their
side". Conflict is inevitable, so FIDIC adds a further condition, in part to
protect the engineer;
2.3. The Employer shall not appoint any person to act in replacement of the
Engineer without the consent of the Contractor
2.2. The Subcontractor Another important factor on the plant construction stage is the subcontractor.
Subcontractors carry out specialist tasks such as air-conditioning, electrical
wiring, roofing, and so on. Because the employer has no contract with these
subcontractors, the employer has, in principle, no rights over them and no
duties toward them.
No line links the employer and the subcontractor; nevertheless, the
subcontractor is, in a sense, working for the employer. To clarify the
relationship, plant construction contracts usually contain a number of special
provisions on subcontracting. The most common are:
- A clause forbidding the contractor to subcontract the entire work;
- A clause allowing the employer or the engineer to veto subcontractors;
- A clause making the contractor 100% liable for the work of all
subcontractors as if the work were his own.
The last provision is especially important. Contractors sometimes try to avoid
taking full responsibility of their subcontractors, but:
This practice... denies the employer one of the principle advantages of
employing a main contractor, that of having only one firm responsible for the
contract.
2.3. The Contractor's Duties: Scope, Delivery, and Defects Liability Delivering a plant is an immensely complex procedure. What special provisions
are necessary to take into account this complexity and the extended time frame
of the contract?
Termination is allowed in most contracts cithcr for cause (excessive delay for
example) or for convenience. A price reduction is a common remedy for
119 defective construction, especially where repair or replacement is uneconomical
or simply impossible. Further, plant construction contract sometimes include a
provision that the employer can (if the contractor breaches the contract) employ
a new contractor and charge the work to the original contractor. Some contracts
contain a tough provision that allows the employer to refuse to accept the work
under certain circumstances.
Control of and Access to the Site During construction, the Building site is under the control of either the
employer or the contractor. Each must allow the other's access to the site. The
contractor obviously needs access to carry out the works, and the employer
needs access to inspect the progress of the works. To prevent
misunderstandings, most contracts regulate this access. Where several
contractors and subcontractors are working on one site under several contracts,
access provisions require careful coordination.
Provision of Construction Equipment Who provides the construction equipment? It is easier for the employer to make
the contractor responsible for selecting and providing the equipment, but it may
be less expensive for the employer to provide the equipment himself. In any
case, this question must be regulated in the contract.
Insurance Damage is suffered by things: Injury is suffered by people. Damage to
machinery, to installations, or to buildings and personal injure to the
workforce are major concerns of the employer and the contractor. The main
question is, of course, who pays? The answer is usually that: the contractor
pays until take-over and the employer thereafter. Usually the contractor
indemnifies the employer against any claims arising from damage to property
or injury to people unless the employer's own negligence is the cause of the
problem. But that is not enough:
... The fact of the employer having obtained an indemnity from the contractor
does not, in any way, lessen the employer's own legal liability, and the third
party is perfectly free, if he can establish a valid claim to proceed against the
employer. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, to the employer that the
contractor has adequate resources available to implement the terms of the
indemnity.
Accordingly in most contracts, insurance policies cover many risks of damage
and injury. Normally the contractor or the insurance company must inform the
employer that the insurance policy has come into force and that the premiums
are regularly paid. This is important: A failure to pay premiums results in a
120 cancelled policy. If there is a serious accident, and the contractor goes
bankrupt, the employer can lose a lot of money.
Clearance of Site
When the work is finished, who is responsible for cleaning up? Again, there is a
trade-off between cost and convenience. If the contractor cleans up, the contract
price automatically reflects his costs.
Services After Completion
As soon as the works are running correctly, the employer takes them over.
During the defects liability (warranty) period, the contractor makes good any
defects. The defects liability provision does not, of course, look at problems
with spare parts, maintenance, and repairs. Many contracts require the
contractor (against payment of course) to supply spare parts, to maintain and to
repair the equipment.
Contractor often writes a separate maintenance and repair contract. Since such a
contract is usually short and simple, this is perhaps a good idea.
The defects liability provision in a plant construction contract follow the pattern
discussed in part VI. One issue, however, is particularly crucial in plant
construction: when does the warranty period begin? If there is only one
contractor, then the warranty begins when the works pass the required
performance tests. (This is variously called the date of acceptance or the date of
take-over).
If, however, the project involves several contractors, life becomes more
difficult for example hydroelectric power station for which one contractor has
supplied and installed the turbines and another contractor the generators.
The scheduled date for completion of all performance tests is 31 December
1995. Warranty begins with successful completion of tests and runs for five
years. Unfortunately, there is a two-year delay with the turbines: tests are not
run until the end of 1997. The supplier of the generators who installed his
equipment on time now has a warranty obligation until the end of 2002. This is
not fair to him. On the other hands, the employer needs a five-year warranty.
How can the parties resolve this conflict of interest?
A common compromise is to say (a) that the warranty runs for five years from
the date of completion of tests. Which is what the employer wants, further, (b)
that the warranty automatically expires at latest by a given date (in our
example, perhaps 31 December 2001). Which gives the contractor some
security. If things go badly, the losses are shared.
In summary: The scope, delivery and defects liability provisions of a plant
121 construction contract follow the pattern established for the straightforward
purchase contract. The provisions are adapted however, to cope with the time
scale and the complexity of the typical construction project.
4. THE EMPLOYER'S DUTIES: PRICE AND PAYMENT Fixing the price and payment terms for a project that is to run for many years
and involves many risks is extremely difficult. What techniques insure that the
employer gets a fair deal?
The more risks the contractor takes, the higher the contract price is. Skillful
pricing shares the risks and lowers the contract price. Payments are made in
stages: this is a problem for the accountant rather than for the lawyer.
As in simple purchase contracts, the main duties of the employer are found in
the price and payment provisions of a construction contract. The time scale and
complexity of the project create a number of problems.
4.1. Price of the Contract The price of plant construction is fixed in one of three ways:
1. Lump-sum price
2. Unit price
3. Cost-Reimbursable price
Lump -sum Price The lump-sum price is stated in advance as a total for the whole project. This is
the normal, familiar method for fixing the price for a job. In calculating this
price, the contractor looks at all the risks he is taking in performing the work.
The contractor puts a price on each risk and, if possible, adds it to the total
contract price. Because they cover so many risks, lump-sum prices are usually
high. Obviously, reducing the contractor's risk is one way to reduce the contract
price. Two approaches to reducing risk are common; unit price and costreimbursable price. Both are different from the lump-sum price in that they are
not fixed in advance for the total project.
Unit Price Unit prices are agreed prices for certain units of performance, for example:
cubic meters of concrete poured, work-hours used in excavation work or in
digging a tunnel. With this method of pricing materials, in the construction of a
tunnel, for example, no one knows what will happen when tunneling begins.
The tunneling contractor needs a large safety margin, so he quotes a high price
for a lump-sum contract. The figure for a unit-price contract (price per workhour) is usually lower because it carries no risks for the contractor. The
employer, on the other hand, accepts a risk. If the work is quickly done, he
122 saves money. If there are major problems, he loses money. The problem for the
employer is obvious. However, if the contractor is paid by the hour, he has no
incentive to work quickly.
Cost Reimbursable Price
- Cost-reimbursable price is another attempt to avoid the high figures that go
with lump-sum quotations. Under this system, the contractor is simply
reimbursed for his costs plus an acceptable profit margin. (For this reason, costreimbursable price is often called "cost-plus price"). With this method, in
theory at least, the contractor needs no safety margin, and so the final price of
the project is perfectly realistic. The danger is obvious. If the price has no
ceiling, then the contractor is under no pressure to keep his costs low: No
matter what happens, he is paid and his profit increases with his expenditures.
To avoid this danger, some contracts include a ceiling price: whatever happens,
the price will not exceed $xxx million. This ceiling often defeats the purpose of
reimbursable model. In effect, the ceiling price becomes a lump-sum price. If
the price goes above the target, the contractor is not paid 100% of his cost. The
greater the reimbursable model, the more sophiscater the use of a target price is.
This gives the contractor an incentive to hold down costs.
Cost-reimbursable contracts usually allow the employer to terminate the
contract if costs are unexpectedly high. Termination is not, however, an easy
answer. The work must be finished, the new company knows the situation, and
it often charges more than the original contractor.
4.2. Payment
Payment is not, in general, a problem for the lawyers, though the details are
sometimes complicated. The price is usually paid in stages: perhaps 10% of the
total as each one-tenth of the work is completed, or installation, and so on. A
large contract may involve hundreds of payment events: perhaps tunneling is
paid for by the meter, excavation by the hour, the general progress of the works
by 10% stages, and the delivery of machines against invoice. With so much to
regulate, price and payment provisions are normally long and elaborate.
In principle, however, the terms of price and payment in a plant construction
contract follow the general pattern explored in earlier.
5. VARIATION
A project changes shape as it develops. How does a contract allow for
alterations and additions to, as well as deletions from the work? How is the new
contract price calculated? And how can the parties guard against major price
changes caused by currency fluctuations and inflation?
123 A well drafted contract creates a procedure for changing the scope of the work.
It also regulates the necessary adjustments to the contract price. A mechanism
for price revisions is necessary when the value of a currency is likely to change
or when inflation is necessary when the value of a currency is likely to change
or when inflation in one country is likely to upset the balance of the contract.
The final shape of a construction project seldom follows the original designs
exactly. Let's take the Island marble quarry as an example.
The Italians are interested in the project because they want a source of marble
in East Asia-export from Europe is uneconomic. A harbor is planned for Island
in a small bay. To allow heavily loaded ships to leave the harbor, the contractor
must blast a deep channel with dynamite.
Unfortunately, a reef of rare coral blocks the entrance to the bay. The Ministry
of science and Environment hears about the plan to destroy the reef only days
before dynamiting is scheduled, the Ministry immediately forbids the
destruction of the coral. The plans must be changed. In another development,
half-way through the project, Vietnam Airlines begins a helicopter service to
the islands. The plans for the administration building are upgraded to include a
helicopter landing pad. Finally, a plan to drill a deep well is abandoned when
test drillings produce only salt water. Three variations are now necessary, each
one of a different type:
1. Alteration
2. Addition
3. Deletion
These variations all require changes to the scope and to the price provisions.
The contract (or the general conditions) must establish a mechanism for making
such changes. Some of the toughest and most expensive disputes occur when a
change is necessary, but the parties did not agree in advance on a mechanism
for change. How does such mechanism work?
First, does the employer have the right to require major changes in the contract?
Some contracts are very clear on this subject:
Variations The term "variation" as used in this contract means any change in the scope
of construction or technical characteristics of the equipment, materials or
construction services to be supplied by the Contractor
Any variations ordered by the Employer must be implemented by the
Contractor in accordance with the provisions of this article 124 Although some legal systems refuse to enforce such sweeping provisions,
normally such a clause, if the contractor accepts it, is valid and enforceable.
Some contracts, perhaps more fairly, allow the contractor the right to raise
objections to variations, especially to major variations. (A "major" variation is,
typically a variation involving a price adjustment of more than 15% of the
contract sum). The employer must consider these objections. If the two parties
cannot agree, the matter must go to arbitration.
In practice, most contractors are happy to accept alteraticns and additions
provided the price of the project is suitably increased. Deletions accompanied
by price reductions are, understandably, less popular. How are price changes
regulated?
Price changes that result from variations in the scope of the contract are often
called adjustments. (Adjustments are distinguished from price revisions which
are price changes for the work exactly as originally specified).
Price Adjustments Price adjustments are often calculated on a cost-reimbursable (cost-plus) basis:
the contractor receives his costs plus a reasonable profit, as we saw in the last
section.
The FIDIC Conditions regulate price adjustments carefully. The first step is for
the engineer to order the variation. Next, the contractor puts a price on the
variation. The engineer now decides whether to carry out the variation or not. If
the engineer wants the variation but thinks the contractor's price is too high, the
FIDIC Conditions create a procedure for fixing a fair price (FIDIC Condition,
§31). It is not necessary to study the details here, but the principle is clear:
where scope and price adjustments are regulated in the contract, the parties can
usually reach agreement. Where there is no regulation, expensive dispute r
quickly arise.
Price Revisions Price Revisions (i.e., recalculations of price for eactly the same work) are a
feature of any contract that runs over a prior of years. Price revisions have two
main sources: (a) an increase (or less commonly a decrease) in the price of the
materials or services, and (b) a change in currency rates.
Where the contractor fears rapid price increases, he will not tender on the basis
of a fixed and constant price. He will want price to be indeed. In principle,
indexation is simple: if the price of a commodity, for example cement,
increases by 10%, then the price calculation exactly reflects this increase. For
example, if cement costs accounted for 20% of the original price, then a 10%
increase in the cost of cement raises the total contract price by 2%.
125 Problems arise in choosing an indexation procedure acceptable to both parties.
What is the source of the indexed? What is the starting date or "zezo-date" for
indexation? What exactly is the formula for applying the index? These matters
must be specified in the general conditions or negotiated in the contract.
Contracts are generally denominated in one currency, perhaps $US. Sometimes
the local currency is used to denominate local components of the contract.
Because violent currency swings are possible over a period of years, contracts
occasionally allow a price revision in line with currency swings. Such clauses
are difficult to divise: if an American supplier offers to work for $US 10
million, a revision clause (based on recent changes in the value of the dollar)
could' swing his actual price down to $US5 million or up to $US 20 million.
This costs within the United States, however, remain much the same, allowing
a little for inflation.
Most contractors do not want a revision clause, but without one the employer
may find himself paying twice as much, or half as much for the project. What is
the fair solution?
In theory, though seldom in practice, the parties can denominate the contract in
a basket of currencies: for example, one quarter US dollars, one quarter
Sterling, one quarter Deutsche Marks, and one quarter Yen. Such a tactic evens
our the rise or fall of a particular currency. There are two ready-made 'currency
baskets": the Special Drawing Rights (SDR's) of the International Monetary
Fund and the European Currency Unit (ECU). Both rates are quoted daily.
Although few contracts today are denominated in either unit, international
practice is slowly changing.
To sum up: A plant construction contract cannot be frozen. The needs of a
construction site change almost daily and the contract must change accordingly.
A well drafted contract sets up mechanisms that allow change with the
minimum of friction.
6. TEST AND INSPECTION
No employer takes over a plant without a successful take-over test.
Unfortunately, many plants fail the take-over test, not once but repeatedly. How
can the employer guard against such expensive and time-wasting failure? Many contracts develop a complex schedule of tests to ensure that machinery
meets its specifications in all respects. These tests greatly reduce the risk of a
last-minute failure at the point of take-over. The procedure for the final takeover tests requires special drafting.
A turnkey contract, at least in theory, requires only one set of tests,
performance tests, when everything is ready for take-over. Most contracts,
126 however, add tests for machinery at various stages of manufacture and
shipping. What is the purpose of these tests? Aren't the issuance of the TakingOver Certificate and the defects liability provision enough protection for the
employer? The chief interest of the employer is a plant that functions correctly
on schedule. Any delay, even if the contractor must pay liquidated damages, is
costly in terms of wasted time and postponed development. If the plant never
works, the employer is left in an intolerable situation. A well constructed series
of tests greatly reduces these dangers. What does a test series look like?
Let's say, for example, that the Saigon Dock Authority has ordered from a
company in Germany a crane for loading and unloading container ships. The
contract includes delivery, installation, and start-up. The Authority specifies,
perhaps, five tests, as follows:
- Test 1 while custom-made crane is being built in Germany
- Test 2 when the crane is ready for shipment.
- Test 3 when the crane arrives at the point of installation
- Test 4 when the crane is installed and ready for take-over
- Test 5 One week before the end of the warranty period
Testing programs obviously vary from contract to contract. For any given
machine, a practical timetable for testing is easy enough to develop.
If schedule testing during manufacture is appropriate (or random testing
usually on 24 hour notice), the FIDIC Conditions suggest a clear wording for
necessary provision:
Inspection and Testing During Manufacture
20.2 The Engineer shall be entitled during manufacture to inspect, examine and test
the materials and workmanship and check the progress of manufacture of all
Plant to be supplied under the Contract. This shall take place on the
contractor's premises during working hours. No such inspection examination or
testing shall release the Contractor from any obligation under the Contract...
Rejections
21.1. If, as result of the inspection, examination or testing referred to in Clause 20
the Engineer decides that any Plant is defective or otherwise not in accordance
with the Contract, he may reject such Plant and shall notify the Contractor
thereof immediately. The notice shall state the Engineer's objections and
reasons. The Engineer shall not reject any Plant for minor defects which do not
affect the commercial operation of such Plant
The Contractor shall then with all speed make good the defect or ensure that any
rejected Plant complies with the Contract... 127 For building works, on-site inspection takes the place of scheduled tests. This
kind of day-to-day inspection is performed by the engineer. The contract
usually includes the details of inspection procedures in the clause that describes
the duties of the engineer or the engineer's representative.
The final testing procedure most often occurs immediately before take-over or
acceptance. The contract must specify this testing procedure closely. The
normal steps are set out:
1. A procedure for naming the day on which the final tests take place.
2. A procedure for continuing tests without the other party (if necessary).
3. A procedure for repeating the tests if the works fail the tests.
4. Consequences of repeated failure of the test. 128 7. AN EXAMPLE OF A SUPPLY CONTRACT TO DELIVER AND INSTALL

then heated to 76 ° C and kept for 5-10 min until negative iodine reaction
The total mash is transferred to the lauter tun where the clean wort is separated
from the spent grains. After drawing off the first wort the grains are now
sparged with water of 76 ° until the gravity in the wort kettle is around 10 11 ° P. Total amount in the wort kettle should be around 55 - 58 hl. During
sparging the heating up of the wort kettle has been started and when the kettle
is full the temperature is 100 °C
The hops are added boiling continuously for approx 90 min. Until the gravity is
12 - 12.5° P. The spent grains from the lauter tun is emptied in a small trolley
and thereafter sold to the farmers as cattle feed
When the wort boiling is completed the wort is pumped to the whirlpool where
the hot trub is separated 163 After 30 min. rest in the whirlpool the wort is pumped through the wort cooler
from 94° to 10° C in one hour. The cold wort is aerated by approx. 35 ml air/ itre
wort. The aerated wort is sent to one of the fermented (combinetanks) which
can contain 3 brews, i. e. 150 hl net. With the first brew to a tank all the yeast
required for three brews is injected, i. e. 150 litres. The yeast is kept in two
yeast storage tanks with cooling jackets and agitators and can be reused up to
10 times. Each time the yeast is used in a fermented the amount doubles. The
excess yeast can be treated with 2% propionic acid and sold to the farmers as
pigs' feed
The wort now in the fermented will start fermenting and the temperature is
allowed to increase to about 16 ° C and the pressure to 1.3 - 1.5 bar where it is
then kept automatically. After 4 days the beer is end-fermented. It is then kept
for 48 hours at 16° C in order to reduce the diacetyl to less than 0.15ppm (mg
per kg) before cooling down in the tank till -1 °C is initiated. As soon as the
cooling is started the yeast will sediment and it is then immediately taken out
and pumped to one of the two yeast storage tanks. When the beer in the
fermented has reached -1 ° C it is kept there for 1-2 days. Before the beer is
pumped to the kieselguhr filter, the final sediment in the tank, approx. 1 hl, is
drained. The beer filtration takes place in a kieselguhr filter and a trap filter.
The beer is checked for taste and CO2 before it is released for filtration
The filtered beer is lead to the two bright beer tanks into which it is filled under
CO2 counterpressure of 1.2 bar. When the beer has been tested for CO2 taste
and turbidity it is released for filling
The filling line comprises equipment for filling of bottles.
The bottling equipment is suitable for handling of 0.51tr. returnable bottles with
a nominal capacity of 6,000bph
Returned bottles are manually unpacked and then conveyed to the automatic
bottle washer where they are cleaned with caustic soda and water
The cleaned bottles are visually inspected and then sent to the filler/crowner
where the beer is filling in and the crown cork applied. The full bottles are now
sent to the tunnel pasteurized where the beer is gently pasteurized
The bottles out of the pasteurizer are inspected for any leakage before they are
conveyed to the labelling machine where a body label is applied. The labelled
bottles are now manually packed in crates and sent to the full bottles
warehouse. 164 Sanitation
The brewing equipment is cleaned by a CIP plant using recovered water for
first rinse and caustic soda and acid for cleaning following by clean water rinse
Utilities
Water of good quality is available from the town supply and the main line to be
the brewery and in the brewery will be local supply
A hot water tank is included for recovery of hot water from the wort cooling
The cooling plant comprises two NH3 compressors which via a heat exchanger
produce glycol water of -4°C to -5° C which is then used for wort cooling, yeast
storage tank cooling and fermenting tank cooling
The steam is generated in a steam generator and supplies the brewhouse, the
filling line and the CIP plant
Compressed air is generated by an air compressor and is used for wort aeration,
emptying of fermenters and for automatic valves
CO2 recovery is included and it will be possible to recover 60 tons CO 2 per year
of which 20-30 tons will be consumed by the brewery whereas the rest can be
sold for various purposes, i. e. welding and soft drinks carbonation
Power is available from the authorities as 3 x380 V + 0 + earth and the brewery
will be equipment with a main distribution board with fuses and breaks as well
as local operation panels for each department
The automation is based on manual operation of the brewhouse and beer
processing but automatic temperature control for brew vessels, wort cooler and
fermented
The cooling plant, steam plant, air compressor and CO 2 recovery plant are all
fully automatic
For the filling line each machine is automatically regulated for temperature
control and stops.
Laboratory Equipment
The most basic equipment is included like CO2 Gehaltemeter, hazemeter,
platometers, thermometers, pH meter and various glassware and alcohol testing

Appendices 3.2. Interpretation of the Contract under CCVN Article 135. Interpretation of Civil Transactions
1. The interpretation of a civil transaction must be based upon the actual
desire of the parties at the time of establishing such transaction an
on the objectives of such transaction.
2. Where a civil transaction may be interpreted as having different
meanings, the civil transaction must be interpreted in accordance
with a meaning consistent with the objective of the transaction, and
370 shall be in accordance with the customs of the place where the
transaction was established. If the party which is economically
stronger includes in the civil transaction points which are
disadvantageous to the weaker party, the interpretation of the civil
transaction must be such that favors the weaker party.
Article 408. Interpretation of contracts:
1. If a contract contains unclear provisions, the interpretation of such
provisions shall not only rely upon the wording of the contract but
also shall be based upon the common intentions of the parties.
2. If a clause of the contract susceptible of many meanings, the meaning
which would allow the implementation of the clause to most benefit
of the parties shall be chosen.
3. If a contract contains a wording with many different meanings the
contract shall be interpreted according to the meaning which best
conforms to the characteristics of the contract.
4. If a contract contains clauses or words which are difficult to
understand, those shall be explained according to the customs at the
appointed place for the execution of the contract.
5. When a contact lacks some provisions not belonging to the essential
substance, the contract shall be supplemented according to the
customs in regard of such types of contracts at the appointed place
for the execution of the contract.
6. The clauses of contract shall be interpreted in relations to each other
so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a
whole.
Remark:
Where rules of interpretation allow the court a great deal of freedom,
the parties should be as precise as possible. 3.3. Applicable Law of the Contract under CCVN.
Article 834: Civil contracts
1. Forms of civil contracts shall be governed by the law of the country
where contract are concluded. The contracts that are concluded in a
foreign country with violations of law governing forms of contracts
shall be valid in Vietnam if the form of those contracts does not
371 violate the law of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
2. The rights and obligations of parties in a civil contract shall be
determined by the law of the country where performance of the
contract takes place.
The contracts that are concluded and performed wholly in Vietnam
shall be governed by the law of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
If the place of performance of a contract is not indicated, then the place
of performance shall be determined by the law of Socialist republic of
Vietnam.
3. The civil contract having immovable property in Vietnam as its
subject-matter shall be governed by the law of the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam.
Remark:
Article 834 is in need of clarification by the courts. 3.4. Applicable Law of the Contract under the Model Contract. 1. Applicable law
This contract, and all questions relating to its formation, validity,
interpretation or performance shall be governed by the law of
[Note: The subclause below is optional]
This contract shall not include, incorporate or be subject to the
provisions of the "United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods.
Remark
The Model Contract assumes freedom of contract in choosing an
applicable law. It also allows for exclusion of the Vienna Sales
Convention. 3.5. Scope of Contract: Technical Specifications Notes for preparing the Technical Specification 372 A set of prcise and clear specifications is a prerequisite for bidders to
respond realistically and competitively to the requirements of the
Purchaser without qualifying their bids. In the context of International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), the specifications must be drafted to permit
the widest possible competition and, at the same time, present a clear
statement of the required standards of workmanship, materials, and
performance of the goods and services to be procured. Only if this is
done will objectives of economy, efficiency, and fairness in
procurement be realised, responsiveness of bids be ensured, and the
subsequent task of bid evaluation facilitated. The specifications should
require all goods and materials to be incorporated in the goods be new,
unused, and of the most, recent or current models, and that they
incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials unless
provides for otherwise in the contract ...
Care must be taken in drafting specifications to ensure that they are not
restrictive. In the specification of standards for equipment, materials,
and workmanship, recognised international standards should be used as
much as possible. Where other particular standards are used, whether
national standards of the Borrower's country or other standards, the
specifications should state that equipment materials, and workmanship
that meet other authoritative standards, and that ensure at least a
substantially equal quality than the standards mentioned, will also be
acceptable.
Source: World Bank Standard Bidding Document: Procurement of
Goods. p. 65.
Remark:
Technical specifications must be prepared to allow absolute certainty
as to the scope of contract. 3.6. Legal Families and the Applicable Law • The total agreement between the parties is their written contract (the
fish) plus the applicable private law (the water) • In principle, the parties to a contract are free to decide the private
law that will supplement their contract; i.e., the parties are free to
choose the water their fish swims in. Each country has its own
national law. These laws belong to one of three families. The Civil
Law Family is legal systems based on codified laws. The aim is
consistency and predictability. The judge applies the written law.
373 Examples: France, Germany, Spain. The Common Law Family:
legal systems aimed at achieving the most just result in the
individual case. There is no written law - only precedents to guide
decision-making. Examples: England, United State, Malaysia. The
Religious Law Family: legal systems based on Moslem principles.
For contracts, these laws tend to adopt international common law or
civil law principles. Examples are Saudi Arabia, Pakistan. 3.7. The Vienna Sales Convention
- The United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods (The Vienna Sales Convention) is the law of any
country that adopts it. Where the Convention conflicts with existing
national law, the Convention prevails.
- The Convention applies to international sales only.
- The parties to a contract can "opt out " of the Convention with a
clause such as:
This contract, and all questions concerning its validity, interpretation
and performance shall be governed by the law of the Republic of
Verbena. This contract shall not include, incorporate or be subject to the
provision of the "United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sales of Goods".
- Many questions about the meaning of the Convention must be
answered in the courts. So far the answers have been slow in coming.
- Even so, the importer might wish to accept the Convention if the law
applicable to the contract is weak or underdeveloped, or if it favours
the seller too strongly. 3.8. Requirement to provide a User's Guide.
Article 435: Obligations to provide information and User's Guide.
The seller is bound to provide the purchaser with necessary information
on the assets sold, and guidelines for using those assets. If the seller
fails to perform this obligation, the purchaser shall have the right to
request the seller to perform the obligation. If the seller still does not
perform it, the purchaser shall have the right to annul the contract and
claim for compensation of damages. 374 Remark:
The buyer's right to annulment for failure to produce a user's guide
would not normally be acceptable to a seller.
3.9. Transfer of Risk, Transfer of Title.
Article 432: Moment of Transfer of the Ownership
1. The ownership over purchased [items] shall pass to the purchaser
from the moment when the purchaser receives the object, except for
cases where parties agree or law stipulates otherwise.
Article 43: Moment of Passage of Risk.
1. The seller party shall bear risks regard of the sold assets until the
moment when assets are delivered to the purchaser, and the latter
shall bear risks from the moment of receiving assets if parties have
not agreed otherwise. Remark:
The concepts of "delivery" and "receipt" will require some definition
by the courts. Under an Incoterm contract, both terms could mean
delivery.
3.10. Transfer of Risk and Title under the Model Contract.
5. Delivery
5.1. Date, Place and Terms of Delivery
The scheduled date of
Delivery of the Goods shall be made Risk and title to the Goods shall pass from
Delivery shall be the SELLER to the BUYER on Delivery. Remark:
Transfer of risk and title together is often the simplest arrangement.
3.11. Place of Delivery under CCVN and under the Model Contract.
Article 426: Place of Delivery of A: sets
Parties shall agree upon the place of delivery of assets. If there are no 375 agreement on -this then the provision of Article 289 [residence or
headquarters of Buyer] of this Code shall be applied.
The place of Delivery under this Contract is 5 5. Agreed place of delivery. Note: In FOB, FCR, CIF and CIP (etc)
contracts, this is the port/place of shipment.
Remark:
Place of Delivery should be stated. In C-term contracts it is the port of
shipment, not the port of arrival. 3.12. Time of Delivery under CCVN and under the Model Contract.
Article 425: Time of performance of a Sale Contract 1. The time for performance of a sale contract shall be agreed upon by
parties. The seller must deliver the assets to the purchaser at the
time as agreed. The seller can deliver the assets before the fixed
time only if the purchaser agrees.
In cases where parties do not fix the time for delivery of assets, the
purchaser shall have the right to request the seller to deliver assets
and the seller shall have the rights to ask the purchaser to receive
assets at any time, provided that parties shall inform each other
within a reasonable period of time, and provided further that parties
do not have other agreements.
2. If parties have not agreed upon a term of payment, the purchaser
shall have to pay upon receipt of the assets
5. Delivery
5.1. Date, Place and Terms of Delivery
Delivery of the Goods shall be made of Delivery shall be 4 3 The scheduled date Remark:
It is essential to clarify the time of delivery. Late delivery has
important financial consequences. The warranty period usually
begins to run from delivery. 376 3.13. Force Majeure under CCVN and under the Model Contract. Article 308: Civil liability due to breach of civil obligations.
1. The obligor, who fails to fulfil improperly the obligation, shall bear
civil liability to the obligor.
2. The obligor, who cannot fulfils the obligation due to force majeure
events, shall not bear civil liability, unless otherwise provided for
by agreements or stipulated by the law 17. Force Majeure
If either party is prevented from, or delayed in performing any duty
under this Contract by an event beyond his reasonable control, then this
event shall be deemed force majeure, and this party shall not considered
in default and no remedy, be it under this Contract or otherwise, shall
be available to the other party. [NOTE: The subclause below contains examples only. It should be
Modified as necessary].
Force majeure event include, but are not limited to: war (whether war is
declared or not), riots, insurrections, acts of sabotage, or similar
occurrence's; strikes, or other labor unrest: newly introduced laws or
Government regulations; delay due to Government action or inaction,
or inaction on the part of any inspection agency, fire, explosion, or
other unavoidable accident; flood, storm, earthquake, or other abnormal
natural event. [NOTE: The subclause below on - non - force Majeure events is
optional]
Force Majeure events do not include
If either party is prevented from, or delayed in, performing any duty
under this Contract, then this party shall immediately notify the other
party of the event, of the duty affected, and of the expected duration of
the event.
If any force Majeure event prevents or delays performance of any duty
under this Contract for more than ... 2 days, then either party may on
due notification to the other party terminate this Contract.
Remark:
Forced Majeure need details negotiation.
377 3.14. Penalties and Liquidated Damages under CCVN Article 377: Punitive damages.
1. Punitive damages are measure that shall be applied by the agreement
or the parties or by law to secure the fulfilment of an obligation by
which the defaulting party must pay an amount of money to the
injured party.
2. An agreement or punitive damages must be filed in an act which may
be separated from including into the main contract. Article 378: Rate of punitive damages.
The rate of punitive damages may be a certain sum of money or may be
determinated by percentage of the value of the breached part of the
obligation, but must not exceed 5%. Article 379: Relationship between punitive damages and
compensatory damages.
1. The parties may agree upon that the defaulting party shall have to
pay only punitive damages but not compensatory damages, or both,
either punitive damages and compensatory damages. If the rate of
compensatory damages was not agreed upon in advance, the entire
damages must be compensated.
2. If the parties have agreed upon the choice between punitive damages
or compensatory damages, the right to choose shall be granted to
the injured party.
3. In case where punitive damages rather compensatory damages have
been agreed upon by the parties or stipulated by law, the defaulting
party must pay only punitive damages.
Remark:
The 5% rate for punitive damages is stringent, but it is unclear. The
possiblity of paying both compensatory and punitive damages is
highly unattractive to the seller: few contracts will allow it.
3.15. Liquidated damages under the Model Contract
8.3. Delay in Delivery
In the event of late Delivery for reason other than force majeures
defined in Clause 17 below, the SELLER shall pay as liquidated
378 damages and not as a penalty the sum of <FIGURE> and of the value of
the undelivered part per Day of late Delivery up to a maximum of
<FIGURE> and of the Price payable Clause 9 below. Payment of
liquidated damages shall be due without the BUYER having to furnish
proof of any loss, damage or injury.
[NOTE: The two subclauses below are alternatives.] Payment of
liquidated damages shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any
claim of the BUYER against the SELLER arising from or in connection
with late Delivery of any Goods. In particular the SELLER shall not be
liable for any indirect or consequential loss or damage, as defined in
Clause 2.7 above, arising from or in connection with late Delivery of
any Goods. Payment of liquidated damages by the SELLER shall not
preclude the BUYER from seeking compensatory damages from the
SELLER for any loss, injury or damage arising from or in connection
with late Delivery of any Goods. In particular the BUYER shall be
entitled to compensation from the SELLER for any indirect or
consequential loss or damage, including but not limited to loss of profit,
loos of use or loss of contract, arising from or in connection with late
Delivery of any Goods. However, payments made as liquidated
damages shall be offset against any compensatory damages recovered
from the SELLER for the late Delivery of and Goods.
8.4. Termination for Delay
In the event that the SELLER becomes liable to pay the maximum sum
payable as liquidated damages under Clause 8.3 above, then the delay
shall be deemed breach of contract and the BUYER may, upon due
notice, terminate the Contract and/or seek any other remedy available to
him.
Remark:
In practice, few sellers will accept Alternative 2 which goes against
the principle of liquidated damages. 3.16. Defective Delivery under CCVN Article 428: Liability for delivery of assets in improper quantity
1. In cases where the seller delivers things in quantity exceeding that
outnumbered the quantity which has been agreed upon, the
purchaser shall have the right to refuse the excess, or to receive it
and pay for it at agreed price.
379 2. In cases the seller party delivers things in quantity less than the
quantity which has been agreed upon, the purchaser shall have
either of following rights.
a. To terminate the contract and request compensation for damages.
b. To receive the quantity which was delivered and request
compensation for damages.
c. To receive what has been delivered and extend a period time for
the seller to deliver the rest.
Article 429: Liability due to Delivery of Incompleted Things.
1. In cases where things which have been delivered are not completed
and thus causing the usefulness to be failed, the purchaser shall
have either of following rights:
a. To cancel the contract and request compensation for damages:
b. To receive what has been delivered and ask the seller party to
deliver components or parts which have not been delivered and
to request compensations for damages and to suspend the
payment the situation becomes complete.
Article 430: Liability for delivery of things of the Wrong category.
In case where the things have been delivered in improper affurtiment
[assortment], the purchaser shall have either of following rights
1. To terminate the contract and request compensation for damages.
2. To receive what has been delivered any pay for it at the price as
agreed upon by parties.
3. To request the seller to deliver thing in proper assortment and to
compensate for sustained damages.
Remark:
The buyer's right to terminate is very hard on the seller. These clauses
are (probably) disposive, however. Some wording on fundamental
breach is necessary in the contract.
3.17. Defective Delivery under the Model Contract
11.3. Buyer's rights in the event of Discrepancy in quantity
If a material discrepancy in quantity exists and is duty notified to the
380 SELLER, the BUYER at his discretion and subject to clause 8.2 above
may either.
a. Accept the delivered portion of the Goods and require the SELLER
to deliver the remaining portions forthwith; or
b. Accept the delivered portion of the Goods and terminate the
remaining portion of the Contract upon the due notice given to the
SELLER.
If any material discrepancy in quantity exists such that <STATEMENT
OF FUNDAMENTAL DISCREPANCY> and if such discrepancy is
duly notified to the SELLER, the BUYER may at his discretion.
a. Adopt either of the remedies prescribed in this clause above; or
b. Reject the delivered portion of the Goods and recover from the
SELLER all payments made to the SELLER as well as all costs,
expenses and customs duties incurred by the BUYER in association
with the shipment, movement through customs, insurance or storage
of the Goods.
11.4. Buyer's rights in the event of Discrepancy in quality
Discrepancies in quality shall be considered as defects and shall give
rise to claims under the Defects' Liability provision of this Contract in
Clause 12 below.
However, a fundamental discrepancy in quality shall give the BUYER
the right to refuse Delivery of the Goods in whole or in part and to
recover from the SELLER all payments made for the unaccepted
portion of the Goods as well as all costs, expenses and customs duties
incurred by the BUYER in association with the shipment, movement
through customs, insurance or storage of the unaccepted portion the
Goods. Further a refusal to accept delivery in whole shall be considered
termination under Clause 18 of this Contract and refusal to accept
delivery in part shall be considered termination of that part of the
Contract affected by such refusal.
Remark:
The wording on fundamental breach is a necessary protection for the
seller. It is essential for the buyer to be fair to the seller or he/she will
simply refuse to do business. 381 3.18. Defect liability under CCVN Article 437: Guarantee of the Quality of Goods.
1. The seller shall guarantee the fitness and characteristics of things
sold. If the purchaser discovers in the purchased things the defects
which devalue it or decrease its fitness, he/she must immediately
notify the seller thereof and shall have the right to request the seller
to repair, the defect, or to replace the things with the defects, or to
reduce price and to compensate for damages, if parties have not
agreed otherwise.
2. The sale party shall guarantee that things sold are in accordance with
description on covers, trademark or appropriate with the sample that
has been chosen by the purchaser.
3. The sale party shall not be liable for defects in the following cases:
(a) Defect that the purchase party has already known and must have
known when buying.
(b) Things at auction; things second hand trade;
(c) The purchase party at fault of causing defect to things.
Article 438: Warranty obligation
The sale party shall have warranty obligation to things sold for a period
of time to be called warranty period, if the warranty is agreed upon by
parties or stipulated by Law. The warranty period shall be calculated
from the time the purchase party has to receive things.
Article 439. Right to request for [remedy of Defect under] warranty
During the warranty period, if the purchase party discovers any defects
on things, it shall have the right to request the sale party to repair things
free of charge or to reduce the price or to exchange the things with
defects for the others or to return things and receive back the money.
Rein ark:
The correct word is "warranty"
The warranty period appears to run forever unless otherwise
regulated by the contract.
The buyer has the right to choose the remedy which is grossly unfair
to the seller. 382 3.19. Defects' Liability under the Model Contract.
12. Defects liability
12.1. Seller's Liability for defects
The SELLER warrants that the Goods supplied under this Contract
shall at the date of their Delivery.
a. Be free defects in material
b. Be free from defects in workmanship.
c. Be free from defect inherent in design, including but not limited to
selection of materials and be fit for the purpose for which such
Goods are normally used.
If any defect provably presented in any of the Goods, on the date of
Delivery comes to light during the defects liability period, then the
BUYER shall forthwith notify the SELLER. The SELLER, without
undue delay, shall at his own risk and cost and at his discretion repair or
replace such item or otherwise make good of the defect.
The SELLER's liability for defects is subject to the BUYER having
adhered to all procedures and instruction applicable to the .... of the
item, and expressly excludes damages to the Goods caused by fair wear
and tear or by misuse occurring after Delivery.
1.2.2. Defects' Liability period
The SELLER shall be liable for defects which come to light during a
period of days from After the end of this period, the BUYER
shall have no right to raise claims of any kind against the SELLER for
any defect in any Goods of the SELLER's supply.
The defects' liability period shall be prolonged by the length of any
period during which the Goods cannot be used by the Buyer because of
a defect. However, if new Goods are delivered to replace defective
Goods, the defects liability period shall not begin again on the
replacement Goods.
1.2.3. Limitation of Defects' Liability.
[NOTE: The two clauses below are alternatives. Delete as necessary]
The duty to repair and replace or otherwise to make good defects is the
only duty of the SELLER in the event of the Delivery of defective
Goods. In particular the BUYER shall not entitled to compensation 383 from the SELLER for any indirect loss or damage as defined in Clause
2.7 above, arising from or in connection with Delivery of defective
Goods. The SELLER shall indemnify and hold harmless the BUYER
against any loss or damage however arising whether direct or indirect
which shall be suffered by the BUYER as the result of defective or
faulty Goods delivery by the SELLER.
3.20. Payment under CCVN and the Model Contract
Article 295: Fulfilling the obligation of paying money.
1. The obligation to pay money shall be fulfilled in full, according to
the timelimit, at the appointed place and in the agreed upon
procedures.
2. The money that must be paid shall be the Vietnamese Dong, except
in cases where the law stipulates otherwise.
Article 424: Price and Modes of Payment
3. Modes of payments shall be agreed upon by parties or stipulated by
law.
Remark:
The requirement to pay all monies in Dong needs interpretation 384 APPENDIX

buyer when the goods are handed over
to the first carrier for transmission to the
buyer in accordance with the contract of
sale. If the seller is bound to hand the
goods over to a carrier at a particular
place, the risk does not pass to the
buyer until the goods are handed over
to the carrier at that place. The fact that
the seller is authorized to retain
documents controlling the disposition of
the goods does not affect the passage
of the risk. dinh, rui ro du'oc chuygn sang ngutii

or otherwise. 2. Tuy nhien, rui ro kh6ng du'oc chuygn

sold in transit passes to the buyer from
the time of the conclusion of the
contract. However, if the circumstances
so indicate, the risk is assumed by the
buyer from the time the goods were
handed over to the carrier who issued
the documents embodying the contract
of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time
of the conclusion of the contract of sale
the seller knew or ought to have known
that the goods has been lost or
damaged and did not disclose this to
the buyer, the loss or damage is at the
risk of the seller. Di6ta 68. Ngu'di mua nhgn rui ro vg minh

68, the risk passes to the buyer when
he takes over the goods or, if he does
not do so in due time from the time
when the goods are placed at his
disposal and he commits a breach of
contract by falling to take delivery. 1. Trong cac truting hop khOng &roc neu

the goods are placed at his disposal at
that place. 2. Tuy nhien, neu ngu'di mua 1.34 buQc
