Global Expansion through Production Sites with a Home Ground in Asia

 


â– 5C parts


Precision processing of engine parts for automotive and industrial machinery is our group's primary business. We offer products meeting customer needs on the basis of production results and engine-related expertise earned through a wide range of undertakings.
We produce the key "5C" parts of engines, including connecting rod and cylinder head in our flexible  production lines to supply them worldwide.













Connecting rod







Features
Connecting rods, placed between piston and crankshaft converts the linear
                reciprocating motion of piston to a rotary motion for engine power transmission.
                They are subject to extremely high mechanical impacts, rotational moments
                and high temperatures.


Use in automotive, industrial and farming machinery engines. Yasunaga manufacture
                connecting rods for engines from 2 cylinders to 8 cylinders.


Now that connecting rods are most essential automotive engine parts, most of them are manufactured by automobile manufacturers in their own in-house plants. We are capable to manufacture such production lines in our machine tools division and to set them up through inter-divisional technology collaborations.




Cylinder head







Features
Cylinder head located on a cylinder block is a device having functions
                to absorb combustible gases, ignite and drive out exhaust air. Most of
                engines comprising the device is computerized with electronic control.


Use of aluminum became more prevalent. Cylinder head itself is so sophisticated as to require quite an advanced processing technology. Our high-level technological capability is now satisfying customers' requirements.




Cylinder block







Features
The core parts in internal combustion engines where energy from ignition and combustion is transmitted to pistons and crankshafts for a revolution power.


For gasoline and diesel engines for automotive, farming and industrial machines, ranging from 1 up to 6 cylinders.


From materials to finished products high precision processed products can be produced with our advanced technology.




Camshaft







Features
Key components of engine valve systems, camshafts drive the rocker arms and tappets that open and close valves. The number used varies with the form of the engine.


Yasunaga has established a continuous production system, based on advanced manufacturing technology, that spans materials to machining to logistics, using methods such as induction quenching that assures surface hardness in cast iron camshafts.


To reduce weight, we carry out mass production and delivery of hollow camshafts.




Crankshaft







Features
Crankshafts play the role of converting into rotational motion the linear reciprocating motion of pistons and connecting rods generated by combustion and expansion processes in engine pistons. They are important key components that are subject to high-speed rotation and a high-impact environment.

Lanner Group Ltd is a discrete event simulation software company headquartered in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire. The business develops, markets and supports business process simulation and optimisation systems.[2][3] The company has subsidiaries in the USA, China, France and Germany and a distributor network selling the company's products in 20 different countries.[4] Lanner Group was formed following a Management Buyout of AT&T Istel, a spin-off from the operational research department of British Leyland where, in 1978, the world's first visual interactive simulation tool was developed.[5] Lanner Group services automotive, aviation, criminal justice, defence and aerospace, financial services and contact centres, food and beverage, health, logistics and supply chain, manufacturing, nuclear, oil and gas, pharmaceutical, and consumer health industries.[6]

Company history[edit]
Lanner Group formed in 1996 after completing a Management Buyout from AT&T Istel;[2] the company was initially named SEE WHY SOLUTIONS and was incorporated in 1995.[6] Lanner Group's previous owner, AT&T Istel, formerly known as ISTEL, was initially called BL Systems, and was a spin out formed in 1979 following a Merger of all the computer departments under the then British Leyland umbrella. BL System's SEE WHY tool, programmed in Fortran 77[7] and launched in 1980,[2] was the world's first commercially available visual interactive simulation package and the precursor to Lanner Group's current core software product WITNESS.[8][9] WITNESS was the first of the industrial strength 4GL simulators.[10] The WITNESS system was launched on IBM PC in 1986[2] and has been revised frequently since.[2][11][12] The latest version of Lanner's Witness Power with Ease 3.0 was released in November 2010.[13]
The applications of the FORTRAN 77 / WITNESS interface have been subject to further academic Research and Development.[14][15] Since 1985 the company has supported its simulation software academic program. Over 100 universities worldwide have been involved since the program began.[16]
Lanner Group continued to develop the WITNESS platform further in parallel to developing its mainstay product of the same name, and since 2002 has introduced new systems providing niche simulation packages for police and healthcare organisations called PRISM and PX-Sim respectively.[2][3] In 2006 the company unveiled a Java based simulation engine called L-SIM which is embedded in Business Process Management (BPM) solutions software.[17] In May the same year, a technology partnership with BPM solution provider IDS Scheer was announced.[18] The L-SIM product is now the simulation engine of IDS Scheer's ARIS Business Simulator.[19] The company's WITNESS platform technology is therefore embedded into current Oracle, SAP, and IBM BPA products.[20]
From 1996 to 2010 the company's main investor was private equity company 3i. On 18 March 2010 Lanner Group announced that it had secured a £3 million new investment deal with NVM Private Equity replacing 3i.[21] 3i continues to retain an interest in Lanner Group as a small minority investor.[4]
