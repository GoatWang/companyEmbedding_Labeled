Company Profile

    
      Sun Race Sturmey-Archer Inc. was set up in 1972. By the efforts of president Hsu and all stuffs, we have been one of the three biggest bicycle drivetrain manufacturers in the world. We were aware of that having our own techniques and qualities are the only way to success. So R&D and innovation are always our basic business belief. Nowadays, we have gotten many key patents and applied these patents on many products.
For expending Europe markets, we merged “Sturmey-Archer” the famous internal gear hub manufacturer in England in 2000. After that merger, we became one of the main internal gear hubs manufacturers in the world and the only one in Taiwan. Because the major market of the internal gear hubs is in Europe, our Europe turnover also rose year-by-year. 
Although many manufactures have moved to China, we still believe that the real and last competitive ability is not the cost; it should be the innovation, quality, and management. As well as we try to make our products to be more creative and different. We will refresh the brand “the kingdom of the bicycle industry” of Taiwan.

				              The purpose of Slider Kit is to gather common slideshow-like jQuery functionalities (such as news sliders, photos galleries/sliders, carousels, tabs menus)
				            

				              When tracking mouse movement, you usually need to know the actual position of the mouse pointer. The event object that is passed to the handler contains some information about the mouse coordinates.
