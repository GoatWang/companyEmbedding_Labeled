Accell Group reports profits, revenue up in first quarter 







 Published  April 26, 2016

 HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (BRAIN) — Accell Group said it recorded higher turnover and profit in the first quarter of this year compared to last year due to higher demand for higher priced e-bikes and sport bikes.
"The year 2016 started well for Accell group," said René Takens, chairman of the board of directors of Accell.
"Sales of electric bikes were up in all countries, especially in Germany. Sales of electric bikes also increased by more than 10 percent in countries where the market in this category is more modest. On top of this, we are seeing a clear rise in the demand for our sports bikes. This resulted in an increase in the average price of the bikes we sold compared to the same period in 2015. Turnover in parts and accessories came in at the same level as last year. The higher turnover we recorded helped us to book a healthy increase in profit for the first three months of 2016. We therefore maintain our forecast for 2016 of a further increase in turnover and profit, barring unforeseen circumstances."
In early April Accell Group N.V. announced that it had agreed to sell its North American P&A business to Hawley-Lambert. Accell Group said it wants to increase its focus on its core business in the U.S., via its own bicycle brands and related merchandise.
Accell Group has also sold Hawley-Lambert the exclusive distribution rights in the U.S. and Canada for Accell Group's proprietary accessory brand XLC. The turnover from the P&A business is estimated to be 15 million euros ($17 million) lower on an annual basis.
The sales to Hawley-Lambert is expected to have a positive impact on Accell Group's operational result and its working capital, the company said.

More...Did you know ?Multiples charts provide an effective way to quickly analyze a company's valuation over a period of time, and compare it against the valuation of another company, a personal list, or a market index. About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
