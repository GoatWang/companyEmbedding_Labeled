	Merida Industry Co Ltd operates in the Motorcycles, bicycles, and parts sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Merida Industry Co Ltd with three other
	motorcycle manufacturers in Asia:
		
	Sanyang Industry Company Limited
	
		(2016
	sales of 35.45 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$1.17  billion]
		of which 79%
		was Taiwan Department),
	
	Zhejiang Qianjiang Motorcycle Co Ltd
	
		of China
		(2.20 billion Chinese Renmimbi [US$327.64  million]
		of which 93%
		was Manufacturing), and
	
	Yadea Group Holdings Ltd
	
		which is
		
		based in Hong Kong
		(7.77 billion Hong Kong Dollars [US$995.10  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	Merida Industry Co Ltd reported sales of 22.90 billion Taiwanese Dollars (US$758.04 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 18.5%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 28.09 billion Taiwanese Dollars.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 38.4% decline
		in Asia, from 7.35 billion Taiwanese Dollars to 4.53 billion Taiwanese Dollars.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Domestic (down 15.3% to 15.63 billion Taiwanese Dollars)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Europe (up 20.1% to 2.74 billion Taiwanese Dollars)

PRODUCT SAFETY RECALL

Merida Industry Co., Ltd (MIC) is a Taiwan based bicycle design, manufacture, and sales company. It was started in 1972 by Ike Tseng. The original layout was based on the Raleigh Nottingham factory as Merida began by making Raleigh bikes for the North American market. Ike was a very talented engineer and the company grew as a well respected OEM manufacturer making for many well respected brands.
What would the world be without its inventors, idealists and “garage engineers”? When Karl Baron of Drais invented the archetype of the bicycle in Germany some 200 years ago, he surely didn’t anticipate how successfully following generations would refine the “Draisine” (named after its creator) up to today. Probably, Drais didn’t even care about this: Like many inventors, he was motivated primarily by the sheer idea and not by success or wealth. But with his “walking bike”, he nevertheless created something that would be a huge plus for the world.
As company founder of the Merida Industry Co., Ltd., also Ike Tseng (1932–2012) has created something which has changed the world to some extent via the power of inventive genius. Because when Ike Tseng established the first Merida plant in Yuanlin (Taiwan) in September 1972, also he was not driven by ambition for success or wealth but by a question of honour: While travelling through the USA a little time before, Tseng had come across a US bike shop whose entrance sign stated unmistakably that any repair of Taiwanese bikes was strictly refused there – due to the unacceptable quality of the latter. Nearly defiantly, the then 40-year-old Tseng decided to change exactly that issue and founded a bike company with the objective to improve the quality level of Far East bikes in a lasting and effective way. Today, the Merida Industry Co., Ltd. annually produces 2.4 million bikes at three locations and is therefore Taiwan’s second-largest manufacturer – of course with top-level quality standards!
At the Merida Industry Co., Ltd., these brilliant 40 years of tradition and experience in the production of first-class bicycles represent many aspects: From the close teamwork with the R&D department in Germany and the cooperation with premium suppliers up to the actual manufacturing (managed by experienced experts at modern workplaces), each and every realization step of a Merida bike is performed meticulously on premium level…
