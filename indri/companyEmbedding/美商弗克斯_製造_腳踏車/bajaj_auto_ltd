When it comes to one of India's most memorable ones, it seems it can hold its own in court. In 2013, Bajaj Auto managed to stay the use of its most iconic tagline, 'Hamara Bajaj', first used as a TVC jingle in 1989, as a film title by a Hindi movie production company. 'Hamara Bajaj' might have gone off air now, but it has become more than a jingle today. It marks the cusp that Indian⋯⋯ brands were on right before the gates were opened to foreign entrants, and is a reminder of how challenging it can be for brands to pre-empt changes in consumer behaviour. 'Hamara Bajaj', which was the final flourish that followed the line 'Buland Bharat ki buland tasveer' (A strong India's strong picture...is our Bajaj), ushered in a brand of advertising that was not tried before. Stringing together a montage of the legendary Chetak scooters in use everyday, the TVC evoked the pride in ownership. 更多由 Bajaj Auto Ltd 張貼36 次觀看36 次觀看Bajaj Auto Ltd · 3月9日 · Watch the Pulsar NS200's biggest fan club and riding group, the Naked Wolves, unveil the new Pulsar NS200 before the worldwide launch and hear what they had to say about the return of the bike in its all new avatar.

Shri.Kamalnayan Bajaj Centenary




				 The Bajaj Group is amongst the top 10 business houses in India. Its footprint stretches over a wide range of industries, spanning automobiles (two wheelers manufacturer and three wheelers manufacturer), home appliances, lighting, iron and steel, insurance, travel and finance. The group's flagship company, Bajaj Auto, is ranked as the world's fourth largest three and two wheeler manufacturer and the Bajaj brand is well-known across several countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East, South and South East Asia. Founded in 1926, at the height of India's movement for independence from the British, the group has an illustrious history. The integrity, dedication, resourcefulness and determination to succeed which are characteristic of the group today, are often traced back to its birth during those days of relentless devotion to a common cause. Jamnalal Bajaj, founder of the group, was a close confidant and disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, Gandhiji had adopted him as his son. This close relationship and his deep involvement in the independence movement did not leave Jamnalal Bajaj with much time to spend on his newly launched business venture. We are celebrating 125th Birth anniversary of Shri. Jamnalal Bajaj on 4th of November 2014.

				  His son, Kamalnayan Bajaj, then 27, took over the reigns of business in 1942. He too was close to Gandhiji and it was only after Independence in 1947, that he was able to give his full attention to the business. Kamalnayan Bajaj not only consolidated the group, but also diversified into various manufacturing activities. The present Chairman of the group, Rahul Bajaj, took charge of the business in 1965. Under his leadership, the turnover of the Bajaj Auto the flagship company has gone up from INR.72 million to INR. 120 billion, its product portfolio has expanded and the brand has found a global market. He is one of Indiaâ€™s most distinguished business leaders, bike manufacturer india and internationally respected for his business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit.

Acquisitions[edit]
Bajaj Auto bought a controlling stake in the Tempo Firodia company, renaming it "Bajaj Tempo". Germany's Daimler-Benz, a long-time collaborator with Firodia because of their ownership of the original Tempo works in Germany, owned 16% of Bajaj Tempo. Daimler sold their stake back to the Firodia group in 2001, meaning that they once again held a controlling interest, with BAL retaining 24% of the shares. It was agreed that Bajaj Tempo would gradually phase out the use of the "Tempo" brand name, as it still belonged to Mercedes-Benz.[16] The name of the company was changed to Force Motors in May 2005, dropping "Bajaj" as well as "Tempo", over the objections of Bajaj Auto with whom the company shares a long history as well as a compound wall.[17]
KTM Power Sports AG[edit]
In November 2007, Bajaj Auto acquired 14.5% stake in KTM Power Sports AG (holding company of KTM Sportmotorcycles AG). The two companies have signed a cooperation deal, by which KTM will provide the know-how for joint development of the water-cooled four-stroke 125 and 250 cc engines, and Bajaj will take over the distribution of KTM products in India and some other Southeast Asian nations.[18] As on 31 March 2013, Bajaj Auto held 47.96% stake in the company.
Bajaj-Kawasaki end tie-up in april 2017[edit]
Bajaj and Kawasaki have ended their 33-year alliance in India following deepening of ties between the latter and its Austrian partner KTM. Bajaj Auto had an alliance with Kawasaki for the sale and after sales service of Kawasaki motorcycles through its Probiking, a premium bike dealership network, since 2009. These Probiking dealerships were later converted to KTM dealerships. Bajaj Auto Ltd. made a technical assistance agreement with Kawasaki Japan in 1984, and since then it had cooperated to expand production and sales of motorcycles in India.[19]
Demerger in 2008[edit]
The demerger of Bajaj Auto Ltd into three corporate entities—Bajaj Finserv Ltd (BFL), Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL), and Bajaj Holdings and Investment Ltd (BHIL)—was completed with the shares listing on 26 May 2008.[20][21]

Acquisitions[edit]
Bajaj Auto bought a controlling stake in the Tempo Firodia company, renaming it "Bajaj Tempo". Germany's Daimler-Benz, a long-time collaborator with Firodia because of their ownership of the original Tempo works in Germany, owned 16% of Bajaj Tempo. Daimler sold their stake back to the Firodia group in 2001, meaning that they once again held a controlling interest, with BAL retaining 24% of the shares. It was agreed that Bajaj Tempo would gradually phase out the use of the "Tempo" brand name, as it still belonged to Mercedes-Benz.[16] The name of the company was changed to Force Motors in May 2005, dropping "Bajaj" as well as "Tempo", over the objections of Bajaj Auto with whom the company shares a long history as well as a compound wall.[17]
KTM Power Sports AG[edit]
In November 2007, Bajaj Auto acquired 14.5% stake in KTM Power Sports AG (holding company of KTM Sportmotorcycles AG). The two companies have signed a cooperation deal, by which KTM will provide the know-how for joint development of the water-cooled four-stroke 125 and 250 cc engines, and Bajaj will take over the distribution of KTM products in India and some other Southeast Asian nations.[18] As on 31 March 2013, Bajaj Auto held 47.96% stake in the company.
Bajaj-Kawasaki end tie-up in april 2017[edit]
Bajaj and Kawasaki have ended their 33-year alliance in India following deepening of ties between the latter and its Austrian partner KTM. Bajaj Auto had an alliance with Kawasaki for the sale and after sales service of Kawasaki motorcycles through its Probiking, a premium bike dealership network, since 2009. These Probiking dealerships were later converted to KTM dealerships. Bajaj Auto Ltd. made a technical assistance agreement with Kawasaki Japan in 1984, and since then it had cooperated to expand production and sales of motorcycles in India.[19]
Demerger in 2008[edit]
The demerger of Bajaj Auto Ltd into three corporate entities—Bajaj Finserv Ltd (BFL), Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL), and Bajaj Holdings and Investment Ltd (BHIL)—was completed with the shares listing on 26 May 2008.[20][21]
