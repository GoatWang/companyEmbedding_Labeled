Harley-Davidson, Inc. (H-D), or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903.
As one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression (along with Indian),[5] the company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements (e.g., Aermacchi 1974-1978 and Buell 1987-2009), periods of poor economic health and product quality, as well as intense global competition[6] to become one of the world's largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following, with owner clubs and events worldwide as well as a company sponsored brand-focused museum.
Noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style,[7] Harley-Davidson traditionally marketed heavyweight, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 700 cm³ and has broadened its offerings to include its more contemporary VRSC (2002) and middle-weight Street (2015) platforms.
Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India, and markets its products worldwide.
Besides motorcycles, the company licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley-Davidson brand, among them being apparel, home decor and ornaments, accessories, toys, and scale figures of its motorcycles, and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community.

History

Beginning
In 1901, 20-year-old William S. Harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of 7.07 cubic inches (116 cc³) and four-inch (102 mm) flywheels.[8] The engine was designed for use in a regular pedal-bicycle frame. Over the next two years, Harley and his childhood friend Arthur Davidson worked on their motor-bicycle using the northside Milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend, Henry Melk. It was finished in 1903 with the help of Arthur's brother, Walter Davidson. Upon testing their power-cycle, Harley and the Davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around Milwaukee without pedal assistance. They quickly wrote off their first motor-bicycle as a valuable learning experiment.[9]
Work immediately began on a new and improved second-generation machine. This first "real" Harley-Davidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of 24.74 cubic inches (405 cc³) with 9.75 inches (25 cm) flywheels weighing 28 lb (13 kg). The machine's advanced loop-frame pattern was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle (designed by Joseph Merkel, later of Flying Merkel fame). The bigger engine and loop-frame design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs. The boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer Ole Evinrude, who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on Milwaukee's Lake Street.




Prototype


The prototype of the new loop-frame Harley-Davidson was assembled in a 10 ft × 15 ft (3.0 m × 4.6 m) shed in the Davidson family backyard.[10][11] Most of the major parts, however, were made elsewhere, including some probably fabricated at the West Milwaukee railshops where oldest brother William A. Davidson was then toolroom foreman. This prototype machine was functional by September 8, 1904, when it competed in a Milwaukee motorcycle race held at State Fair Park. It was ridden by Edward Hildebrand and placed fourth. This is the first documented appearance of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in the historical record.[10]
In January 1905, small advertisements were placed in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal offering bare Harley-Davidson engines to the do-it-yourself trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early 1970s.
In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue),[12] at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters. The first Juneau Avenue plant was a 40 ft × 60 ft (12 m × 18 m) single-story wooden structure. The company produced about 50 motorcycles that year.

In 1907, William S. Harley graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in mechanical engineering. That year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow ("cream") brick. With the new facilities production increased to 150 motorcycles in 1907. The company was officially incorporated that September. They also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time, a market that has been important to them ever since.[13]
In 1907 William A. Davidson, brother to Arthur and Walter Davidson, quit his job as tool foreman for the Milwaukee Road railroad and joined the Motor Company.
Production in 1905 and 1906 were all single-cylinder models with 26.84 cubic inch (440 cm³) engines. In February 1907 a prototype model with a 45-degree V-Twin engine was displayed at the Chicago Automobile Show. Although shown and advertised, very few V-Twin models were built between 1907 and 1910. These first V-Twins displaced 53.68 cubic inches (880 cm³) and produced about 7 horsepower (5.2 kW). This gave about double the power of the first singles. Top speed was about 60 mph (100 km/h). Production jumped from 450 motorcycles in 1908 to 1,149 machines in 1909.[14]




Harley-Davidson works in 1911


By 1911, some 150 makes of motorcycles had already been built in the United States – although just a handful would survive the 1910s.
In 1911, an improved V-Twin model was introduced. The new engine had mechanically operated intake valves, as opposed to the "automatic" intake valves used on earlier V-Twins that opened by engine vacuum. With a displacement of 49.48 cubic inches (811 cm³), the 1911 V-Twin was smaller than earlier twins, but gave better performance. After 1913 the majority of bikes produced by Harley-Davidson would be V-Twin models.
In 1912, Harley-Davidson introduced their patented "Ful-Floteing Seat", which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube.[15] The spring tension could be adjusted to suit the rider's weight. More than 3 inches (76 mm) of travel was available.[16] Harley-Davidson would use seats of this type until 1958.[17]
By 1913, the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new 5-story structure had been built. Begun in 1910, the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along Juneau Avenue and around the corner on 38th Street. Despite the competition, Harley-Davidson was already pulling ahead of Indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after 1914. Production that year swelled to 16,284 machines.

World War I
In 1917, the United States entered World War I and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort.[18] Harleys had already been used by the military in the Pancho Villa Expedition[19][20] but World War I was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue, first with the British Model H, produced by British Triumph Motorcycles Ltd in 1915.[21] After the U.S. entry into the war, the U.S. military purchased over 20,000 motorcycles from Harley-Davidson.[22]
Bicycles
Harley-Davidson launched a line of bicycles in 1917 in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles. Besides the traditional diamond frame men's bicycle, models included a step-through frame 3-18 "Ladies Standard" and a 5-17 "Boy Scout" for youth. The effort was discontinued in 1923 because of disappointing sales.[23]
The bicycles were built for Harley-Davidson in Dayton, Ohio, by the Davis Machine Company from 1917 to 1921, when Davis stopped manufacturing bicycles.[24]
1920s




Harley-Davidson 1000 cc HT 1923


By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, with 28,189 machines produced, and dealers in 67 countries.[25]
In 1921, a Harley-Davidson, ridden by Otto Walker, was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than 100 mph (160 km/h).[26][27]
During the 1920s, several improvements were put in place, such as a new 74 cubic inch (1,212.6  cm³) V-Twin, introduced in 1921, and the "teardrop" gas tank in 1925. A front brake was added in 1928 although notably only on the J/JD models.[28]
In the late summer of 1929, Harley-Davidson introduced its 45 cubic inches (737 cm³) flathead V-Twin to compete with the Indian 101 Scout and the Excelsior Super X.[29] This was the "D" model, produced from 1929 to 1931.[30] Riders of Indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the "three cylinder Harley" because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder.[31] The 2.745 in (69.7 mm) bore and 3.8125 in (96.8 mm) stroke would continue in most versions of the 750 engine; exceptions include the XA and the XR-750.[citation needed]
Great Depression

The Great Depression began a few months after the introduction of their 45 cubic inch (737 cm³) model. Harley-Davidson's sales fell from 21,000 in 1929 to 3,703 in 1933. Despite this, Harley-Davidson unveiled a new lineup for 1934, which included a flathead engine and Art Deco styling.[32]
In order to survive the remainder of the Depression, the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines. They also designed and built a three-wheeled delivery vehicle called the Servi-Car, which remained in production until 1973.[29]




Harley-Davidson UL


In the mid-1930s, Alfred Rich Child opened a production line in Japan with the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cm³) VL. The Japanese license-holder, Sankyo Seiyaku Corporation, severed its business relations with Harley-Davidson in 1936 and continued manufacturing the VL under the Rikuo name.[33]

An 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cm³) flathead engine was added to the line in 1935, by which time the single-cylinder motorcycles had been discontinued.[34]
In 1936, the 61E and 61EL models with the "Knucklehead" OHV engines was introduced.[35] Valvetrain problems in early Knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines.[36]
By 1937, all Harley-Davidson's flathead engines were equipped with dry-sump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the "Knucklehead" OHV engine. The revised 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cm³) V and VL models were renamed U and UL, the 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc³) VH and VLH to be renamed UH and ULH, and the 45-cubic-inch (740 cc³) R to be renamed W.[35]
In 1941, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210 cm³) "Knucklehead" was introduced as the F and the FL. The 80-cubic-inch (1,300 cc³) flathead UH and ULH models were discontinued after 1941, while the 74 inch (1880 mm) U & UL flathead models were produced up to 1948.[35]
World War II




Harley copied the BMW R71 to produce its XA model.


One of only two American cycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression,[5][37] Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers.
Harley-Davidson, on the eve of World War II, was already supplying the Army with a military-specific version of its 45 cubic inches (740 cm³) WL line, called the WLA. The A in this case stood for "Army". Upon the outbreak of war, the company, along with most other manufacturing enterprises, shifted to war work. More than 90,000 military motorcycles, mostly WLAs and WLCs (the Canadian version) were produced, many to be provided to allies.[38] Harley-Davidson received two Army-Navy ‘E’ Awards, one in 1943 and the other in 1945, which were awarded for Excellence in Production.




Harley produced the WLC for the Canadian military.


Shipments to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program numbered at least 30,000.[39] The WLAs produced during all four years of war production generally have 1942 serial numbers. Production of the WLA stopped at the end of World War II, but was resumed from 1950 to 1952 for use in the Korean War.
The U.S. Army also asked Harley-Davidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71. Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft-driven 750 cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. This shared no dimensions, no parts and no design concepts (except side valves) with any prior Harley-Davidson engine. Due to the superior cooling of the flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100 °F (56 °C) cooler than its V-twins.[40] The XA never entered full production: the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army's general purpose vehicle, and the WLA—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police, escort, and courier roles. Only 1,000 were made and the XA never went into full production. It remains the only shaft-driven Harley-Davidson ever made.
Small Harleys: Hummers and Aermacchis




Harley-Davidson Hummer


See also: Harley-Davidson Hummer and Harley-Davidson Topper
As part of war reparations, Harley-Davidson acquired the design of a small German motorcycle, the DKW RT 125, which they adapted, manufactured, and sold from 1948 to 1966.[41] Various models were made, including the Hummer from 1955 to 1959, but they are all colloquially referred to as "Hummers" at present.[42] BSA in the United Kingdom took the same design as the foundation of their BSA Bantam.[43]




1971 Aermacchi Harley-Davidson Turismo Veloce


In 1960, Harley-Davidson consolidated the Model 165 and Hummer lines into the Super-10, introduced the Topper scooter,[44] and bought fifty percent of Aermacchi's motorcycle division.[44][45] Importation of Aermacchi's 250 cc horizontal single began the following year.[45][46][47] The bike bore Harley-Davidson badges and was marketed as the Harley-Davidson Sprint.[46][47] The engine of the Sprint was increased to 350 cc in 1969[45][48] and would remain that size until 1974, when the four-stroke Sprint was discontinued.[48]
After the Pacer and Scat models were discontinued at the end of 1965, the Bobcat became the last of Harley-Davidson's American-made two-stroke motorcycles. The Bobcat was manufactured only in the 1966 model year.[49]
Harley-Davidson replaced their American-made lightweight two-stroke motorcycles with the Aermacchi-built two-stroke powered M-65, M-65S, and Rapido. The M-65 had a semi-step-through frame and tank. The M-65S was a M-65 with a larger tank that eliminated the step-through feature. The Rapido was a larger bike with a 125 cc engine.[50] The Aermacchi-built Harley-Davidsons became entirely two-stroke powered when the 250 cc two-stroke SS-250 replaced the four-stroke 350 cc Sprint in 1974.[51]
Harley-Davidson purchased full control of Aermacchi's motorcycle production in 1974 and continued making two-stroke motorcycles there until 1978, when they sold the facility to Cagiva.[44]
Overseas
Established in 1918, the oldest continuously operating Harley-Davidson dealership outside of the United States is in Australia.[4] Sales in Japan started in 1912[4] then in 1929, Harley-Davidsons were produced in Japan under license to the company Rikuo (Rikuo Internal Combustion Company)[52] under the name of Harley-Davidson and using the company's tooling, and later under the name Rikuo. Production continued until 1958.[53][54]
Tarnished reputation

In 1952, following their application to the U.S. Tariff Commission for a 40 percent tax on imported motorcycles, Harley-Davidson was charged with restrictive practices.[55]




AMF H-D Electra Glide


In 1969, American Machine and Foundry (AMF) bought the company, streamlined production, and slashed the workforce. This tactic resulted in a labor strike and lower-quality bikes.[6] The bikes were expensive and inferior in performance, handling, and quality to Japanese motorcycles. Sales and quality declined, and the company almost went bankrupt.[6] The "Harley-Davidson" name was mocked as "Hardly Ableson", "Hardly Driveable," and "Hogly Ferguson",[56][57] and the nickname "Hog" became pejorative.[citation needed]
In 1977, following the successful manufacture of the Liberty Edition to commemorate America's bicentennial in 1976,[58] Harley-Davidson produced what has become one of its most controversial models, the Harley-Davidson Confederate Edition. The bike was essentially a stock Harley with Confederate-specific paint and details.[59]
Restructuring and revival
In 1981, AMF sold the company to a group of 13 investors led by Vaughn Beals and Willie G. Davidson for $80 million.[60] Inventory was strictly controlled using the just-in-time system.
In the early eighties, Harley-Davidson claimed that Japanese manufacturers were importing motorcycles into the US in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers. After an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission, President Reagan imposed in 1983 a 45 percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than 700 cc. Harley-Davidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from Japanese motorcycle makers.[61] However, the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the Japanese.[62]
Rather than trying to match the Japanese, the new management deliberately exploited the "retro" appeal of the machines, building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era. Many components such as brakes, forks, shocks, carburetors, electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased, technical improvements were made, and buyers slowly returned.
Harley-Davidson bought the "Sub Shock" cantilever-swingarm rear suspension design from Missouri engineer Bill Davis and developed it into its Softail series of motorcycles, introduced in 1984 with the FXST Softail.[63]
In response to possible motorcycle market loss due to the aging of baby-boomers, Harley-Davidson bought luxury motorhome manufacturer Holiday Rambler in 1986.[64] In 1996, the company sold Holiday Rambler to the Monaco Coach Corporation.[65]
The "Sturgis" model, boasting a dual belt-drive, was introduced initially in 1980 and was made for three years. This bike was then brought back as a commemorative model in 1991. By 1990, with the introduction of the "Fat Boy", Harley once again became the sales leader in the heavyweight (over 750 cm³) market.[citation needed] At the time of the Fat Boy model introduction, a story rapidly spread that its silver paint job and other features were inspired by the B-29; and Fat Boy was a combination of the names of the atomic bombs Fat Man and Little Boy.[66] However, the Urban Legend Reference Pages lists this story as an urban legend.[67][68]
1993 and 1994 saw the replacement of FXR models with the Dyna (FXD), which became the sole rubber mount FX Big Twin frame in 1994. The FXR was revived briefly from 1999 to 2000 for special limited editions (FXR2, FXR3 & FXR4).[69]
Construction started on the $75 million, 130,000 square-foot (12,000 m2) Harley-Davidson Museum in the Menomonee Valley on June 1, 2006. It opened in 2008 and houses the company's vast collection of historic motorcycles and corporate archives, along with a restaurant, café and meeting space.[70]
Buell Motorcycle Company
Main article: Buell Motorcycle Company




Buell Lightning XB9SX


Harley-Davidson's association with sportbike manufacturer Buell Motorcycle Company began in 1987 when they supplied Buell with fifty surplus XR1000 engines. Buell continued to buy engines from Harley-Davidson until 1993, when Harley-Davidson bought 49 percent of the Buell Motorcycle Company.[71] Harley-Davidson increased its share in Buell to ninety-eight percent in 1998, and to complete ownership in 2003.[72]
In an attempt to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to Harley-Davidson in particular, Buell developed a low-cost, low-maintenance motorcycle. The resulting single-cylinder Buell Blast was introduced in 2000,[73] and was made through 2009, which, according to Buell, was to be the final year of production.[74]
On October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson Inc. issued an official statement that it would be discontinuing the Buell line and ceasing production immediately.[75] The stated reason was to focus on the Harley-Davidson brand. The company refused to consider selling Buell.[76] Founder Erik Buell subsequently established Erik Buell Racing and continued to manufacture and develop the company's 1125RR racing motorcycle.[77]
First overseas factory in Brazil
In 1998 the first Harley-Davidson factory outside the US opened in Manaus, Brazil, taking advantage of the free economic zone there. The location was positioned to sell motorcycles in the southern hemisphere market.[78][79]
Claims of stock price manipulation


Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) stock price (source: ZenoBank.com)


During its period of peak demand, during the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, Harley-Davidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country. At the same time, its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models. Harley-Davidson, like the auto manufacturers, records a sale not when a consumer buys their product, but rather when it is delivered to a dealer. Therefore, it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing. When demand softened following the unique 2003 model year, this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price. In April 2004 alone, the price of HOG shares dropped from more than $60 to less than $40. Immediately prior to this decline, retiring CEO Jeffrey Bleustein profited $42 million on the exercise of employee stock options.[80] Harley-Davidson was named as a defendant in numerous class action suits filed by investors who claimed they were intentionally defrauded by Harley-Davidson's management and directors.[81] By January 2007, the price of Harley-Davidson shares reached $70.
Problems with Police Touring models
Starting around 2000, several police departments started reporting problems with high speed instability on the Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycles.[82] A Raleigh, North Carolina police officer, Charles Paul, was killed when his 2002 police touring motorcycle crashed after reportedly experiencing a high speed wobble.[83] The California Highway Patrol conducted testing of the Police Touring motorcycles in 2006. The CHP test riders reported experiencing wobble or weave instability while operating the motorcycles on the test track.[84]
2007 strike
On February 2, 2007, upon the expiration of their union contract, about 2,700 employees at Harley-Davidson Inc.'s largest manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania went on strike after failing to agree on wages and health benefits.[85][86] During the pendency of the strike, the company refused to pay for any portion of the striking employees' health care.[87]
The day before the strike, after the union voted against the proposed contract and to authorize the strike, the company shut down all production at the plant. The York facility employs more than 3,200 workers, both union and non-union.[88]
Harley-Davidson announced on February 16, 2007, that it had reached a labor agreement with union workers at its largest manufacturing plant, a breakthrough in the two-week-old strike.[89] The strike disrupted Harley-Davidson's national production and was felt in Wisconsin, where 440 employees were laid off, and many Harley suppliers also laid off workers because of the strike.[90]
MV Agusta Group
On July 11, 2008 Harley-Davidson announced they had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the MV Agusta Group for $109M USD (€70M). MV Agusta Group contains two lines of motorcycles: the high-performance MV Agusta brand and the lightweight Cagiva brand.[91][92] The acquisition was completed on August 8.[93][94]
On October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson announced that it would divest its interest in MV Agusta.[75] Harley-Davidson Inc. sold Italian motorcycle maker MV Agusta to Claudio Castiglioni, ending the transaction in the first week of August 2010. Castiglioni is the company's former owner and had been MV Agusta's chairman since Harley-Davidson bought it in 2008.[95]
Operations in India
Main article: Harley-Davidson India
In August 2009, Harley-Davidson announced plans to enter the market in India, and started selling motorcycles there in 2010. The company established a subsidiary, Harley-Davidson India, in Gurgaon, near Delhi, in 2011, and created an Indian dealer network.[96][97]
Financial crisis
According to Interbrand, the value of the Harley-Davidson brand fell by 43 percent to $4.34 billion in 2009. The fall in value is believed to be connected to the 66 percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year.[98] On April 29, 2010, Harley-Davidson stated that they must cut $54 million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in Wisconsin, and that they would explore alternative U.S. sites to accomplish this. The announcement came in the wake of a massive company-wide restructuring, which began in early 2009 and involved the closing of two factories, one distribution center, and the planned elimination of nearly 25 percent of its total workforce (around 3,500 employees). The company announced on September 14, 2010 that it would remain in Wisconsin.[99]
Motorcycle engines




1,450 cc V-twin


Main article: Harley-Davidson engine timeline
The classic Harley-Davidson engines are V-twin engines, with a 45° angle between the cylinders. The crankshaft has a single pin, and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods.[7]
This 45° angle is covered under several United States patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large, high-torque engine in a relatively small space. It causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy "potato-potato" sound so strongly linked to the Harley-Davidson brand.
To simplify the engine and reduce costs, the V-twin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This is known as a dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively "wasting a spark". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping. The 45° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such: The first cylinder fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315° later, then there is a 405° gap until the first cylinder fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.[100]
Harley-Davidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system, (Big Twin up to 1978 and Sportsters up to 1978), magneto ignition system used on some 1958 to 1969 Sportsters, early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights, (all models 1978 and a half to 1979), or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module, more familiarly known as the black box or the brain, (all models 1980 to present).
Starting in 1995, the company introduced Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) as an option for the 30th anniversary edition Electra Glide.[101] EFI became standard on all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, including Sportsters, upon the introduction of the 2007 product line.[102]
In 1991, Harley-Davidson began to participate in the Sound Quality Working Group, founded by Orfield Labs, Bruel and Kjaer, TEAC, Yamaha, Sennheiser, SMS and Cortex. This was the nation's first group to share research on psychological acoustics. Later that year, Harley-Davidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at Orfield Labs, based on recordings taken at the Talladega Superspeedway, with the objective to lower the sound level for EU standards while analytically capturing the "Harley Sound".[citation needed] This research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with EU standards for 1998.
On February 1, 1994, the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine: "The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use". Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed comments opposing the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use a single-crankpin V-twin engine which produce a similar sound.[103] These objections were followed by litigation. In June 2000, the company dropped efforts to federally register its trademark.[104][105]

Revolution engine




V-Rod on the show room floor


The Revolution engine is based on the VR-1000 Superbike race program, co-developed by Harley-Davidson's Powertrain Engineering team and Porsche Engineering in Stuttgart, Germany. It is a liquid cooled, dual overhead cam, internally counterbalanced 60 degree V-twin engine with a displacement of 69 cubic inch (1,130 cm³), producing 115 hp (86 kW) at 8,250 rpm at the crank, with a redline of 9,000 rpm.[107][108] It was introduced for the new V-Rod line in 2001 for the 2002 model year, starting with the single VRSCA (V-Twin Racing Street Custom) model.[109][110] The Revolution marks Harley's first collaboration with Porsche since the V4 Nova project, which, like the V-Rod, was a radical departure from Harley's traditional lineup until it was cancelled by AMF in 1981 in favor of the Evolution engine.[111]
A 1,250 cc Screamin' Eagle version of the Revolution engine was made available for 2005 and 2006, and was present thereafter in a single production model from 2005 to 2007. In 2008, the 1,250 cc Revolution Engine became standard for the entire VRSC line. Harley-Davidson claims 123 hp (92 kW) at the crank for the 2008 VRSCAW model. The VRXSE Destroyer is equipped with a stroker (75 mm crank) Screamin' Eagle 79 cubic inch (1,300 cm³) Revolution Engine, producing more than 165 hp (123 kW).
750 cc and 500 cc versions of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers.[112] These motors, named the Revolution X, use a single overhead cam, screw and locknut valve adjustment, a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.[citation needed]
Düsseldorf-Test
An extreme endurance test of the Revolution engine was performed in a dynometer installation, simulating the German Autobahn (highways without general speed limit) between the Porsche research and development center in Weissach, near Stuttgart to Düsseldorf. Uncounted samples of engines crashed, until an engine successfully passed the 500 hour nonstop run. This was the benchmark for the engineers to approve the start of production for the Revolution engine, which was documented in the Discovery channel special Harley-Davidson: Birth of the V-Rod, October 14, 2001.[113]
Single-cylinder engines




1928 Harley-Davidson single-cylinder motorcycle



IOE singles

The first Harley-Davidson motorcycles were powered by single-cylinder IOE engines with the inlet valve operated by engine vacuum.[114] Singles of this type continued to be made until 1913, when a pushrod and rocker system was used to operate the overhead inlet valve on the single, a similar system having been used on their V-twins since 1911.[115] Single-cylinder motorcycle engines were discontinued in 1918.[116]

Flathead and OHV singles

Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models.[117] These singles were available either as flathead engines or as overhead valve engines[118] until 1930, after which they were only available as flatheads.[117] The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S.[118] This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.[117]

Model families
Modern Harley-branded motorcycles fall into one of six model families: Touring, Softail, Dyna, Sportster, Vrod and Street. These model families are distinguished by the frame, engine, suspension, and other characteristics.
Touring
See also: Harley-Davidson FL




Hamburg Police Electra Glide


Touring models use Big-Twin engines and large-diameter telescopic forks. All Touring designations begin with the letters FL, e.g., FLHR (Road King) and FLTR (Road Glide).
The touring family, also known as "dressers" or "baggers", includes Road King, Road Glide, Street Glide and Electra Glide models offered in various trims. The Road Kings have a "retro cruiser" appearance and are equipped with a large clear windshield. Road Kings are reminiscent of big-twin models from the 1940s and 1950s. Electra Glides can be identified by their full front fairings. Most Electra Glides sport a fork-mounted fairing referred to as the "Batwing" due to its unmistakable shape. The Road Glide and Road Glide Ultra Classic have a frame-mounted fairing, referred to as the "Sharknose". The Sharknose includes a unique, dual front headlight.
Touring models are distinguishable by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension and are the only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by the location of the steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.




Electra Glide "Ultra Classic"


The frame was modified for the 1994 model year when the oil tank went under the transmission and the battery was moved inboard from under the right saddlebag to under the seat. In 1997, the frame was again modified to allow for a larger battery under the seat and to lower seat height. In 2007, Harley-Davidson introduced the 96 cubic inches (1,570 cubic centimetres)[119] Twin Cam 96 engine, as well the six-speed transmission to give the rider better speeds on the highway.
In 2006, Harley introduced the FLHX Street Glide, a bike designed by Willie G. Davidson to be his personal ride, to its touring line.[120]
In 2008, Harley added anti-lock braking systems and cruise control as a factory installed option on all touring models (standard on CVO and Anniversary models).[121] Also new for 2008 is the 6-US-gallon (23 l; 5.0 imp gal) fuel tank for all touring models. 2008 also brought throttle-by-wire to all touring models.
For the 2009 model year, Harley-Davidson redesigned the entire touring range with several changes, including a new frame, new swingarm, a completely revised engine-mounting system, 17-inch (430 mm) front wheels for all but the FLHRC Road King Classic, and a 2–1–2 exhaust. The changes result in greater load carrying capacity, better handling, a smoother engine, longer range and less exhaust heat transmitted to the rider and passenger.[122][123] Also released for the 2009 model year is the FLHTCUTG Tri-Glide Ultra Classic, the first three-wheeled Harley since the Servi-Car was discontinued in 1973. The model features a unique frame and a 103-cubic-inch (1,690 cm³) engine exclusive to the trike.[124]
In 2014, Harley-Davidson released a redesign for specific touring bikes and called it "Project Rushmore".[125] Changes include a new 103CI High Output engine, one handed easy open saddlebags and compartments, a new Boom! Box Infotainment system with either 4.3 inch (10 cm) or 6.5 inch (16.5 cm) screens featuring touchscreen functionality [6.5 inch (16.5 cm) models only], Bluetooth (media and phone with approved compatible devices), available GPS and SiriusXM, Text-to-Speech functionality (with approved compatible devices) and USB connectivity with charging. Other features include ABS with Reflex linked brakes, improved styling, Halogen or LED lighting and upgraded passenger comfort.
Softail
Main article: Softail




2002 Softail Heritage Classic.


These big-twin motorcycles capitalize on Harley's strong value on tradition. With the rear-wheel suspension hidden under the transmission, they are visually similar to the "hardtail" choppers popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as from their own earlier history. In keeping with that tradition, Harley offers Softail models with "Heritage" styling that incorporate design cues from throughout their history and used to offer "Springer" front ends on these Softail models from the factory.

Designation

Softail models utilize the big-twin engine (F) and the Softail chassis (ST).

Softail models that use 21 inch (530 mm) Front Wheels have designations that begin with FX, e.g., FXSTB (Night Train), FXSTD (Deuce), and FXSTS (Springer).
Softail models that use 16 inch (410 mm) Front Wheels have designations beginning with FL, e.g., FLSTF (Fat Boy), FLSTC (Heritage Softail Classic), FLSTN (Softail Deluxe) and FLS (Softail Slim).
Softail models that use Springer forks with a 21-inch (530 mm) wheel have designations that begin with FXSTS, e.g., FXSTS (Springer Softail) and FXSTSB (Bad Boy).
Softail models that use Springer forks with a 16-inch (410 mm) wheel have designations that begin with FLSTS, e.g., FLSTSC (Springer Classic) and FLSTSB (Cross Bones).

Dyna
Main article: Harley-Davidson Super Glide




2005 Dyna Super Glide Custom.


Dyna-frame motorcycles were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's oil reservoir.
Prior to 2006, Dyna models typically featured a narrow, XL-style 39mm front fork and front wheel, as well as footpegs which the manufacturer included the letter "X" in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and Low Rider (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which featured thicker 41mm forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) was introduced to the Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2–1–2 exhaust, twin headlamps, a 180 mm rear tire, and, for the first time in the Dyna lineup, a 130 mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards, detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender. The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.
The Dyna family used the 88-cubic-inch (1,440 cm³) twin cam from 1999 to 2006. In 2007, the displacement was increased to 96 cubic inches (1,570 cm³) as the factory increased the stroke to 4.375 inches (111.1 mm). For the 2012 model year, the manufacturer began to offer Dyna models with the 103-cubic-inch (1,690 cm³) upgrade. All Dyna models use a rubber-mounted engine to isolate engine vibration.

Designation

Dyna models utilize the big-twin engine (F), footpegs noted as (X) with the exception of the 2012 FLD Switchback, a Dyna model which used floorboards as featured on the Touring (L) models, and the Dyna chassis (D). Therefore, except for the FLD from 2012 to 2016, all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD, e.g., FXDWG (Dyna Wide Glide) and FXDL (Dyna Low Rider).
Sportster
Main article: Harley-Davidson Sportster




2002 Sportster 883 Custom






2003 Harley-Davidson XL1200 Custom Anniversary Edition


Introduced in 1957, the Sportster family were conceived as racing motorcycles, and were popular on dirt and flat-track race courses through the 1960s and 1970s. Smaller and lighter than the other Harley models, contemporary Sportsters make use of 883 cc or 1,200 cc Evolution engines and, though often modified, remain similar in appearance to their racing ancestors.[126]
Up until the 2003 model year, the engine on the Sportster was rigidly mounted to the frame. The 2004 Sportster received a new frame accommodating a rubber-mounted engine. This made the bike heavier and reduced the available lean angle, while it reduced the amount of vibration transmitted to the frame and the rider, providing a smoother ride for rider and passenger.[127]
In the 2007 model year, Harley-Davidson celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Sportster and produced a limited edition called the XL50, of which only 2000 were made for sale worldwide. Each motorcycle was individually numbered and came in one of two colors, Mirage Pearl Orange or Vivid Black. Also in 2007, electronic fuel injection was introduced to the Sportster family, and the Nightster model was introduced in mid-year. In 2009, Harley-Davidson added the Iron 883 to the Sportster line, as part of the Dark Custom series. In the 2008 model year, Harley-Davidson released the XR1200 Sportster in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The XR1200 had an Evolution engine tuned to produce 91 bhp (68 kW), four-piston dual front disc brakes, and an aluminum swing arm. Motorcyclist featured the XR1200 on the cover of its July 2008 issue and was generally positive about it in their "First Ride" story, in which Harley-Davidson was repeatedly asked to sell it in the United States.[128] One possible reason for the delayed availability in the United States was the fact that Harley-Davidson had to obtain the "XR1200" naming rights from Storz Performance, a Harley customizing shop in Ventura, Calif.[129] The XR1200 was released in the United States in 2009 in a special color scheme including Mirage Orange highlighting its dirt-tracker heritage. The first 750 XR1200 models in 2009 were pre-ordered and came with a number 1 tag for the front of the bike, autographed by Kenny Coolbeth and Scott Parker and a thank you/welcome letter from the company, signed by Bill Davidson.[citation needed] The XR1200 was discontinued in model year 2013.

Designation

Except for the street-going XR1000 of the 1980s and the XR1200, most Sportsters made for street use have the prefix XL in their model designation. For the Sportster Evolution engines used since the mid-1980s, there have been two engine sizes. Motorcycles with the smaller engine are designated XL883, while those with the larger engine were initially designated XL1100. When the size of the larger engine was increased from 1,100 cc to 1,200 cc, the designation was changed accordingly from XL1100 to XL1200. Subsequent letters in the designation refer to model variations within the Sportster range, e.g. the XL883C refers to an 883 cc Sportster Custom, while the XL1200S designates the now-discontinued 1200 Sportster Sport.
VRSC
Main article: Harley-Davidson VRSC




V-Rod


Introduced in 2001 and produced until 2017,[130]the VRSC muscle bike family bears little resemblance to Harley's more traditional lineup. Competing against Japanese and American muscle bikes in the upcoming muscle bike/power cruiser segment, the "V-Rod" makes use of an engine developed jointly with Porsche that, for the first time in Harley history, incorporates overhead cams and liquid cooling. The V-Rod is visually distinctive, easily identified by the 60-degree V-Twin engine, the radiator and the hydroformed frame members that support the round-topped air cleaner cover. The VRSC platform was also used for factory drag-racing motorcycles.
In 2008, Harley added the anti-lock braking system as a factory installed option on all VRSC models.[121] Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from 1,130 to 1,250 cc (69 to 76 cu in), which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a slipper clutch as standard equipment.
VRSC models include:
VRSCA: V-Rod (2002–2006), VRSCAW: V-Rod (2007–2010), VRSCB: V-Rod (2004–2005), VRSCD: Night Rod (2006–2008), VRSCDX: Night Rod Special (2007–2014), VRSCSE: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2005), VRSCSE2: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2006), VRSCR: Street Rod (2006–2007), VRSCX: Screamin' Eagle Tribute V-Rod (2007), VRSCF: V-Rod Muscle (2009–2014).

Designation

VRSC models utilize the Revolution engine (VR), and the street versions are designated Street Custom (SC). After the VRSC prefix common to all street Revolution bikes, the next letter denotes the model, either A (base V-Rod: discontinued), AW (base V-Rod + W for Wide with a 240 mm rear tire), B (discontinued), D (Night Rod: discontinued), R (Street Rod: discontinued), SE and SEII(CVO Special Edition), or X (Special edition). Further differentiation within models are made with an additional letter, e.g., VRSCDX denotes the Night Rod Special.
VRXSE
The VRXSE V-Rod Destroyer is Harley-Davidson's production drag racing motorcycle, constructed to run the quarter mile in less than ten seconds. It is based on the same revolution engine that powers the VRSC line, but the VRXSE uses the Screamin' Eagle 1,300 cc "stroked" incarnation, featuring a 75 mm crankshaft, 105 mm Pistons, and 58 mm throttle bodies.
The V-Rod Destroyer is not a street legal motorcycle. As such, it uses "X" instead of "SC" to denote a non-street bike. "SE" denotes a CVO Special Edition.
Street
Main article: Harley-Davidson Street
The Street, Harley-Davidson's newest platform and their first all new platform in thirteen years, was designed to appeal to younger riders looking for a lighter bike at a cheaper price.[112] The Street 750 model was launched in India at the 2014 Indian Auto Expo, Delhi-NCR on 5 February 2014. The Street 750 weighs 218 kg and has a ground clearance of 144 mm giving it the lowest weight and the highest ground clearance of Harley-Davidson motorcycles currently available.[131]
The Street 750 uses an all-new, liquid-cooled, 60° V-twin engine called the Revolution X. In the Street 750, the engine displaces 749 cc (45.7 cu in) and produces 65 Nm at 4,000 rpm. A six speed transmission is used.[131]
The Street 750 and the smaller-displacement Street 500 has been available since late 2014.[112] Street series motorcycles for the North American market will be built in Harley-Davidson's Kansas City, Missouri plant,[112] while those for other markets around the world will be built completely in their plant in Bawal, India.[112][131]

Custom Vehicle Operations (CVO) is a team within Harley-Davidson that produces limited-edition customizations of Harley's stock models. Every year since 1999, the team has selected two to five of the company's base models and added higher-displacement engines, performance upgrades, special-edition paint jobs, more chromed or accented components, audio system upgrades, and electronic accessories to create high-dollar, premium-quality customizations for the factory custom market. The models most commonly upgraded in such a fashion are the Ultra Classic Electra Glide, which has been selected for CVO treatment every year from 2006 to the present, and the Road King, which was selected in 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2008. The Dyna, Softail, and VRSC families have also been selected for CVO customization.
Environmental record
The Environmental Protection Agency conducted emissions-certification and representative emissions test in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 2005. Subsequently, Harley-Davidson produced an "environmental warranty". The warranty ensures each owner that the vehicle is designed and built free of any defects in materials and workmanship that would cause the vehicle to not meet EPA standards.[132] In 2005, the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) confirmed Harley-Davidson to be the first corporation to voluntarily enroll in the One Clean-Up Program. This program is designed for the clean-up of the affected soil and groundwater at the former York Naval Ordnance Plant. The program is backed by the state and local government along with participating organizations and corporations.[133]
Paul Gotthold, Director of Operations for the EPA, congratulated the motor company:

Harley-Davidson has taken their environmental responsibilities very seriously and has already made substantial progress in the investigation and cleanup of past contamination. Proof of Harley's efforts can be found in the recent EPA determination that designates the Harley property as 'under control' for cleanup purposes. This determination means that there are no serious contamination problems at the facility. Under the new One Cleanup Program, Harley, EPA, and PADEP will expedite the completion of the property investigation and reach a final solution that will permanently protect human health and the environment.[133]

Harley-Davidson also purchased most of Castalloy, a South Australian producer of cast motorcycle wheels and hubs. The South Australian government has set forth "protection to the purchaser (Harley-Davidson) against environmental risks".[134]
In August 2016 Harley-Davidson settled with the EPA for $12 million, without admitting wrongdoing, over the sale of after-market "super tuners".[135][136] Super tuners were devices, marketed for competition, which enabled increased performance of Harley-Davidson products. However, the devices also modified the emission control systems, producing increased hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide. Harley-Davidson is required to buy back and destroy any super tuners which do not meet Clean Air Act requirements and spend $3 million on air pollution mitigation.

According to a recent Harley-Davidson study, in 1987 half of all Harley riders were under age 35.[137] Now, only 15 percent of Harley buyers are under 35,[137] and as of 2005, the median age had risen to 46.7.[138][139][140][141]
In 1987, the median household income of a Harley-Davidson rider was $38,000. By 1997, the median household income for those riders had more than doubled, to $83,000.[142][clarification needed]
Many Harley-Davidson Clubs exist nowadays around the world,[143] the oldest one, founded in 1928, is in Prague.[144][145][146][147][148]
Harley-Davidson attracts a loyal brand community,[149] with licensing of the Harley-Davidson logo accounting for almost 5 percent of the company's net revenue ($41 million in 2004).[150] Harley-Davidson supplies many American police forces with their motorcycle fleets.[151]
Harley-Davidson motorcycles has long been associated with the sub-cultures of the biker, motorcycle clubs, and Outlaw motorcycle clubs.
Origin of "Hog" nickname
Beginning in 1920, a team of farm boys, including Ray Weishaar, who became known as the "hog boys", consistently won races. The group had a live hog as their mascot. Following a win, they would put the hog on their Harley and take a victory lap.[152] In 1983, the Motor Company formed a club for owners of its product taking advantage of the long-standing nickname by turning "hog" into the acronym HOG., for Harley Owners Group. Harley-Davidson attempted to trademark "hog", but lost a case against an independent Harley-Davidson specialist, The Hog Farm of West Seneca, New York,[153] in 1999 when the appellate panel ruled that "hog" had become a generic term for large motorcycles and was therefore unprotectable as a trademark.[154]
On August 15, 2006, Harley-Davidson Inc. had its NYSE ticker symbol changed from HDI to HOG.[155]
Bobbers
Harley-Davidson FL "big twins" normally had heavy steel fenders, chrome trim, and other ornate and heavy accessories. After World War II, riders wanting more speed would often shorten the fenders or take them off completely to reduce the weight of the motorcycle. These bikes were called "bobbers" or sometimes "choppers" because parts considered unnecessary were chopped off. Those who made or rode choppers and bobbers, especially members of outlaw bike gangs like the Hells Angels, referred to stock FLs as "garbage wagons".[156]
Harley Owners Group
Main article: Harley Owners Group
Harley-Davidson established the Harley Owners Group (HOG) in 1983 to build on the loyalty of Harley-Davidson enthusiasts as a means to promote a lifestyle alongside its products. The HOG also opened new revenue streams for the company, with the production of tie-in merchandise offered to club members, numbering more than one million. Other motorcycle brands,[157] and other and consumer brands outside motorcycling, have also tried to create factory-sponsored community marketing clubs of their own.[158] HOG members typically spend 30 percent more than other Harley owners, on such items as clothing and Harley-Davidson-sponsored events.[159]
In 1991, HOG went international, with the first official European HOG Rally in Cheltenham, England.[160] Today, more than one million members and more than 1400 chapters worldwide make HOG the largest factory-sponsored motorcycle organization in the world.[161]
HOG benefits include organized group rides, exclusive products and product discounts, insurance discounts, and the Hog Tales newsletter. A one-year full membership is included with the purchase of a new, unregistered Harley-Davidson.[162]
In 2008, HOG celebrated its 25th anniversary in conjunction with the Harley 105th in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
3rd Southern HOG Rally set to bring together largest gathering of Harley-Davidson owners in South India. More than 600 Harley-Davidson Owners expected to ride to Hyderabad from across 13 HOG Chapters [163]

Beginning with Harley-Davidson's 90th anniversary in 1993, Harley-Davidson has had celebratory rides to Milwaukee called the "Ride Home".[166] This new tradition has continued every five years, and is referred to unofficially as "Harleyfest", in line with Milwaukee's other festivals (Summerfest, German fest, Festa Italiana, etc.). This event brings Harley riders from all around the world.[167][168] The 105th anniversary celebration was held on August 28–31, 2008,[169] and included events in Milwaukee, Waukesha, Racine, and Kenosha counties, in Southeast Wisconsin. The 110th anniversary celebration was held on August 29–31, 2013.
Labor Hall of Fame
William S. Harley, Arthur Davidson, William A. Davidson and Walter Davidson, Sr. were inducted into the Labor Hall of Fame for their accomplishments for the H-D company and its workforce.[170]
Television drama
The company's origins were dramatized in a 2016 miniseries entitled Harley and the Davidsons, starring Robert Aramayo as William Harley, Bug Hall as Arthur Davidson[171] and Michiel Huisman as Walter Davidson, and premiered on the Discovery Channel as a "three-night event series" on September 5, 2016.[172][173]

The many connections between bicycling and motorcycling prompted Harley-Davidson to begin selling bicycles in 1917. Despite heavy promotion, sales were disappointing and production was discontinued in 1923."

This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers.
In this project we are given the role of marketing consultant for Harley Davidson and we are asked to launch and introduce Harley Davidson products in the UK market by identifying 2 market segments. We will use different marketing techniques to market, position and launch the products. Segmentation process will be used to create subgroups of customers for targeting our branded products. External & internal environment analysis will be done to build the base for the project and develop understanding.
Harley Davidson
The company was established during 1907 by two automotive enthusiast and childhood friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson. They made their first design as early as 1901 and entered into commercial business since 1905. The company launched its first model in 1905 and by 1907 formally launched the company by the name of Harley Davidson. The company took giant strides in production and development of motorcycles and by 1920 they became largest motorcycle manufacturers in the world (Harley Davidson, 2013).
Over the years the company has survived many economic downturns and has maintained its unique image and reputation among its loyal customers around the world. The company is famous for customization offered and its heavy chopper style bikes and accessories. The company only manufactures bikes for 750 cc and above. Total revenues for the year 2012 were around £ 3.4 billion (Harley Davidson, 2013).
Micro-Environment
Here we will discuss micro factors in which company is operating in this particular country.
Market Environment (Customers & Competitors)
Customers in UK market are very diverse in the context of culture, religion, ethnicity, social, life style, buying pattern, age groups and behavioral aspects. For Harley-Davidson people of all age- groups are its potential customers because UK is a highly individualistic society as stated by (Hofstede, 1980). Competitors of Harley-Davidson include Honda, Suzuki, and Kawasaki etc. But due to rapidly changing technological factors and advancements rivalry also fluctuates each year. According to Ash, (2012) in UK currently there are three competitors of Harley i.e. Triumph Speed-Master, Ducati Monster and Victory Vegas.
Market Environment (Suppliers & Intermediaries)
Harley-Davidson UK has its own dealership and supplier network which they operate and manage via their website and HD University. H-denet.com is a secure and state-of- the art website developed by Harley-Davidson UK for dealers to access (Harley-Davidson UK, 2013). The official network of dealers in UK also acts as intermediaries for Harley-Davidson and they don't use any separate retailers in the market for their products and services. This factor makes it easy for the company to sustain an efficient system of marketing distribution channels (Czinkota & Ronkainen, 2010).
Macro Environment
PESTLE Analysis
Here we will discuss the macro-factors of the country in which organization is operating.
Political
UK is also a permanent member of UN Security Council, G8 and EU. To reduce the fiscal deficit David Cameron has taken healthy measure, such as a 24% reduction to the department for sport, media and culture (Datamonitor, 2011). The positive aspect regarding motorbike industry in UK is that the collection of tax revenue from this industry is upto 1 billion pounds (Mintel, 2012).
Economic & Environmental
In the EU United Kingdom is the 2nd largest economy and is one of the strongest in the context of outward and inward foreign investment, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, standards of living and social living. So, economically the UK is a strong and safe country especially with the fact that their government is also serious about banking and financial sector performance of the country (Datamonitor, 2011). In the UK command and control principle is the basis of traditional environmental policy, whereby certain standards or quotas are given to possible polluters to fulfill and careful monitoring is then done by authorities and they deal strictly with any infringements such as EPA system (Environmental Agency, 2013).
Social
The living standard of the UK residents is quite high, such as, the system of healthcare and education delivery, child poverty and income inequality factors (Datamonitor, 2011). Culturally the UK is highly individualist society with low power distance, low uncertainty avoidance and highly masculine society (Hofstede Index, 2013)
Technological
The UK has government level focus in R&D sector and similarly motorbike brands such as Yamaha and Honda are roping in innovation in their new products which is helping in improved management and fuel optimization (Mintel, 2012).
Environment
In the UK command and control principle is the basis of traditional environmental policy, whereby certain standards or quotas are given to possible polluters to fulfill and careful monitoring is then done by authorities and they deal strictly with any infringements such as EPA system (Environmental Agency, 2013).
Legal
New regulations about driving license i.e. implementation of 3rd License has put a new set of laws for motorcycle drivers creating more limitations for the people. 17 years of age has been set minimum for driving a motorcycle as per the regulation of the UK Government, (2013).
Competitors Analysis (Harley Davidson)
The UK scooter and motorcycle industry has been dominated for a long time by Japanese brands Yamaha & Honda and currently around 3 out of 10 sales are from these two brands for new scooters and motorcycles making them strong competitors of Harley Davidson in the UK market (Mintel, 2012). The other competitors of HD are Suzuki, BMW and Ducati. The biggest market share is of Honda in the market with total market share of 39% (Mintel, 2012)
Honda
Honda has been the market leader in the motorcycle industry of the UK for many years now by bringing in innovative models and technology through its products and has been able to sustain its position successfully (Mintel, 2012).
Yamaha Motorbikes
Yamaha has been the second largest motorcycle brand in the UK in terms of market share and they have been giving tough competitor to Honda as well throughout last 5 years (Mintel, 2012). We will see statistical comparisons of these brands in the UK market to authenticate our arguments and will include recent and past year's data about the market share of these brands in the UK motorcycle & Scooter market:

These comparisons show that Honda and Yamaha have captured the major market share in the UK and posing serious threats & competition for Harley Davidson as well.
Harley Davidson Market Share
In 2004 its combined market share was 9% only and intense competition was posed against Harley by other competitors in the market. Harley Davidson has the eighth largest market share in UK behind Japanese giants Suzuki and market leader Honda etc. It is interesting to know here that in 2005 Honda's market shared dropped and the following year market share of Harley Davidson increased by 4.6% (Mintel, 2006).
SWOT Analysis of Harley Davidson Inc.
This is a planning tool which is used for understanding the threats, opportunities, weaknesses and strengths that are involved in a business or project (CIPD, 2010).
Strength
Customized bikes
Luxury brand reputation
Strong customer base and years of existing in the market
The brand name & image of Harley-Davidson.
A strong research & development (Harley-Davidson Inc, 2012).
Weakness
Sale of Company in the UK are encouraging.
Geographic concentration is vulnerable to risks (Mcbee, 2011)
Non-fuel efficient bikes
Opportunity
Differentiation and innovation of HD.
Rising interest of UK youth in motorbikes (Tim, 2012). Male 4% and Female 6% (Mintel, 2012).
Move into other markets using brand image of company such as apparel fashion clothing.
Threats
Stringent emission standards in UK (Harley-Davidson Inc, 2012).
Overall usage of Bikes in UK is very low compared to UK
Strong competition
TOWS Matrix of Harley-Davidson
SO Strategies
ST Strategies
By introducing new models of motorcycles in UK considering the cultural & technological trends in UK will help in capturing the market share.
Target female and younger generation because they are getting attracted to this segment which can help in expanding and sustaining the UK market. Harley-Davidson is a legacy for US police officers that they can continue in UK as well (Harley-Davidson, 2013).
Use manufacturing investment in UK and develop a strong dealership network for managing cost & gripping the market.
Customer loyalty in European countries especially UK can be a potential threat because Harley-Davidson is yet to obtain loyalty here. To gain that loyalty in UK via their quality services and innovation will get them their traditional strength and diminish potential threat especially quality customer services which is most considered by UK people & companies (Jenkinson, Sain 2009).
WO Strategies
WT Strategies
Average buying age of Harley-Davidson's customers is still increasing which is becoming a weakness and luxury motorcycles of the company restrain majority of younger population to buy it. The dominant segment of customers were baby boomers who are ageing out and the company needs to specifically focus on their R&D for younger segment of UK e.g. light weight motorcycles or scooters is one strategy to attract younger customers.
Harley-Davidson has never been into traditional advertising & promotional activities and have relied more on word of mouth, but few of their competitors have large marketing and financial resources (DeliKase, 2009). Use of tradition marketing & advertising methods in UK market is essential to cancel out the diversification factor.
Motorcycle noise standards of European Unions are stricter than those used in US which can be a potential threat & weakness which the company has to consider.
Porters' Five Forces Model
Micheal Porter has given this model which provides an in depth analysis for companies to help them in their strategic and marketing decision making (Hollensen, Svend 2011).
Internal Rivalry
Honda and Yamaha have entered the segment of heavy weight bikes and are rivals of Harley-Davidson. They have a competitive advantage over Harley-Davidson in the form of low prices (Rutter, 2013).
Threat of New Entrants
Motor industry is very vast and huge in terms of its product range, market & investment, so new entrant threat is something which HD should not worry about.
Bargaining Power of Suppliers & Customers
Harley-Davidson relies heavily on a single supplier for some of its raw material but, raw material is for customized bikes and there are fewer producers in the market making it minimal factor. Harley-Davidson has the brand name & image of world's most valuable brand with iconic status (BBC, 2010). But still, the price range of HD can affect the buying power of customers.
Threat of Substitution
This factor is high for HD with the introduction of innovative, cost effective and stylish Japanese brands in the market.
Market Identification
We have identified 2 target markets based on the cultural, social, economic and other factors. In depth discussion and analysis on the identified markets is as follows:
First Target Market (Segmentation)
According to Keller & Kotler, (2012) segmentation refers to a strategy using which we can create a subgroup having similar product requirements by dividing the whole relevant market of the product. First target consumer market that we have chosen will be younger generation ranging from age 8 to 15 (Male) and this is mainly due to the reason that for Harley Davidson baby boomers who are basic market segment have gone aged now and the company is in need of customers who can persist for a longer period of time and the company need to utilize its brand image to attract such customers.
Demographic Segmentation
This particular type of segmentation refers to the division of market on the basis of variables that comes under demographic aspect i.e. education, occupation, income, life cycle, family size, socio- economic group, sex and age etc. According to Armstrong & Kotler, (2010) this type of segmentation is most wide used and popular for distinguishing customer groups mainly due to the simplicity with which users can collect this sort of data. Variables of demographic segmentations in the HD's context are discussed below:
Age & Gender
In the new customer segments, young adults were identified as most prominent segments for Scotty as per the reports stated by (Mintel, 2012). We are specifically targeting male customers in this market segment with age from 8-15 years because in this age group male customers are more vulnerable to be attracted for Scotty. The kids in this age range likes to ride and have the tendency towards sport activities which makes them potential customers. Majority of kids in this market segment are school going and now scooters are used as mode of transport and allowed in schools making it more attractive product and J. Fraser of NDP Group stated that for those who cannot drive bikes this is a fun way of transport, safer than bikes and stable (Doward, 2011).
Income
Income range of these customers will be around 1000 pounds and being students parents can only afford to spend that much of money and mostly they belongs to middle class with educational level upto middle as well. It means they can easily afford to spend on Scotty of Harley Davidson which will not cost much due to its average prices as a product.
Behavioral & Social Factor
Behaviorally these customers see benefits in brands because their friends are using it and children use toys on regular basis which later on turns into heavy usage and this segment belongs to middle social class. They purchase mostly on different occasions such as Christmas, Easter and other national events or festivals and they value reliability the most i.e. my friend is using that's why it is reliable, whereas, they are not brand conscious and not loyal as well because they are using brand for the first time. Socially this particular segment has high need of kid scooters because of the school going kids and sports activities of male kids in UK (Mintel, 2012).
Psychographic Segmentation
According to Keller & Kotler, (2012) values of the consumers, personality and psychological traits are few segments on the basis of which consumers are divided in this market segment. Psychographic variables of this segment show that they are family oriented and socially conscious customers i.e. wants to buy for the child due to social pressure and competition and the interests of kids in sports activities. They possess average brand opinion and have various alternative options because they don't use brands quite often and mostly they are first time buyers. Their lifestyle is family oriented and they prefer brands that are beneficial for the kids in a reliable way and popular in their social circle of friends & peers. According to Datamonitor, (2011) middle class population of UK is increasingly using brands when it comes to their kids and children.
Product Positioning
Here we will try to create a particular image of our brand & product in the minds of the customers by positioning the Harley Davidson product accordingly. We will use perceptual mapping in this regard which will help us in identifying the exact position of our product in the perception or mind of the consumers i.e. by illustrating consumer favorites and competitor brands or products which is as follows:
Expensive
Ben
Zinc
Razor
Razor
Y.Vol
Razor Appealing Designs Reliability
Zinc
Zinc
Sporty
There are various brands available in the UK that is providing kids scooters but few brands have been able to perform better. We have taken 4 dimensions that are appropriate with scooters for kids brands i.e. designs, quality, reliability and sporty. When consumer identification was viewed it was clear that consumers view Razor, Zinc and Yvolution as reliable and sporty brands. Whereas, consumers view Razor and Zinc as sporty and cool in designs and they view Razor, Zinc and Ben as expensive and cool in designs. Harley Davidson should develop their new product for this specific market by focusing on attractive and modern designs of Scotty and use of bright color combinations that are elegant & sporty as well and avoid heavyweight Scotty's because this segment customers will prefer lighter weight Scotty due to their age and usage factor. These factors will play key role in attracting customers of this segment.
To communicate and make people aware about the uniqueness and arrival of the brand in a new way i.e. using a new tag line will be effective. For example, creating a tag line which will attract the younger generation male such as "play smart, look smart, use smart: Harley Davidson Smart Rides". We have to hit hard on the hearts & mind of our target market segment with such tag line which will make HD alive and revive because once we are able to enter this market segment with few sales it will be easy to continue. Adopt traditional ways of advertising and promotion e.g. hires a brand ambassador while launching new models and designs. Sportsperson like Andy Murray is the best possible brand ambassador who can lift the brand name & image in UK market because currently he is the most popular sports player among our target market segment i.e. younger generation males. On top of this Wimbledon Championship is coming up in few months time in the UK which will create "putting icing on the cake" impact of our brand.
Marketing Objectives of Segment1
Here we will state some marketing objectives for this segment that we want to achieve with these marketing strategies and we have to make sure that the objectives are realistic and measureable. We have outlined a 3-year marketing plan below for Harley Davidson:
To raise the market share by 1.5% in first years, 2% in the second year and 2.5% in the third year i.e. in total 6% increase in the market share for the company and we will do so by developing brand equity and brand image in the country.
Our main weapon will be to produce unique and innovative products especially designed for this target market segment so that we can achieve a respected and emerging position in this market. We want our sales to increase 5% each following year i.e. for three years.
We all know that customer service is of supreme important in this country where we see please & thank you used frequently and it is a strong culture in the UK. By considering this, we will launch a strong customer relationship management system through which customers can interact with the company regarding any issue and query anytime and feel being valued.
To achieve status of market leader in this specific UK market of Scotty in the next 3 years by basing on our marketing, CSR, innovative and consistent strategies focusing on the lifestyles of the customers of target segments.
To achieve an increase in sale progressively i.e. doubling the sales ratio for each coming year by utilizing innovative marketing techniques and fulfilling customer's precise needs through innovation and differentiation.
Marketing Mix for Segment 1
Product
For this segment we have to market such product which meets the requirements, demands, trends lifestyle and tastes of the customers. For this we will have to keep few things in mind e.g. Scotty is in trend recently and its use is vast because it fulfills the need of this segment. Using combination of 2 colors for one model i.e. blue & black, then using multi-colors for one model i.e. yellow, orange and brown will attract the kids and will show variety & uniqueness as well. We have to keep mini micro- scooters' popularity in mind which according to (BBC, 2012) has risen in last 2 years i.e. we have to keep separate designs, models, color combinations, features and reliability for different age groups such as 8-10 years, 11-13 years and then 14-15 years of consumers. This will allow us to make a positive impact and satisfy needs of this segment adequately. This year we will launch color combination of 2, in 2nd year multiple color combinations will be launched and in 3rd year new additions in previous model color combinations. At the same time we have to make different sizes of the models as well to make sure that all the age group segment benefits and use our products.
Price
Pricing factors have to consider very precisely because other brands in the market are not expensive and since Scotty is a new product by Harley Davidson for specific market segment and people have made up their mind regarding price by looking at other brands. A new pricing criteria is needed for this segment because we will be targeting this segment majorly in our marketing strategies and as (Schembri, 2009) stated that premium prices are offered by HD for its products. In addition the current consumer market of scooters in UK is price sensitive and we have to forgo our pricing strategy that we use for our other products. We have to adopt cost- based pricing for this segment as we have to keep in mind the purchasing power of the customers and they will be new customers plus we have to look at 3 years strategy by competing with strong competitors. So, initially competitive prices should be offered that are not more than what competitors are offering and once the customers has admired the brand product and accepted, then we can think about increasing slightly when the risk will be minimum.
Place
Social media and company's own website will be effective sources of distribution apart from company's own dealership network in the country. Social media is important because it plays a fast and effective role in today's world for communicating and distributing products and services in a cost effective way. Facebook pages and twitter accounts will be used to let the dotcom generation know about the HD products and the company's own website will be modified with information about the new and upcoming products and their features. According to Ofcom, (2012), over 80% of the UK population today uses social media for different purposes which show the potential in this source. The website of the company will also allow the customers to locate the official dealers countrywide and to interact with them about gathering information and queries. In addition, the company should add 5-10 more dealers in major cities of the country to cover maximum number of customers.
Promotion
Creating a super hero logo to be used on all models of scooters will be a great way to promote the brand i.e. just like Spiderman & batman we will design our own super hero logo which will attract young kids. In addition hiring a brand ambassador for this product line will be positive such as; Andy Murray will be the best possible person for this role because he is very popular among younger generation. Public appearances of Andy in few events will provide great advertising benefits to the company or in few competitions of kids about riding scooters. Developing an android application or game about the new products of HD by using the super hero logo that drives scooters of HD and it will also produce high results because almost 85% of the UK population uses mobile phones and with the inclusion of smart phones advertising has become more effective, efficient and long lasting.
Market Identification (Second Target Market)
Segmentation
This market that we have targeted by segmenting and creating subgroup of customers consists of females with age range 21- 40 years. We will be launching Women Bikes that are lighter and trendier than Bikes for Males and it will be brand extension of Harley Davidson. According to Mintel, 2012 survey women appears a more promising segment for Motorbikes as about 6% of the women desire to keep a motorcycle.
Demographic Segmentation
For identifying the potential customers segment this segmentation includes age, gender, income and similar other variables. We have chosen this segment because females with such attributes like to use branded products for their routine life and are adventurous and sports frenzy.
Income, Age & Gender
This segment includes females that are doing white collar job and earning more than £ 30,000 annually or their families who support them are extremely well off. The age range for these consumers is from 21 to 40 years and their purchase power is also healthy making them attractive segment for HD. The disposable income available to this segment is very high and they are in a better position to make their own decision.
This age women are also looking to breakaway and our particular segment is going away from families to study and looking to enter new exciting phase in their lives, which makes them positive potential customers of our product. The size of this segment is also very high according to statistics by Mintel, 2012 total number of females falling under this category is 35% of total female population in UK. Similarly of total population UK under 21 - 40 years total female is about 49%.
These women fall under the distinct lifecycle category and more attracted towards brand. They want to be associated with fashion and want to wear and look for style of life that is based on branded and stylish products. Our target marget for this category is women that are falling under upper middle and upper income level and share the same lifestyle characteristics that are also followed by global Harley Davidson followers and brand persons. According to report of Mintel, 2012 women during the age 30 to 40 and single look to develop hobbies which make them distinctive, using a Harley Davidson bike will be the ideal opportunity and best segment to utilize this window.
Behavioral Segmentation
Behaviorally females of this market segment are brand conscious, fashionable and likes to be fit & healthy and takes interest in sporting activities and they are free-will with power to purchase and identify brands according to their needs and demands, depend on niche market & buy brands as status symbol.
This segment is looking for comfort, status and reputation from the brand. The look for niche products and always are attracted with products which are not common. They are extremely brand loyal and once there trust is established it is very difficult to detract them from their brand of choice. They are very loyal followers of brand and will look to keep associated with brand in all areas meaning that not only they will be interested in the core product but they will be buying all the brand extensions. This can allow Harley to develop to develop trendy helmets, jackets and other accessories.
Psychographic Segmentation
This segment customer's value uniqueness, innovation and luxurious brands in the market, they look to satisfy their mind by purchasing such products and they are returning customers as well who gets excited by the brand image & symbol. Distinctive lifestyle is what they seek and carry with a high social class which matches with the brand position of Harley Davidson.
Brand Positioning & Perceptual Mapping

Harley Davidson
Fashionable
In this perceptual map we have used variables such as affordability, fashionable designs, affordability of brands and expensiveness. From the perceptual Map it can be seen that Honda ranks high in terms of affordability and fashion, the motorcycle is a perfect combination of medium range design and pricing. Ducate appears to be the most expensive, however the fashionable is not high and Honda sportster brand ranks high in fashion and is also less expensive than Ducati. If customers looking for luxury and fashionable motorcycle than Harley Davidson Sportsterr brand appear to be the best choice, while consumers going for cheaper alternatives will look for either Suzuki or Honda. Kawasaki is admired for its better mieage and efficiency these factors are not rated high among choices for females.
Marketing Objectives for Segment 2
Objectives for this segment are different because of both age and gender difference. SMART technique will be sued for this segment marketing objectives.
Being Specific: This market is very lucrative due to which we have to achieve an overall market share of 15% within first 12 months of the launch has to be identified. The introduction of Sportster women version will be done on grand scale and break even is expected to be achieved by year three.
Being Measureable: Measuring the costs of production and whole marketing process and other transportation costs for reaching a set target that we need to match by making our sales. We have 12 months of time to reach that target and show our performance.
Being Achievable: Right use of social media and website for selling & advertising purposes will easily get us through to that target and in addition brand ambassador campaign will also assist in achieving the target within the set time.
Being Realistic: This objective and goal is very realistic given the situation in our hand i.e. huge potential in the segment, the trend for using bikes has shown double digit growth in UK during the past five year Mintel, (2012)..
Being Time Specific: This one year is a short term objective and step towards the medium term goals i.e. this objective is set for achieving breakeven so that further objectives can be achieved.
Marketing Mix for Segment 2
Product
The product for the segment will be Sportster line of Motorbikes, the line will be labeled as SheSportster. The bikes will be modified made lighter and more comfortable so that they can be use for the segment women in the age bracket of 21 to 40 years. Luxurious feel is important for females, the Motorcycle would also be comfortable and easy to ride and customers should also look for style and fashionable according to the behavioral requirements i.e. satisfaction and brand image. We will use different color combinations for the motor cycles so that consumers of this segment gets attracted to it and mostly using vibrant colors that looks cool such as pink, red, purple, royal blue, black etc.

To make it more appealing leather material for the seats will be used which will also increase the product usage and improve the fashion touch. At least three different types of SheSportster will be launched with different color combinations and contrasts. One set of product will include all the necessary supporting equipments making sure that customer needs are met. The option of customizing the color combinations will be available on official website of the product so that product positioning can be made more attractive yet simple.
Price
As we know that Harley Davidson is a luxury brand with iconic positing and image, its prices has always been at premium and mostly HD has been a price leader in the market of luxury products which has attached certain expectations of customers with this brand. According to Moriarty et al, (2012) high pricing is normally linked with luxury products and brands so that a sense of expensiveness and appeal can be felt and most importantly consumers feel a sense of satisfaction while buying such expensive brand items. For this segment pricing will not be an issue and we can set the prices according to our feasible calculations and we can set healthy margins in this because customers of this segment are not price conscious. The Sportster brand already has pricing established in UK. Due to the association of Harley Davidson the Motorcycle will be priced at higher level. The comparison of existing bikes which are suitable to b driven by the females is as follow;

Data for Motorcycle Pirces collected from websites of companies respectively
From the above figures it can be seen than every company is selling one of it top product at almost the similar price. However at lower end the price of Honda and Kawasaki is the cheapest. These brands will be the main competition of Harley Davidson SheSportster.
Prices will be competitive and high so that our brand image and position is maintained and customers' perception can be met and fulfilled. This product range is price elastic because this product is not basic necessity for customers and they can look for other brands if prices get too high or out of reach then demand will also shift to the lower side. So, premium prices will be set since the purchasing power and sense of brand identification is high in this particular segment of customers.
Place
Channels of placing and distribution have always been important for any product. For this product range we will have to rely on set of distributors. The best option is to look for existing retailers of Harley and use the same premises to sell the product. Other option is to place SheSportster at various retail chain stores for special marketing and promotion packages. New Look and Sports Direct are some retail outlets where we will provide our products to be sold to customers. Especially New Look and Debenhams outlets are available easily countrywide and in access of majority of such customers. Apart from this company website and other selling websites such as e-bay will be used for online selling where a large number of females visits and buy products on regular basis.
Issuing purchase cards with bonus points and making them workable at both physical stores and online will provide a benefit to the company using which customers can do purchasing in the way which is feasible and easy for them. This distribution strategy is chosen simply because above 50% of the UK population has access to social media through their cell phones (BBC, 2011) and Above 90% of customers of this segment uses internet and social media because of the nature of their work and interests which is a plus point for us to position our products in a better way and in quick time. Avoiding long channels of distribution will allow the company to sell the products efficiently and making sure that customer relationship management is of high quality at both physical stores and online stores so that customers will feel satisfied on the effectiveness of the distribution and management systems. The facility of modifying color combinations and sizes at online stores will make it more impactful on the customers.
Promotion
Several promotional methods can be used for advertising this product of Harley Davidson. A separate facebook page for SheSportster motorcycle range in highly desirable here because women shop online in huge numbers and especially working women doing white collar job likes to search for their favorite products and brands online. So a separate facebook page and a separate section of this product on the official website of the company will be an effective tool of promotion. Fashion magazines and professional magazines are also an effective way for promoting the SheSportster range because consumers of this segment frequently view or read these magazines for their information updates and new trends in the market. Attractive billboards featuring models or celebrities will be used to impact on masses.
Organizing a sports event of females in major cities of the country e.g. a competition of motorbike racing or other healthy sports games which involves no risk will be a positive step. In these games prizes will be given to the winners in the form of Harley Davidson Accessories such as helmets and Jackets which will increase the interest and desire in the consumers of this segment.
Hiring a celebrity or model to endorse this product range will also make a huge impact on the promotion of Harley Davidson products such as Victoria Beckham or captain of world cup winning women cricket team who can influence largely on attracting this segment. Even a unique ramp walk by models with the motorcycles in a fashion week will do more than what is required by the promotional events of our products i.e. showcasing SheSportster products in such event will be a unique idea and will definitely attract the attention of media and consumers.
Control Mechanism for HD
For evaluating, monitoring and assessing the success of our marketing plan different techniques are available. The business plan for Harley Davidson is for three years and marketing control plan will be developed accordingly.
Year - 1
Product Launch
SheSportster will b official launched in the UK market
Promotion Effectiveness
As this would be the first year, the promotion effectiveness will be measured using number o visits of customers to the distributors and other places where products are sold. Also visits to social media such as facebook, twitter, My Space and google+ etc will be monitored to identify product awareness and effectiveness of promotion.
Also surveys will be conducted among the targeted segments to identify their views and perceptions about the brand during the first year of launch.

Promotion Effectiveness
Statistics should be viewed from last year promotion activities and checked on quarterly basis so that progress can be assured up to 12 months. A customer feedback form during marketing promotions and sales visits is a most widely used tool in this regard and it is effective as well, so we will use this form and take feedback from our valued customers so that we know exactly what consumers think and feel about their purchase behavior and about competitor brands or the brands they already use, and the after 2-3 weeks time asking the customers about their comments regarding our brand products and it will be entirely upto customers whether they want to share their opinion or not. With this we will get positive and negative points that we need to improve and change regarding our products and services.
As this would be the second year, the promotion effectiveness will be measured by using sales of unit sold. Also surveys will be conducted among the targeted segments to identify their views and perceptions about the brand extension during the second year of launch.

Conclusion
Harley Davidson has chosen two market segments which are complete different segments in terms of their needs, requirements, and other attributes. This can be seen as an advantage or disadvantage as well at the same time because if the company did well in one segment it will automatically reflect on the other segment sales and acceptability and if one segment fails it will dent the performance of the other segment as well. Rivals of both segments of market are different making it more difficult to compete and handle the marketing campaign. Three years plan are set for both segments which are not very aggressive due to the stiff competition in both segments and this will benefit in implementation and attainment of set objectives. Kids market is relatively complex because you never know with kids that what sort of product will appeal them but still we have put innovative and unique strategies for them after analyzing competitors' performance and trends in the market. For female segment things are easy and more vulnerable for the company because this segment attributes suits the HD brand name and image. Control mechanism will help in managing the operations and make back up adjustments and modifications so that ultimate objectives are not disturbed. This marketing management of two HD products is not easy due to complex UK market attributes and presence of strong competitors.

How Harley-Davidson Mastered Product Positioning


The motorcycle manufacturer has no doubts about its identity. Here's how you can crystalize yours.

To be able to tell the world about your new product, you first need to be able to talk about it internally. 
This is what it means to position your product. To find a great example of strong product positioning, take a look at Harley-Davidson. This is the company's internal positioning statement: 

The only motorcycle manufacturer That makes big, loud motorcycles For macho guys (and "macho wannabes")  Mostly in the United States Who want to join a gang of cowboys In an era of decreasing personal freedom.

It's rather poetic. But you don't have to be a poet to draft a similarly effective statement. Developing this kind of mantra is formulaic, startup advisor Arielle Jackson recently told First Round Review. Jackson is a former product marketing manager for Google and Square.
She recommended using the following structure to come up with your own positioning statement: 

For (target customer) Who (statement of need or opportunity), (Product name) is a (product category) That (statement of key benefit). Unlike (competing alternative) (Product name)(statement of primary differentiation).

Note that the end result is different from a tagline, Jackson said. Taglines are consumer-facing catch phrases that summarize your positioning statement extremely concisely. For example, one of Harley-Davidson's tag lines is "American by birth. Rebel by choice."  
Internally, positioning statements are crucial because they set the stage for all that will follow--including finding the right people as you expand, further developing the product and, of course, marketing it to your audience.
"It all starts with nailing down your positioning. Everything stems from that." Jackson said. "If you've done it right, you'll be able to tell everyone why what you’re doing matters in a way that will make them listen and respond."
