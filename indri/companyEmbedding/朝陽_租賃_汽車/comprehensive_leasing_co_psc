Vessel class operation inspection is mandatory for ODM. At Heishin Pump Works, we have put a robust service structure in place to promptly respond to customers' requirements.
Need to say about operation inspection, even prior to the inspection, we board the actual ship and check piping and electrical wiring to ensure that all our devices are fully operational. Not only inspection, we also impart training to crew members about operating procedure of devices. 
By learning the unique technology and know-how of Heishin Pump Works, backed by 15 years of experience, the longest of its kind in Japan, we support in ensuring environment friendly navigation of vessels.



1. 	Instant delivery of parts
Wear and tear of various device parts when a vessel is en route, poses a serious challenge to time management and safe navigation of ship. At Heishin Pump Works, we have all the required systems in place to expedite the supply of new parts for the replacement of wearing parts. 
Moreover, our pumps are designed so that number of parts in a device are minimized, thereby reducing the likelihood of wearing out of parts itself.

2. Service Network
Worldwide service network is indispensable for vessels that are navigating oceans of the world. At Heishin Pump Works, for bilge alarm and ODM, which are frequently pointed out by PSC (Port State Control), we have entered into collaborations with overseas manufacturers and formed worldwide service network. 




3. Provision of information about international rules and technology
We actively participate in "Ranking Meet", which is periodically held by NK Kobe as an occasion to provide latest information about oil-water separator that we have been working on since the formation of international rules as well as know-how accumulated over 80 years. 
We actively seek to exchange information with owners and other manufacturers.

What is financial leasing?

Financial leasing is a new type of leasing originated from U.S. nearly 40 years ago. It allows the lease provider to provide lessee with equipments they need and allow the lessee to “use” the above equipments by simply paying fixed installments, while the lease provider still retain the rights and ownerships of the equipments before end of the leasing contract.
From practical point of view, financial leasing is somehow very much similar to the bank loan and hire purchase; however, it makes really big difference in legal and accounting point of senses since the property right is retained by the lease provider (e.g. leasing company) and lessee have the right to use only. At the end of terms, the lessee can return the assets, buy –back for the preset amount or finance the option. Under the leasing arrangement, the corporations need not to provide any warranty and other entanglements that are usually associated with bank loan and hire purchase.  Moreover, with less upfront cash outlay, the corporations can have better cash flow management and don’t have to make any big cash payments. For the lease providers, they can shift their risks since the lease contracts are consented based on the request and choice of lease .Meanwhile, the manufacturers and suppliers benefit greatly by greater sales volumes and less credit risks exposed to creditors.
Financial leasing has become the next-best and effective financing tool in the world. As financial leasing can effectively boost the sales of productive assets (e.g. equipments), there is also a strong connection between development of financial leasing and the rate of economic growth. In U.S., over 50% of the capitals investments are financed by financial leasing and it even overtake bank loans in the areas of automobiles, aircrafts and office equipments.  Most of the leasing companies usually share common background of commercial banks and manufacturers and their presence usually positively influence the economic growth of the country. 
 
 

Development of Financial Leasing Industry in China- History & Laws

As early as July 1982, the Chinese government already tried to defined the standards for ordinary leasing terms in Article 23 of “Economic Contract Law of People’s Republic of China” (中華人民共和國經濟合同法). Afterwards, the government had further given some practical regulatory guidelines & regulations in the “Laws of People’s Republic of China on Chinese-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures”(中華人民共和國經濟涉外合同法) and “Contract Laws of People’s Republic of China”(中華人民共和國合同法).  During the period, a couple of local banks like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Agricultural Bank of China(ABC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB) and other banks like China CITIC bank, Bank of Communications (BOCOM), China Investment Bank successively  participated in the leasing market directly or indirectly. The improper business environment and inappropriate management forced the Chinese government to ban the commercial banks from taking part in the leasing business since the Asian financial Crisis in 1997. 
In gaining membership in the WTO, the Chinese government undertook various commitments, including opening up China’s financial services industry to foreign companies. The government also wanted to diversify its financing channels available to small and medium sized enterprises. All these factors had driven  China to re-initiate its efforts to promote financial leasing industry and the National People Congress had took up the responsibility of drafting process of a new comprehensive Leasing Laws.
The procedure to produce the Leasing Law began in 2004, with the formation of a legislation steering committee (“Steering Committee”) by the National People’s Congress. Subsequently, a working group was established to draft an outline of the Leasing Law and solicited comments from the local legislatures, government agencies, business leaders and experts from all over the country.  In 2005, the official draft of the Leasing Law had been proposed to the Steering Committee and the Committee re-submitted it to the Finance and Economic Commission for second review. Since then, the international businessmen started exploring the potentials of the market and the market was opened up to single foreign investor since 2004. However, the low market acceptance level and the limited choices for leasing product still greatly hindered the development of the industry, thus the leasing market was unavoidably almost dominated by the foreign companies. Nevertheless, with China’s low penetration rate and high GDP growth rate, it is believed that China is still having huge potential in leasing market. 
 
 

What is the “Measures for Administration of Financial Leasing Companies”?

The amended “Measures for Administration of Financial Leasing Companies” which came effective in 1st March 2007 allowed both local and overseas-incorporated commercial banks to set up financial leasing companies.  The new regulations gave financial leasing a fresh opportunity to take root in the world’s fourth largest economy. It requested that only the banks, big leasing companies, established manufacturers and other authorized business entities can be eligible for being the “major shareholder” (e.g. more than 50% of the share holdings) in the leasing companies. 
The banks should have been regarded as new-blood to energize the industry, meanwhile, the reinforcement of the proper supervision of industry created a better environment for the development of the industry. All of the above, the rejuvenation on financial leasing definitely has brought banking industry into a new era.

Existing Management System of Financial Leasing Company in China

In the regulatory area, China has a dual-system under which the leasing companies are under supervision of two different legal entities - China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) now jointly conduct examination and approval rights for the leasing companies in China. The issues of “Measures for Administration of Financial Leasing Companies” and promulgated CBRC issued in 2000 (but revised in March 2007) and “Measures for Administration of Foreign Investment in the Leasing Industry” issued by the MOFCOM in February 2005 had initially provided an overview of the general regulatory regime for the financial leasing industry, the key changes introduced by CBRC Measures and major differences between financial leasing companies regulated by CBRC and MOFCOM.
Leasing Companies supervised by CBRC
There are a total of 12 financial leasing companies and some enterprise group financial companies and trust leasing companies regulated by CBRC by end of 2006. To rough estimation, the values of their leased assets would be around RMB 14.2 billion. These companies are regarded as financial 
Leasing Companies supervised by MOFCOM
Up to 2007, more than 40 Sino-foreign joint ventures and a few solely foreign-funded financial leasing companies are regulated by MOFCOM. The values of their leased assets would be RMB 30 billion.

Why does Chinese government keen on promoting leasing?

Advantages of Financial Leasing
                  China is a country of few per capita resources. Through leasing, it may save energy and resources and enable one variety of equipment to be used by several enterprises.  Additionally, the equipments can be recycled as manufacturers can repair and renovate old equipment for after leasing contracts, which is also in line with the environmental protection policy of the government.  Recently, the China government is heavily promoting a contractive monetary policy and financial leasing itself is totally in line with the prevailing macroclimate. Under the tightened monetary climate, the banks would inevitably tighten its credit lines and financial leasing would become the most effective use of financing. 
In addition, the Chinese government would like to use this financial product to stimulate healthy economic growth since the national capital would be channeled to the creation of productivity and future incomes (GDP) under financial leasing. Particularly, it really serves the purpose of helping the small and medium corporations, especially for those with greatest difficulties in financing and hardest to provide any warranty for bank loans. These companies make up 99% of the total number of business enterprises, 60% of the total industrial productivity, 40% of the total tax incomes and 75% of the total employment.
Finally, China is encouraging the high-tech industry which is characterized by frequent replacement of equipment. Leasing would be a good choice for these companies since they need no warranty and little upfront cash for these purchases.
Rising Civil Aviation Market
                What is more, the China’s civil aviation sector is expanding fast. Despite an aviation slump in the world, the prospects of China’s jet market are enormous.

 • New York Times bestseller •The 100 most substantive solutions to reverse global warming, based on meticulous research by leading scientists and policymakers around the world“At this point in time, the Drawdown book is exactly what is needed; a credible, conservative solution-by-solution narrative that we can do it. Reading it is an effective inoculation against the widespread perception of doom that humanity cannot and will not solve the climate crisis. Reported by-effects include increased determination and a sense of grounded hope.” —Per Espen Stoknes, Author, What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming “There’s been no real way for ordinary people to get an understanding of what they can do and what impact it can have. There remains no single, comprehensive, reliable compendium of carbon-reduction solutions across sectors. At least until now. . . . The public is hungry for this kind of practical wisdom.” —David Roberts, Vox“This is the ideal environmental sciences textbook—only it is too interesting and inspiring to be called a textbook.” —Peter Kareiva, Director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLAIn the face of widespread fear and apathy, an international coalition of researchers, professionals, and scientists have come together to offer a set of realistic and bold solutions to climate change. One hundred techniques and practices are described here—some are well known; some you may have never heard of. They range from clean energy to educating girls in lower-income countries to land use practices that pull carbon out of the air. The solutions exist, are economically viable, and communities throughout the world are currently enacting them with skill and determination. If deployed collectively on a global scale over the next thirty years, they represent a credible path forward, not just to slow the earth’s warming but to reach drawdown, that point in time when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere peak and begin to decline. These measures promise cascading benefits to human health, security, prosperity, and well-being—giving us every reason to see this planetary crisis as an opportunity to create a just and livable world.

“At this point in time, the Drawdown book is exactly what is needed; a credible, conservative solution-by-solution narrative that we can do it. Reading it is an effective inoculation against the widespread perception of doom that humanity cannot and will not solve the climate crisis. Reported by-effects include increased determination and a sense of grounded hope.”—Per Espen Stoknes, Author, What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming “There’s been no real way for ordinary people to get an understanding of what they can do and what impact it can have. There remains no single, comprehensive, reliable compendium of carbon-reduction solutions across sectors. At least until now. . . . The public is hungry for this kind of practical wisdom.” —David Roberts, Vox“This is the ideal environmental sciences textbook—only it is too interesting and inspiring to be called a textbook.” —Peter Kareiva, Director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA“Drawdown is not just a project—it is an adventure. It is a promising story that has the potential to engage every person on the planet with at least one solution to climate change, whether it is educating girls, improved rice cultivation, creating walkable cities, eating a plant-rich diet, household recycling, or any of the other solutions.”—Karen O'Brien, cCHANGE“Drawdown is an exceptional example of cooperation between some of the sharpest thinkers on climate and energy matters, an atlas that has the potential to save the planet.”—Andreas Kuhlmann, CEO German Energy Agency“It will give you the best kind of hope, the kind that balances realism with radical vision. . . . Stabilizing the climate system will require a heroic global effort, but the point here is only to show that . . . such an effort can do more than merely succeed; that it can succeed well, and open into futures that we can actually bear to contemplate.”—Tom Athanasiou, The Nation“The Paul Hawken presentation I just experienced at Telluride Mountainfilm was simply the best speech I have ever heard. And, not so incidentally, also the most important. To come at the world’s most important issue in an entirely novel fashion is a monumental feat.”— Tom Peters, American writer on business management practices, best known for In Search of Excellence“In the course of 20-some years of investigating and writing about global warming I’ve become all too familiar with that dynamic of gloom/doom/shame/fear/apathy, and I think Hawken has put his finger on exactly why we haven’t made more policy progress. The biggest anchor dragging behind this boat isn’t climate denial or even indifference but, I suspect, the almost unspeakably deep, defeatist conviction that no response really matters because we are already so thoroughly screwed. I’m vulnerable to that despair at times and maybe you are, too. If so, read this book — not just as an antidote to fear and despair but as foundation for understanding and supporting the kinds of change that really could be coming, and at every scale from your household to your company, your community, your county and state and national government.”—Ron Meador, MinnPost“I am blown away by Drawdown. Like hearing an advance copy of Sergeant Pepper, back in the day.”—John Elkington, CEO Volans, author and world authority on sustainable development “Be kindly unto the scientists, for they may just save our skin—and make us happier and wealthier in the bargain. . . . An optimistic program for getting out of our current mess, well deserving of the broadest possible readership.”—Kirkus Review “A rigorous and profoundly important resource.”—Donna Seaman, Booklist “With a climate-denying party controlling the government, it can seem that there’s no hope. . . . But a new book might change that—and serve as a blueprint for what comes next if the U.S. government (and the global community) begins to aggressively focus on altering the climate future. Drawdown is likely the most comprehensive model of climate solutions ever made.”—Fast Company “Drawdown is a magnificent achievement.”—Greg Watson, Schumacher Center for New Economics “This is one of the most powerful, hopeful, world-changing documents. A deeply peer reviewed, fully win-win, nearly no-regrets pathway . . . with a surprising ranking of the most important and impactful solutions. Paul Hawken’s simple, elegant genius in leading this approach, can inspire rapid, catalytic action. ”—Andy Lipkis, TreePeople“A bold plan to beat back climate change based on solutions already within our grasp.”—Outside Magazine“At a time when the Trump administration is working to dismantle much of the nation’s efforts to minimize climate change, Paul Hawken’s new book swoops onto the scene like a knight in shining armor. . . . The book’s release couldn’t possibly come at a better time. Refreshingly absent of political analysis, it’s grounded in scientific reality and will likely go a long way toward inciting people to action.”—The Portland Tribune “Drawdown is likely the most hopeful thing you’ll ever read about our ability to take on global warming.”  —Joel Makower, GreenBiz      “This book is a beautiful, inspiring, and deeply satisfying read. Most importantly it is no more doom and gloom. It is OPTIMISTIC and empowering. Paul Hawken is a true visionary and a brilliant voice for real solutions.”  —Jessica Rolph, Founding Partner, Happy Family     “It’s so brilliant . . . a showstopper.”  —Donald A. Falk, PhD, Associate Professor School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona

Top customer reviews4.0 out of 5 starsWonderful albeit incompleteByHerbon May 5, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseDrawdown is long overdue. As with all of Hawken's writings it's well conceived, carefully researched and beautifully written. Thank goodness for this effort. Yet....I looked in vain for the evidence that the remedies discussed will materially change the trajectory of projected temperature increases.  How much below 2 C will we stabilize at with full implementation of these 100 remedies? According to the book even the most aggressive scenario they model only reduces CO2 by less than one gigaton (out of about 40 gigatons we spew each year) and that isn't until 2045. That means that we're still doomed.I'm also puzzled that the book is called "The most comprehensive plan every proposed to reverse global warming". It's not a plan.  It is a painstakingly researched compendium of currently used and and projected remedies. As such it's an essential contribution to our collective knowledge about climate change action.  A plan however would have a set of goals, objectives, strategies, indicators and more. Perhaps Paul or others are now working to transform this solid beginning into a real plan. As a long time planner I'd be happy to help.There is also little discussion about the single most important variable affecting whether we retain a livable planet - and that is time - or lack of it.  Most all comprehensive analyses conclude that we're essentially out of time to avoid the most existentially dangerous consequences of climate chaos. It's wildly optimistic, and unsupported by the evidence, to suggest, as Drawdown does, that we can reverse climate change even if most of these remedies are not fully implemented until 2050.Unless we almost fully decarbonize and drawdown in a decade or two, we're doomed to 5 -10 degrees F of warming by the end of the century. That level of warming will destabilize our politics, our economy, our food production, our social cohesion and our infrastructure to such an extreme degree that the organized productive work necessary to implement these remedies will be next to impossible to sustain.And even were we by some near miracle to stabilize at the 2 C target we'll have a barely habitable planet, despite the conventional climate wisdom. There's little that is scientific about the 2 C target. It's a convenient political decision that puts the need for urgent action far into the future.  We can see the severe consequences on our ice caps, our coral reefs and our weather with only 1 C warming today.There's also the 'moral hazard' risk of the optimistic Drawdown message. We already have too much climate complacency. Yet reading Drawdown suggests that the market and human creativity is enough - or almost enough - to reverse climate change without mass mobilization and radical changes in how we invest, regulate, consume and organize our daily lives.I write this critique with hesitancy given the enormous trust I have in Paul's good intentions and the admirable efforts of his 200 person working group. But we need to do so much more and much faster than what Drawdown describes. So I hope Paul will integrate that perspective into his continuing efforts at showing us the best path forward.Read more66 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsCoffee Table Quality, Paperback Price -- Makes an amazing giftByJen Bouldenon April 26, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAfter spending the last 17 years being actively involved in the green movement, I have to confess that I've been guilty of thinking "game over" when it comes to the fate of our very own human race, especially considering the current administration but also because of population growth, increased meat production to meet the demand of a new middle class in China, and many, many other things. However, thank God I got to learn more about what my amazing friend Paul Hawken has been up to the past few years. You see, he didn't give up. Quite the opposite. He doubled down. He started a nonprofit with his own money called "DRAWDOWN" - and the result is this beautifully illustrated book with the top 80 things we can do to REVERSE global warming. Turns out it's totally possible. EX: There's a type of seaweed that when fed to cows reduces their methane emissions by 70%, and growing the seaweed helps reverse the acidification in the dead zones of our oceans! (Methane is a HUGE contributor to Global Warming.) If you want to change your feelings from "game over" to GAME ON, I totally recommend getting this book. It's truly brilliant. And so inexpensive for how big and beautiful it is. This is a "coffee table quality book" in a paperback form. So, so beautifully done on all levels. BRAVORead more33 comments|

Furnisson April 18, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis book is inspiring and superbly organized. The solutions appear to be impeccably researched, analyzed, and clearly presented.  There are now many books about climate change. Most are largely reiterations of the same concepts and are typically short on solutions. This one is different: it is laser focused on solutions and puts them into clear and compelling context. We needed a comprehensive assessment and presentation of what can be done to avoid global catastrophe. Now we have it.  Highly recommended.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsThis book is a great service to mankind.ByKateon July 8, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseMuch better than I expected.  I had not idea there were so many avenues for recovery being utilized and explored.The writing was easy to understand without watering down the science.  The later section about ideas being tried but not yet to be the point of being replicated by others was very interesting.  It convinces me this issue is solvable and that many are working worldwide to ensure the survival of our planet.  I posted a number of quotes on Facebook encouraging others to read the book, and labeled it MUST READ so hopefully others will also read and share.  I've read several very good non-fiction books, but this would be valuable for all to read.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Guidebook to Control Climate Change - Comprehensive yet a good read and well illustrated.ByJohn Englanderon July 4, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAn extraordinary book by pioneer Paul Hawken. Essentially a catalog of all possible ways to reduce CO2 level in the atmosphere, to slow the warming of our climate to avert climate change catastrophe. It is well written and actually interesting to read.  Well laid out with good graphics. Considering that there is no single solution to this looming crisis, having such a fair balanced description of possible efforts is a huge contribution. Though it is a lot to absorb, because it is organized by category (e.g. energy, agriculture, transportation) with a specific topic or mini-chapter on each of the hundred items, it is both a reference and a read that can be taken in chunks.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA very important read.ByJ. Bridgeron July 23, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase20 of us used Drawdown as a discussion book for our book club. It is a very positive book that deals with a sometimes scary topic, particularly with our current administration.  It is well balanced and very thorough in its treatment of each selected program.  While none of this book's plan is a final "solution", each taken separately can contribute to solving this crisis. Even though many of us in our group are scientists or engineers, we all were introduced to new ideas. Too bad the book is not more widely read, particularly by those who could introduce many of the books ideas to our government.  All of us learned about many new topics and now realize that several can be introduced to us in our every day lives, thus allowing us to "do our part" in helping to solve this crisis.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

    OpenGL® SuperBible, Seventh Edition,   is the definitive programmer’s guide, tutorial, and reference for OpenGL 4.5, the world’s leading 3D API for real-time computer graphics. The best introduction for any developer, it clearly explains OpenGL’s newest APIs; key extensions; shaders; and essential, related concepts. You’ll find up-to-date, hands-on guidance for all facets of modern OpenGL development—both desktop and mobile.   The authors explain what OpenGL does, how it connects to the graphics pipeline, and how it manages huge datasets to deliver compelling experiences. Step by step, they present increasingly sophisticated techniques, illuminating key concepts with worked examples. They introduce OpenGL on several popular platforms, and offer up-to-date best practices and performance advice.   This revised and updated edition introduces many new OpenGL 4.5 features, including important ARB and KHR extensions that are now part of the standard. It thoroughly covers the latest Approaching Zero Driver Overhead (AZDO) performance features, and demonstrates key enhancements with new example applications.   Coverage includes   A practical introduction to real-time 3D graphics, including foundational math   Core techniques for rendering, transformations, and texturing   Shaders and the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) in depth   Vertex processing, drawing commands, primitives, fragments, and framebuffers   Compute shaders: harnessing graphics cards for more than graphics   Pipeline monitoring and control   Managing, loading, and arbitrating access to data   Building larger applications and deploying them across platforms   Advanced rendering: light simulation, artistic and non-photorealistic effects, and more   Reducing CPU overhead and analyzing GPU behavior   Supercharging performance with persistent maps, bindless textures, and fine-grained synchronization   Preventing and debugging errors   New applications: texture compression, text drawing, font rendering with distance fields, high-quality texture filtering, and OpenMP     Bonus material and sample code are available at  openglsuperbible.com.

Oh, I have a few gripes and grumbles relating to the reorganization (e.g., it seems like Chapter 5 will never end.  It could be split, deferring pieces to later and appropriate contexts.)  The reorganization of the sample code is a good step forward.  There is less dependence on mysterious libraries.  And, the essential support code has been reorganized into a more attractive “framework.”Be prepared for a lot of emphasis on shader programming.  Face up to it: It’s the nature of the modern beast.  If you’re not ready for that, one suggestion is to start with an earlier edition – one that focuses on earlier versions of OpenGL, and then grow to love it.Having gone through many (aborigines are said to have a ternary number system: 1, 2, many) editions of the Superbible, I find it necessary to keep a copy of a corresponding Redbook (OpenGL Programming Guide) edition handy.  In that sense, I find the Superbible to be an essential learning aid.  But …It was indeed unfortunate to find that the current authors and publisher continued to follow the habits of previous authors and publishers of walking away from what I view as their responsibility to their readership:1. Others have complained about the quality of the black and white illustrations.  They were correct: the printing of screenshots is terrible.  The majority of the current authors are experienced authors.  (a) They should have avoided the problem.  (b) The editor should have caught the problem before going to press.  (c) The printer should have called attention to the problem before committing to a run.2. There is no consistent way of tying a screenshot or a code listing to a project name in the source code provided as a download on the book’s web site.  I made it a point to deduce, by one means or another, the project name from the text or code if the project name was not explicitly mentioned (which was the usual case).  The authors could have provided an index in the download’s README file.3. In the Preface, an author states, “We made a bunch of mistakes – we’re certain of it.  …  If you think you see something that doesn’t quite gel, check the book’s Web site for errata.”  I’m writing this review in June 2014, almost a year after publication of the book.  There are no errata on the web site.  Moreover, there is no mechanism for submitting errata.4. The code I downloaded (dated November 2013) built on Visual Studio 2010 successfully.  All but a few projects executed without error.  I found the distribution for VS 2010 available on GitHub to be useless: Apparently the last person to build it built it with VS 2013.  I considered submitting an issue, but got discouraged when I saw that the last commits were made seven or eight months ago.5. The book’s Appendix C describes two tools, ktxtool and dds2ktx, which it says is available in the source code.  Not so.6. I searched for but could not find an OpenGL Superbible forum.  The best I could find was the general OpenGL forum.  The last blog entry on the book’s web site is dated February 2014.  Apparently the authors have better things to do.In scoring a rating for this edition of the OpenGL Superbible, I started with five stars.  After all, I consider it and the Redbook to be essential components to learning OpenGL.  Then, because of the lousy illustrations and the authors’ neglect, I backed off two stars.  A  one-star deduction would not have been enough.It occurs to me that all of the problems enumerated above could be resolved on the book’s web site.  I would be glad to improve my rating if the authors (or even someone else) would step up to addressing them.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWell organized, thorough, and readableByNajati Imamon October 30, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book has been a critical part of me getting started with OpenGL. I had a general understanding of 3D graphics and limited experience with Direct3D, but it had been a while and I found OpenGL to be fairly intimidating, especially since immediate mode was deprecated. OpenGL SuperBible has gotten me past the intimidation and initial hurdles in pretty short order. There's a lot to OpenGL, but the book presents it plainly and clearly. The tone is clear above all else. It's light and personal, but not super familiar or cheeky - it strikes a good balance.The clear introduction to the pipeline and the lucid and well-explained code examples have gotten me going far faster than I would have expected. After reading Part I of the book I'm familiar enough with the basics that I'm already working on my project in earnest and reading the rest of the book either as reference and as I have time. The writing continues to be clear and the figures are really clear on the Kindle, both on phone and tablet. The code samples can be a little difficult on a narrow screen, but that's just the nature of reading code on a phone.I think anyone entering the OpenGL world should be warned that it (OpenGL) is a bit of a mess, especially if you're trying to target multiple platforms and be reasonably backwards compatible. This book is about a particular version of OpenGL and, as it's not intended as a history lesson, doesn't do a tremendous amount to be clear about the differences between versions. It'll take some independent work on the reader's part to come to understand which version of GL suites their purposes best and then a bit more work to understand what parts of the book don't apply to that version. Having said that, I am targeting OpenGL 3.2/GLSL 1.50 and have had no trouble applying my new understanding and only a couple hiccups using the bits of the code I've copied.On that note, I tend to write my samples from scratch when learning a technology so I end up copy-pasting pieces of the samples and not just using them whole hog. Given this style, the code download works well. I haven't tried to build the samples.Overall, complaints about difficultly with the code samples on certain platforms and difficulties with color figures in a black and white book (which is acknowledged by the author) seem pretty insignificant when compared with the clarity of the writing, the organization of the content, and the availability of a code download. Highly recommended.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBest OpenGL Bible YetByRobin T. Wernickon March 3, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAny comprehensive graphics rendering system is understandably complex. Introducing it requires detailed modeling of the properties of light transmission, reflection and combination. Defining the interface to such a system requires detailed organization and a proper introduction to the reader. These are difficult to accomplish without an outstanding degree of knowledge of the subject and an admirable presentation. This book raises the standard for OpenGL tutorials while keeping up with the ever increasing capability of the API.There has been a lot of unbridled dissatisfaction with former versions of this book. Some of it has undeniable validity, and I think that none of it applies to this version. The 780 pages of this book cover the OpenGL API very well and provide enough examples of the more complex operations to satisfy all but the most hardened curmudgeon. Look, the subject fills a full year of study, so don't expect any author to provide the full 2500 pages it deserves. A lot of thinking and experimenting is required to master this subject for any API. It's not a one stop or single volume operation. I cover both DirectX and OpenCL API references in my work and this book is the OpenCL reference to have on your shelf.Read more0Comment|

  ﻿What Is Comprehensive Auto Insurance?

Updated: June 2017 
Comprehensive insurance is a coverage that helps pay to replace or repair your vehicle if it's stolen or damaged in an incident that's not a collision. Comprehensive typically covers damage from fire, vandalism or falling objects (like a tree or hail). If you're financing or leasing your car, your lender likely requires comprehensive coverage. If you own your vehicle outright, it's an optional coverage on your car insurance policy. 




What Is Covered by Comprehensive Insurance?

Comprehensive helps cover damage to your car that's not the result of a collision, such as:

Theft
Vandalism
Fire
Natural disasters (like a hurricane or a tornado)
Falling objects
Damage done to your car by animals
A civil disturbance (like a riot that results in damage or destruction of your car)



What's Not Covered


Damage to your car from a collision
Damage to another person's vehicle from a collision
Your (or your passengers') medical expenses after an accident

Comprehensive Coverage Deductibles and Limits

When you purchase comprehensive coverage, you will select a set deductible, which is the amount you pay out of pocket toward a covered claim. Let's say you choose a $500 deductible, and your car is later damaged by hail in a covered claim. If it costs $1,500 to repair your car, you would pay your $500 deductible, and your insurance would pay the remaining $1,000.



Comprehensive coverage has a limit, or the maximum amount your policy will pay toward a covered claim. The limit on comprehensive coverage is typically the actual cash value of your vehicle. 



If your car is stolen, for example, your policy would reimburse you for your car's depreciated value. In other words, if you wanted to replace your stolen vehicle with a newer make and model, you would likely have to use some of your own money to do so, in addition to using the reimbursement from your insurer.



What Is the Difference Between Collision and Comprehensive Insurance?

Collision coverage helps pay to repair your car if it's damaged in a collision.



Comprehensive is a separate coverage from collision and covers different types of losses.

Why Buy Comprehensive Coverage?

If you're wondering whether you should buy comprehensive coverage, here are a few considerations: 

Comprehensive coverage may be required by your car's lender. If you're leasing or financing your vehicle, your lender may require you to have comprehensive and collision coverage until the vehicle is paid off. 
How old is your car and what is it worth? If you have paid off your car, comprehensive coverage is optional. It may be a good idea to find out the Kelley Blue Book value of your vehicle. Would you be able to pay that amount to repair or replace your vehicle if it were stolen or damaged in an accident? If you can't afford to pay much out of pocket, then buying optional coverages, like comprehensive coverage and collision coverage, may be a smart investment.
How much are the annual premiums for comprehensive and collision coverage? The Insurance Information Institute suggests that you take the amount you'd pay in one year for comprehensive and collision coverage, and multiply that number by 10. Is your car worth less than that number? Then comprehensive and collision coverage might not be a cost-effective option for you. In other words, you might want to talk to your agent about whether it makes sense to include these coverages on your car insurance policy.

Have questions about comprehensive coverage? Talk to a local agent.

Explainer Video (1:50): What Is Comprehensive Coverage? 
Announcer (voiceover): Comprehensive coverage is available to protect you against vehicle damages not caused by a collision. For example, it may protect you against vehicle damages caused by:
Announcer (voiceover): Theft, vandalism, natural disasters, falling objects, fire, hail, flood, animal damage.
Announcer (voiceover): Why consider comprehensive coverage? Well, could you pay out of pocket for damages if, say, you hit a deer, damaging your car? If not, comprehensive coverage may be able to help you.
Announcer (voiceover): In some cases, comprehensive coverage might be required. For example, if your car is leased or if you still owe money on your loan, the lending institution may require this coverage. Check with your lending or leasing institution to determine whether it's required. 
Announcer (voiceover): Even if comprehensive isn't mandatory, consider: Would you be able to afford to fix or replace your car if it was damaged by a hailstorm? The protection offered by comprehensive coverage can help set your mind at ease.
Announcer (voiceover): Something else to consider is your deductible amount—the money you have to pay out of pocket in the event of a claim. It's a good idea to set the deductible at a level you can afford to pay.
Announcer (voiceover): So, now you have a little more information on the benefits of comprehensive coverage, which can help protect you against vehicle damages not caused by a collision. In some cases, it may help protect against vehicle damages caused by: theft, vandalism, natural disasters, falling objects, fire, hail, flood and animal damage. Check with your lending or leasing institution to find out whether comprehensive coverage is required.
