Publication Date: September 08, 2014

 In 1999, the International Horticultural Exposition was held in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in China. Recognised as an international exposition by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), the event was organised by the International Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH), based in Paris, France.  It was the first international mega-exposition hosted in China, and had strong support from Kunming's local government agencies. The six-month long exposition (Expo Garden) attracted more than 9 million visitors from around the world with a daily average of 49,000 park visitors and hitting a peak of more than 110,000 visitors in a single day. After the exhibition ended, Kunming government decided to continue to keep the venue open as a tourist destination, and major transformations were made to Expo Garden's management structure and business operations.  A decade later, Expo Garden had lost its position as a prime tourist destination in Yunnan, as other destinations such as Dali, Shangri-la and Lijiang became the top tourist draws. During this time, domestic tourists emerged as the main engine of growth in Yunnan's tourism industry.  In 2012, the group that owned and managed Expo Gardens, Yunnan Tourism Co. Ltd, a state-owned company listed in the Shenzhen stock exchange, needed a turnaround strategy to enhance the attractiveness of Expo Garden, its major asset. The aim was to: o	transform Expo Garden into a major player in Yunnan Province's tourism industry; and o	to boost Expo Garden's income growth substantially and improve the financial performance of the company.

Yunnan Tourism Co., Ltd: Developing Garden Expo ’99 Site into a First-Class Urban Eco-Cultural Complex Case Solution & Answer

This Case is about STRATEGY
PUBLICATION DATE: September 08, 2014 PRODUCT #: NTU056-PDF-ENG
It was the first international mega-exposition hosted in China, and had powerful support from the local government bureaus in Kunming.
Kunming authorities chose to continue to maintain the site open as a tourist destination following the display finished, and important transformations were made to the management structure and business operations of Expo Garden. A decade after, Expo Garden had lost its standing as a prime tourist destination in Yunnan, as other destinations including Dali, Shangri la and Lijiang became the top tourist draws. In this period, national tourists emerged as the chief engine of growth in the tourism sector in Yunnan. In the year 2012, the group that owned and managed Yunnan Tourism Co., Expo Gardens Ltd, a state-owned company recorded in the Shenzhen stock exchange, wanted a reversion strategy to improve the attractiveness of Expo Garden, its important strength. The objective was to: o Transform Expo Garden into a leading player in the tourism sector; and o of Yunnan Province To foster the income increase of Expo Garden significantly and enhance the fiscal operation of the firm.
