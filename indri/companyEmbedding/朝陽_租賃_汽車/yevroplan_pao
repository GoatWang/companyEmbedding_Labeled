Analyst Report







Analyst Report



This ETF offers exposure to small cap Russian equities, making it one of several options available for accessing a component of the BRIC bloc that holds tremendous potential but also significant risks. Russia's economy remains largely dependent on the energy sector, thanks to the country's vast reserves of natural gas and oil, and as such RSXJ can be heavily influenced by changes in energy prices. RSXJ is probably too granular for long-term buy-and-holders, but can be useful for investors looking to implement a country rotation strategy or to tilt exposure towards this emerging market. RSXJ is, surprisingly, not as heavily tilted towards the energy sector as its large cap peers as just 17.5% of the fund goes towards that sector. That weighting is matched by similar levels in the utilities, materials, and industrials spaces, suggesting that RSXJ may offer a more balanced play on the Russian market. Nevertheless, the combination of small caps and Russia is a pretty potent mix and investors should use extreme caution when investing in this often volatile product.
