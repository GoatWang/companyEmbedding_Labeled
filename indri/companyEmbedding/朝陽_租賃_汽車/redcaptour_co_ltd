SK Networks Co., Ltd.

                                     •  Wholesale: Raw Materials                                                                             •  Seoul, GY                                                                    

                                    The history of SK Networks dates back to 1953. In the aftermath of the Korean War, the creation of Sunkyung Textiles, the predecessor of SK Networks, was a ray of hope for economic revival in a war-torn nation. This company, equipped with a grand total of 20 outdated weaving machines recovered amid the ruins, began SK Networks' entrepreneurial epic. “Sunkyung,” suggesting the scope of the company's ambition, “light” and “magnitude,” would indeed prove a fitting title for the SK story.

Our companionship with customers is rooted in a time when bringing new life and new dreams to our fellow citizens meant more than we can imagine.

SK Networks has remained true to this commitment for over fifty years.
 
 
 
	

From the moment when we wake up in the morning and, still sleepy, pick an outfit for the day,
As we get in the car and head for the office,
During a short afternoon coffee break,
Or a casual chat with a friend on the mobile phone,
To the evening hours at home, when we wind down from the day,
The people of SK Networks are thinking of you.
SK Networks is a company touching your life up-close, always with you in mind,
Even when you are the least aware.

No company understands its customers as SK Networks does, or is as attentive to them as we are. For SK Networks, customers are our alpha and our omega.

It comes as no surprise that SK Networks operates through industry’s broadest network of customer channels - or that our top-quality products are accessible to our customers whenever and wherever
