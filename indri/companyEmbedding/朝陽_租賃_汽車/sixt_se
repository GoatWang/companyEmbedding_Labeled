Description

Summary
The global car rental market performed well during the historic period, recovering from the slowdown recorded at the beginning of 2009 due to the financial crisis and recession. Overall, growth was recorded in the four regions - Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa - across all key performance indicators (KPIs) during the historic period. This is expected to continue over the forecast period, supported by the rise in tourism flows and expenditure.
Key Findings

 According to the Travel &Tourism intelligence center (TTIC) analysis based on 40 countries around the world, the US was the leader in the car rental market in terms of both market value and fleet size. The US recorded US$28.6 billion market value in 2013, which is more than six times that of its competitor, Japan, which recorded US$4.2 billion market value in 2013
 The Eurozone crisis had a negative impact on the Travel and Tourism sector in European countries. However, car rental KPIs showed resilience in many countries (with the exception of Italy and Spain) with overall growth recorded in KPIs during the historic period. The hosting of international events such as Olympic Games in London in 2012 and Winter Olympic Games in Russia in 2014 have partially supported the growth
 Challenging economic conditions and fierce competition have resulted in a large number of deals recorded in the global car rental market during the historic period as a means for operators to improve profitability and remain competitive. Some of the biggest deals in the car rental market were recorded in the US such as the acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group by Hertz. Several leading car rental operators from North American and Europeans market are trying to expand their business in Asia-Pacific, Africa, and South and Central America by entering into joint ventures and partnerships to develop new hotels and benefit from the growing demand for car rental in these emerging markets
 Japan was the largest car rental market in the Asia-Pacific region with a total market value of US$4.2 billion in 2013. South Korea followed closely with a market value of US$4.1 billion in 2013; however, it is expected to surpass Japan's car rental market value in 2014 to become the largest market with US$4.4 billion in revenue. Hong Kong was the smallest market with total market value of US$14.8 million. China is a rapidly developing rental market, which recorded the highest growth in total car rental market value in the region at a CAGR of 26.05% during the historic period
 South Africa was the largest car rental market in the Middle East and Africa with a total market value of US$492.3 million in 2013, closely followed by Saudi Arabia with a market value of US$490.2 million. However, the Saudi Arabian car rental market is expected to surpass South Africa's car rental market value in 2014 to become the largest market with US$513.1 million in revenue.

Vision



            The customer is the most important person in our business. The customer is not an interruption of our work –
            they are the purpose of it. We are not doing the customer a favor in our service – the customer is giving us
            the opportunity to do so. The customer is not dependent upon us – we are dependent on them. The customer is
            not an outsider to our business – they are a central part of it. The customer is not a cold statistic – they
            are the flesh and blood human being with feelings and emotions, opinions and perspectives. The customer is
            not someone to argue or match wits with, there is no argument to be won with the customer. The customer is
            someone who brings us their needs and in the end it is our job to handle them.

The beginning of a moving tale
When Martin Sixt started his company “Sixt Autofahrten und Selbstfahrer“ 
				(“Sixt Car Cruises and Self Drivers“) in 1912, Germany didn‘t even have a proper road network. Still, 
				Martin believed in the future of his idea. In 1917, Martin Sixt purchased a location in the Seitzstraße 
				11 in Munich, where one of the most popular Sixt branches still exists today.


Sixt business in the second generation
Martin Sixt handed over the company to his nephew, Hans Sixt. An 8-cylinder 
				Isotta Fraschini and the big 6-cylinder Renault became part of the fleet. Eventually, because of bottlenecks 
				in the spare parts supply for foreign brands, Sixt decided to use only Mercedes vehicles from 1929 onwards.


Dramatic demise before the new start
Martin Sixt passed away in May 1945. In the end, he even had to witness the destruction 
				of the residential and business sites in the Seitzstraße by bombings. On top of that, the German army confiscated all 
				Sixt vehicles, except for the Mercedes 230 Landaulet.


The birth of “Auto Sixt“
After innovations like the first radio-taxis in Europe, Sixt Car Rental was founded under 
				Hans Sixt. Just a few years later, the first branches at airports in Frankfurt am Main and Munich opened.


Sixt expands its product range
The Sixt family’s car rental company realized in an early stage that Germany had a large 
				and sustainable need for a leasing product. As a result, Sixt opened the first German company with a first full-service 
				leasing program for vehicles.


Growth of the family business
Erich Sixt, the present Chairman of the Board of Sixt SE, joined the family business as 
				the third generation. Together with his wife Regine Sixt, he continually expanded the company to its present size and 
				significance in the market, launching its presence at all German airports. Sixt’s innovative strategy was expanded 
				further with the introduction of rental automates (Sixt Express).


Sixt adds vans and trucks to the fleet
The company began to offer clients not only rental cars, but also the possibility to rent a 
				van or truck.


The Initial Public Offering of Sixt
This was one of the most significant decisions in the history of Sixt. With the IPO, new 
				growth opportunities were created. In 2013 Sixt AG will change its legal form to an European Corporation, the current 
				Sixt SE. 


Establishment of Sixt Leasing GmbH
The growing leasing division led to the establishment of a daughter company called 
				“Sixt Leasing GmbH“ in 1988.


Sixt enters international arena
Only a year after Sixt Car Rentals started operations in Switzerland, Regine Sixt 
				began the international expansion with franchisees and broadened the company‘s presence rapidly. In the early 90s, 
				Sixt became the market leader in Germany. Today, Sixt is operating worldwide in more than 100 countries.


Regine Sixt children's aid foundation
Regine Sixt also founded the Sixt Children‘s Aid Association (Kinderhilfe e.V.) in Munich in 
				2000 and transformed it into a foundation in 2011. Themed “Drying little tears“, it supports children living in poverty worldwide. 
				Today, the Regine Sixt Children‘s Aid Foundation is the official Corporate Social Responsibility Program in all countries around 
				the world wherever Sixt is present.


Sixt founds Autoland Direktverkauf GmbH
With this new daughter company (today Sixt Car Sales), Sixt entered the market of second hand car 
				sales. However, the core business of Sixt is still car rental.


Sixt Ventures and autohaus24.de are born
“Sixt Ventures”, another daughter company, was founded, with a goal to discover and develop innovative 
				digital business ideas. Additionally, with the establishment of autohaus24.de, Sixt and Axel Springer Auto Verlag GmbH set up one of 
				the first portals for selling new cars online. The online car sales center has a role as a sales partner for German traders and 
				matches offers with interested private customers.


Sixt offers mobile solutions
Sixt was the first worldwide car rental company to offer booking via iPhone, adapting itself to the 
				changing mobility needs of customers. With the swipe of a finger, a customer can rent a Sixt vehicle. The Sixt app also supports 
				vehicle pick-up with barcodes to shorten the process. Furthermore, Sixt offers its customers vehicles with the intelligent information 
				system, BMW ConnectedDrive, which interconnects the driver and delivers relevant pieces of information for the customer’s journey.


The fourth generation
Alexander Sixt assumed control of corporate development, and Konstantin Sixt took responsibility for the 
				entire Internet business, which is of vital importance for Sixt.


Sixt enters the USA
Sixt starts its expansion in the USA and opens its first rental branches in Florida.


Foundation of DriveNow
Sixt and BMW joined forces, starting the joint venture DriveNow, a premium car sharing product. This innovative 
				mobility concept combines the highest quality vehicles and services with ease and flexible usage. 


Congratulations, Sixt!
Sixt celebrated its 100th anniversary and pursued further international expansion. DriveNow expanded and an offer 
				for commercial use by the companies is introduced. As the only international provider, Sixt also offers a comprehensive service covering car-sharing, 
				renting and leasing.


Get in!
Sixt enlarged its mobility solutions product range with myDriver, a professional chauffeur service for private and business 
				customers with affordable and transparent fixed prices. The daughter company focuses mainly on airport transfers. The fleet consists of high-end limousines 
				from renowned brands.


Leasing Initial Public Offering
With the IPO of the Sixt Leasing SE, Sixt put the leasing business on a solid financial footing, at the same time making it 
				the first listed car leasing company in Germany. Also in 2015, the sons of Erich Sixt, Alexander and Konstantin, were appointed to the Board of Directors 
				of Sixt SE. Finally, you can unlock a vehicle with your smartphone! Sixt starts the new service “Fastlane” in Switzerland.


Internationalization of myDriver
The transfer service provider myDriver expanded internationally to several European cities.


Internationalization of DriveNow
The premium car sharing product DriveNow expanded internationally. Outside Germany the car sharing service is available 
				in Brussels, Copenhagen, London, Milan, Stockholm and Vienna.

No day passes like another. We are fast and flexible! No one rests on
                        status quo; everybody pursues the goal to bring Sixt amongst the best in the world. It is
                        exciting anew every day to be part of it.

If one is prepared to shoulder responsibility early in the day and wishes
                        not to do a pure desk job, has found just the right address.

There is no standstill at Sixt. As soon as a decision is made, all
                        participants do their utmost to achieve the targeted goal. This makes working here very
                        vivacious, varied and exciting for me. It never is boring. And at the end of every day, you feel
                        like you have really been able to achieve something.


Eva Büchert
Senior Manager Office CEO/COO







During my trainee program, I had the opportunity to work in different
                        cities in Germany. Among other places, I was deployed in Berlin, Nuremberg, Munich and Leipzig.
                        Here, I could make contacts within the Sixt world relatively quickly, and I count on these still
                        today.
