Hengli Petrochemical Co. Opens PTA Plant Utilizing INVISTA Technology 

SHANGHAI - Sept. 19, 2012 - INVISTA Performance Technologies (IPT) and Hengli Petrochemical (Dalian) Co, Ltd celebrated the successful start-up of the first phase of Hengli’s purified terephthalic acid (PTA) project in Changxing Island of Dalian, Liaoning Province, at the plant’s opening ceremony today. The world-scale PTA plant utilizes INVISTA’s market leading PTA process technology, provided to Hengli under a license agreement.
Attending the opening ceremony today were Mr Wang Min, party secretary of Liaoning Province, Mr Tang Jun, party secretary of Dalian City, Mr Li Wan Cai, mayor of Dalian city, Mr Chen Jian Hua, chairman and president of Hengli Group Co, Ltd as well as representatives of INVISTA. 
“We are proud to be a part of the celebration today, not just because of the successful start-up of this world-scale PTA plant, but also for a project of such scale completed on an accelerated schedule,” said Steve Kromer, senior vice president of IPT at INVISTA. “The successful start-up represents a significant milestone in our relationship with Hengli, as this is our first project together.”
INVISTA and Hengli signed the technology licensing agreement in May 2010. Construction of the plant started shortly after that date. In addition to the licensing of its PTA process technology, INVISTA provided design, procurement, training and start-up services, and continues to provide commissioning service in support of the project.
“We thank the support of the local government on the project. We also appreciate the high efficiency and professionalism of the Hengli project team and their close cooperation with our licensing team, all of whom have helped make this successful start-up possible,” said Kromer.
With INVISTA’s innovative technology in PTA manufacturing, this project also signifies INVISTA’s commitment to supporting China’s development in the areas of advanced technology and value-added industrial developments. 
INVISTA has been growing its business in China through innovative products and advanced technologies. In addition to licensing its leading technologies in chemical intermediates and polymers, the company has also been expanding its manufacturing presence and strengthening its capability for advancing product innovations. Expansion to double the capacity of its air bag nylon fiber plant in Qingpu, Shanghai, is underway. Just last month, INVISTA opened its first research and development center in Mainland China with the establishment of INVISTA China Textile Research Centre, also in Qingpu. 
INVISTA has been licensing its leading technologies in chemical intermediates and polymers in China since 1990. INVISTA estimates that the total investment of its Chinese licensees has now exceeded RMB 55 billion. The company’s market-leading PTA technology is available as a license package.
