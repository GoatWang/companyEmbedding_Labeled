[Application of Crucialtec's optical input devices]

There must be literally hundreds of thousands of different electronics devices in the market today, from familiar items such as mobile phones, computers of all types, laptops, tablet computers, gaming devices, to professional equipment, specialized devices, industrial machines, everything. Many of these products, however, have several components in common. Take a look at the devices you have around you, and chances are many of them have LCD displays now. There are only a handful of companies that manufacture top-quality LCD panels and displays, and these companies are household names. There are other companies that make key components such as mobile chipsets that you might not be able to see but nevertheless are found in every mobile phone and personal communication devices. The companies that make these components, too, are superstars in their field.
 
One of these companies is Crucialtec, whose optical joysticks can be found everywhere. Take the "smart remote" that comes with most televisions today. Our TVs are increasingly complex, often with various input functions and built-in Internet. Many of us use our TVs as the entertainment center that controls all the other devices we have attached to them, and the remotes necessarily are forced to contain a lot of different functions. The optical trackpad is the little square input device that you can in the middle of these remotes, and they make life a lot easier.
 
The importance and widespread use of Crucialtec's optical input devices led to Crucialtec making headlines recently by announcing that they will begin supplying its optical input devices to UEI (Universal Electronics Incorporated), the world's largest remote control manufacturer headquartered in the United States and supplying remotes for TV, cable TV, audio, home theater and numerous other device manufacturers around the world. According to Crucialtec, UEI agreed to install the company's optical trackpad (OTP), one of Crucialtec's main optical input devices, into UEI's top-of-the-line remote control models using the latest technology. The company plans to ship one million units that include Crucialtec's OTP this year, expanding production and distribution steadily in the years to come.
 
Crucialtec's optical input devices can also be found in some of the world's leading computers and tablets. Tablet computers have become widespread, and many people are familiar with the touchscreen input system. After using tablets for a few years, however, some users have begun to ask for a more tactile pointing system. There are even some consumers that choose a tablet computer with a traditional USB port that can support a mouse, even though the inclusion of such a feature makes the tablet bulkier and thicker than the market's leading products. As more and more users find new uses for tablet computers, they are demanding additional features and companies are working to deliver them. Crucialtec's success in the mobile industry has not escaped the attention of top computer and tablet manufacturers such as Samsung and LG. The company recently accounted that one of these top tablet computer manufacturers will soon begin shipping new tablets that include Crucialtec's optical pointing devices.
 
Crucialtec has already become the world's leading developer and manufacturer of mobile input devices. As can be seen with the above application with new laptop and tablet computers, the type of optical, biometric and laser input devices that the company specializes in are increasingly finding new applications. Soon, such input devices are expected to become common features in all kinds of electronics devices including IPTVs, controllers, MP3 px-x-x-x-layers and other media devices, and even toys for children. These new usage for the company's core product has allowed Crucialtec to continue to expand their already dominating market share and revenues, posting sales of $208 million in 2010. The company expects its revenues to rise to $1 billion by 2013, and has recently opened a new manufacturing plant in Hanoi, Vietnam, with an expected manufacturing capacity of 100 million units per year in order to meet the rocketing demand for its star product.
