Company Profile
Vitatron – The pacemakers
Vitatron is a European based international pacemaker company with a rich history. We started in 1956, implanting our first pacemaker in 1962. Since that day, Vitatron pacemakers have helped more than 700,000 people. We blend our rich history as a specialist with active physician partnerships.
Physician’s knowledge and needs are an invaluable source in our continuous efforts to deliver patient-focused therapies for the treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders: Bradycardia and Atrial Fibrillation. Our unique approach to product development yields fast, easy and innovative pacing therapies and diagnostics that adapt to the patient’s individual physiological needs.
We passionately strive for efficient perfection, realizing better results, less physical burden and time-saving pacemaker follow-ups, all resulting in lower costs for healthcare.
Since 1986, Vitatron has been part of Medtronic Inc, the world leader in medical technology. As a highly successful and subsidiary, Vitatron offers a technology stream that is complementary to Medtronic’s products.
In 2011, Vitatron designed and developed a new line of “Smart and Easy” pacemakers
called the G and E series. This line of pacemakers offers a full array of advanced
diagnostics, therapies and ongoing management of atria arrhythmias with user friendly
interface.
The A series is the newest addition to the Vitatron family, with four new models also
designed for Smart and Easy pacemaker use with leading-edge technology without ever
compromising the service and responsiveness you've experienced for over 50 year.
