In response to the ever-growing demand for electronics, SIWARD was founded in 1988 with the goal of producing high quality crystals. After several years of intensive R&D activities, we enjoyed enviable success while continuing to expand our business and strengthen our market competitiveness.
Address: 1-1, Lane 111, Jung-Shan Rd., Sec. 3, Tantzu Hsing, Taichung 427, Taiwan, R.O.C.Phone: +886 4 2534 7909Fax: +886 4 2532 7885E-Mail: sales@mail.siward.com.twWebsite: http://www.siward.comDescriptionDespite our success in the past, we are not content to sit back and take it easy. Instead we aim to continue to strive and learn form each and every experience that we face and incorporate greater strengths into our working habits.
Improvement of Production techniques and Continual Upgrading of Product Quality
We at SIWARD insist on the policy that there is no room in the communications industry for a company that does not consider quality to be of the highest importance. Ever since our founding, we have placed a great deal of emphasis on the improvement of production techniques and the continual upgrading of our product quality. We have confidence in our ability to continuously expand our product line.
The Better Each Step is Controlled, the Better the Quality Will Be
With the professional support of our R&D department, we have been able to ensure continual improvement and excellent quality in our designing, sample manufacturing, product testing and all stages of our mass production process. It is this customer satisfaction which keeps our customer coming back to us.
Moving Towards the Climax of Technology
Without customer satisfaction our company would not survive. One of the ways that we achieve this is by ensuring that our factories are equipped with the latest "state of the art" machinery, have highly competent professional personnel and techniques to ensure the smooth running of our plants. In 1993 we successfully developed "SAW Devices" with support of Taiwan "Industrial Technology Research Institute". This has provided us with invaluable experience in cooperation with this academic institution and has helped us to move forward in a major way.
Our Sales Network Extend to Every Part of the World
We have build Taiwan-based global sales network, and have clients in over 35 countries. We have no doubts that with this trend we will continue to build a solid foundation in Asia and from this base we look forward to an ever-expanding global position.
SIWARD's Perspective of the Future
In response to the ever-growing demand for electronics, SIWARD was founded in 1988 with the goal of producing high quality crystals. After several years of intensive R&D activities, we enjoyed enviable success while continuing to expand our business and strengthen our market competitiveness.
"Employees" Keep SIWARD Moving
Except for endeavoring to achieve the best in our professional field, we deeply concern about our surroundings and never forget our responsibility to the society. We strive, with every possible effort to protect the environment. Employees keep SIWARD moving. They are considered to be our most valuable resources. We never stop investing in our employee's training. In our believe, the continuous training is the only way to prevent us from stepping back. In addition, the complete welfare system offers a pleasant working environment to soothe the employees' working pressure.
SIWARD's Products Tells About SIWARD's Reliability
None of our products are delivered without first passing strict testing and inspection. After all, it'' our image that is at strike. In order to maintain our good reputation, we insist on QC systems that go beyond what our customers either imagine or expect.
