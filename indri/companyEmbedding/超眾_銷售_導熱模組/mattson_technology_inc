Find out where we make food happen!
We strive to get our clients as close to the end product as possible, as early in the process as possible. See where we create hundreds of food concepts and protocepts on a daily basis and how we enable our clients to bring commercially viable products to market.


×Close Concept Creation
Regardless of how we fill the pipeline for you, we apply holistic thinking, decades of cross-category experience, and an innate understanding of consumer food behavior and food trends to transform your ideas into viable business concepts.
 
ProtoThink is a mobile co-creation platform. Using social media as a tool, we ideate, track, and document new concepts, flavors, ingredients, forms, restaurants, cooking methods, and shopping and eating behaviors – in real-time, accessible to the team in the cloud.
Our creative team of food inventors moderate the sessions to stimulate thinking in order to identify the most disruptive, yet feasible concepts that match your needs. We then turn the output from ProtoThink into new-to-you concepts as well as new-to-the-world innovations.

The Food Studio is a collaborative, food-centric ideation session where we create real product models for expressing ideas. Being able to visualize concepts beyond words on paper results in a more successful ideation. We unleash creativity with real food you can see, touch, and (sometimes) eat. The result is dozens of concepts created in a single session. Consumers can’t eat concepts, and management doesn’t eat strategy. This team-building environment fosters buy-in from all disciplines– innovation, marketing, operations and executives.
 SEE THE FOOD STUDIO IN ACTION
×Close  
When you need a fresh perspective from outside your company’s four-walls, leverage our innovation team’s 150-plus years of combined experience to identify food opportunities where none seem to exist.
You set the criteria; we ideate within these parameters. Then, using our food-centric approach, we deliver concepts as a holistic, strategic blueprint. This outlines the elements required to get you to market: from positioning to culinary strategy, from food processing technology to manufacturing, and from placement to channel strategy.
Inspiration for Concept + Product Development
Every team needs inspiration beyond your four walls. As part of the innovation process, we offer a range of engagements to spur creativity, foster cross-team collaboration and provide fodder for your next product line, menu concept, food form or ingredient.
    INTEGRATED CONSUMER INSIGHTS
Uncover insights from the only truly integrated end-to-end innovation firm in the Food & Beverage industry.
 
We integrate research seamlessly into the development plan in a way a third party vendor cannot. You can rest assured that the research is being conducted with actionable results in mind. That’s the way we’re wired, because we’re usually tasked with executing upon those results.
Mattson’s Integrated Consumer Insights (ICI) includes Qualitative Social Communities and Quantitative Panels.
TRADITIONAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES
Additional Mattson research techniques include:
• Focus Groups
• Central Location Taste and/or Preparation Tests
• One-on-One/Ethnographic Interviews
• Custom Research
 BRANDING AND DESIGN
We are specialists in creating new brands and designing impactful trial-driving packaging. We use our food innovation expertise to create memorable names, identities, and product communication in all categories, channels, and consumer need states.
   Product Design and Development
A great product is your ultimate competitive advantage. We develop products for every category, consumer need state, technology, temperature state, culinary tradition, and channel of distribution. Our teams of product developers include multidisciplinary expertise that are as broad as they are deep and include culinary cross-trained food technologists, technology cross-trained chefs, regulatory experts and commercialization specialists.
WE OFFER
• Product Design
• Product Research and Development
• Ingredient Applications
• Manufacturing Process Development
 Commercialization
With our cross-functional food lab teams, dedicated commercialization specialists, and two on-site pilot plants, we are able to meet your commercialization needs. From identifying qualified co-packers to leading plant trials, from managing full-size production runs to conducting shelf-life testing, our team is  experienced across virtually every technology to ensure your product is commercially viable and market-ready.

Mattson Technology, Inc. Reports Results for the 2010 Fourth Quarter and Year-EndHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Mattson Technology, Inc. Reports Results for the 2010 Fourth Quarter and Year-EndMarketwireFebruary 2, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareFREMONT, CA--(Marketwire - 02/02/11) - Mattson Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTSN - News), a leading supplier of advanced process equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, today announced results for the 2010 fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010. 2010 Business Highlights:-- Fourth quarter revenue of $41.3 million marked the seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Fiscal 2010 revenue of $138.3 million grew 225 percent over 2009.-- 2010 etch revenue increased 6 times over 2009, generated over 30 percent of systems revenue, and expanded into the NAND, foundry, and packaging markets. In the fourth quarter, Mattson Technology shipped etchers for production into a new etch application set, which expands the Company's etch served-available-market by approximately $500 million and doubles the Company's etch application portfolio.-- Rapid-thermal-processing (RTP) expanded beyond the DRAM market. Mattson Technology generated revenue from two of the top three NAND customers and shipped the Helios® XP into the logic and foundry lines of three leading Asian semiconductor manufacturers. Millios™, Mattson's millisecond anneal technology, achieved tool of record status for advanced logic and DRAM applications at a key customer. Millios is now being utilized at three key customers for device development down through the 16-nanometer node.-- Shipments of Suprema® and Aspen III strip products to key foundry and memory customers continued to expand the Company's core base. In 2010, Mattson Technology added a new logic/foundry customer, and qualified at a new NAND customer. The Company is engaged with eight of the top ten capital equipment spenders in the strip market.David L. Dutton, Mattson Technology's president and chief executive officer, noted, "We achieved the majority of the aggressive goals we set in 2010, particularly in the new product penetration area. The fourth quarter marked our seventh consecutive quarter of growth, but as we announced on January 4, 2011, customers rescheduled the shipment of DRAM products during the quarter, which caused our revenue growth rate to fall below our expectations. Although the delay was disappointing, new etch product positions, and our strip systems' strong foundry presence, drove the overall business in the fourth quarter." Dutton concluded, "In 2010, revenue grew 225 percent over 2009, and momentum continues to build. Based in part on our new product positions, we expect to outgrow the industry in 2011."Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter were $41.3 million, compared with $39.8 million in the third quarter, and $17.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 30 percent, compared to 37 percent in the third quarter, and 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Relative to the third quarter, gross margins were negatively impacted by a change in product mix as several DRAM tools were rescheduled.Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $19.9 million, compared to $19.5 million in the third quarter and $17.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased relative to the third quarter, as the Company's accounting calendar was comprised of 14 weeks, whereas the prior periods contained 13 weeks.Net loss for the fourth quarter was $7.9 million, or $0.16 loss per share, compared with a net loss of $6.4 million, or $0.13 loss per share, for the third quarter and net loss of $11.4 million or $0.23 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2009.Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash at the end of the fourth quarter were $23.0 million, compared with $45.3 million at the end of the third quarter, and $60.4 million at the end of 2009. The cash reduction from the third quarter was due to increases in working capital accounts. Inventory increased $7 million quarter-over-quarter, and accounts receivable and advanced billings increased by $10 million.Attached to this news release are preliminary unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.Conference CallOn Wednesday, February 2, 2011, at 2:00 PM Pacific Time (5:00 PM Eastern Time), Mattson Technology will hold a conference call to review the following topics: 2010 fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results, current business conditions, the near-term business outlook and guidance for the first quarter of 2011.
