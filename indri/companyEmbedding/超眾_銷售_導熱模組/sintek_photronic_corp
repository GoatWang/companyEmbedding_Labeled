Sintek Allowed to Set Up PMMA Resin Plant in Nanjing

				Taipei, July 20, 2006 (CENS)--SinTek Photronic Corp. of Taiwan has won an approval from the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to set up a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin material plant in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of mainland China.

Sintek is a major supplier of color filter, a key part component in the thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panel. The PMMA resin is the key material for manufacturing light guides, also a key element of a TFT-LCD panel.

Sintek chairman Chang Wen-yi pointed out that the planned PMMA resin facility in China would supply the needed material to affiliated Global Display Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (GDT), a backlight module supplier in China.  

According to Chang, the new PMMA resin plant will be set up in Nanjing in cooperation with French technical partner Arkema. The facility will initially have a monthly capacity of 2,500 tons of PMMA resin, which will be sufficient enough for making light guides for 2.5 million 17-inch TFT-LCD monitor panels, the chairman said, but Sintek would first utilize only half of the capacity.

Chang also added that the Nanjing PMMA resin plant would start mass production when GDT's monthly output outstrips 900,000 backlight modules. Currently, GDT ships about 600,000 backlight modules per month, and aims to achieve a monthly shipment volume of one million units in the third quarter this year, and a maximum volume of about 1.6 million units in the future.

GDT sells its backlight modules with bundled color filters in mainland China, making it a major sales channel for Sintek-made color filters in China, which currently account for over 50% of Sintek's total sales revenue. In the past, the largest shareholder in GDT was Helix Technology Co., Ltd. Of Taiwan, but from last year Sintek has gradually boosted its shareholding in the major subsidiary to over 90% so far. 

More and more upstream parts manufacturers in the local TFT-LCD panel line are rushing to venture into the material-making field to cut costs and further strengthen their competitiveness. For instance, Forhouse Corp., a backlight module supplier, has run ahead of Sintek in setting up a PMMA resin plant in central Taiwan in cooperation with a German partner. Forhouse's PMMA resin plant is scheduled to post an annual capacity of 40,000 tons of PMMA, which will be used by the company itself.

Industry sources pointed out that light guide accounts for about 25% of the total cost of a backlight module, while the PMMA resin commands about 20% of the production cost for light guide.

SINTEK, HannStar Display sets up joint venture maker of color filters

                        	Jan 21, 2003 Ι Industry In-Focus
Ι Electronics and Computers Ι By Adam,  CENS
                            










				 
				
				Taipei, Jan. 21, 2003 (CENS)--SINTEK Photronic Corp. and HannStar Display Corp., two local manufacturers, has recently established a joint venture producer of color filters based on the fifth-generation manufacturing process, with commercial production to begin in June 2004.

Listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, SINTEK Photronic is Taiwan's largest manufacturer of color filters, a key component of TFT-LCDs (thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays). HannStar Display is a main manufacturer of TFT-LCDs listed on the local over-the-counter bourse.

SINTEK Photronic currently has a color filter factory based on the 3.5th-generation manufacturing process and another on the fourth-generation one. In order to reduce the investment risk of setting up a color filter factory based on fifth-generation manufacturing process, the company cooperates with HannStar Display, a user of color filters, for the joint venture project.

The joint venture company will start establishing a color filter factory of fifth-generation manufacturing process in the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park located in Tainan County, southern Taiwan, next month and complete it in December this year. The factory will begin volume production in June 2004.

With the fifth-generation manufacturing technology to be transferred from Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. (DNP) of Japan, the factory will make color filters from 1,200mm x 1,300mm glass substrates. The production of color filters can be automatically shifted to using 1,100mm x 1,250mm or 1,100mm x 1,300mm glass substrates to meet varying demand by domestic TFT-LCD production lines based on manufacturing process of the fifth generation.

The factory will have initial monthly production capacity of using 60,000 glass substrates and the capacity will be expanded to 75,000 glass substrates eventually. Of the factory's production capacity, a portion equivalent to using 30,000 glass substrates will be reserved for HannStar Display and the other available for the three local TFT-LCD makers AU Optronics Corp., Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., and Quanta Display Inc. as well as Samsung of South Korea.

The joint venture manufacturer will have initial capital of NT$3.50 billion and 50%, namely, NT$1.75 billion has been raised from SINTEK Photronic (80% stake) and HannStar Display (20% stake). The remaining 50% of the initial capital will be collected next quarter, with DNP likely to be a shareholder.
