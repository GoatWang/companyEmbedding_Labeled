Ban Leong is a brand name in the technology productsdistribution industry for more than 20 years. From a traditional IT products distributor, Ban Leong Technologies Ltd. has successfully transformed into a new-generation technology-driven specialist distributor under the leadership of our Managing Director, Ronald Teng, who spearheaded the transformation since it was incorporated in 1993.
Leveraging on our 20-year brand history, we successfully re-positioned and strengthened our brand as a name synonymous with innovative, fashionable and user-focused tech-savvy products through regular marketing activities.
Ban Leong Technologies Ltd has been listed on the SGX Main Board since 23 June 2005 and distributes a diverse range of IT accessories, multimedia and data storage products. Multimedia products primarily consist of audio and visual products ranging from earphones, speakers and cameras to commercial and consumer displays. IT accessories include consumer I.T products such as computer systems, components, peripherals, printers and Mobile products from wearables, accessories and powerpacks. New categories include Smart Home solutions and Robotics. Data storage products include portable and cloud drives, HDD enclosures, Blu-Ray and portable DVD-RW.
We also constantly focus on identifying innovative IT products to enhance and expand our range of products. Over the years, we have gathered the brands of AVLABS and eGear under our wings and developed them as our in-house brands, focusing on specific range of products.
AVLABS’ core focus is on the research of markets and trends and subsequent sourcing of innovative, high quality audio/visual consumer products for the Asia Pacific region. AVLABS strives to be a market leader in the PC, Mac peripherals and consumer electronics market segments. Through the use of leading edge packaging design and manufacturing methods, we aim to achieve excellence in product value perception and brand recognition. eGear has evolved over the years to focus in traveler portable accessories such as Bluetooth speakers and cables.
Till date, we have more than 40 authorized distributorships for over 178 types of products under 55 brand names. This allows endless bundling possibilities of different products to cater to our customers’ varied needs.
With an experienced management team with over 30 years of combined experience in the IT industry, we are able to identify and establish strong relationships with our vendors who have a track record of developing innovative products.
We distribute our products through three channels, namely, e-commerce particularly the e-retailers and Ban Leong e- store; resellers such as retailers and chain stores and directly to corporate resellers and system integrators. To complement our distribution services, we provide after sales support services and offer out-of-box replacement warranty to our customers. We have our own service centre with in-house technicians to handle all the hardware/technical problems as well as onsite repairing for certain products. By going the extra mile to serve our customers, we have established our name as a “reliable and trustworthy” partner.
Today, we are based in Singapore and have regional offices in Malaysia and Thailand.
