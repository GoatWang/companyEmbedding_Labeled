Established in 1973 Tai-Shing Electronics Components has manufactured electronics components for over three decades. We currently offer 60 different series of relays, including solid-state relays, telecom relays, reed relays, general-purpose relays, high-current power relays, automotive relays and latching-type relays. Our house brand, TTi, provides you with quick-sourcing solutions for retail-ready products, and we also offer specialized OEM services. Nearly perfect acceptance rates Tai-Shing Electronics Components is committed to producing defect-free products. That's why we source many of our raw materials from Japan and Germany - countries known for producing reliable goods. This, combined with the production consistency of our ISO 9001:2000-certified factories in both Taiwan and mainland China, results in product acceptance rates uncommon in the industry. In fact, our return rate is less than 10 parts per million. We produce 10 million units monthly, so this consistent quality is upheld even on large orders. House-brand and OEM products delivered fast Our TTi-brand products ship with UL, CSA and TUV approvals, so you can distribute them in your market without documentation delays. Should you have customization needs, our R&D team leaders - who average more than 30 years of experience - can handle all of your requirements. Once we start production, lead times can be as short as three days. E-mail us today for more information. A Global Sources member since 1995
