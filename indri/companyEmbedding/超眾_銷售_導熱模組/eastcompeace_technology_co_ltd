Exposure for high resolution LCD 'AEGIS-HR series'



[Overview]

Along with development of smartphones*1, their displays require higher performance (such as high resolution and low power consumption) than the conventional displays do.

AEGIS-HR*2 series are the exposure system for manufacturing ultra high resolution displays to apply to the smartphones and the tablet PCs etc. By adopting the uniquely-developed micro-lens array (MLA)*3 optical system, which is different from that included in the previous system.
*1 : See "Improvement of Display – Enhance Resolution and Image Quality" described below.
*2 : HR stands for High Resolution.
*3 : MLA (Micro-lens Array) means that the micro-lenses are arranged in a grid pattern.
*4 : See “Impact on display design by High Resolution” described below.



MLA

 


[Features]

High resolution*4
 This system achieves 2μm exposure resolution by MLA, Micro Lens Allay.  It leads to producing the high resolution displays which are equivalent to or more than 300 pixels per inch (ppi).  (As of the end of September, 2011)
High alignment accuracy
 Optical system by MLA for AEGIS-HR is quite simple structure compared with that of typical projection type exposure. This allows AEGIS-HR to realize high alignment accuracy.
High productivity

The impact on display design by high resolution
To achieve both high resolution and low power consumption for displays, fine patterns are required.

*1 : Aperture ratio: Ratio of the area to pass through lights in (sub) pixels.
If the display adopts the high resolution without changing the line width of the black matrix frame (BM), it reduces the aperture ratio.  To maintain the same brightness, it is necessary to brighten the backlight, and then the power consumption increases.  As a result, the battery life for smartphones and laptop computers will be shortened.
