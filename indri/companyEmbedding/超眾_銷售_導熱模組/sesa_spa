	Treating your body, skin and hair with chemicals strips them of many nutrients and leaves them lifeless and dull, forget about the damage you have caused your body yet and move on to a healthy lifestyle. The Sesa Hair Oil is an ayurvedic hair oil that has been formulated to fight all hair problems and give you long lasting results. This organic oil is a blend of various herbs, filled with medicinal properties that support and strengthen hair growth.

	The hair oil is composed of Indian gooseberry oil, licorice, brahmi, datura metel, triphala, centella asiatica, eclipta alba and jatamansi among various other herbs, this perfect mix of ayurveda and knowledge enables you to receive the goodness of nature in a bottle. The strong blend of these ingredients prevents and cures alopecia (hair loss), treats scalp infections and prevents hair from UV damage. This Sesa hair oil is infused with natural ingredients because no one better than mother Earth can solve your hair problems.

	Massage your hair regularly with this oil and it will improve the texture of your hair, improving the melanin content of hair as well as providing nourishment to the scalp so your strands are always enriched. This ayurveda rich oil contains essential nutrients and ingredients which help speed up hair growth because of increased blood circulation to the scalp. Regular use of the oil will reward you with reduced hair fall, greys and a dry, itchy scalp.

After that I have seen ad of Sesa Hair Oil in a news paper and choose flipkart.com to place order.

And you have given me simple Sesa Hair Oil which is very wrong. When a customer orders for a certain type of product, with its specifications, he / she should get that product with the specification given by the buyer. Just because someone has ordered you pack and send any product. This is wrong. I accepted it because I don't want to go into another trouble of returning the product.

After trying out Sesa oil, I also tried Khadi's olive oil, and Khadi's almond oil just to experience which is better. Sesa oil is a winner, hands down. I see the difference in the softness of my hair the day I wash with Sesa oil versus with the other oils.The only minus is a "ayurvedic" fragrance that is left behind even after washing twice with the shampoo.READ MOREMokshi KalsotraCertified Buyer29 Nov, 201242PermalinkReport Abuse1 ★Dont go by reviews alone.I bought this product only because I read amazing reviews on it here and on mouthshut.
