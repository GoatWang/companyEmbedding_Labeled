Company Description                    




                        Prime View International, Inc. (PVI) (now, E Ink Holdings Inc.) was the first TFT LCD company based in Taiwan. Its products include high quality small-to-medium-sized TFT LCD panels. PVI’s parent company, the YFY group, a world leader in paper manufacturing, realized that high growth potential of digital publishing and started research efforts on alternative display solutions to link the divide between paper and electronics.In 2005, PVI acquired the ePaper business unit from Philips and worked closely with E Ink to launch the first EPD eBooks into the market.To increase its capacity, PVI established Transcend Optronics in YangZhou, China in 2002, for the display module manufacturing. PVI merged with the Korean TFT LCD company, Hydis Technologies in 2008. PVI then acquired E Ink Corporation in the U.S. to further integrate the ePaper supply chain in 2009.In 2010, PVI became E Ink Holdings, Inc.  The E Ink Group is now supplying ePaper modules to the global top tier eReader brand names like Amazon, Sony, Hanvon, Barnes & Noble, etc.  Currently E Ink’s ePaper module has a significant global market share and all modules are manufactured by its Chinese subsidiary, Transcend Optronics.E Ink Holdings’ corporate philosophy aims to deliver revolutionary products, user experiences, and environmental benefits through advanced technology development. With new products like color, flexible, and touch-enabled ePaper, E Ink Holdings will lead the eBook industry into the new era. E Ink Holdings' corporate philosophy is to deliver revolutionary products, user experiences, and environmental benefits through advanced technology development. This vision has led to continuous investments in the field of ePaper displays. Case in point: our 2008 acquisition of Hydis Technologies, manufacturer of the world's best wide viewing angle LCDs and our 2009 acquisition of E Ink Corp., the worldwide leader in ePaper.

Competitiveness



Based on E Ink's outlook for the industry, E Ink will utilize its existing strength and dominant market position to expand into the markets for all TFT-LCD devices.E Ink will utilize TFT-related technologies to develop new products and new applications in order to maintain steady growth in sales and profit.
1. Understanding market needsSince 1992, E Ink has focused on small-and-medium-sized TFT LCD products and established a technology service oriented manufacturing business. Through this long-term investment and focus, the company's accumulated experience is a valuable, irreplaceable resource.
2. Complete product lines and capabilitiesE Ink has a complete production line for small-and-medium-sized TFT LCD products. The company is also actively involved in procuring material resources to ensure long-term stable supply of products. Furthermore, E Ink is always exercising its creativity to manufacture products to meet new market demands, but also to ensure the company's dominance in the market. Key TFT LCD products are up to 12.1 inches wide
3. Going the extra miles for customersThrough its superior customization service, E Ink has successfully established itself in the market. The company provides its main customers in the niche market with benefits which include products that return better profit can enjoy the benefits and security from marketing a unique product over a specified period.
4.Customer relationsE Ink has a culture of developing good relationships between the company and its customers. One of the company's principle customer support strategies is to assign technical staff to help a customer to resolve any product issue encountered. This often enables the customer to go to market before its competitors. The company's quality manufacturing and excellent service gives our customers product advantage.
5. Product development: meeting changing needsDrawing on its expertise in technological development and marketing projects, E Ink maintains an efficient production schedule. However, E Ink aims to shorten the product development process even further. Currently, the time frame for specification development to preparation for mass production averages three or four months for a new product. In the future, E Ink aims to complete the process within three months. Shortening the lead time will cut costs. Keeping product development expenses as low as possible in such a competitive market is one of E Ink's highest priorities, yet E Ink still intends to develop special products to meet demand.
6. Product development at minimal NRE costTo create competitive price advantage, E Ink exercises strict cost control throughout the product development process including the design and testing stages. Strict cost control is even more stringent products developed for clients with special requirements. In the development process, new products cannot be guaranteed to be successful. However, if a new product is price competitive due to tight cost control and minimized expenditure during development, it will have a greater chance of success.
