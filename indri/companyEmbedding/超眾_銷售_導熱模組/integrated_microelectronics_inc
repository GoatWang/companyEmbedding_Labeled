History[edit]




IMI Energy Solutions at Fremont, California, USA.


IMI started in 1980 as a joint venture between Ayala Corporation and Resins, Inc. With its headquarters in Muntinlupa, they were just a workforce of around 100 employees with total fixed assets of US$3,700,290. By 2001, IMI only had three manufacturing sites in the Philippines.
As of 2015, IMI has 13 manufacturing sites around the world with more than 15,000 employees. From a EMS company, it expanded its scope to include EMS and Power Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services. IMI is also into prototyping, manufacturing, product test development, testing and order fulfillment.[1]

The company began to establish its presence outside the Philippines. In 2005, IMI acquired the EMS assets of Saturn Electronics and Engineering Inc. in the US[2] and the Speedy-Tech Electronics Ltd of Singapore.[3] The acquisition of Speedy-Tech eventually led to the establishment of IMI’s presence in China—through three facilities, namely, two in Shenzhen and one in Jiaxing.[4]

After what just happened last week, it could⋯⋯ be a lot closer than you think.  Just  a few days ago, Ayala corporation  purchased 94.9% of a 145 yr old German company called Misslbeck. This is a company that designs, builds, and prepares a car for manufacturing. They have done it since the horse and carriage (literally) and have recently just finished building the new Rolls Royce, the Audi A8, the Focus RS, among countless others.  Basically, this is a company that the worlds largest automakers go to to create their first working model. They are tasked to develop the car, build the clay model, then make the parts--as well as the tools to make them--and then deliver a working model to the brands to see if it's ready for manufacturing.  The short story here is, aside from the KTM factory in Laguna , Ayala already owns a company called IMI which make car components like the cameras used for auto parking, frontal collision warning, as well as the components needed for self-driven cars like the new Volvo.  They have 16 factories around the world, five of which are located in the Philippines. They already supply the worlds best, like Bosch, who in turn supply the world, so this latest acquisition has simply completed the circle for them.  Although they have not admitted to any plans of developing a Filipino car, when asked about the possibility of one, Art Tan, president and CEO of Volkswagen philippines, said yes. That is very, very possible.  I'll be writing a more in depth piece soon but I just wanted to share that piece with you asap because it's pretty darn awesome.  So, whatcha think? With the talent that we have over here (that we normally export out) coupled with this new development, do you think the Philippines is ready to step out into the world's automotive stage? 更多Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. · 7月9日 17:32 · http://www.philstar.com/…/ayala-unit-completes-acquisition-…Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. 更新了封面相片。 · 6月29日 · Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. · 6月23日 · Robot vs. robot in tic-tac-toe.
