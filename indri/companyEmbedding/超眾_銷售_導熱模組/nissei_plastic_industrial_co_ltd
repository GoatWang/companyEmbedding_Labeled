HIFLON
Fluorocarbon Polymer Insulated Products
Excellent charactreristics ; heat resistance, chemical resistance,low friction, and so on.
"HIFLON™" is a trademark of NISSEI's fluorocarbon polymer insulated products. Since HIFLON™ has excellent thermal resistance (it withstands temperatures range from - 200 to 250 degrees centigrade) and chemical resistance, it is often used in diverse fields such as industrial equipment, OA equipment, or transportation equipment. Also, HIFLON™ has excellent conduction and is thus suitable for use in communication devices. Its’ excellently stable composition makes it well-suited for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Recently, it is also used for medical devices.

LIKAL
Silicone Rubber Insulated Products
Clean material with outstanding stability and environmental friendliness.
"LIKAL™ is a trademark of NISSEI's silicone rubber insulated products. LIKAL™ is a synthetic rubber which has outstanding stability and withstands high and low temperatures range from –60 to 200 degrees centigrade. Because of its excellent characteristic for compression and weather resistance, it is often used for products such as automobile equipment, domestic electrical appliances, and moldings of building materials, which must be quality-guaranteed for a prolonged period. Also, as LIKAL™ is an extremely clean material, it is perfectly suitable for food manufacturing and medical devices.

LICOM
Optical Fiber Products
Fusing of various materials and precision processing and pursuing the possibility of light.
"LICOM™" is a trademark of NISSEI's optical fiber products. Other than silica glass fiber products, we have developed various products produced from compound glass fiber and plastic fiber. By using those fibers, we also produce light sensors, light guides for illumination, various light-sources boxes, etc with excellent characteristics for heat-resistance and chemical resistance. Nissei continues to make breakthroughs in the fields of optical communication (eg. data communication fiber, picture transmission fiber, etc.), medical devices (eg. laser-beam transmission fiber, etc.), and high-precision processing (eg. semiconductor laser sources, etc.).

Nissei Plastic Industrial Co. Ltd. has introduced its NEX-IV, the fourth generation of its all-electric injection molding machine. The Japanese machinery manufacturer is taking orders for the NEX-IV series, which includes presses in clamping forces ranging from 30-360 tons.
Nissei debuted its NEX series of injection presses in 2003, and has sold 16,000 of them since them. The NEX-III was introduced in 2012.
The NEX-IV continues Nissei’s stable plasticization and high-precision metering of the injection unit, and the company claims the flat clamp type clamping unit transmits stable and uniform pressure by its linear pressure toggle mechanism.
The NEX-IV Series includes these features:
• Increased precision and speed, though a newly designed toggle mechanism that can cut the mold open/close cycle time by 5-20 percent. The Flat Clamp has been further developed to improve the evenness of its contact pressure. To improve clamping precision, linear guides come standard. Combining that with the “Precision Metering” function, which maintains the consistency of metering density and injection volume, the press gives very stable, precision molding with a high level of repeatability, according to the company.
• Nissei says NEX-IV presses offer one of the widest daylights in the industry while keeping its footprints to the smallest size. Adding up to 100 millimeters to the daylights allows a big increase in the range of mold thicknesses allowed. Plus, Nissei said you use larger molds in smaller machines, in conjunction with the low-pressure molding method.
• A low-inertia servomotor is combined with Nissei’s original injection unit and its control that gives a higher speed/response/pressure injection, and optimized barrel temperature control. These technologies expand the range of molding, and give high-precision injection and metering.
• High-precision metering control Pre-Pack II makes consistent metering density and injection volume, improving yields even when running regrinds or inconsistent materials.
• The Linear Precision Toggle has characteristics similar to the straight hydraulic clamping system, using the advances of a toggle. Standard features are “automatic clamping force adjustment,” which automatically adjusts clamping force fluctuations caused by rising mold temperature, and “direct clamping force setting” that works while the press is running.
Nissei also added new features to the TACT IV controller, including compiling important process information into on e large, 15-inch screen, where each process id displayed in a color-coded chart. A new material-change purging circuit cuts the amount of resin used for purging, and the time to do it. Also new: a mold open/close response speed selector.
Nissei Plastic Industrial Co. Ltd. is based in Nagano, Japan.
Nissei America is in Anaheim, Calif.
