Miniature ball bearings have become essential components in the rotating elements of various equipments and machines. In response to the trend toward equipment and machinery that gets smaller, more compact, thinner and quieter, we manufacture hundreds of kinds of miniature ball bearings, including specialized types, from extremely small bearings with a 1.0 mm bore diameter and a 3.0 mm outer diameter to bearings that are about 20 mm in outer diameter.











Consist of inner ring, outer ring, balls, retainer and cage. This type is the most generally used radial ball bearings for many applications.







Extra-thin-section deep grove ball bearings have a small radial cross-sectional thickness. They are used when extreme compactness is important.








Deep groove ball bearings with extended inner rings are inch series bearings with their inner rings extended equally on both sides beyond the width of the outer ring. This feature simplifies the design and fabrication of parts closely surrounding the bearing.






Thrust ball bearing consists of flat washers (without raceway groove) and ball-installed cage. This type can support an axial load only from one direction. 








This type has a raceway gro0ve on both washers and holds a higher load rating.






Pivot ball bearing consists of outer ring and several balls. This type supports a tapered tip (pivot of normally 60°) of spinning shaft.








Deep groove ball bearings with flanged outer rings is a type that the flange extends around the entire circumference of the outer ring. This feature simplifies a process of  the mounting of the bearing into housing. 






Downsizing the ball screw supporting bearing with miniature size bearing for actuators and ball screw supporting unit.











ISC's newly developed material (TBN-6) achieves much higher performance on corrosion resistance over existing stainless steel of SUS440C. 
     This has been materialized by the optimum addition of four chemical elements and fine adjustment on the content of other minimal elements.
     Moreover, higher mechanical flexibility is added on the material through our original heat treatment technology. 
     With these features, this material can be expected to be widely applied, starting from sea craft and fishing applications, which are to be exposed on salt water, to the outdoor machinery devices.






Best solution for the machineries in outdoor, saltwater and highly corrosive chemical environment.


 







In order to minimize the stress of patients, dental hand piece is required to hold high level of ultra high speed rotation and 	
the lowest vibration. ISC has developed a dental bearing with ultra high speed rotation and lowest running torque in order to meet these requirements from the market.	






In order to respond the market demand	promptly, ISC has a full line of standardized dental bearing.







ISC produces customized dental bearing which fits in all designs from major hand piece brands.










ISC products comprise miniature ball bearings and high precision processing unit sub-assemblies. Utilizing our expertise obtained through manufacturing many types of ball bearings, we achieve high precision and quality at a low cost. We offer you the best solution both for selecting the most appropriate bearing and for designing a surrounding structure of bearing.

All semiconductor products are subject to post-process verification for defect check. Here, a semiconductor test socket works to serve as a core inspection part electrically linking the testing instrument and the semiconductor chips.

With its capability of developing and manufacturing the highly customized semiconductor test socket, ISC Co., LTD. offers the total test solution by way of technical innovation. 
Referring to 'Integrated Silicone Contactor' ISC Test Socket takes advantage of the silky silicone to prevent harming the semiconductor, much improved from the conventional Test Socket (Pogo Pin-type) to realize the unique concept for the highly innovative product.

Featured by ISC Test Socket is its thinner structure than the conventional one for prompt signal transfer.
ISC Test Socket is compatible with the micro-pitch semiconductors below 300um, while successfully retaining the greatest part of current.
