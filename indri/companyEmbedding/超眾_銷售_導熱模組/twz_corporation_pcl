Welcome to Thai Mitsuwa Public Co.,Ltd.




      The company initially started operation  with 80 employees and 6 molding machines, mainly focusing on home appliances. With the sophistication of market needs actively becoming more multifaceted, the frequent demands have been increasing and have been growing to expand our business together with our customers both domestically and internationally.
      Since then the plant has expanded to 1200 employees along with 125 molding machines and has well established throughout the plastic industry in Thailand, participating to take lead in products such as home appliance, audio- visual, office automation, motorcycle, car mount  audio equipment, both interior and exterior equipment for four wheeler vehicles, etc., and  working hard day by day to ensure a greater trust from the market.
      In October 2003, the company was listed on the  Market  for Alternative  Investment  (mai). To follow the footsteps in cultivating frontiers, corresponding methods were brought in such as weld less molding injection, paint booths for UV and hard coating. Meanwhile,  panels for car audio-visual equipment such as car exterior parts and car mount switches have been developed.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com Canada's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.
