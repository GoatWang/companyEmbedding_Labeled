The company’s revenue is estimated at about US$40.7 million this year.
DA Technology is set to be listed on KOSDAQ this year, which will give the company an opportunity to take a leap forward. It passed screening in preparation for going public on the KOSDAQ and the initial public offering (IPO) is now in progress.
DA Technology, which set up its in-house R&D center in 2004, continues to double its efforts in developing new products and enhancing core competence of its products. As result of these efforts, it acquired 15 patents with over three patents pending.
Thanks to all of these efforts, about 87 percent of its revenues come from abroad.

November 17, 2014  by digitalbuyersguide Leave a Comment KITA to Boost Korea’s Trade Sector
The meteoric growth of the Korean economy, which enabled the nation to become the global economic power it is today, is a fact that is widely known and respected throughout the world.
In this process, the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) has played a vitally important role in Korea’s economic and industrial development, as one of the key institutions linking Korean companies to the outside world through the most crucial years of the nation’s industrial expansion.
Founded in 1946, KITA is the largest business association and one of the most influential economic organizations in Korea, with 73,000 member companies and numerous offices in Korea and abroad. The organization’s key roles are two-fold: providing support for member companies and working to remove obstacles that prevent trade and international commerce; and on the global level, promoting free trade and facilitating the signing of free trade agreements between Korea and its trading partners around the globe.
About KITA & Its Main Activities
With its headquarters located in the Korea World Trade Center in Samseong-dong in the heart of Seoul, as well as 12 offices in South Korea and nine branch offices abroad, KITA collects, analyzes and publishes economic data and surveys that help its members make informed and accurate business decisions. The association oversees trade fairs and exhibitions that involve its member companies, provides consultation for developing overseas markets, and acts as the link between Korean and foreign companies, and government agencies involved in commerce and trade.
The services provided by KITA are indispensable resources for Korean companies operating abroad. The association provides translation services, web site creation and maintenance support, human resource management support, and a wide variety of other programs designed to aid dayto-day business operations. KITA also utilizes the network of Korean expatriates and Koreanowned businesses abroad to manage a cooperative matrix of Korean firms and entrepreneurs who have already blazed a path in the global market.
Another key role of KITA involves trade shows and exhibitions, which have become one of the most important tools for global trading companies. KITA matches global buyers with leading Korean companies through expert consultants, tours and pays personalized attention to visiting buyers in order to maximize business opportunities during the duration of their visit to Korea.

Mr. Jo Jae-we, CEO of a leading EMC/EMI solution provider in Korea, Solueta Co., Ltd. (www.solueta.com) received the Trader of the Month award for his contributions in achieving the excellent export performance of Solueta. Mr. Jo founded a company called STEC in 2001 and changed its name to Solueta in 2008.
He has overcome the early difficulties he had in the business and successfully managed to greatly expand Solueta into a major EMC/EMI solution company in Korea. With 185 employees, Solueta recorded exports worth $26million in just 11 years after its founding. Its success lies in constant technical innovations and flexible response to the rapidly changing market environment.
The company has secured the entire processes for the production of EMC/EMI solution by introducing a plating line and adhesion line in 2008 and 2011, respectively. Through such efforts, the company production has established the environment manufacturing next-generation multifunctional materials, strengthening quality and price competitiveness at the same time.
Currently, Solueta is the No. 1 company in the Korean market in terms of developing and manufacturing EMC/EMI, conductive tapes, conductive cushions and thermal management solution, which are electromagnetic wave blocking and heat-resistant materials. Solueta has gained recognition for its technology, supplying to global IT device manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, Apple, Motorola, Nokia, etc.
As IT devices such as smartphones and TVs are evolving, the EMC (Electro-Magnetic Compatibility) / EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) technology is essential and growing in demand. These solutions are needed to have thin and flexible qualities, along with excellent conductivity and heat conduction in order to be applied to increasingly thinner digital gadgets.
Solueta’s products meet those requirements as well as offer competitive prices. Solueta is striving to respond quickly to meet customers’ demanding requirements, and also gives quality and price competitiveness.
