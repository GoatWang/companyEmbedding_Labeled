 Research 
  






 Significant progress has been made in SZS research. Fundamental issues in die design and tryout, various kinds of model principals, subordinate structure links, accurate molding techniques, stamping-signature analysis, and innovative measurement strategies have been examined and improved. Several systems, including global strain measurement, optical checking fixtures, the robot-based measurement system, the material handling grip location optimization package, and active binding controlled dies have been developed and tested in the projects. The program has generated significant interest among the stamping industry.

We began our company in 1966 manufacturing springs and now they are our main product. We use techniques that we pioneered and are used in the spring industry.
                                                                                     To produce all types of springs, we use over 150 progressive, automated-forming machines. SZS uses advanced techniques of spring shaping, heat-treating after forming, and electroplating. The result is a superior spring with very low failure rates that our customers can depend on. It is better designed spring, stronger, longer-lasting, and of higher quality than any other available.
 Our spring automatic-shaping machines, produce springs for communication, computer, consumer (3C) products, such, as notebooks, LCD monitors, PDAs, optical devices and home appliances . As far as production capacity, our company can produce more than 100 million pieces a month.
 SZS has a program of constantly updating its spring production methods and equipment. One of its prime focuses is its accurate, automatic spring-shaping machinery. It produces springs with high-strength properties, high-elastic limits, good surface quality, and extensive elastic range to serve as resilient structures designed to undergo multiple deflections.

 Stamped Products

 Over 26 years ago, SZS pioneered high precision-stamping dies and multifunctional molds. Since that time, the company has continued to design and manufacture or purchase precision tooling while expanding its capabilities to become a provider of world-class manufacturing solutions. SZS specializes in high-quality, high-volume, precision metal parts of brass and of SUS301, 304, SECC, SPECC, SK-5, or SK-7 steels. 
 We have developed a remarkable ability to design, build, and operate all manner of progressive- and compound-stamped products — including fast delivery of prototypes. 
 To provide competitive stampings, we also creatively use slide machines and cam-operated dies to produce parts. And to keep tooling and part quality in top condition, we employ the latest sensor technology .






 
 









 Plastic Products 

 Since 2003

The TOYO high precision injection machines are fully equipped and on excellent team from die design to manufacturing is well organized, it has achieved a fast, efficient, high quality performance. 














                                                                     
                                                                    
                                                                







 Developing a Distant View







 SZS began building its rock-solid reputation in 1965 as the Shin Zu Shing Sprig Factory, a small company producing the finest precision wire and planar springs in the world. We can tailor our processes to meet your needs 
 The world and society changed vastly over the forty years since its founding; SZS never strayed from its pioneering spirit of meeting the expectations of its customers and society. As a recipient of over 200 international patents, SZS seeks to inspire future generations and expresses a strong commitment to boldly face new challenges.
