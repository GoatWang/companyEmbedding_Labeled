Company Announcement Archive Availability Update:
Bursa Malaysia had on 20 April 2015 replaced the announcement dissemination system known as Bursa LINK. As we have over 1 million records of announcements made by listed issuers over a span of 15 years, the data migration and verification has to be carried out progressively to ensure data integrity and reliability. During the initial period of migration, only announcements for a period of 5 years from 1 January 2010 are made available on the website. Thereafter, the remaining past announcements on Bursa Malaysia website will be progressively increased to 15 years within 3 months from 20 April 2015.
