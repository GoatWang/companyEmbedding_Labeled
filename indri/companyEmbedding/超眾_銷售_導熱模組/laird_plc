Acquisition


        24 Nov 2015
        
Strengthening capabilities in the Enterprise Internet of Things
Laird PLC, the global technology company, today announces that it has acquired LS Research (LSR), a
  leader in wireless product design and development, for a total cash consideration of $55m, which
  will be funded from existing debt facilities.
Background on LSR
Headquartered in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, with satellite offices in Madison (WI) and Eagan (MN), LSR
  is a company with embedded Radio Frequency (RF) products and services that simplify wireless and
  accelerate development for its customers. Its operations are split into three key areas which provide
  their customers with RF design services to enable Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) connectivity
  applications, RF products including certified wireless modules and antennas, and Electro-Magnetic
  Conductivity (EMC) testing to international certification standards. It provides Near Field, Local Area
  and Wide Area products and services to enable wireless connectivity and EIoT capabilities into the
commercial and light industrial markets.
Established in 1980, LSR has a strong track record of growth, having increased revenue significantly
  over the last five years, with comparable margins to the Laird wireless businesses and revenue of
  $21.6m in the year ended 31 December 2014. It is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full
  year of ownership. LSR will be integrated into the Laird operating model, (reporting as part of our
  Wireless Systems segment).
LSR will be a strategic and complementary fit with our existing M2M business. This acquisition adds
  new capabilities in embedded wireless solutions and services to Laird, provides us with new routes
  to market for our own products, and most importantly, extends our reach, presence and capabilities
  in the EIoT markets in which Laird is making significant strategic investment.
Benefits of the acquisition
Laird will look to integrate our existing capabilities and those of LSR in order to realise the benefits
  and opportunities of our combined technology, products, services and routes to market, while the
  skills of our new people will add bench strength to our engineering, sales and leadership teams. This
  will enable us to:

Expand our reach into the light industrial and commercial sectors
Provide a fast track to expanding our capabilities and scope of supply by adding new services in
  the form of upstream wireless connectivity design capabilities that enable EIoT ecosystems, and
  EMC testing facilities that can be used internally, as well as continuing to be offered to external
  customers
 Further drive our differentiation principles of innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed by
  adding new (pre and post sales) services and products and reducing time to market for new
  products

David Lockwood, Chief Executive, commented
“This is an exciting development for Laird and provides fantastic opportunities for us and for our
    customers. The capabilities that LSR brings to Laird will enhance our ability to deliver on the clear
    potential that the EIoT has to offer.”

Laird is a global technology company providing systems, components and solutions that protect
    electronics from electromagnetic interference and heat, and that enable connectivity in missioncritical
    wireless applications and antennae systems. Laird is a global leader in the field of innovative

Shares in technology company Laird (LSE: LRD) have fallen by as much as 50% today after it announced a profit warning. Should investors avoid it, or does Laird present a buying opportunity for the long term?
Laird experienced a disappointing first half of the year and was expected to record a significant improvement in the second half of the year. However, its third quarter has been hugely challenging. The acceleration of production for mobile devices has come much later than in previous cycles and visibility remains poor.

Shares in technology company Laird (LSE: LRD) have fallen by as much as 50% today after it announced a profit warning. Should investors avoid it, or does Laird present a buying opportunity for the long term?
Laird experienced a disappointing first half of the year and was expected to record a significant improvement in the second half of the year. However, its third quarter has been hugely challenging. The acceleration of production for mobile devices has come much later than in previous cycles and visibility remains poor. Laird has also experienced margin pressure as a result of unprecedented pricing issues and some operational factors.
The effect of this has been a very tough quarter and Laird has reduced guidance for the full year. It now expects underlying pre-tax profit to be around £50m. This would represent a fall of £23m from last year’s pre-tax profit of £73m.
Clearly, investors have reacted negatively to profit warning. However, the company is taking action to stabilise and boost its performance. It will focus on managing costs and improving cash flow. Laird expects year end net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to be within covenant limits of 3.5 times.
Furthermore, Laird’s business outside of its Performance Materials division remains strong, with its Wireless Systems division delivering a rise in sales of 58% in the quarter. It has also seen positive momentum in its automotive business, while trading in Novero remains consistent with previous guidance.
External factors
Laird’s disappointing three months is due to external factors rather than a failure by the company itself. The smartphone market has been under pressure of late, with Apple reporting a 15% drop in sales of its smartphones in the most recent quarter. Similarly, Samsung has endured a tough period as product recalls are likely to have affected sales numbers.
As such, Laird remains a sound business and its strategy to become more efficient and streamlined could lead to an improved business model over the medium-to-long term. However, in the short run things could get worse before they get better. The smartphone market remains highly uncertain and while Laird may be able to meet updated guidance, there can be no guarantee that this will be the only reduction in guidance before the end of the year. This means that Laird’s share price could fall further.
However, in the long run the smartphone market is likely to grow. Demand from emerging markets should pick up as GDP per capita increases in the coming years. Therefore, Laird continues to offer sound long-term growth potential and could recover the lost ground in the aftermath of today’s profit warning. Buying now would be risky since Laird’s shares are likely to be highly volatile. But the potential rewards are also high, which makes it appealing for investors who are able to take a long-term view.

But is this an even better buy?
Despite this, there's another stock that could be an even better buy. In fact it's been named as A Top Growth Share From The Motley Fool.
The company in question could make a real impact on your bottom line in 2016 and beyond. And in time, it could help you retire early, pay off your mortgage, or simply enjoy a more abundant lifestyle.
