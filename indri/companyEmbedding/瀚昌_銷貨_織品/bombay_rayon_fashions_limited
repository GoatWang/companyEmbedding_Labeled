Yarn
               In 2010 Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd. completed its vertical integration in the textile industry with the acquisition of a yarn manufacturing company of great repute, STI India Ltd, thus making BRFL one of the privileged few to have the capability of producing everything from yarn to garment.
				Our Yarn division is well known for Production of world class cotton yarn and knitted grey fabric, quality consciousness,  fair business practices, modernization, environmental consciousness, social awareness, ultra-modern plant equipped with sophisticated high-tech machinery and high calibre personnel & a great work culture
Strengths and features of our yarn and knitted products are  procurement of high quality cotton fibre for 4-6 months in advance, every bale of Cotton fibre is tested for Length, Micronaire, and Rd (Reflective Index) value for making homogeneous and uniform mixing to avoid shade variation and barre effect in fabric.    We have controlled yarn contamination by implementing systematic and controlled raw material sourcing,  manual contamination sorting with scientific method, eight VISION SHIELD machines with POLY PROPYLENE identification system in blowroom lines and  Electronic yarn clearers with foreign fibre/contamination cleaning facility (eg. 'Siro' clearer or 'Quantum' Clearer).
We have Tandem cards (Double Carding) machine, which gives good quality of super carded and super combed yarn with very low tolerable objectionable classimate faults, which in turn gives more consistent and better fabric appearance. All yarn is 'Xorella' saturated steam conditioned for ensuring even moisture level at every layer of the yarn which gives better results during knitting and weaving.Samples from all lots of yarn are tested, knitted and dyed to ensure consistent and right quality before shipment to customers. 
Our yarn products are 100 % Cotton Combed Yarn,100 % Organic Yarn,100% Organic Yarn under fair trade and 100% cotton yarn under fair trade.

Our
                  Founder
		     When one visionary man set out, on his mission to fulfill his dream of the perfect fabric for the world, his passion gave birth to an enterprise called Bombay Rayon.
             The man was Mr. JD Agrawal. His enthusiasm for quality fabrics inspired him to bring innovations to Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited since its inception in 1986. The company has grown at an overwhelming pace, keeping up with the needs of the customers as well as stakeholders. With its entry into retail market and the global fashion export industry, Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited (or BRFL) has become the fastest growing company in the Indian Textile Industry. The culmination of a dream, this is just the beginning of a revolution in the Indian Fashion Market.
 
Our Founder Speaks: 
“At Bombay Rayon, we continue to lead the field by focusing on what we know best. Creating exclusive top-of-the-line garments and suitings & shirtings for those who love the very concept of dressing up. From our shirtings to our fabrics, to our formal wear and exclusive collections, when it comes to corporate performance and refreshing lifestyle, Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited has always been a leader.
 
Since 1986, Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited has been the name India relies on for clothing that fits the active Indian spirit. Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited provides apparels that are inspired by the five basic elements that make-up our atmosphere and the garments do perform. Exclusive construction details and only the finest fabrics ensure our patrons will be equipped to take on whatever challenge comes their way. I have always wanted our customers to head out in the adventure of their lives in the brand that has made living and lifestyle great for nearly two decades… Bombay Rayon.
 
I still remember the time when both my sons stepped onto the corridors of our manufacturing unit. The overwhelming sense of achievement that I witnessed on their faces then, continues to inspire me in walking that extra mile… just that now, it’s no more an ‘I’. What started as a small business enterprise in the mid eighties is now a powerhouse textile giant catering to the needs of people from across global parameters. Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited has not only instilled in its employees a never-ending drive to reach-out, but has also equipped their families with a sense of pride and achievement; such that no other can parallel. This in essence is our real accomplishment and Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited shall always live up to the intrinsic demands and expectations of India and the world.
 
Bombay Rayon’s product designs are all about being at ease in comfortable clothing with effortless style so our clientele never have to worry about what they’re wearing. At work or at your leisure, with the Bombay Rayon Fashions Limited tag, our patrons can never cease to enjoy the simple comfort of just being themselves. That’s a promise, which over time has transformed into a cherished legacy and a trusted assurance matched by none. 
 
Let me hereby reaffirm, this distinction will always be the hallmark of the brand that’s Bombay Rayon.”
