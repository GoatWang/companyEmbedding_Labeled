 SANYO CO.,LTD. utilizes its ability to coordinate as a dedicated merchant of steel pipes to contribute to society by supplying transport construction materials, landscaping materials, and other finished components. 
Not only do we provide roadway products such as large-scale pillars for road signs and materials for sound-proof wall materials, but we also provide epoxy-coated reinforcing steel bars and crime prevention security products.  

By providing a solution at every stage, from planning and proposals to processing, inspection, and delivery, we provide quality products that meet the needs of our clients. 

Based on years of knowledge and experience, we provide a variety of coated products, including electrostatic powder coating, to achieve a high level of rust prevention and environment beautification. 
We also stock roadside markers and curve mirror pillars for town road safety councils in order to ensure speedy response to any needs.  



【Main products】
Large-scale sign pillars 
 SANYO CO.,LTD. manufactures and sells large-scale marker pillars, regulatory marking pillars, and signal pillars for use by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, highway management companies, local municipalities, and town road safety councils. 
We also offer value added products including designs and coating matched to specific landscapes. 

Road marker and curve mirror pillars  
For rust prevention, pillars are finished with a molten zinc coating and, depending on customer needs, we will also apply a polyester resin finish using electrostatic powder coating. 
We also can treat curved pillars and base pillars. 
The polyester resin finish using electrostatic powder coating uses a coating made from a molecule-dense resin. The coating layer bonds well with base layers and provides superior anti-rust, rigidity, and climate resistance properties. 


Sound-proof wall materials 
Panels offered include our feature product, an integrated uniform panel, translucent panels that ensure sunlight, and reverse side-block panels that use a colored back panel to provide a consistent exterior look.  
We also provide services for support beam manufacturing, and pile foundation construction. 

Epoxy-coated reinforcing steel bars 
As a protective measure against chloride damage to reinforced concrete, we apply a 220±40μm coat of an epoxy resin with superior adhesiveness and corrosion resistance to protect rebars from corrosive elements. 
This process satisfies quality standards established by the Japanese Society of Engineers and is highly praised for its workability and cost effectiveness.
