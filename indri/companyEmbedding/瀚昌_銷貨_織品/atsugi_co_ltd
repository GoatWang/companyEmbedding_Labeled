High performance, weight saving, cost reduction, quality, environmental measures…
              There are so many improvement tasks for the forging  technology to accomplish sophisticated requirements.  In other word, it means that this technology  is so expected technology.

              Since its establishment in 1958, Kanto Industry Co., Ltd. has been steadily working on manufacturing of parts, focusing on parts for automobile industry. In order to meet the technological expectations of our clients, our company has created an integrated system of production encompassing forging, machining, and finishing. In 1995 we founded a Factory run by a joint corporation in Thailand. Also we acquired ISO 9001 certification in 2004 and ISO 14001 in 2008.

             For an engineer,  the more difficult target he has, the more challenge he takes. Machinery and  inspection machine made by ourselves show the proof of engineer’s challenge and  contribute the products quality.We shall continue our efforts to make our contribution to the future society by many technologies we have in our hands.
