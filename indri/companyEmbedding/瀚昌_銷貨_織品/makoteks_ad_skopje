Market democracy- let`s play together

The challenge is yours - publish your opinion,evaluation,analysis,remarks, or comment the events on the Macedonian market from your perspective 

An unusual week is behind us. Aweek, in politicview, that got the entire Macedonian public on its feet,starting from the higher state`s establishment down tothe ordinary people… Since

berzNIK 

archives, selectsand distributes the economic and stock exchange infor-mation published in the printed media, it could not resistthis week to the events that directly reflect on the eco-nomic market in the country. It is impossible to remainindifferent when you have been asked to change yourown name, as it is a thorn in the neighbor`s flash. Whatfor? Well, the whole public knows this, still it allows thefreedom to make conditions for our change of thename... even though the political countries that appealon world democracy are involved... I would state herewithout a doubt that in contrast to the recent unsuccess-ful efforts of the political structures, congratulations tothe Macedonian lions who after 10 humanitarian yearsgain their independence and they are recongnisedunder the constitutional name of the country, that isRepublic of Macedonia, within the InternationalAssociation of Lions.Contrary to this dimension of political conditioning,on the other hand, the events in our northern neighborsare completely opposite, where a new state is beingformed in the Balkan region, Kosovo declares indepen-dance... This is a indeed democracy, some people tohave two countries (if they feel like it) while others tohave their ancient name denied... These are simpledemocratic and political courses you need to follow,conditionally speaking, otherwise you will not beallowed to participate in the game... Well, we are on ourground now, out of the politics that more or less dictatesthe economic transactions... Especially, having in mindthat the Macedonian capital market has suffered due tothe events in Kosovo... We have been hearing the com-ments of the stock analysts for weeks that the investorsare reserved in terms of the movements caused follow-ing Kosovo`s declaration of independence... The reflex-ive recognition or rejection by the relevant political andeconomic forces is actually the first step, or news, thatwould put the status quo things in motion…Well, this is the particular week in which, besidesthe series of turbulent events, many positive economicevents happened that are important to the further devel-opment of the market… First of all, as the stockexchange analysts evaluated, we encountered drasticpositive leaps, therefore the trade volume is high, atleast in terms of the traded quantities, whereas a pricegrowth of certain stocks was recorded in the last twodays of the week, labeled by someone as the start ofthe bull...It could not have been expected some great stepahead in the previous week, hence the investors are notin a state of readiness... However, there were eventsthat marked the week and will leave a further mark onthe capital market in the future… For instance, a roundtable was held on the subject: The role of the custodi-an bank within the fully funded pension insurance inRepublic of Macedonia. An area of interest that empha-sizes inevitably, alongside with the development of thecapital market, the function of the banks as guardian ofthe property, as one of the new financial services withinthe modern financial trends. In order to introduce thisarea in details, MAPAS in cooperation with the USAID`sBusiness Environment Project, hired experts fromCroatia that has several years of experience in the fieldof private pension funds.Of course, a large attention was drawn in the publicto the controversy in relation to the Credit Bureau forIndebtedness of Physical Entities. An institution which isnot in favor of the Macedonian citizens considering theactual standard. No more living on credit. Despite theannouncements implying that the personal data will besubjected to inspection only upon the citizens consent,the opinions are still divided… The concerned parties,the physical and legal entities, believed that this will vio-late their rights to privacy and to personal data protec-tion, that is to say considering what king of data theBureau will have at its disposal, it might be easilyabused. In fact, the experiences of other countries indi-cate that the personal data is largely abused within theCredit Bureau.The week ended with most unordinary event, theawarding of the Oscar for Social Responsibility of theCompanies (OOP). Around 73 companies participatedin this project, while only 15 of them were nominated forthe award. This is a step ahead in relation to theimprovement of the companies` image. OOPbuilds upthe consumers` loyalty under the basis of ethic value,reduces the financial risks and improves the quality ofthe products and the services, increased the motivationand productivity among the employees and enhancesthe market performance in a way the necessarychanges can be implemented faster and consequent-ly… Asimple practice used years back by the devel-oped economic markets.The brokerage Euro Broker is presented in this edi-tion of

berzNIK 

, which recently started to provide invest-ment advices according to the market components…Namely, they underlined during the promotion: In future,the uninformed physical and legal entities, who are notfamiliar with the securities market and the investmentphilosophy, will not need to guide themselves upon theadvices by the quasi-experts, instead they can immedi-ately turn to the right place - the investment advice com-pany or the investment funds where the investmentadvisors work....Anyway, I think that a particular part of their advicewill be a challenge for you to publish your opinion, eval-uation, analysis, remarks, or to comment the events onthe Macedonian market from your perspective.The

berzNIK

O

ur access to accurate information, or inone word, to be in the right place at theright time, have always been and willalways be in interest of the direction of certainmovements in any segment of the social-eco-nomic community. It means, the accurate andforehanded information are usually the amplifierthat should initiate the acceleration in order toreach some level, to come to the goal, which issubject of the delivered information. What

berzNIK 

is trying to popularize is classified infor-mation that refer to the business community,delivered on time. Or, more precisely, we store,select, and electronically distribute to YOU - ourdear clients, the information that can be foundon different pages in different daily newspapers,and which reflect the business subjects and in acertain part present their positive or negativecomponents and characteristics that directly orindirectly affect the capital market.The race for tragic, financial, and politicalaffairs - as top news, is not our challenge. It istop news for us when you receive on time thereworded things about you, your company, andthe market - if you consider yourself to be a per-son of this profession. Furthermore, to hear theofficial stands, solutions, and decisions on thesystem procedures on time, but also to find outbeforehand about the gossips, which mightopen your eyes. In fact, we distribute to you allnews, both positive and negative, and youdecide what is in your favour, what could be use-ful for your further affirmation and presentation -again through the distributive service -

,the weekly review of events.Specifically in this direction, and in the inter-est of supporting the positive climate for attract-ing foreign investors in this country, especiallyfor attracting new foreign and domestic players,participants on the capital market, in this issue ofthe weekly review we have also given room forthe first International Fair for Tourism and theTourism Business Forum, which these daystakes place in Ohrid - an event at which webelieve many tourist and hotelier`s companies,as well as many associations from the wine pro-duction field, will have their promotion. Having inmind the dimensions of this fair event - also reg-istered in the World Tourism Organization, andthe step forward of the Government in this field- financial injection of a million euros, there is anopportunity many of them to increase the capitalwith shares` issues or multiply it preciselythrough the stock exchange transactions - tobecome trading potential on the MacedonianMarket.The numbers made last year also speakabout the fact that the Macedonian capital mar-ket in the second decade of its existence rapid-ly keeps pace with the stock exchanges from theregion and SEE. Atrue ascent. Aconclusion,which is confirmed also by the stock exchangeratios given in the Annual Statistical Bulletin ofthe Macedonian Stock Exchange, even thoughthere was a big correction and stagnation in thepenultimate months of the year. The totalturnover is increased for 34.45 percents com-pared to 2006, and the largest positive jump wasmade in the classical trading with increase ofeven 181.86 percents. The greatest turnoverwas made in October, and the largest participa-tion in it had Komercijalna banka with 26.40 per-cents. MBI recorded the largest growth in theregion - a jump of 109 percents. The biggestprice increase on the Official Market record theshares of RZ Inter - Transped - for 1,000.82 per-cents in December compared to January, whilethe biggest fall had the shares of Makoteks - for82.76 percents.After these numbers, you will agree, asmuch as they are trying to label our market as asmall one, it, however, is considered to be thekey player in the region, especially when talkingabout entry of big investments. Moreover, if weadd to this the analysts` assessments that lastyear all players on the stock exchange earned,making decisions will be easier… Here we canalso mention the investment funds - the emis-saries who will have to include most of the pop-ulation in the business trading as well, andwhich will also contribute for increase of thecompetition between the existing banking-finan-cial institutions in this country.I believe that

						THE 
						HISTORY OF THE MACEDONIAN TEXTILE INDUSTRY WITH A FOCUS 
						ON SHTIP


						  


Introduction- the Early Beginnings and 
						Developments Until 1945

						 

						The growth of the Macedonian textile sector underwent 
						diverse historical and economic phases. This industry is 
						among the oldest on the territory of Macedonia, and 
						passed through all the stages of development. At the end 
						of the 19th century, Macedonia was a 
						territory with numerous small towns with a developed 
						trade, especially in craftsmanship (zanaetchistvo). 
						The majority of the population lived in rural areas, 
						Macedonia characterized as an agricultural country, 
						where most of the inhabitants satisfied their needs 
						through own production of food. The introduction and the 
						further development of the textile industry in Macedonia 
						were mainly induced by the needs of the Ottoman army for 
						various kinds of clothing and uniforms.  Another reason 
						for the emerging of the textile sector was to satisfy 
						the needs of the citizens in the urban areas. An 
						important factor for the advancement of this industry at 
						that time was the developed farming, cattle breeding in 
						particular. (stocharstvo). 

						The first textile enterprises were established in the 
						1880’s in the villages in the region of Bitola – Dihovo, 
						Magarevo, Trnovo, and their main activity was production 
						of woolen products. Only a small number of cotton 
						products were produced in (zanaetciski) craftsmen 
						workshops. The growth of textiles in this region was 
						natural as Bitola, at that time also known as Manastir, 
						was an important economic and cultural center in the 
						European part of Turkey.[i] 
						At that time the owners and managers of the textile 
						industry were businessmen with sufficient capital to 
						invest their money in industrial production. These 
						companies showed good results and their business had a 
						bright perspective. Unfortunately, the Balkan wars and 
						the First World War had devastating results for this 
						industry. 

						One of the first textile companies in the territory of 
						Republic of Macedonia was the textile and knitting (trikotazna) 
						factory in the village Dihovo . The factory was built in 
						1883 and represented one of the largest textile 
						factories in the European part of the Ottoman Empire. 
						The investment in this factory was estimated to be 
						15.000 golden Turkish liras. Yet, this was a huge amount 
						to be invested by one person, so the owners established 
						a joint stock company akcionersko drustvo that 
						financed the building of the factory. They produced 
						mostly woolen products with modern production processes. 
						The company used mostly domestic wool. In order to 
						produce high-quality products they also imported wool 
						from England. The final products were sold in most of 
						the major cities in the region: Bitola, Thessalonica (Solun), 
						Skopje, Istanbul, Izmir (Smirna), Duras (Drach). The 
						factory was closed in 1915 when the Bulgarian army, in 
						control of Macedonia at the time, took the machinery to 
						the towns of Sliven and Gabrovo in Bulgaria. 

						At the end of 19th and beginning of 20th 
						century there were ten other textile workshops. 
						Unfortunately, they were all shut down and destroyed 
						during the First World War. Beside woolen products, 
						there was also production of cotton products. However, 
						this sector could not develop much in Macedonia at this 
						time because of high competition from the European 
						cotton producers. Another negative factor for the growth 
						of cotton production was the low purchasing power of the 
						Macedonian population. Only in the period between 1933 
						and 1940 the cotton producing industry grew more 
						significantly. 


						            In Macedonia the modern production in the 
						silk industry began at the end of the nineteenth 
						century. The main centers for silk cocoon (kozhurci) 
						were the regions of Gevgelija, Dojran, Strumica, and 
						Radovish. The first factory for processing silk cocoon (odmotacnica 
						na svileni kozurci) was established in 1894 in 
						Gevgelija. The factory was the property of the sultan 
						Hamid. The machinery was brought from Italy, and 
						assembled by Italian experts. At that time the employees 
						worked for 12 to 14 hours per day, and the total number 
						of employees was 180, all of them from Gevgelija. There 
						were also women among them. The factory shut down at the 
						beginning of the Balkan wars in 1912, and it was 
						destroyed in the First World War. This war had serious 
						consequences for the silk processing business (svilarstvoto). 
						Because they were very close to the military front many 
						inhabitants from the region of Gevgelija and Dojran 
						moved toward the inner parts of Macedonia. Looking for a 
						secure place to live, these people left their workshops 
						and began to work in other professions. Therefore, the 
						end result in the silk processing industry was similar 
						to the story of the woolen processing- failure. 


						At the end of First World War new economic conditions 
						were created. With the partition of Macedonia in 1912 
						confirmed at the Versailles in 1918, the economy 
						stagnated and the development of the textile industry in 
						what is today the Republic of Macedonia discontinued. 
						Part of the investments in this industry remained at the 
						other side of the new borders, and part of it was 
						destroyed in the war. The Macedonian textile industry 
						could not be revived and developed because of the 
						interests of strong competitors from Serbia, Croatia, 
						and Slovenia. As Macedonians in the Kingdom of 
						Yugoslavia were not even recognized as a nation, the 
						country renamed Vardarska Banovina, it was obvious that 
						the Macedonian industrial development was not a priority 
						for the Yugoslav rulers. In fact in the inter war period 
						only two small textile industrial companies were 
						renewed: “Sterjo Pikulis” in the village Magarevo, 
						producing cloth and laces (za shtofovi i gajtani) 
						and “Petar Lekikj” in Tetovo producing laces (gajtani). 
						In the period 1918-1940 there were 16 textile producing 
						companies established on the territory of Republic of 
						Macedonia. By the beginning of the Second World War only 
						12 companies were operational. Three shut down, while 
						one was just to be constructed before the war. Here is 
						the full list of these factories:


						1.                 
						
Factory for producing cloth and lace of 
						Sterjo Pikulis in Magarevo-Bitola region- established in 
						1890 as a craftsmen workshop (zanaetciska rabotilnica 
						za izrabotka na klashni i gajtani). During 
						the First World War it was destructed, and restored in 
						1924 with new machinery brought from Chemnitz, Germany. 
						In 1940 there were 24 employees, and the total output 
						was 150.000 meters of various types of woolen and cotton 
						cloth, and 15.000 kilos of lace. The factory worked in 
						two shifts. 


						2.                 
						
Factory for producing lace of Petar Lekikj 
						in Tetovo – established in 1905 in Skopje, but moved to 
						Tetovo in 1908. It was also destroyed in the First World 
						War and renovated afterwards with machinery brought from 
						Nierenberg-Germany. The number of employees fluctuated 
						between 8 and 17, and the output was 12.000 kilos 
						various types of lace. 


						3.                 
						
Enterprise for processing of cotton and 
						wool “Gligor Stamenov” based in Strumica. In the period 
						1918 to 1925 the enterprise functioned as workshop for 
						ginning cotton and wool. In 1925 it acquired machines 
						and began spinning and weaving of cotton increasing 
						production. The machinery was taken from a factory in 
						Banja Luka. At the beginning the number of employees was 
						five, while in 1940 it grew to eleven. 


						4.                 
						
Bitola Textile Industry (Bitolska 
						tekstilna industrija) was one of the first knitting[ii] 
						company (trikotazno pretprijatie) established in 
						1927. All of the machinery was new, bought in Germany, 
						except for the sewing machines that were brought from 
						the United States of America. At the beginning, the 
						production capacity was between 10.000 and 15.000 kilos 
						of final products, but later, in 1940 it the capacity 
						was increased and the output was 33, 380 kilos cloth 
						tricot and 5.080 dozens of specialized cloth - flannel (faneli). 
						The number of employees was between 25 and 30. The 
						factory purchased the raw materials such as cotton yarn 
						(pamucna pregja) from Czechoslovakia and Italy, 
						and wool from England and Greece. Only a small portion 
						was procured from the spinning mills in the Kingdom of 
						Yugoslavia such as those in Litija, Slovenia, or in Duga 
						Resa, Croatia.


						5.                 
						
Factory for producing tricot “Dijamant” 
						from Skopje – established in 1927. The factory’s total 
						output was 12.000 kilos of final products. The raw 
						material, yarn, was purchased from England, Austria, and 
						Belgium. The machinery was bought from Germany. The 
						products were sold in the Yugoslav markets, about 50% in 
						Serbia, 40% in Macedonia, and 10% in Croatia, and only a 
						few times a small portion in Greece. From 1927 to 1929 
						the number of employees was 33.


						6.                 
						
Textile Industry of the General Trade 
						Joint Stock Company (Tekstilna industrija na 
						Generalnoto trgovsko akcionersko drustvo) from 
						Skopje, built in 1931. The machinery was bought in 
						Chemnitz-Germany. At the beginning, the daily capacity 
						was 2.800 pairs of socks for men. The next year this 
						number increased to 5.000. In 1931 the capacity for 
						producing fabric for women’s clothing (zhenski shtof) 
						was between 300 and 400 meters per day, while in 1937 it 
						reached 1.000 meters per day. The department for 
						producing carpets (kilimarsko oddelenie) had a 
						capacity of producing 1.500 square meters of carpets per 
						year. The raw materials were imported from England and 
						Italy. The final products were sold in the Kingdom of 
						Yugoslavia, the carpets exported to Austria and the 
						Scandinavian countries. In the beginning the number of 
						employees was 70 while in 1936 it grew to 464. 



						7.                 
						
Factory for cotton cloth (Fabrikata za 
						pamucni tkaenini), Skopje, established in 1933. At first 
						this was a small enterprise.  In 1940 machinery was

						began. In that year the number of employees was 15.


						8.                 
						
Industrial Enterprise for the production

						tekstilni tkaenini od juta). In 1933 the owners of 
						the soap producing factory “Aero” from Skopje bought 10 
						used gins from Vranje, Southern Serbia. In 1935 they 
						bought 10 new machines from Germany, and in 1938 another 
						22 machines from Germany, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia. 
						Although they bought the machines for the needs of the 
						soap factory, later on they used them for producing 
						textiles as well. The raw materials were brought from 
						Poland, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia. The total output 
						was between 200.000 and 300.000 meters linen per year. 
						The products were sold on the domestic markets, 70% in 
						Macedonia, 25% in Kosovo and 5% in Southern Serbia. In 
						1939 the number of employees was 50, 15-male and 
						35-female. 


						9.

						1.500-2.000 kilos of cotton yarn, imported mainly from 
						Italy and Greece. The output was 45.000-50.00 meters of 
						various types of silk and cotton fibers. In 1940 the 
						factory had 18 workers.

Textile Factory (Tekstilna i 
						pozamanteriska fabrika) from Skopje established in 
						1931 as a textile workshop. In 1934 the factory was 
						expanded, and there were 18 employees. This number later 
						on reached 30 employees. The products were sold in 
						Macedonia-60%, Kosovo -20%, Eastern Serbia-10%, and 
						Bosnia-10%. The yarn was imported from Czechoslovakia, 
						Italy, and Germany (90%), and 10% from Slovenia. The 
						factory had 67 machines, purchased from Czechoslovakia, 
						Germany, and Belgium. Ten of the machines were bought 
						used from Yugoslavia. In 1940 the number of employees 
						was 52.


						14.              
						
The Weaving workshop (Tkaacka 
						rabotilnica) “Jug”, from Skopje, established in 1939 
						with 18 machines. The gins were brought from 
						Switzerland, the rest of the machinery from Germany. 
						Basic raw material was artificial silk imported from 
						Germany and Italy, and the factory consumed 10.000 kilos 
						per year. The number of employees was 22. 


						15.              
						
Factory for ginning silk (Fabrika za 
						odmotuvanje na svila) from Gevgelija – established 
						in 1938. The machinery was purchased from Greece. About 
						18.000 kilos dry cocoon were ginned per year. While the 
						final products were sold on the Yugoslav market, the 
						number of employees in 1940 was 60. 


						16.              
						
Textile Factory (Tekstilna industrija) 
						“Armagan”, from Skopje established in 1941. The 
						machinery was bought in Germany, England, and 
						Czechoslovakia. The capacity was 420.000 meters of 
						various types of cotton cloth per year (for one shift).
						

						 

						The initial development of the Macedonian textile 
						industry indicates two major phases: the first phase 
						1918-1933 is characterized with a slower 
						development-only five enterprises were established and 
						two of them shut down. The second phase (1933-1940) 
						indicates more intensive development, with nine 
						established enterprises. Out of these established 
						enterprises, seven were based in Skopje, an economic and 
						administrative center which attracted domestic and 
						foreign capital. 

						The companies in the Macedonian textile sector at that 
						time did: ginning of silk, weaving of cloth made of 
						cotton, wool and artificial silk, knitting, and else. 
						The most important industrial facilities were the 
						weaving mills of cotton products. Before the war the 
						textile companies were small enterprises. There was a 
						disproportion between the capacities of the spinning and 
						weaving mills. The only enterprise that owned a spinning 
						mill was the company for processing wool and cotton in 
						Strumica. This situation was partly due to the high 
						costs of investments needed for founding spinning mills. 
						In addition, the return on investment was higher on 
						weaving mills. Investors in the past as today were 
						interested only in profits and for there is no surprise 
						that for a period of time only investments in weaving 
						mills were being made.

						The late appearance of the textile industry in the 
						interwar period was due to the lack of capital, 
						industrial energy, and skilled workers. Some foreign 
						companies offered cotton and silk yarn for a lower price 
						than those offered to their domestic markets, with a 
						payment period of one to six months. An important thing 
						to be mentioned is that most of the Macedonian 
						industrial machines were bought second-hand from the 
						economically more developed countries – Croatia, 
						Czechoslovakia, and Germany. These machines were old, 
						and in some cases the amortization was over 50%. This 
						resulted in lower productivity rates and the employment 
						of more work force. In 1938 the first company that 
						worked with 2, and later with 3-4 gins was “Tulbend” 
						from Skopje. 

						The total capital invested in the textile industry in 
						fixed assets – land, buildings, and machines at the end 
						of 1940 was 17.454.000 Yugoslav dinars (approximately 
						400,000 US dollars at that time or 4,000,000 US dollars 
						today when calculating the amount using a GDP deflator[iii]), 
						or 3.5% of the total investment in industry and mining. 
						In 83.4% of the companies more than 10.297.000 dinars 
						(234,000 US $) were invested, while in the other 16.6% 
						of companies, 7.157.000 dinars (163,000 US $) were 
						invested. The textile industry took the fourth place by 
						investments, after the food, electric distribution, and 
						tobacco industry. In 1939 the Macedonian textile sector 
						employed 434 people, or 5% of the industrial employment.[iv] 
						The wages were very low, until 1936 the minimum wage not 
						even specified. In 1937 the minimum wage was fixed to 2 
						dinars per hour (five American dollar cents), but the 
						supply of workers was so high that even this wage was 
						decreased. 

						The Macedonian textile industry went through a 
						continuous growth in the inter war period. The 
						production especially increased in the second half of 
						this period. At that time new industrial enterprises 
						were established – “Tulbend” in Skopje, the textile 
						factory “Vardar” also in Skopje, the textile factory 
						Skopje, etc. In this period most of the products were 
						made of cotton, although production of woolen items was 
						also kept.  The total output of the textile industry in 
						1940 equaled to 32.250.000 dinars, where 4.500.000 were 
						woolen products, or 13.83% of the total production of 
						textile sector. 

						            
						



Textile and Apparel Industries in 
						Macedonia During SFR Yugoslavia and Today


						 


						Investment


						 

						With the five year planning program the SFRY government 
						has decided to change the Macedonian economy from 
						primarily craftsmanship to industry. Therefore 
						investment in several key sectors was made: production 
						of electricity, metallurgy, chemistry industry, tobacco 
						industry, leather industry, food processing and textile. 
						According to the five year plan most investments were 
						made in ‘production of electricity - 36,6%; than textile 
						industry - 16,7% and nonmetal industry with 12,6% of 
						total investment in the industry sector in the period 
						between 1947-1953’[v]. 
						In textile industry in Macedonia two huge capacities 
						were built: Teteks (in Tetovo) and Makedonka (in Shtip). 
						The former planned to produce woolen yarn and fabrics 
						and cloths; the later was planned to spin cotton yarn 
						and weave cotton cloth. This provided for balanced 
						textile production, which in the previous period was 
						disproportionate.  The investment highly contributed to 
						increase of employment and thus if in 1947 the textile 
						sector employed just 393 people (5,3% of total 
						employment in the whole industry)[vi], 
						in 1953, after the capacities in Shtip and Tetovo were 
						built, the employment in the textile sector amounted to 
						9850 people or 32%[vii] 
						of total industrial employment.   


						 


						Output


						 


						In socialist times, the textile and the apparel 
						industries in Macedonia grew continuously in the period 
						1946 to 1989. The growth was particularly strong between 
						1960 and 1970, the index rising from 35 to 100. 


						 

 

						 


						Although the growth in the industrial production in 
						these industries and especially in the textiles sector 
						slowed down in the 1980’s the positive trend lasted 
						until 1989. In real numbers, the production of yarn grew 
						from 
10007 tons in 1965, to 18562 in 1974 
						and 22021 in 1984.


						 

 

						 

						Similarly, the production of cloth grew from 783,000 m2 
						in 1939 to 2,493,000 in 1953, and the 26,594,000 in 1965 
						to the whopping 43,782,000 in 1974 and the fascinating
						

						63,727,000 in 1984.

						 

 


						 


						            The production of apparel grew from 175,000 
						meters in 1946, to 444,000 in 1953, 1,341,000 in 1965, 
						4,020,000 in 1974, to 12,776,000 in 1984.

						 

 

						 

						With the year 1990, the sharp decline of this industry 
						began. The decrease was small in the production of 
						apparel 
10,451,000 m2 in 1994 compared to 

						12,776,000 in 1984 m2, but more significant in the 
						textile sector. The difference in the produced yarn in 
						tons in 

						1984 – 22021, and 1994 – 7583 was threefold while the 
						difference in the produced cloth was also substantial; 
						63,727,000 m2 were made in 1984 while only 27,548,000 in 
						1994. 

						The decline in the sector apparel production lasted 
						until 1996, stabilizing in the following years, until 
						2000. In the same time, the decline in the production of 
						textiles and fabrics was continuous. The following 
						figure evidences the decline.

						 

 

						 

						The downfall of these sectors however, continued after 
						2000 being more dramatic for the textile sector.


						 


						 

						 

						Figure: Index of Apparel and Textile Production 
						1998-2003


 

						In the period before 1989, the share of the Macedonian 
						production of textiles and apparel in the Yugoslav 
						production also grew. The Macedonian production of cloth 
						grew from 2% in 1946 to 15% of the Yugoslav share in 
						1985. In 1985, it was bigger than the production of 
						Bosnia and Herzegovina and not much smaller than that of 
						Serbia; 52703000 in Macedonia and 7294600 in Serbia. As 
						far as Macedonian share of the apparel production in the 
						total Yugoslav output is concerned, it grew from 4% in 
						1955 to 12% in 1975 to fall somewhat in 1985 to 8%.
						

						 

						The decline of the Macedonian apparel and textile 
						industry after 1989 is evident if compared to the total 
						Macedonian industry. While in 1990, the share of the 
						production of textile 
						fibers and fabric industry in the total Macedonian 
						industry was 6.3 % in the 2000, it was 2.3, while the 
						share of the production of the industry for production 
						of finished textile products dropped from 10.5% in 1990, 
						to 6% in 2000. Therefore, in 1990, the relation of both 
						sub- sectors in 1990 was 1:1.4 and in 2000, it had 
						changed into 1:2.6. In 2003, the gap has widened to 
						1:3.5.

						Within the total industrial production (index of 
						industrial production), the textile and apparel

						manufacture of textiles with 4.3 % and 

						manufacture of apparel

						According to the Background Study on Macedonia[x] 
						the share of garment industry in Macedonian economy in 
						2002 was 11,25 % from GDP, 0,65% production of textile 
						materials and 10,60% production of items for clothes, 
						for further processing and for drying of fur. (See Table 
						17) The ministry of Economy estimates that it 

						participates with 8.84% in the total number of companies 
						in the economy, and contributing to the GDP with over 
						10%.[xi]


						 


						VALUE OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL PRODUCTION


						 

						The value of textile and apparel production put in USD 
						has risen constantly from 8,053 million of USD in 1954 
						through 25,386 million of USD in 1959, 50,543 million of 
						USD in 1964, 66,680 million of USD in 1969 and reached 
						an imposing 258,121 million of USD in 1974. Than, after 
						the decline in 1979 (167,883 million of USD) the overall 
						value of textile and apparel production has reached its 
						absolute peak in 1984 with tremendous 463,615 million of 
						USD.[xii] 
						Afterwards the value of textile and apparel production 
						has fallen sharply and “stabilized” in both 1989 and 
						1994 with 134,378 million of USD and 141,097 million of 
						USD respectively. Then the value of production has 
						increased again with 226,713 million of USD in 1999 and 
						187,086 million of USD in 2002.  


						 

 


						 


						 


						EMPLOYMENT


						 

						These industries also witness decrease in the number of 
						employees. 
As it can be seen 
						from Figures 10 and 11, the number of workers in these 
						industries had continuously declined in the 1990’s, 
						quite sharply in the textile sector, more modestly in 
						the apparel production. 


						 

						FIGURE 10



 

 

						FIGURE 11

 

 

						The biggest growth in employment in textile and apparel 
						sector has occurred in course of 70’s and 80’s. The 
						number of employees in both sector increased from 17.500 
						in 1969, through 26.200 in 1974, 39778 in 1979 and 
						51.450 in 1984 to 64.361 in 1989 when the transformation 
						process has began. On the other hand, there were 40.999
employed persons in the manufacture of textiles 
						and apparel in 1994, 31.056 in 1999 and 26.317 in 2002. 
						According to official data by the Ministry of Economy in 
						2004 there were 36639 employees in the textile and 
						apparel sector.[xiii] 
						Out of those 5,059 are workers in the textile, and 
						31,580 in the apparel sector. Despite the decrease in 
						the number of workers which might have had much to do 
						with the over-employment practices during socialist 
						times, and of the industrial production, the textile and 
						the apparel producing industry are one of the most 
						significant employment sectors in the country, as 8.6% 
						of the registered employed persons work in these 
						sectors.[xiv] 
						This 
						industry is a major employer with abut 30 % of the total 
						number of employees in the industrial sector.[xv]


						Employment wise it is by far the biggest industrial 
						sector. Thus, in the second industrial branch 
						manufacture of food products and beverages, there are 
						16938 workers while in the third, the production of 
						metal products there are 9,590 employees.[xvi]

						 



						SALARIES IN TEXTILE AND APPAREL INDUSTRY[xvii]

						 

						The combined monthly average salary in both textile and 
						apparel industry amounted to 21,6 USD in 1954 and 
						afterwards it has risen to 36,3 USD in 1959 and 85,3 USD 
						in 1964. Then it fell to 51, 5 USD in 1969 and has 
						increased again in 1974 and 1979 to 106,9 USD and 198,5 
						respectively. After renewed decline in 1984 (96 USD[xviii]) 
						the average wage in the textile and apparel sector grew 
						to a “record” of 543 USD in 1989.[xix] 
						After the dissolution of Yugoslavia the officially 
						registered salaries in the Macedonian textile and 
						apparel industry amounted to 120 USD in 1994, 106,2 in 
						1999 and 94,6 USD in 2002. 


						 


 

						 




						 




						 


						EXPORT


						 

						Apparel and textile production is an important export 
						oriented sector. Within the 
						Macedonia’s exports to the EU, in 2003, by far most 
						exported products were exactly the textile products 
						(46.4%),).[xx]


						The share of textile and apparel in all Macedonian 
						exports amounted to 25,5% in 1990 (textile products - 
						6,8%, apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur -18,7%) and 
						than it fall to 15,3% in 1995 (textile products – 5,9%, 
						apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur -9,4%). Afterwards 
						the share of textile and apparel in overall Macedonian 
						exports has started to rise and reached 26,8% in 2000 
						(textile products - 2,8%, apparel, dressing and dyeing 
						of fur - 24%), 33,2% in 2002 (textile products – 3,2%, 
						apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur - 30%) and 34,2% in 
						2003 (textile products – 3,1%, apparel, dressing and 
						dyeing of fur -31,1%). In this period, the share of 
						textile products in the overall Macedonian exports has 
						declined constantly while the share of apparel products 
						was growing continuously. The total value of exports of 
						textile and apparel products amounted to 269,85 million 
						of USD in 1990 (textile products – 42.5 million USD, 
						apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur – 227,3 million of 
						USD) As with the share of the overall exports the 1995 
						proved to be a critical year in regard to value of the 
						export, the combined value amounted to 122,5 million USD 
						(textile products – 26,3 million USD, apparel, dressing 
						and dyeing of fur – 96,2 million of USD). The situation 
						has improved in the following years and in 2000 the 
						overall value of exports of textile and apparel products 
						was 357,9 million USD (textile products – 46,3 million 
						USD, apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur – 311,6 million 
						of USD), than 371,1 million USD in 2002 (textile 
						products – 40,4 million USD, apparel, dressing and 
						dyeing of fur – 330,7 million of USD) and finally 453,4 
						million USD in 2003 (textile products - 46,5 million USD, 
						apparel, dressing and dyeing of fur - 406,9 million of 
						USD).[xxi] 
						

						On the list of major Macedonian export products in the 
						first quarter of 2003 according to the 
highest rate in 
						the total export value, apparel products are four of the 
						top 10, women blouses leading the list. (Table 12) This 
						basically means that from the products Macedonia 
						exports, the most money it gets is for apparel items. 
						The biggest export markets in 2003 were: Germany 38%, 
						Greece 15%, USD 8%, Italy 7%, Holland 6%, Belgium 5,5%, 
						UK 5%, France 4%, Slovenia 2% and other countries 9,5%. 
						In 2004 apparel and textile exports contributed to 32% 
						of the total exports of Macedonia. (29%, and 3 % 
						respectively) One can conclude that despite the 1990’s 
						and early 2000’s decline, the textile and apparel 
						production is the biggest economic sector in Macedonia. 
						What is important for our study is that today, a high 
						concentration of Macedonian medium and the large 
						companies (twenty) is present in the town of Stip and 
						that about 15% of the country’s apparel producers are 
						located in Stip.

						 




						 



 



The History of Textiles and Apparel in 
						Shtip: “Astibo” and “Makedonka”


						  

						Following the Second World War Macedonia underwent a 
						period of rapid industrialization. From the pre-war 
						7,371 persons employed in the industrial sector, the 
						numbers grew to 13,634 in 1947, 20,540 in 1950, 36,653 
						in 1956, and 53,959 in 1960. 



						[xxii]The 
						cotton processing “Makedonka” together with the producer 
						of woolen products “Todor Cipovski Merdzhan (Teteks)” 
						from Tetovo, and the silk factory “Noncha Kamishova” 
						from Veles, was considered as a basis of the development 
						of the Macedonian textile industry.[xxiii] 
						The textile factory “Pamuchna Industrija Makedonka", was 
						conceived of and formally speaking founded in 1950.  
						Based on a business plan by engineer Pavel Domicelj of 
						the Slovenian based Tekstil Projekt in July 1950, 
						the construction of a colossal object began on an empty 
						field called “Ezhova Poljana [the field of hedgehogs] 
						next to the road Shtip-Kochani.[xxiv] 
						The construction was finished in April of 1952, when 
						production of textile fibers was initiated in the 
						spinning plant with 120 persons.[xxv] 
						Most of the machines were new, bought from the UK based 
						company Platt. 

						 


						Picture: The colossal object of the factory Makedonka 
						built in the early 1950’s.


						  

						The compound was thoroughly planned with wardrobes, 
						showers, a restaurant and a shop, an ambulance, 
						laboratories and administrative offices. At that time it 
						was one of the biggest and most modern factories in the 
						whole SFR Yugoslavia.[xxvi] 
						As a matter of fact, in 1954 the GDP of “Makedonka” was 
						40 % of the Shtip region (Ovchepolska okolija), and 54 % 
						of this regions’ industry). A year later, in 1955, 
						Makedonka’s share of the GDP was 65% and 80% of the GDP 
						of the industry in this region.[xxvii] 
						The “Makedonka” complex included a restaurant serving 
						one free meak for the employees per day, three discount 
						stores, and a library.[xxviii] 
						For the needs of its workers, the factory built 
						additionally a complex of apartment buildings so that in 
						1962, “Makedonka” owned 171 two - room flats, and 120 
						one - room apartments. “Makedonka” gave credits with no 
						interests to children of employees that went to 
						universities. Credits were available for other purposes 
						as well.[xxix] 
						Since 1970 Makedonka also had a camp on the shores of 
						the Ohrid Lake, a summer resort on the mountain 
						Plachkovica, and a hotel at lake Dojran. The workers 
						using the hotels paid symbolic prices, the factory 
						essentially subsidizing the resorts.[xxx] 
						A KUD “Makedonka” [an artist/performers group] was also 
						founded in 1965 with around 11 performances per year, 
						2-3 concerts in the town and 8-10 elsewhere. They won 
						numerous awards, diplomas and plaques.[xxxi]


						 

						 

						Picture: The plaque indicating the beginning of work in 
						Makedonka.

						 


						 

						 

						In the early stages “Makedonka” lacked educated 
						personnel. In 1955, when the factory had a total of 
						1.224 workers, only 14 had “high qualifications/skills”, 
						124 had basic qualifications/skills, and 448 were 
						semi-skilled, while 638 had no skills/qualifications.[xxxii] 
						Thus, for the needs of the factory, in 1954 a 
						Industrisko-tehnichko uchilishte and in 1955 a 
						Tekstilno-tehnichko uchilishte were opened. In 1960 
						these schools were closed; instead a Uchilishen Centar 
						za Obrazovanie na Kadri od Tekstilna Struka was opened.[xxxiii] 
						Also, within the Rabotnichki Univerzitet specialized 
						technical courses were organized for the education of 
						workers. In 1955, about 530 workers followed these 
						courses.[xxxiv] 
						Within “Makedonka” in 1959 a Centar za Struchno 
						Obrazovanie na rabotnicite was opened aimed at further 
						education and specialization of the workers. The factory 
						also gave various stipends (29 in total for 1956, 82 in 
						1961, for example) to students from secondary and 
						vocational schools, as well as university students.

						The development of the company was not only marked by an 
						increase of size but also by the introduction of new 
						production lines. In 1955, the weaving plant (‘tkaechnica’) 
						and in 1957, the enrichment capacity (‘oblagorodilnica-dorabotuvachki 
						kapaciteti’) sections were added to the spinning mill, 
						while in 1957, another section was integrated in the 
						factory, the ‘vigonj predilnica’- (kind of a spinning 
						mill). Thus, the company grew from a spinning mill unit 
						to a cotton fiber processing (prerabotka na pamuchni 
						tkaenini) company. “Makedonka” produced three different 
						kind of products: yarn, raw fabrics, and final products 
						(‘predivo, surova tkaenina, gotov proizvod’). Its design 
						unit grew so that in 1971, 400 different patterns and 
						designs were made, while at the beginning years they 
						could not make more than 30. In 1983 “Makedonka” built 
						the factory for the production of jeans, buying the 
						license to produce Wrangler from the US.[xxxv]

						“Makedonka” profited from the fact that at that time 
						cotton was grown in the Shtip region and all around the 
						country.[xxxvi] 
						Although the data shown here documents the production 
						since 1939, cotton was produced in this country for a 
						long time. There is evidence that Shtip, had many cotton 
						fields at the end of the XIX century.[xxxvii] 
						During Yugoslav times Macedonia alone supplied 90% of 
						the cotton consumption in the federation. As can 
						be observed from Table 21 cotton was produced in 
						Macedonia in great quantities.[xxxviii] 

						The peak in the cotton production was in the early 70’s.[xxxix]

						The significance of this company was so high that the 
						supreme Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito visited it in 
						May 1959.  The factory products were sold all over 
						former Yugoslavia and were exhibited at industry fairs 
						in Zagreb and Leskovac. “Makedonka” had partners 
						throughout the country such as “Ateks”, “Srbijateks”, 
						Tekstilpromet”(Zagreb), “Slavonijateks” (Osijek), 
						“Tekstil” and “Veletekstil” from Ljubljana, “Stoteks” 
						from Kraljevo, “Nishpromet” from Nish, and “Trgotekstil” 
						and “Skopski Magazin” from Skopje, as well as 
						representative offices in seven cities of former 
						Yugoslavia: Belgrade, Kraljevo, Zagreb, Sarajevo, 
						Ljubljana, Shtip, Novi Sad.[xl]. 
						At that time, 80% of the production was contract 
						manufacturing.[xli] 
						The deals were made through intermediaries such as, 
						“Makoteks” from Skopje and “Tekstil” from Zagreb. A 
						small part of the deals were done through “Jugotekstil” 
						(Ljubljana), “Centrotekstil” Belgrade. Thus, as early as 
						1957 the company began exporting. In 1959, one of the 
						successful years, the company exported half of its 
						production; about 30 % of the export production was sold 
						to Burma, and 19 % to Western Germany. 



						[xlii] 
						While in early 70’s, its export was worth more than 3 
						million US dollars, the main role seems to have been 
						inner-Yugoslav trade. In 1977 the factory exported 20% 
						of its production. In 1981 “Makedonka” exported for the 
						amount of 227 million dinars, while in the first months 
						of 1982 the exports were worth 320 million dinars, out 
						of which 263 million in the Western markets.[xliii]  
						In 1983 “Makedonka” exported 3.5 million USD.[xliv]


						In the 1970’s the idea for joining forces with other 
						textile and apparel companies was realized and 
						“Makedonka” become part of the “Inteks” conglomerate.[xlv] 
						Indeed, “Makedonka”, invested in the establishment of 
						the following factories: the weaving plants “Maleshevka” 
						from Berovo, “Ovche Pole” from Sveti Nikole, the apparel 
						producers, “Partizanka” from Delchevo, “Alkoloid” from 
						Berovo, and the weaving plant and manufacturer of 
						terrycloth, towels, beach towels, bedding, and 
						bathrobes, “Frotirka” from Delchevo. All three, Berovo, 
						Delchevo and Sveti Nikole are very small mountainous 
						towns located in the Eastern region of Macedonia. The 
						idea was that these factories would economically use the 
						cloth produced by “Makedonka.”[xlvi] 
						The apparel producer “Astibo” also started out as a 
						production line of “Makedonka”. In fact, the textile 
						industry of Shtip was pertinent to development of other 
						industrial capacities in the region.

						In the first year of its existence, “Makedonka” employed 
						a total of 500 persons[xlvii] 
						growing continuously.  In 1955, the factory had already 
						grown to a total of 1224 workers, while in 1961 the 
						number of employed persons in “Makedonka” grew to 2786.[xlviii] 
						Most of the workers were young, only 14 % being older 
						than 40. At that stage, by a State command, many 
						villagers from Shtip area were made to work in the 
						textile factory. Hence, in 1955, the factory grew to a 
						total of 1.224 workers, while in the early 1960’s the 
						number of employed persons in “Makedonka” grew to 2.786.[xlix] 
						In mid 1960’s it employed 3.070 workers.[l] 
						In 1970 there were 3.500 employees, 80 of which with 
						university degrees, 188 highly skilled, 862 skilled, 648 
						semi-qualified, and 1.281 with no skills, 268 high 
						school graduates, 83 primary school graduates etc.[li] 
						The number grew to 3700 persons in 1973 and 4160 in 
						1977.[lii] 
						In 1979 it employed 4.300 people and produced 19 million 
						meters of raw and 17 million meters of finishing 
						fabrics.[liii] 
						The maximum number of workers registered in “Makedonka” 
						was 5900, in 1987.[liv] 
						Since then the number continued to decrease until the 
						liquidation of the company in 2001.

						 The Story of Astibo


  

						Having “Makedonka” produce fabrics and cloth, it came 
						natural that an apparel company is also founded.[lv] 
						Thus, “Astibo” was founded in 1962 as a department 
						within “Makedonka” with 119 employees and grew quickly.[lvi] 
						At the beginning, the company was situated in the 
						emptied depots of the Tobacco company “Monopol.” In 1967 
						it had 320 employees and was transformed as an 
						autonomous socialist entity, a so-called ‘OOZT’ (BOAL in 
						English, OOZT stands for basic organization of 
						associated labor), Mihail Nedkov becoming the director. 
						At this time there was a world recession, which hit the 
						textile industry, and Makedonka’s production units 
						outside of Shtip, in other towns of Eastern Macedonia, 
						as well as “Astibo” got an autonomous status. “Astibo” 
						at that time was called OOZT “Konfekcija Makedonka Shtip.” 
						Only in 1978 however, with the organizational 
						reorganization of the BOALS “Mashka Programa-Mladost”, “Solidarnost”, 
						“Zhenska Programa”, “Egzotik”, “Detska Programa-Pinki”, 
						“Galaksija”, “Opshtestvena Ishrana”, and “Astibo Komerc”, 
						“Astibo” became a separate company a “rabotna 
						organizacija modna konfekcija” (Work Organisation for 
						Fashion) Astibo.[lvii] 
						Astibo’s core business was the design, production and 
						distribution of men’s, women’s and children’s ready-made 
						garments.

						In 1972, “Astibo” had about 2.000 employed persons. 
						Following a policy recommendation to open branches in 
						underdeveloped regions of the country in order to absorb 
						a high number of unemployed persons there “Astibo” 
						founded production units in a number of towns mainly in 
						the Eastern part of Macedonia such as Makedonski Brod, “Brodchanka”, 
						Probishtip, “Proteks”, Sveti Nikole, “Astibo”-Sveti 
						Nikole, Kriva Palanka, “Palanchanka”. Radovish, “Radovishanka”, 
						Vinica, “Vinichanka”, Kratovo, “Kratovchanka” and 
						Makedonska Kamenica, “Vera Jocikj.”[lviii] 
						Many of these units opened in the Eastern regions of 
						Macedonia like “Vera Jocikj” were established as a 
						result of the communist leadership decision to employ 
						the spouses of the men working in the mine pits in 
						Eastern Macedonia and despite the lack of interest in 
						this endeavor by “Astibo” itself.[lix] 
						Taking into account all workers in Shtip and elsewhere 
						there were a total of 5.500 workers employed in Astibo.
						

						A decade after it was established the conglomerate 
						became the biggest producer of light (casual) apparel in 
						all Yugoslavia and one of the top five producers of 
						apparel overall, with 60 own shops throughout the 
						country.[lx] 
						At this time Astibo began exporting its production 
						making contracts with foreign buyers, “manufacturing 
						pre-ordered items already paid by the partners abroad.”[lxi] 
						Exactly in this period 1973-1980, “production of textile 
						and garment sharply decreased in the old industrial 
						regions, which underwent a process of 
						‘de-industrialization’, while peripheral regions in 
						South and East, with or without textile tradition, were 
						chosen for new investment in textile and garment 
						production.”[lxii] 
						By 1978 “Astibo” exported half of its production.[lxiii] 
						In 1983 “Astibo” exported goods worth 2.4 million USD.
						



						[lxiv] 
						The following year the exports were worth 4 million USD.[lxv] 
						In the first eight months of 1985 “Astibo” exported 5.3 
						million USD.[lxvi]


						The factory grew and in 1975 it had 3200 employees.[lxvii] 
						In the early 1980’s “Astibo” had 3.700 workers and was 
						well known throughout former Yugoslavia.[lxviii] 
						“Astibo” grew so much that it had a health care 
						institution (zdavstvena stanica), a restaurant, and a 
						day care center for the employee’s children (detska 
						ustanova).[lxix]. 
						How well organized the factory was at that time we can 
						see by the fact that the health care institution had a 
						unit for gynecological treatment offering among others 
						counseling about the use of contraceptives, a lab, a 
						pediatrician, and a dentist unit. 



						[lxx] 
						The company became an additional important element for 
						the town’s life as it built apartments for the workers, 
						had its own restaurant, and kindergarten for the 
						children of the employees. In total, the whole complex 
						of buildings of “Astibo” was 35.000 square meters. The 
						company also had a “B” category hotel “Garni” (6 rooms, 
						3 doubles and 3 singles) in the center of Shtip, built 
						in 1978. In the 1970’s “Astibo” provided 1 million 
						Yugoslav dinars for stipends and credits for the studies 
						of the children of the employees.[lxxi]

						 

						 The 
						Decline and the Fall of Makedonka


						  

						Although decorated with a special medal by Tito in 1977, 
						“Makedonka” had a number of problems that lead to its 
						decline in the 1980’s and collapse a decade later.[lxxii] 
						As “Makedonka” produced basic fabrics from cotton much 
						of it was produced by local agricultural workers.[lxxiii] 
						The problems for “Makedonka” began when from 1973 
						onwards, as you can see from the figure bellow a 
						significant drop in the cotton production occurred in 
						Macedonia. Starting with the 1970’s the factory 
						increasingly relied on the import of basic materials 
						such as cotton.[lxxiv] 
						What were the reasons for the decrease of cotton 
						production in Macedonia? In the early 70’s there was 
						huge optimism regarding the future of Macedonian cotton 
						industry. The dams in Vodoca and Tulija were built 
						providing a complete system for irrigation necessary for 
						increasing the production of cotton crops while also 50 
						harvester machines/combines (kombajni) have been bought 
						form USSR for agricultural cooperatives (ZIK’s) from 
						various parts of the republic.[lxxv] 
						In fact, an increase in the production of cotton crops 
						was necessary since almost the then entire production 
						was used by “Strumicanka” and “Makedonka”. However, the 
						optimism was short lived and a decrease of the 
						production of cotton occurred. Despite the improvement 
						of some of the factors influencing production such as 
						irrigation the production of cotton was highly 
						exhausting, the growing up period long, and the profits 
						very low in comparison to required work. Additionally, 
						part of the problem was that the mentioned 50 combines 
						were at the disposal of the ZIK’s but not of the 
						individual producers (who were forced to grow their 
						crops manually) of cotton who were dominant in cotton 
						sector. There were also not enough machines for 
						separating the cotton seeds from the fibers (masini za 
						oddeluvanje na vlakno i seme). 

						Moreover, on the world markets of cotton in the early 
						1970’s some major producers such as Australia emerged 
						while others such as China, India and Brazil had a 
						significant increase in their yield lowering the prices 
						of this commodity. When in the 1970’s China began 
						integrating its economy to the global markets the 
						supplies of cotton and in that regard also the stocks of 
						cotton grew significantly and this automatically 
						affected the world cotton prizes, and led to their drop.[lxxvi] 
						Thus, as there was a significant drop of the price on 
						world market of cotton in the early 70’s, in Macedonia 
						it became commercially more viable to import cotton from 
						socialist partners in Egypt or the USSR instead of 
						producing its own one. In the 1980’s almost all the 
						cotton used in “Makedonka” was imported.[lxxvii]  
						In fact, “Makedonka” exported fabrics to the Eastern 
						block in exchange of cotton. In the first five months of 
						1982 the exports to the former socialist block worth 56 
						million dinars were used to obtain cotton.[lxxviii] 
						In the mid 1980’s about 90% of the cotton used for 
						production were imported.

						Negotiating Issues


						  


						As a result, the Macedonian farmers decreased the 
						production of cotton and gradually switched to 
						cultivating other more profitable agricultural products. 
						In the course of time the new facilities (dams, system 
						of irrigation) and equipment were used for purposes of 
						growing ranogradinarski products. Today the Institute 
						for Agriculture in Strumica (Institut za juzni 
						zemjodelski kulturi) is practically the sole place in 
						Macedonia where cotton is still being grown and for 
						scientifically purposes only.[lxxx]


						 
 

					 Figure: Cotton Production in Macedonia 1974-1997


					 




					 

As the production decreased after 
					1973, less regions were producing cotton so that by 1992 
					Veles produced 7, Kavadarci 12, Gevgelija 4, and Valandovo (Strumica 
					region) 6 tons, while from 1995 to 1997 Valandovo was the 
					only region where cotton was produced in the country. In 
					1998 cotton was not anymore grown anywhere in Macedonia.
					

					Another of the core problems was the over-employment in the 
					factory as a result of party influence on the economy. The 
					massive industrialization in the post war period was 
					undertaken without much concern over the actual need of 
					employed persons. More persons were employed in the new 
					factories than needed, and the productivity was lower than 
					the optimal one.[lxxxi] 
					Already in the early 1960’s for example the economic logic 
					for establishing weaving plants and apparel producers using 
					the “Makedonka” fabrics proved wrong as the satellite 
					factories in Berovo, Sveti Nikole, and Delchevo, began 
					making losses. Yet these and other plants, derogatorily 
					referred to as “politichki fabriki [political factories]” 
					had to be opened in order to absorb the high number of 
					unemployed persons in this region.[lxxxii] 
					The yearly losses of the Berovo factory for 1965 were 
					estimated at 50 million Yugoslav dinars. The second factor 
					influencing the economic decline of the factory was bad 
					management. The third factor causing the decline of the 
					“Makedonka” is located in the Yugoslav economic difficulties 
					throughout the 1980’s and the early 1990’s and the collapse 
					of the market caused by the wars of the dissolution of the 
					federal republic. In the 1980’s the company was not making 
					profits but the system had to pay the wages of the 
					workers. To pay the salaries the management obtained funds 
					through loans from various banks, even from the mining 
					company Sasa from Makedonska Kamenica. The oldest two 
					production facilities, the spinning and the weaving one (predilnica 
					and tkaechnica) made losses and a possible solution was to 
					split the factory into smaller units. However, the senior 
					management led by the manager Panche Brashnarov in the 
					period 1989-1992 refused any changes of the structure of 
					“Makedonka” even if they would have helped the economically 
					healthier parts of the factory survive the pending 
					transformation easier.[lxxxiii]

					The wars and the disintegration of Yugoslavia negatively 
					affected the working of the factory, as in the early 1990’s 
					not only there was a collapse of the Yugoslav market for 
					which the company was positioned but more importantly, 
					“Makedonka” could not realize its financial claims from 
					firms throughout the former Yugoslavia.[lxxxiv] 
					In 1992 Delcho Lazarov became the new manager (generalen 
					director) and he was ready to start active bankruptcy 
					proceeding in cooperation with the government. According to 
					the liquidation program prepared by Macedonian government, 
					the same year, the two most problematic units the spinning 
					and weaving plants were supposed to be liquidated and sold 
					to interested parties. 


					  


					The Decline: Parts of Makedonka Today


					 

 As 
					“Makedonka” continued to make financial losses in the early 
					1990’s, it was included in the special restructuring program 
					of 25 biggest loss - making companies in the country.[lxxxv] 
					The government aimed at a reorganization of the company and 
					tackling the over-employment issue through a program of the 
					World Bank. The funds provided by this program as a let off 
					money for the over-employed in the "Makedonka" amounted to 
					US$ 1.8 million. 


[lxxxvi] 
					

					Zivko Tolevski, the union leader of “Makedonka”, did not 
					agree with this solution, and organized a new strike. There 
					was a commotion and the process of liquidation was postponed 
					while production went on for a while despite losses. The 
					salaries were paid by loans for which the collateral 
					provided were parts of the non-essential property of “Makedonka.” 
					Such a situation was unsustainable and the workers were 
					forced to take a leave and receive 70% of their wages.
					



					 



					 

					The laying off was conducted in two phases, so that in March 
					1995 in the Employment Bureau in Shtip a financial 
					compensation and layoff money to a second group of 650 
					dismissed workers  from "Makedonka" were paid. The 650 
					workers have been declared technological surplus in "Makedonka".[lxxxvii] 
					In October, 1995, the government decided to initiate the 
					process of privatization.  According to a decision of the 
					Government Commission for Transformation of Public 
					Enterprises, which have considered the reports of the 
					process to date of transformation of 13 (of 25) 
					low-producing enterprises, seven such firms received the 
					“go-ahead” for privatization, one of them being "Makedonka" 
					from Stip.[lxxxviii] 
					The following year, the Agency for Privatization decided to 
					transfer the debts of “Makedonka” to eight separate legal 
					entities which were evolved from the separate departments of 
					the factory. However, the eight new entities also made 
					losses and continued with poor economic performance.

					Since the reorganized separate entities did not work well in 
					the following years either, in 2000 the government initiated 
					a bankruptcy procedure. The winner of the international 
					tender was Zoran Krstevski, an Italian with a Macedonian 
					background. He planned to reorganize the factory step by 
					step, to replace the old machines by new Italian ones and to 
					reemploy “Makedonka” workers. He wanted the legal 
					proceedings of buying the company completed as soon as 
					possible but was faced with organized protests by the 
					workers who did not even allow him to enter the premises of 
					the factories he was to buy. Upon such a welcome Mr. 
					Krstevski decided not to invest in “Makedonka” and the first 
					attempt of privatization failed. Later on there were also 
					unsuccessful efforts to privatize the company through the 
					model of manager-workers buyout.[lxxxix] 
					


					 



					 

					Although privatization seemed as the most viable solution by 
					2001 none of the units of “Makedonka” was yet privatized, 
					due to as some maintained, “the government's undefined 
					attitude towards companies that have been making losses and 
					which should have been sold or closed long ago as required 
					by international monetary experts have prevailed.”[xc] 
					The main problem with the privatization of “Makedonka” was 
					the fact that since the changes of the political system and 
					the beginning of the decline of the company the machines, 
					the other equipment and the facilities have not been 
					maintained regularly and any buyer had to make huge 
					investments to repair them and restart production.[xci] 
					By the end of the year the government decided to liquidate 
					“Makedonka” selling it piece by piece. At the time of 
					liquidation, in 12/2001 the company had 3.009 workers 
					registered. 


					 


					By 2003, one by one the new legal entities springing from 
					the different Makedonka’s units had been privatized as

					owners are rented out. Politeks, a company producing 
					terrycloth, towels, beach towels, bedding, and bathrobes 
					(frotir), is owned by Slave Ivanovski and is situated in a 
					small space within former AD Tkajacnica. In June this year 
					the company was liqudated and is offered for sale together 
					with the machines and the premises. At the moment there are 
					20 machines bought in the 1970’s from which part of can be 
					renovated and used for production. Before the transformation 
					254 persons worked in this unit of AD Tkaechnica. When 
					Mr.Ivanovski bought “Politeks” there were 100 workers of 
					which only five were employed by the new owner. The workers 
					hope that the new owner of “AD Jeans” the selling of which 
					is scheduled for 6th of September 2005, will take 
					interest in “Politeks” and buy it too.[xcvi]

					A big part of the “AD Tkaechnica” of about 6000 m2 was 
					rented out on a ten year lease to the Greek company “Proteks 
					As.”[xcvii] 
					This company’s primary activity is the production of wool 
					yarn from raw wool, intended for carpet production. 
					According to the manager Petar Dimitrovski currently the 
					number of employees is 5, but after one year of preparation 
					they are planning to start with the production in the summer 
					and employ another 50 people, former “Makedonka” workers.[xcviii] 
					For the beginning of production, they plan to import raw 
					material, wool from Greece, but also to buy such from 
					Macedonia in the future. The installed capacity production 
					is about 50/60 tones per month and the plan is that the 
					entire production is sold at foreign markets, UK mainly, and 
					Germany and Denmark. The machines for production are twenty 
					years old, made in Italy and Belgium, moved to “Makedonka’ 
					from the other company of the owner based in Larissa. The 
					maintaining of the machines and the transport is provided by 
					the Greek owner.  By the end of August “Proteks As” started 
					with trial production of wool yarn, employing 10 people.[xcix]


					Yet another part of AD “Tkaechnica” was bought by the Shtip 
					apparel producer “EAM”. According to the owner of AD 
					Tkaenini, Slave Ivanovski it is most profitable to rent or 
					sell parts of this former “Makedonka” unit.[c] 
					He would like to make “Makedonka” a duty free zone and to 
					attract foreign investors. Another idea he has is to turn 
					the “Makedonka” complex into a university. Although he has 
					different ideas what to do with this property he is sure not 
					interested in opening an apparel producing unit there 
					fearing cheap Chinese imports. 

					In the AD Jeans & Denim there are 2 textile companies that 
					produce today: “Textil Invest Denim” (with 140 workers) 
					producing cloth for a Turkish company, and ”Tekstil Invest 
					Jeans” producing lohnveredelung clothes. The apparel 
					producer “Mikoteks” rents out the former AD “Postelnina.” In 
					the former AD Transport i Spedicija the apparel company 
					“Kit-Go” is situated, while the shoe producer “Bargala” has 
					rented the former AD Predilnica. The apparel producer 
					“Maksima” rents out the  former AD Opshtestveni Standardi. 
					The company that bought AD Opshtestveni Standardi, “Preciz” 
					is now also the owner of the hotel ”Makedonka” on the lake 
					Dojran; the kindergarten, the restaurant; and three shops. 
					Furthermore, in October 2004, Blagoja Temelkovski became new 
					owner of the former “AD ROS” establishing a new company ECM 
					to run this unit.[ci] 
					Their primary activity is reparation and maintenance of 
					electric machines transformers and production of mechanical 
					parts. The new owner inherited the old machines, and until 
					now, did not invest in buying new and modern machines. 
					Finally, Riste Micev, is the owner of the former AD 
					Energetika does not want to rent the locality because this 
					unit supplies energy to the other firms and makes profit out 
					of it.[cii]


					            During the liquidation of “Makedonka” much of 
					the equipment was disbanded and stolen. During the 
					privatization process when the trustee was Dimitar Adzhiev, 
					eight of the newer machines were relocated to the textile 
					factory “Astibo” from Berovo.  There is no document 
					testifying if the machines were sold or rented out.[ciii] 
					Although the police was informed no investigation was 
					initiated. Many people from Shtip know that part of the 
					machines from “Makedonka” are in Berovo it is a public 
					secret. The other machines from “Makedonka” were left to the 
					new owners to decide what to do with. Some of them were 
					quite new. In 1997 in the “oblagoroduvanje/ finishing” unit 
					4 new machines were bought from Switzerland

worth around million Euros. These 
					were up to date models and no other company in Macedonia had 
					such machines. The new owners of AD “Tkaechnica” however, 
					did not find much use of these machines and disbanded them 
					and sold them as scrap metal in Macedonia and Bulgaria. In 
					the “AD 
					Predilnica”,
					
the faith of the machines was no 
					different, bulldozers coming in destroying them before being 
					sold as useless metal. 

					sostojbata ne bila poinakva. 

					Only the machines from “AD Ros” survived the transition and 
					are still used for production. 


					 


					 


					 


The Decline and the Transformation of 
					Astibo


 


					 

					In the early 1980’s “Astibo” had problems with sales on the 
					domestic markets. As payments from wholesale retailers were 
					regulated to be made within a time framework of 90 days the 
					rampant Yugoslav inflation at that time depreciated much of 
					the money received at the actual time of payment. Therefore, 
					the management decided to step up exports instead.[civ] 
					So once in the early 1980’s “Astibo” faced financial 
					difficulties it began working on the basis of the 
					“lohnveredelung” production. This job was easy to do as the 
					foreign partners, mainly German ones, provided all the 
					necessary materials and “Astibo” had to do only stitching 
					and sewing. Unlike the 1970’s “Astibo” now did not need 
					anymore to develop own products and sell them to foreign 
					partners; neither it had to purchase the materials for 
					manufacturing.[cv] 
					Already at that time about 60% of the Yugoslav apparel 
					producers worked with contract manufacturing producing 
					pre-ordered apparel by Western companies,.[cvi] 
					In 1982 about 85% of all the “Astibo” exports were with the 
					lohnveredelung system. Exports amounted to 40% of all 
					production, and were worth 1.2 million USD, 80% of which 
					made on the Western markets. 



					[cvii] 
					To facilitate the process in April 1985 “Astibo” becomes 
					part of the “Inteks” conglomerate.[cviii]


					Meanwhile, the number of workers of “Astibo” grew to the 
					record number of 4800 in 1987.[cix]

					At this time 80% of the production was exported. By 1989, 
					“Astibo” had grown into an independent business operating 
					seven independent factories on a single site which, during 
					the 1990s, before the company ran into financial 
					difficulties, produced an estimated 2.5 million finished 
					garments per year. At that time, over 90% of production was 
					lohnveredelung-work/contract manufacturing exported to 
					Western Europe (including Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark 
					and Belgium) and the USA. The own production was sold 
					through the chain 28 retail stores throughout former 
					Yugoslavia. In general, “Astibo” was a relatively successful 
					company before the collapse of the old system. 

					After the dissolution of Yugoslavia in February 1991, in 
					independent Macedonia, the units outside of Shtip became 
					independent firms while “Astibo” became a joint stockholding 
					company (Akcionersko Drushtvo).[cx] 
					In the period of transition the management founded a number 
					of new limited liability companies (drushtva so ogranichena 
					odgovornost), such as “Astimpeks”, “Astiprom”, “Astigros”, 
					“Astibo-turs”, and “Astibilans”. A number of factors lead to 
					Astibo’s collapse in the 1990’s:  one of the most important 
					related to the regional turbulences and the wars of Yugoslav 
					succession which disrupted trade contacts with Western 
					buyers of apparel. “Astibo” also could not realize its 
					financial claims from firms throughout the former 
					Yugoslavia.[cxi] 
					On the other hand, over-employment was a great problem as 
					the company had way too many employees than needed in the 
					1990’s.[cxii] 
					Over-employment was a burden of the past, due to the massive 
					employing of youth in the 1970’s. At that time the 
					management boasted that “we will hire new employees because 
					we have plenty of orders…what will happen when there will be 
					no more orders- we will think about this when such times 
					come.”[cxiii] 
					The management was not much concerned about long terms 
					effects of employing huge amounts of workers. In the late 
					1970’s and early 1980’s the company faced a negative trend 
					and began accumulating debt.[cxiv]

					If during socialist times the issue could be put aside 
					following the changes of the political system the problems 
					came into surface. The ratio between workers and 
					administration was not helping efficient work either, as for 
					example, in the end of the 1990’s out of the 2.000 workers, 
					up to 700 were employed in the non-manufacturing section of 
					the company.[cxv] 
					In addition, bad management decisions and surplus capacity 
					also influenced the break down of the profitable business 
					and led to the company’s insolvency.[cxvi] 
					In the second half of the 1990’s, “Astibo” had run up 30 
					million euros’ debt to the state institutions and various 
					private firms while the contributions for the social and 
					health insurance had not been paid for a number of years.[cxvii]


					Losing the Yugoslav markets in the early 1990’s the factory 
					unsuccessfully attempted to enter the Western markets 
					selling its own brand. According to Branko Georgiev, deputy 
					manager (zamenik director) of TLM Canda and former director 
					of “Astibo” although the company registered a brand of its 
					own in Germany, “Astibo-De” it failed to find partners to 
					buy their products. The lack of good contacts contributed to 
					the fall of this initiative. As Mr.Georgiev put it “it is 
					difficult to ‘conquer’ Western markets, we did not have the 
					right person in Germany and failed, that it is how it works 
					in the so-called open markets.”[cxviii] 
					The economic difficulties of “Astibo” led the government to 
					initiate in April 1994 a transformation of the company by 
					founding a Council for transformation, and preparing a 
					program of action. The then general director Mr.Panche  
					Nasev, together  with his  associates,  unsuccessfully 
					negotiated with the Government the possibilities for the  
					current managing  team of  "Astibo" to buy the majority 
					shares.[cxix]


					The company continued to make losses from 1995 onwards. In 
					1997, the company’s value was estimated at 14 million 
					Deutschmarks, but the question how to privatize the company 
					remained as the workers were against managerial buyout and 
					organized strikes to assert their opinion. Only in May 2002 
					the government consulting the management of the company 
					decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings in “Astibo”. The 
					company was liquidated in a speedy procedure on 10th 
					of July 2002 and a tender was called. At this time Astibo 
					had 2.056 workers in the following units: (the apparel 
					factories are bolded).

					 At the time of the sale, “Astibo” was estimated by the 
					government to be worth 
					4,000,000 million Euros much less than the first assessment 
					of value. Characteristically, in the 1990’s the value and 
					the price of the Macedonian public companies offered for 
					sale decreased as the time passed and the privatization was 
					kept postponed. The loss making enterprises not only made 
					losses but also their assets suffered depreciation, so also 
					“Astibo”.  The winner of the the tender was Mr. Kocho Mocan 
					who was to buy the company for 2.125.000 Euros. He, however, 
					failed to pay the money in the legal timeframe and the 
					tender and the sale were cancelled. In the end of 2002, a 
					new tender was opened. There were no contractual conditions 
					of sale concerning re-employment of workers or future 
					investment in the plant in either of the tenders. The only 
					criterion for the selection of a purchaser was the price 
					offered for the assets. In addition, the government covered 
					the unpaid social contributions and paid severance pay to 
					the laid off workers, depending on the amount years in 
					service. The debts to the different parties were to be paid 
					by the proceeds from the sale of the company.[cxxii] 
					The company was bought by a consortium of nine companies 
					which paid 1.704.000 Euros. Each member of the consortium 
					paid a share according to the size of the objects bought, 
					the sum ranging from 

					110 000 
to 

					280 000 
Euros.[cxxiii]

					maker “Zhito-Leb.”[cxxiv]

 

 



					The Situation in the Apparel and Textiles Production in 
					Shtip Today


					 


					What is the situation in the textiles and apparel sector in 
					Shtip today?  Let us start with the basic question, how many 
					such producers exist nowadays? It was very difficult to 
					ascertain how many textile and apparel enterprises are there 
					in Shtip. In conversations, people from Shtip often claim 
					that there are 70 to 80 “konfekcii” (apparel producers), 100 
					even, but this number showed to be highly exaggerated. In 
					fact CRPM was able to identified only 58 apparel and textile 
					producers in the town of Shtip. This number might not be 
					absolutely correct as some firms, especially small ones, 
					work outside of the system, while others might have gone 
					bankrupt by now (Viteks) but this number can be considered 
					quite reliable under current circumstances. See the full 
					list of the textile and apparel producers from the town at 
					the end of the paper Table A.[cxxv] 
					Interestingly only 3 apparel producers have newly built 
					facilities: Vivendi, Albatros and Vabo; while many use 
					buildings of former socially owned enterprises (SOE). 
					Shtipko for instance is situated in facilities of former SOE 
					Progres – factory for metal products, Mavis works in an old 
					building of the tobacco company “Jugotutun”, Angroteks, 
					Gracija, MK Vera Mond, Shtipteks, and MK Briteks are 
					situated in depots of the former SOE “Nova Trgovija”, Beas-S 
					is situated in “Metalna.” We mentioned the companies that 
					work in the facilities of Astibo and Makedonka. Furthermore, 
					Stilteks, Anateks, and Tomas stil are located in private 
					houses, Nana in a shopping center (old SOE) while Longurov 
					works in a depot of “Makpromet.” Thirteen companies are 
					located in the premises of Astibo and Makedonka. The 
					machines of the apparel producers are typically being 
					serviced by former technicians from “Makedonka” and “Astibo” 
					only a handful companies actually employing a person 
					responsible for this activity. Most of the machines are 
					usually bought from Turkey, and are YUKI type made in Japan.[cxxvi]



					 


					Picture Apparel Production Line


					 

					In the mentioned 58 companies there are 5610 workers which 
					imply that the percentage of persons employed in the apparel 
					and textiles sectors within the Shtip economy is quite high 
					(about 45% of the Shtip employed). If one considers that 
					there are a number of persons from Shtip that work in 
					industries that are related to the apparel and textile 
					sectors such as transport and logistics, catering for the 
					workers, etc. it is easy to the significance of the sectors 
					on the Shtip’s economy. Moreover, Shtip is the biggest 
					center of apparel and textile production in Macedonia. It 
					has more workers employed in these sectors than Skopje with 
					3851 workers, Tetovo with 3563, Gevgelija 2985, Bitola with 
					2541 and Strumica with 2316.[cxxvii]

					Apparel and textile production is in Shtip companies very 
					much focused upon “outward processing production" as only 
					one (EAM) has its own production marketed through own export 
					channels, while 2 (Tomas Stil and 
					Stilteks, small firms with 5 employees sewing pants) have 
					own products for sale at the domestic markets. Additionally, 
					a number of companies produce a small share of their 
					products for domestic markets, or for own export: Gracija 
					(with about 5% own production) Mond (10%) Beas-s 20%, 
					Briteks 20% Milano/Modena 40%, Zen/Vivendi, 20% and Sthipko 
					30%. 

					A vast majority of Shtip apparel and textile producers 
					manufacture “light 
					apparel (casual)” such as 
					shirts, blouses, t-shirts, etc. production, that demands 
					very little fixed investments and therefore is vulnerable to 
					market shifts and Asian competition with much cheaper labor 
					costs. A smaller number of producers (11) such as: Anateks, 
					Kit-Go, Starteks, Beas-s, Star-teks, Shtipko, Do-na, 
					Stilteks, Ziziteks, Makteks, and Galija manufacture only or 
					predominantly jackets, coats and other more sophisticated 
					semi-heavy and “heavy 
					apparel (tailored)”. 
					This production is less exposed to market vulnerability due 
					to higher transport costs, needs more skilled labor, and 
					more capital investment. Zen-Vivendi and Mond, too produce 
					heavy and semi-heavy apparel, but only in addition to light 
					textiles which is still their dominant activity. 

					A number of Shtip based companies produce a small share of 
					their products for domestic markets, or for own export: 
					Gracija (with about 5% own production) Mond (10%) Beas-s 
					20%, Briteks 20% Milano/Modena 40%, Zen/Vivendi, 20% and 
					Sthipko 30%. 
. This leaves the industry in Shtip 
					lagging behind the world trend in designing and branding 
					which is a new economic activity everywhere in the region 
					from Serbia (Nikola’s, MONA, St George etc.), through 
					Bulgaria (few companies produce under own brand for domestic 
					market only: Daphne, Odeta, Albena Style and etc.) to Turkey 
					(Little big, Mavi jeans, Tac and etc.) and Romania (where 
					the government through investments stimulated the industry 
					to produce their own collections for the domestic market and 
					for export such as Xandra and Anrolf). Shtip has few value 
					added products and currently does mostly ‘sewing and 
					stitching’. Most of the companies are small and mid-size and 
					the workers are skilled in simple cut and make techniques 
					needed for the production of “light clothes”.


					 


					 


					 



The Losers of the Transformation


					  

					The clear loser of the transformation of the Shtip textile 
					and apparel sectors are the workers in these industries. 
					While the owners and the managers of the apparel companies 
					enjoy better live their fortunes have not been as bright as 
					those in the new and quickly developing branches of these 
					sectors, such as logistics and intermediaries. The winners 
					of the transformation are those managers and sector leaders 
					who have invested in the most valued added type of 
					activities including marketing, logistics and transport.

					Mihajlo Nikolovski[cxxviii] 
					worked as a tailor during socialist times, starting from 
					1973. He graduated from a two-year technical school for 
					tailors and worked in “Astibo” from 1973 to 2002. He has had 
					numerous awards in the communism: he was twice “Yearly 
					Udarnik[employee of the year]”, twice “Monthly Udarnik”, 
					also receiving the “1st May” Award from the trade union. 
					During the 1980’s he earned about 350 euros per month and 
					bought an apartment of 58 square meters with a credit from 
					the local bank. His wife worked as a tailor as well, 
					employed since 1972 with a similar salary. With their 
					earnings they could cover all of the life expenses and went 
					frequently on holidays. The most visited destination for 
					them was Dojran, and they never went outside the state. They 
					had both time and finances for partying, restaurants, etc. 
					Mihajlo was satisfied from the public health system. His 
					mother was assistant chef in a state restaurant and his 
					father was a policeman. It was easy for them to get a credit 
					from the banks. Mihajlo is very satisfied with the political 
					system at that time and thinks that the inter-ethnic 
					relations and the security situation were stable. He has had 
					no “obstacles in the communist system” and believes that he 
					could have easily planed for the future, due to the 
					prosperous economic circumstances. He was satisfied with the 
					relationship employer-employee in the communist system. The 
					unions were very strong and it was difficult for the 
					companies to make someone redundant. 

					 Today, Mihajlo is a tailor in a private apparel producing 
					company. His spouse works in another company from the same 
					sector. His daughter was born in the early 1970’s and is 
					married today, while his son was born in the late 1970’s. 
					His daughter is a graduate from the Faculty for Economics in 
					Skopje, and his son is a graduate from the secondary textile 
					school in Shtip unemployed for eight years now. Mihajlo 
					nowadays has a monthly salary of 10000 MKD while his wife 
					has a monthly salary of 12000 MKD. The family has worse 
					living standards in comparison to before and has problems 
					with the covering of all the life expenses. In the 
					supermarkets they shop basic products only, primarily food. 
					They spend very little on cloth, and the main parameter for 
					his buying decisions is the price not the country of 
					production. Mihajlo. Dimitrov describes the family 
					perspectives as uncertain and not very promising. Today, 
					they rarely go on holidays, and when they do it is usually 
					in Ohrid and never outside Macedonia. His daughter currently 
					lives in Skopje in apartment with her husband, and his son 
					lives with the parents in Shtip. He has had problems to meet 
					all the educational expenses for his daughter due to the 
					limited family finances. His working hours are from 07.00 in 
					the morning to 15.00 in the afternoon. Although he still has 
					his old friends, he does not meet with them as frequently as 
					before. His son plans to migrate outside of Shtip and 
					possibly outside of Macedonia in search for employment.  The 
					interviewee was dissatisfied with the political situation in 
					Macedonia today. The same is true about his opinion for the 
					security situation in the country; he argues that he does 
					not feel as safe as before. He believes that the 
					inter-ethnic relations in the country are very unstable and 
					unpredictable. Furthermore, he feels general discontent 
					towards all of the state institutions and the judicial 
					systems.  

					While Mihajlo, a tailor has a difficult life Andon 
					Mihajlovski[cxxix] 
					a manager of apparel producing company lives not much 
					better. He has graduated in 1991 from the secondary-economic 
					school in Shtip, but he has no university education. His 
					father was a manager in communist times, with a nice salary. 
					They could have easily received a loan for a house, and his 
					monthly salary was around 500 euros. Andon’s mother was a 
					clerk in a bank, and had with an average monthly salary of 
					400 euros. The family used to go on vacations pretty often, 
					the most notable locations visited being Ohrid, Greece and 
					the Adriatic Sea. All the family members had state health 
					insurance. The family had a car, Lada at first, and Zastava 
					101 later on. Today they have apparel and a transporting 
					company. Andon has a spouse and two children his wife being 
					the director of the transportation firm. They have annual 
					profit of about 10 thousand euros and Andon complains that 
					the expenses of the business have been perpetually 
					increasing in the last few years. Nevertheless, he satisfied 
					with the profit, which leaves the lack of free time their 
					only inconvenience at the moment. . His family lives in the 
					house he inherited from his father since they are not yet in 
					a position to build a new one. The family does not go on 
					holidays frequently; they prefer the weekend trips instead. 
					Most of the times Andon’s family goes for holidays to Ohrid, 
					and rarely in Greece. With his earnings, he is able to meet 
					all of the expenses for the children, primarily education, 
					food and clothing. Currently he drives Fiat Punto from 2000 
					and that’s the only car the family possesses. 

					Marko and Jovanka Tomovski are a couple in their late 60’s. 
					Jovanka is a former worker of “Astibo” while her husband 
					used to work in the public administration. Both agreed that 
					before the transformation the salaries were quite good.[cxxx] 
					They have built their house just saving money from their 
					wages. One salary they used for living while the other they 
					used to pay for the construction of their home. Every summer 
					they went on holidays, once they were in Romania they felt 
					like Americans, rich and powerful. Ohrid lake, Bulgarian 
					Black Sea Cost, or the near by Dojran were regular on their 
					summer list of locations to spend their break. In the late 
					1970’s they also bought a car, the classical Volkswagen. 
					Everything was much better organized in socialist times 
					according to the Tomovski couple, “Astibo” had a 
					kindergarten for our daughter, we ate at the restaurant, and 
					those who had no living dwelling were given credits, and so 
					on. Their nostalgia for the good old times is confirmed by 
					the difficult live they have today, with expensive prices 
					and low pensions. 

					Even worse is the story of the former “Makedonka” worker 
					Milancho Manev, who donated blood 130 times helping others 
					in difficult times. However, this summer he could not find a 
					single soul ready to help him pay his debt to the water 
					supply public enterprise.[cxxxi] 
					To pay back the debt Milancho had to do public work on the 
					behalf of this enterprise. He complains that these are the 
					times when there is no job available. Similar situation 
					happened to Slobodan Mishikj, long time employee of the 
					Shtip printing house “Ilinden.” Slobodan had to work in the 
					public swimming pool all summer for a daily fee of 60 to 80 
					denars (1 to 1.3 Euros) and for the Electric Supply Company 
					in order to pay his debts for the electricity bill. In Shtip, 
					about hundred citizens worked this summer in public 
					enterprises to pay back their bills. The faith of the former 
					goalkeeper of “FC Bregalnica” Stojan Stojanov, 51, is also 
					disturbing.[cxxxii] 
					Born in a village in a near to Shtip region Stojan’s parents 
					left the rice field in Kochani and came to work in “Makedonka.” 
					Stojan and his wife also worked in this company, although he 
					is more known as a football player. Both of them got laid 
					off in 1999, she after 33 years of experience, and he with 
					28. They have three daughters, one of them a student in 
					Bulgaria. Stojan’s spouse got a job in a private apparel 
					producer. Her salary is what they live on. According to him, 
					most of the laid of “Makedonka” workers have a difficult 
					life nowadays. A number of workers from the liquidated SOE’s 
					in Shtip have organized themselves in an informal 
					association pressuring the government to help them find 
					jobs. Stojan comments that life is very difficult, “the 
					state officials do not care if you have or not have money, 
					they take home appliances instead, if we do not make now we 
					shall undertake radical measures, because our is not a life 
					worth living.”[cxxxiii]


					 


					 



The Big Winners of the Transformation


					 Logistics and Transport 


					 


					 

					To export their final product to foreign markets apparel 
					producers need a clearance from the custom authorities. In 
					order to get a custom clearance one needs a bank guarantee 
					of 5,000,000 MKD (about 83,000 euros) certifying financial 
					liability. This is a job of shpedicja (a custom clearance 
					house- sluzhba za carinsko deklariranje) and there are 27 of 
					them in Shtip with 300 employed persons.  Only three apparel 
					producers have own shpedicii, Albatros, Mavis, and Asteks, 
					the rest paying other shpedicii for the service. The biggest 
					10 shpedicii in Shtip are: Birkart, Canda, Fershped, 
					Makoshped, Kamilshped, Montanashped, Bakshped, Visashped, 
					Inteksshped and Asteksshped. Besides these there are about 
					20 smaller shpedicii. In this segment of the market in Shtip 
					Birkard has a dominant position. Birkard, works with 80 
					apparel companies in total, 30 suppliers from Shtip, and 50 
					retailers based in West Europe. The biggest apparel 
					companies from Stip that Birkart cooperates with are Beas, 
					Briteks, Elena (Labod), Eskada, Mont trejd, Vivendi and V&E. 
					Besides providing custom clearances the main activities of 
					Birkart are the transport of finished products, work with 
					CAD and CAM systems, and final logistic and products 
					preparing for the final clients. Working on the transport of 
					finished goods Birkard manages 60 vehicles, that belong to 
					other Macedonian transport companies (from Stip, mainly). 
					For the transporting activities Birkart charges 5 % 
					provision. 

					Many Shtip apparel producers use the logistic services of 
					Birkart for the transport of their final products to Western 
					markets. Birkart combines orders from several apparel 
					producers and transports their goods. One truck can take 
					between 17-20,000 light apparel or 10,000 light apparel and 
					5,000 heavy apparel items. Having no large depots to keep 
					larger quantities of their products, Shtip apparel producers 
					typically make small series of about 5,000 items for export 
					which are immediately forwarded to retailers in Europe. On 
					the way back to Macedonia Birkart transports various kinds 
					of commercial products not necessarily related to the 
					textiles and apparel industry. Each week about 30 trucks 
					transport goods to Western Europe. This equals a minimum of 
					500,000 pieces, so that Birkart alone is moving 25 million 
					pieces? If we take an average of 1,500 pieces per worker 
					(see remark up), then about 16,-17,000 workers would be 
					needed to produce this. The company also owns a customs 
					depot (carinski sklad) of 1000 m2, where it does custom 
					clearance for the apparel producers. In any case this 
					company is very important trend setter because besides 
					Birkart, there is only one other logistics center in Shtip, 
					the Canda International Germany branch office Textile 
					Logistic Makedonija (TLM). It is worth mentioning that at 
					the moment these are the only logistic centers in all 
					Macedonia.


					Birkard, dominates the logistics in the Macedonian clothing 
					sector. It works with 80 apparel companies in total, 30 
					suppliers from Shtip, and 50 retailers based in West Europe. 
					Besides providing custom clearances the main activities of 
					Birkart are the transport of finished products, work with 
					CAD and CAM systems, and final logistic and products 
					preparing for the final clients. Working on the transport of 
					finished goods Birkart manages 60 vehicles, that belong to 
					other Macedonian transport companies (from Stip, mainly). 
					The company also owns a customs depot (carinski sklad) with 
					around 3,000 sq. meters, to handle up to 300,000 pieces, 
					where it does custom clearance for the apparel producers.  
					They provide services like labeling of clothes, packaging, 
					sorting and they prepare all paper work for the final 
					transport and export to European markets. 

					A close company to Birkart is “New Trend Center for Textile 
					Technology” founded in the beginning of the year as a joint 
					venture between “Zmaj Promet”, and E-biz. “New Trend” is a 
					completely modernized European looking company. The offices 
					are fully equipped with modern computers, and software to 
					automatically adjust designs to different sizes. Trajan 
					Angelov is the manager of Birkart and co-owner of Zmaj 
					Promet. It is not difficult to confuse the three companies 
					since the manager of “New Trend” is Suzanka Angelova the 
					wife of Mr. Angelov. At meetings and in interviews 
					Mr.Angelov often speaks in the name of “New Trend” adding to 
					the confusion.[1] 
					Since the three companies, “Birkart”, “New Trade”, and “Zmaj 
					Promet”, are located in the same premises they could be seen 
					as one larger enterprise. 

					Before investing into textile/garment sector “E-biz” has 
					conducted thorough analysis of the market realizing that 
					there is an urgent need for investments in modern ICT 
					technologies. In the summer of 2004 “E-biz” called a tender 
					for establishing the “New Trend” and from the four 
					participants “Zmaj Promet’s” offer seemed most attractive 
					and economically viable. The business plan for establishing 
					the “New Trend” was approved at the beginning of November of 
					2004. The investment in “New Trend” was 400.000 USD, with 
					“Zmaj Promet” investing 53% and “E-biz” 47%.[2] 
					According to the business plan the “New Trend” should became 
					financially self sustainable in three years, after which a 
					re-definition of the ownership relations will occur. “E-biz” 
					does not intend to set up another center such as “New Trend” 
					stating that this single company is currently sufficient to 
					cover the Macedonian market and establishing another one 
					would mean duplication and unnecessary dispersing of 
					existing potential and knowledge.

					New Trend provides CAD and CAM services to interested 
					Macedonian apparel producers. They began with promotion of 
					the CAM in May 2005, and the Shtip apparel producers are 
					increasingly becoming to use the service. The CAD system is 
					being used in two shifts whiles the CAM in one shift. 
					Currently the CAM is used in 70% of its capacity hoping to 
					reach 100% until the end of the year. “New Trend” has 
					currently 50 customers, 26 of them from Stip. The number of 
					“New Trend’s” customers is increasing every month. The 
					machines are both located on the ground floor of the main 
					building. Companies in Germany only have to send the design 
					per email, and the raw materials, and “New Trend” then 
					prepares the clothing pieces for the companies using 
					sophisticated software. “New Trend” provides quality control 
					of the materials and Trend” supplies clothing companies, 
					like Milano for example, with the accessory materials 
					intended for CAD and CAM services importing them from Italy. 
					They closely cooperate with the intermediary company Global 
					from Skopje. For New Trend/Birkart it would be great if 
					there are more companies moving to full-packaging, using 
					their global networks. The company’s future priorities are 
					to attract more clients because there is luck of confidence 
					in this kind of business and to become the major raw 
					material suppliers. 

					Textile Logistics Macedonia-Canda was actually the first 
					logistic center in Macedonia. It was founded by Textile 
					Logistic Bulgaria (TLB) in March 2003, and today it works 
					with about twenty apparel producers from Macedonia from 
					Kochani, Kavadarci, Bitola, and Skopje, and five from Shtip, 
					Lars, Mavis, Metro-Premier, Beas, and Labod MK (Elena).. A 
					dozen other companies have signaled already their additional 
					interest in cooperation.[3]

TLM works for CANDA which is subcontracted 
					by the multinational chain C&A. In its operations TLM is de 
					facto autonomous in relation to the TLB. Still, while more 
					than 90% of technical and logistic operations of TLM is 
					coordinated directly through Germany (Canda). Alike Birkart, 
					TLM also works with CAD and CAM systems, and final logistic 
					and product preparing for the final clients. For 
					transportation, TLM uses mainly the services of the German 
					company Meyer & Meyer and their associates (Grdovjanka). TLM 
					is a significant customer of Birkart’s depot. 


					           TLM rents a store belonging to Angroteks which 
					used to be a furniture department store. In 2003, TLM 
					subcontracted companies produced for CANDA Germany 1 300 000 
					pieces of clothing, 2 400 000 pieces in 2004, with the 
					expected growth in produced items of 10-20 % for 2005. 
					(including products from 3 new companies producing heavy 
					clothing). For transportation, TLM uses mainly the services 
					of Meyer & Meyer (Grdovjanka) and their associates. The 
					average annual number of trucks driving TLM goods is around 
					300, while in high season there are 30 trucks monthly. The 
					average number of clothing units per truck is 8.000. In the 
					interview Mr Georgiev explained that Birkart is somehow 
					copying the TLM logistic model. He does not consider Birkart 
					to be a dangerous competitor and he thinks they can complete 
					each other. Mr. Georgiev said that TLM is practically the 
					only significant customer of Birkart’s depot and almost 90% 
					of goods stored there belong to TLM. He is satisfied with 
					TLM’s position on the Macedonian market, with the relations 
					with Canda and indirectly C&A being the biggest asset and 
					advantage over Macedonian rivals. 

					Finally we should also mention the transport sector. There 
					about 300 people employed in the transport (forwarding) 
					sector in Shtip. The two largest companies in the market 
					Gradovjanka and Zmaj Promet are related to the logistic 
					centers Birkart and TLM. 

					The prices are dominated by the offers of Birkart, and TLM. 
					

					“Zmaj promet” works since 1993, and does international 
					transport of goods with 37 workers, and 13 trucks. About 90 
					% of the time they drive apparel from all over Macedonia to 
					Germany, Benelux, Greece and their business is going on 
					well.[cxxxiv]  
					The transport company “Gradovjanka” was founded in 1989/90 
					and in 1996 become a branch-office of the German Transport 
					Company Mayer & Mayer for the Macedonian region 
					concentrating on forwarding apparel. “Gradovjanka” is not 
					the only company that provides transport services for the 
					Mayer & Mayer as currently there are also 4 other companies 
					doing this. At the moment, they have 16 trucks and cooperate 
					with the following apparel producers from Shtip: Lars, Vabo, 
					Eskada, Shtipteks, Canda. The total number of employees is 
					24, together with drivers and they have eight trucks. 
					Mostly, they are transporting in Germany, Belgian and 
					Holland.  Their business premises are in the former 
					enterprise Staklara 29 Noemvri from Skopje which they bought 
					5 years ago. Currently, 
					the company has storage area of 7 000 m2 of 
					non-covered land which it plans to enlarge. 
					It is important to know, that there is no real maintenance 
					or service for trucks in Macedonia. In the republic it is 
					only possible to do repairs, but spare parts are not 
					accessible at all. For major repairs Macedonian companies 
					send their trucks into the EU – to Greece.


					According to Liljana Puncheva- Chief of Customs in Shtip 
					(Shef na carinska ispostava) besides Birkard (13 trucks) and 
					Mayer & Mayer (8 trucks) the other most active transport 
					companies are: Metro Premier with 7 trucks; Divna with 3 
					trucks; and DM Preciz with 3 trucks. She mentioned that the 
					average number of trucks that export goods each month 
					through the Shtip Customs is 1250, the busiest days being 
					Friday and Saturday.[cxxxv] 
					On average five apparel producers use one truck to export 
					goods. Many exporters from Skopje also use terminal in 
					Shtip, and many have their offices there, including the 
					intermediary company Global from Skopje. There are 18 
					forwarding companies in the Custom direction building[cxxxvi] 
					while, 3 are located elsewhere.[cxxxvii] 
					


					 



					The Role of the Intermediaries 


					  

					The sale intermediaries or agents had a very important role 
					in the textile and clothing industry in the SFR Yugoslav 
					period. At that time in Macedonia there were two 
					intermediary companies: Inteks and Makoteks. Dealing with 
					export of finished products and import of raw materials and 
					fabrics, Inteks was a trade representative of a large 
					conglomerate of 25 factories/producers from Macedonia. 
					“Makedonka” and “Astibo” were members of Inteks.[cxxxviii] 
					In fact, the government of socialist Macedonia urged the 
					smaller apparel producers to join “Inteks.”[cxxxix] 
					Inteks organized representations of the Macedonian textile 
					and clothing producers at international fairs and provided 
					its members information about new machines and 
					technologies.  Within Inteks there was a part which follows 
					fashionable trends, machines and went regularly to fashion 
					fairs in Moscow, Leipzig, Düsseldorf, Belgrade, Zagreb and 
					Ljubljana where they had a stand together with other 
					producers from SFRY.  In the 1980’s “Inteks” had 58% of the 
					total turnover and 47% of the profits of the textile and 
					apparel producers in the republic, and made exports worth 
					22.8 million USD in the Western markets and 30.7 in the 
					socialist block.[cxl] 
					In 1986, it had 28,000 employees with export for the first 
					half of 1986 worth 13.8 million USD in 1986, 64% of which 
					sold in the Western markets.[cxli] 
					In the same year “Inteks” had problems getting payments from 
					companies from the socialist block of countries, especially 
					from those from the Soviet Union, and the German Democratic 
					Republic.[cxlii] 
					In 1987 there were about 29,000 employed in the Inteks 
					consortium with 90 % export production.[cxliii] 
					They used to import 15000 tons of cotton not only for the 27 
					producers from Macedonia but for all SFR Yugoslavia. In the 
					beginning there were 150 employed in Inteks, then 70, today 
					15. The company has lost its intermediary position and the 
					owner Zoran Azmanov lives of renting the real estate of the 
					company.

					Former managers of Inteks have however, continued doing the 
					business of intermediation between Western buyers and 
					Macedonian manufacturers. The two directors and partners of 
					Texico, a leading sales intermediary, Mr. Grukevski and Mr. 
					Vaskov, are an example. Texico exists since November 2002 
					and employs six persons. It works with 10 foreign partners 
					mainly from Germany, but also from Italy and Belgium. Texico 
					is intermediary in the annual sale of one million pieces of 
					apparel. Their way of business is to negotiate deals with 
					the foreign buyers, together with the local producers. 
					Texico’s profit margin is five percent. The annual turnover 
					of Texico is around two million Euros. While Lavishbelt, INT, 
					Polaris and Etra have about the same annual turnover as 
					Texico the biggest company in this business nowadays is 
					Global, with an annual turnover of about EUR 12 million. 
					Global’s 80% of its customers are from the EU, particularly 
					from Germany, Netherlands, Italy and England, and 20% are 
					from the USA. They are gradually abandoning the US market 
					and focus more on European Markets due to the possibilities 
					for achieving lower transport costs and greater flexibility 
					in production. Global has partner cooperation with the well 
					established German clothing company Steilmann Group. The 
					owner, Mr.Vladimir Ichokaev has built a logistical centre in 
					Skopje with a customs depot, and CAD and CAM machines and 
					plans to invest in a laboratory for washing clothes. Apart 
					from Global’s own clothing facility with about 60 workers, 
					60 other companies throughput Macedonia manufacture for 
					Mr.Ichokaev.

 POLICY STUDY N1:


MACEDONIAN 
						CLOTHES FOR EUROPE




						 



I. INTRODUCTION  


 


This 
						is an analysis of development problems in a former 
						socialist country in South Eastern Europe. It is also a 
						story about life in Stip a medium-sized town in Eastern 
						Macedonia; the emergence of a new group of private 
						entrepreneurs on the ruins of formerly socialist 
						companies; and the policy responses to the emerging new 
						economy by public institutions. The story explores the 
						forces that have affected the people and economy of Stip 
						in the past and the factors which are buffeting them 
						today. Examining and investigating those forces and 
						factors is crucial for anybody who wants to understand 
						the current socio-economic situation of Macedonia. As 
						Stip is traditionally the biggest center of clothing and 
						textile production in Macedonia this study is important 
						for understanding the overall situation in this sector. 
						In this study we aim to explore what is the state of 
						affairs of the textile and apparel industry. Is there a 
						need for modernization and transformation to make it one 
						of the economic driving forces of the country?  Stip - 
						due to its historical and regional importance for the 
						textile production - shall be used as a case study for 
						this sector.  


 


The 
						story of Stip is also vital for any policy maker who 
						considers which measures and public policies might be 
						effective for breaking out of a cycle of stagnation and 
						decline. The analysis of the changes in the clothing 
						sector in Stip offers a solid basis for understanding 
						the transformation of other industries in Macedonia in 
						search for a more focused approach to problems of the 
						Macedonian economy. Picturing Stip and its over-dominant 
						industrial sector – textile and clothing industry, 
						provides an extremely useful tool for more comprehensive 
						understanding of the current economic problems of the 
						country and for considering the possible solutions of 
						the crisis. This report helps to explain the universal 
						and specific reasons making Macedonia one of the slowest 
						growing transition economies.  


 


Today, the Macedonian “transition” from socialism to a 
						market economy is largely completed. However, the 
						results of the transformation have been disappointing. 
						The country’s GDP growth has been slowest in the region.

						real change in % against previous year[1]

In 
						addition, Macedonia has a very high unemployment. Its 
						official rate of unemployment is highest in Southeast 
						Europe, worse than Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia 
						excluding Kosovo.[2] 
						The percentage of Macedonians of working age (15-64) who 
						are employed is 
						33,51%, compared to 46% in Turkey, 51,7% in Poland or 
						65% in Germany.[3]



Macedonia rates 81 among 155 economies that are surveyed 
						annually for the purposes of “Doing business report” of 
						the World Bank.


 

Poorly 
						functioning institutions and dysfunctional courts have 
						undermined business activity and kept per capita foreign 
						direct investments low, even by regional standards. The 
						foreign investments in Macedonia are lowest in the 
						Southeast of Europe lagging well behind neighboring 
						Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Growth and reform strategies should not be based on 
						abstract values, but mainly on concrete figures obtained 
						directly from field research. That is the only way to 
						elaborate policy, tailored to the real needs, and to 
						develop practically applicable economic strategies. The 
						objective of this paper is to shed light on some of the 
						structural problems facing Macedonia that might help 
						explain its stubbornly high unemployment rate and low 
						level of growth and exports.  It does so by looking both 
						at a crucial sector (clothes or apparel production) and 
						at trends in one of Macedonia’s seven regions (Eastern 
						Macedonia).  This sector is crucial for bread winner 
						both in terms of exports and employment. Every second 
						item Macedonia sells to the EU is a shirt, blouse or 
						another piece of clothing. In 2004 clothing and textile 
						exports made up 32 percent of all of Macedonia exports, 
						and 46.4 percent of its exports to the EU (in 2003) 
						significantly more than the ‘traditional’ Macedonian 
						exports of raw tobacco (2,8%), wine (2,5%) and lamb 
						(1,6%).


[5] 
						Exports of iron and steel contribute a further 24 
						percent: in fact, apparel and iron exports combined make 
						up two thirds of the country’s exports. Developments in 
						these key sectors directly and strongly affect all of 
						Macedonian society as they contribute to two thirds of 
						the country’s exports.

						the total given.

 

In terms of 
						employment clothing manufacturing today is the biggest 
						industrial sector.  

Almost one in ten officially employed Macedonians today 
						produce clothes (8.6 percent).[7]. 
						The industry employs 36,635 people, nearly  

one third of the total number of employees in the 
						Macedonian industrial sector.[8]


It has 
						more than a double of the workers in the manufacture of 
						food products and beverages (16,938) and far more than 
						the 9,590 employees in the production of metal products.[9]  
						This is true even though the  


						number has been in decline since the late 1980s, when 
						there were 
62.518 
						employees.[10]

 

Women’s blouses 
						and cotton T-shirts are the most competitive products 
						produced in Macedonia today.  

The 
						women’s blouse was the number one Macedonian export 
						product in the first trimester of 2005.[11] 
						On the list of the top 10 most valuable export items 
						were also men’s cotton shirts in the fourth and women’s 
						trousers and brace overalls in the eight place. 
						Macedonia actually earns more selling women’s blouses 
						than with the sales of its wine and lamb combined, and 
						these items are just one kind of apparel exported by the 
						domestic producers. Exports of blouses sewn for C&A are 
						worth more than the sales of the famous T‘ga za Jug 
						[Longing for the South] Macedonian red wine.


 


The 
						center of the clothing production in Macedonia today is 
						in Eastern Macedonia, in Stip. There 5,610 (or 40 
						percent of all employed) work in 58 companies in the 
						textile sector.



[12] This is more than in any other 
						town in the country (Skopje has 3,851, Tetovo 3,549 and 
						Bitola 2,541 people working in this sector).[13] 
						In the rest of Eastern Macedonia textiles and clothing 
						are also major employers. In the small town of Radovish 
						where the economy in socialist time was concentrated 
						around the copper mine Buchim, today there are 
						several textile companies such as: Koneli, Dekorteks, 
						Edinstvo, branches of Stipteks (from Stip), 
						and Orka (from Skopje).” In Vinica, there are  
						Vinka and Vinichanka built in socialist 
						times, but also new clothing companies such as Moda; 
						in Kochani, Ko, Stil, Goldenteks, Triko, Amorteks 
						and Daniteks. The town of Delchevo was also 
						textile oriented. Today besides the old Alkaloid 
						and Frotirka, several new clothing companies, 
						such as Palteks and Dateks have been 
						opened.  


 


Outsiders looking at Macedonia rarely pay much attention 
						to its East. North West and North East Macedonia are in 
						the focus due to their complex ethnic relations (here 
						most of the country’s Albanians live).  The capital 
						Skopje is the political and economic centre: with 25 
						percent of the total population producing 50 percent of 
						the country’s GDP.[14]  
						Even Central Macedonia – the valley of the Vardar river 
						– is familiar to those who travel from Central Europe to 
						the Aegean, from Belgrade to Thessaloniki.  Eastern 
						Macedonia, however, sees few visitors; the population is 
						largely mono-ethnic, the landscape unspectacular. People 
						in this region have the worst living standards in 
						Macedonia. They are less prosperous than those in Skopje 
						but also than citizens of Tetovo or Kumanovo.[15] 
						



 


Can a 
						city whose economy depends on textiles and clothes be 
						anything other than poor?  Can a region where the 
						typical worker is a woman with primary school education, 
						sewing and stitching pieces of imported cloth with the 
						help of old-fashioned sewing machines, truly develop?  
						Some in Stip doubt this.  “A town with so many clothing 
						companies must be poor”, explains Vlado Netkov, who now 
						runs one of the most entrepreneurial businesses in Stip.[16] 
						Yet most of the private companies CRPM interviewed in 
						recent months have expanded their activities since 
						2001.  In the short term, then, the sector appears to be 
						doing fine. However, in the clothes sector the short 
						term is short indeed. It is alarming that today, as in 
						the socialist past the simple “sewing and stitching” 
						remains the main economic activity in the town. 
						Investments in higher value-added production are hardly 
						evident, which brings the danger of Stip being destined 
						for further stagnation. Precisely because Stip is so 
						“clothing manufacturing dependant” if this sector fails 
						the city itself would collapse as well. Whereas in other 
						Macedonian municipalities a decline of the clothing 
						sector means economic trouble of a single economic 
						sector in Stip it would mean the collapse of the entire 
						city. As the experience of so many countries has shown 
						manufacturers and retailers scout the planet for the 
						lowest-cost production. The search for yet lower costs 
						of production influences the “race to the bottom” 
						concept.

						of Macedonia with Stip’s neighboring towns Delchevo, 
						Berovo, Sveti Nikole underlined.


 





 


 


Since 
						orders can be placed anywhere on the planet the 
						sub-contractors, the ones actually who produce the 
						goods, are relatively powerless price-takers, rather 
						than partners and deal-makers. The world of textile and 
						apparel industry has undergone several production 
						migrations since the 1950s, from North America and 
						Western Europe to Japan in the 1950s and early 1960s, 
						and then from Japan to Hong Kong, Taiwan and South 
						Korea, which dominated Global textile and 
						clothing exports in the 1970s and early 1980s. Finally 
						in the late 1980s and the 1990s there was a third 
						migration to other developing economies including China. 
						Each new tier of entrants in the Global apparel 
						trade had a significantly lower wage rates than its 
						predecessor. Stip and Macedonia have entered this race 
						sometimes ago. But, an economy whose symbol is the 
						cotton T-shirt is not one that can reach EU living 
						standards in the 21st century.[17]  
						How Macedonia arrived at this stage, and what options a 
						town like Stip, and national policy makers, have today 
						are crucial questions for the future of the whole 
						country?

MACEDONIA’S MANCHESTER  

 

Stip is a small, 
						picturesque little town merely a one hour drive from the 
						capital Skopje. 

According to statistics, in Stip the food is cheapest in 
						Macedonia.[18] 
						In the 
						country Stip is famous for its local, pizza-like 
						pastry, pastarmajlija. Most of the town’s houses 
						are modern. There are a number of socialist era 
						apartment buildings and newer shopping centers. A river 
						passes through the center of Stip full of cafés and 
						restaurants. This little town is a home to many 
						Macedonian historical figures, from the chiefs of the 
						‘infamous’ VMRO, Vancho Mihajlov, and Todor Aleksandrov, 
						to the partisan leader Mihajlo Apostolski. The key 
						figures of the country’s post- 1991 independence, former 
						premier Nikola Kljusev, presidents Kiro Gligorov, and 
						the spiritual leader Archbishop Mihail, also hail from 
						there. It was in Stip during the times of Kingdom of 
						Yugoslavia, in 1924, where the Russian musician Sergey 
						Mihailov, staged “Pagliacci” the first opera in what is 
						today Macedonia and it is in Stip’s where “Makfest”, the 
						most prestigious pop music festival in the country, is 
						organized nowadays.[19] 
						A vast majority of the 47,796 inhabitants of Stip are 
						Macedonians with a small number of Vlachs, Turkish, Roma 
						and others.  

Although there were more than 4,000 Turks in the town 
						after 1945; most of them left as part of a population 
						‘exchange’ organized in the 1950s between socialist 
						Yugoslavia and the Turkey. The Vlachs are a small and 
						entrepreneurial minority of 2,074.

Although this is an old city, there are few buildings 
						left from before the 20th century. Before the 
						19th century they are no precise statistics 
						on Stip’s population figures. The only useful 
						information are from traveler’s descriptions of the town 
						according to which Stip had 3,000-4,000 inhabitants in 
						1797, the number increasing to 6000 in 1807, and then to 
						17,000 in 1835. Stip was rather a dynamic and rapidly 
						developing town for this period in history. The growth 
						of Stip was induced by the trade with Thessalonica, 
						mainly conducted by the Jewish community of the town.[21] 
						In this era the Stip had 3000 houses out of which 1200 
						were Christian houses, whereas 1570 were Turkish.  



 


The 
						importance of the city as an economic and trade centre 
						of the eastern region of Macedonia started to decline 
						when the railway Thessalonica-Skopje-Mitrovica was built 
						in 1873 bypassing Stip. By the end of 19th 
						century (1899) Stip had some 20,900 inhabitants, of 
						which 10,900 Macedonians; 8,700 Turks; 800 Jews; 500 
						Roma. The Vlachs appear in the statistics only in 1912, 
						when they amount to 120 people.[22] 
						Before the 1912 the city of Stip had 32 neighborhoods 
						out of which 11 were inhabited by Macedonians, 9 were 
						inhabited by Turks, one by Roma and one by Jewish 
						inhabitants, whereas the rest were mixed. There were 
						around 700 craftsmen’s workshops (most of them 
						shoemakers - 100 and clothing producers - 60) and 
						trading houses, one hotel, 47 restaurants, and 25 
						bakeries.[23]




 


Before the Second World War Stip with its 550 Jewish 
						inhabitants had a third biggest Jewish community in 
						Macedonia (after Skopje and Bitola)[24]. 
						Most of the Jews living in Stip were engaged in small 
						trade activities and were relatively poor[25]. 
						Unlike their kin from Bitola who were supporting the 
						Zionist movement and those from Skopje who were well 
						integrated with the rest of the society, the Jews from 
						Stip were mainly working class and had strong 
						pro-communist orientation.[26] 
						All but few Jews from Stip were deported to the 
						concentration camp Treblinka between 25 and 29 March 
						1943.[27] 
						None of them survived the camp horrors and today there 
						is only one Jewish family living in Stip.  

 


In 
						the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, Stip was a 
						town of craftsmen, and agricultural producer (tobacco, 
						cotton, poppies and wool). After 1945 however, Stip as 
						other towns in Yugoslavia, went through a rapid process 
						of mass industrialization and urbanization becoming an 
						important economic center. Industrialization resulted in 
						most of the surrounding villages becoming depopulated. 
						Much of the agriculture production has been neglected 
						and people left their villages to work in the industrial 
						capacities in the town. In fact, the urbanization has 
						been so extreme that out of 45 villages in the 
						municipality, by 2002, 35 have been completely 
						depopulated or have less than 100 inhabitants.[28] 
						The villages that have actually witnessed population 
						growth in the last fifty or so years, are either 
						adjacent to the town, (Chardaklija with 922, and Star 
						Karaorman with 911 inhabitants), or are on the main road 
						to Veles and Skopje. (Tri Cheshmi with 1065 villagers)

The 
						post-war industrialization of Stip was based on the 
						production of textiles and clothes.  There were other 
						industrial facilities built from scratch: some in food 
						production and processing (Zhito Leb, an 
						industrial bakery), some in metal production (Metalna, 
						producing metal tubes), and a very large company 
						producing shoes (Bargala).  However, it was the 
						textile factory Makedonka, founded in 1950, which 
						played the leading role in transforming the town. 
						Makedonka and its affiliate factory Astibo 
						was considered as an important basis for the development 
						of the Yugoslav textile and clothing production. The 
						importance of this factory was high at that time, but 
						until today it continues to condition the current 
						economic situation and potentials for growth of the Stip 
						economy.  

 


Even 
						the physical layout of Stip tells a story of a town that 
						is based on the development of Makedonka. As you 
						enter Stip from the West, one soon reaches a round-about 
						near the now defunct train-station. On the left is the 
						region’s main industrial zone. Since 1950 this area is 
						dominated by Stip’s largest socialist enterprise, the 
						textile company Makedonka.  There is a huge white 
						monument of an industrial worker at the entrance 
						symbolizing the economic giant employing 5,900 people in 
						the 80’s.  

 

When one comes 
						in the complex of Makedonka on his left he first 
						sees the yellow administrative building where the whole 
						process of production in the factory was planned and 
						administered/managed. Next to the entrance door of this 
						management building there is a plaque announcing the 
						beginning of production of yarn in Makedonka in 
						1953 when the spinning mill was handed over to the 
						workers of the factory. Further down the main street 
						(there are two parallel streets that go through and 
						around the Makedonka compound) one can see on the 
						left side a huge production facility where the 
						Macedonian fabrics were created, whereas on the left 
						side there are the storage facilities next to which a 
						railway is passing. This is where the trains used to 
						stop at Makedonka while the yarn and fabrics were 
						loaded to be transported throughout the former 
						Yugoslavia and Europe.

Since April 2004 
						the railway line connecting Stip to Skopje has stop 
						functioning, the government deeming it not profitable 
						enough. Two years earlier Makedonka also stopped 
						operating. Today the compound is falling apart, the 
						railway gate locked already rusted. The maintenance has 
						been poor in the last ten years and one could see that 
						many windows are broken, parts of the walls are 
						deteriorating and the grass in the park is growing wild 
						for some time. There is a bulk of old machinery, rusted 
						from the rains and the time that past by, scattered 
						around the compound. An old flag of the factory is still 
						there, continually blown by the wind that is so strong 
						in the Stip area.

 

To get from the 
						round-about to the centre a traveler would continue on
						Goce Delchev Street.  One then passes a number of 
						private clothing firms including Albatros, one of 
						the most dynamic enterprises in town. Soon one reaches 
						what is today the largest employer in town, Bargala, 
						where more than 1,200 employees are making shoes for 
						export to the USA and Italy. On the left one finally 
						comes to the complex of buildings of Astibo, the 
						most important clothes producer in socialist times.  
						Named after the Roman name for Stip, Astibo laid 
						the foundations of the large clothes sector of today.  
						Many of the managers of private producers today, 
						including those of Stipteks and Albatros 
						started their careers in the management of Astibo.  
						When the company was liquidated and its premises sold, a 
						consortium of (mainly) former managers bought the 
						premises which today again houses eight producers of 
						clothes.

 

The Goce 
						Delchev road then climbs up a small hill before one 
						reaches the centre of the town.  The main cathedral, 
						St. Nikola from the XIX century built on the ruins 
						of a XIV century church, dominates the centre of the 
						city. Opposite it is the municipal building, housing the 
						Mayors office, regional offices of the various 
						Ministries of the central Government, the offices of the 
						trade union, the citizen’s information centre and the 
						local UNDP office. A few steps from the cathedral are 
						the City Museum, and a large bronze memorial in the 
						shape of a Menorah commemorating the destruction of 
						Stip’s Jewish community during World War II.

This is the old 
						commercial centre concentrated around the Ottoman 
						covered bazaar (Bezisten) in which traders 
						gathered and sold their items in the past but nowadays 
						is used as an art gallery. Next to the Bezisten 
						is the tall building of Stip’s largest hotel, Oaza,
built in the socialist era by Astibo.  


 


 


To 
						the south-west, on the big hill which shadows the town, 
						you can see the remains of a medieval castle, the 
						Isar an old Ottoman fortification and halfway up, on 
						what is little more than a ledge, the small 
						fourteenth-century church of St. Arhangel. On the 
						same hill there is a newly built cross overlooking the 
						town, constructed in celebration of the 2000 years of 
						Christianity.   


 

The 
						 

economy in Stip revolving around Makedonka and 
						Astibo declined in the years after the dissolution 
						of Yugoslavia and the transformation of the system. 
						While during socialist times the many Stip inhabitants 
						has a decent life and good working conditions today this 
						is no longer true. Living standards have worsened 
						drastically at the beginning of 90’s. Workers in the 
						textile sector have far less amenities than 20 years 
						ago. Their jobs are not a certainty. Long gone are the 
						paid holidays at the Ohrid lake, and the provided social 
						and health care for the whole family. No cultural events 
						for the workers are organized by the clothing 
						manufacturing firms any more. The salaries are low, and 
						the working hours long. After 1989 the town did
						
not witness a construction 
						boom typical for the capital or some other parts of the 
						country. Instead, in the city center one finds a new 
						shopping center that is half finished and only a few new 
						apartment buildings.

 

Today only  
36 
						percent of the working age population have official 
						employment (in 1994, the employment rate was 61 
						percent). The employment rate in Stip today is higher 
						than the Macedonian average of 33.51 percent.[29] 
						However, the EU average is 63.3 percent, and the lowest 
						rate among EU is Poland’s 51.7 percent.[30] 
						


Despite the economic decline, industrial production, and 
						clothing manufacturing in particular, overshadows the 
						economy in Stip. While in the tertiary sector there are 
						4494 employees or 32% of all employed, agricultural 
						activity, except for occasional subsistence farming, has 
						almost diminished. Today, out of 13,888 registered 
						employees, 9140 persons, or 66% of all employed, work in 
						the industrial sector. Like in the past, within the 
						industrial sector, clothing manufacturing predominates.

III.      STIP’S RACE TO THE BOTTOM


 


 


In 
						clothing production, labor expenses account for up to 60 
						percent of the overall production costs.[31]
						Labor 
						costs are particularly important in the outward 
						processing trade (OPT) also know as cut-make production, 
						the 807/9802 program, “production sharing”, or 
						lohnveredelung. In this system of international 
						subcontracting firms supply intermediate inputs (cut 
						fabric, thread, buttons and other trim) to suppliers, 
						typically located in neighboring low-cost countries with 
						reciprocal trade agreements that allow goods assembled 
						offshore to be re-imported with a tariff charged only on 
						the value added by foreign labor. To make this system 
						worthwhile, the cost savings associated with low-wage 
						assembly must exceed the inherent additional costs of 
						production fragmentation, namely: two-way shipments; 
						longer and larger inventory; and added co—ordination to 
						manage the fragmented supply chain. Even small 
						deviations in production costs can in turn drive the 
						producer “out of the market” the buyer turning to the 
						competitors. 
						




 


Stip clothing producers today fear that they will be 
						driven out of the market The history of the development 
						of the industry in this town tells us why. Stip has a 
						long tradition of clothing and textile production, first 
						developed after the Second World War, 
						concentrated around Makedonka, playing the key 
						role,[32] 
						and then Astibo. Founded in 1950 Makedonka 
						began production with 120 workers in April of 1952 with 
						new machines bought from the United Kingdom. 
						Makedonka was one of the biggest and most modern 
						factories in the whole SFR Yugoslavia producing yarn, 
						fabrics and cloth for the domestic clothing market. It 
						included a restaurant serving one free meal for the 
						employees per day, three discount stores, and a library.[33]
Makedonka had apartment buildings constructed for 
						its workers who could buy these through different kinds 
						of credits.[34] 
						The company expanded, both in size and in production 
						capacity, building a weaving plant in 1955, a spinning 
						mill in 1957, clothing manufacturing line in 1962 and a 
						jeans factory in 1983. The number of workers grew year 
						by year from 500 in 1953, to the peak of 5900, in 1987.
						



[35]


 


Makedonka’s 
						fibers and cloth was used by the clothing producing unit
						Astibo was founded in 1962 with 119 employees. 
						This company also grew quickly.[36] 
						The core business was the design, production and 
						distribution of men’s, women’s and children’s clothes. 
						Already in 1972, Astibo had about 2.000 employed 
						persons. It even founded production units in a number of 
						towns in the Eastern part of Macedonia employing the 
						spouses of the men working in the mine pits in Eastern 
						Macedonia.[37] 
						A decade after it was established the conglomerate 
						became the biggest producer of light (casual) clothes in 
						all Yugoslavia and one of the top five producers of 
						apparel overall, with 60 own shops throughout the 
						country.[38] 
						In 1967 Astibo began exporting its production 
						making contracts with foreign buyers, “manufacturing 
						pre-ordered items already paid by the partners abroad.”[39] 
						By 1978 Astibo exported half of its production.[40]




 


The crisis of Stip’s textile industry began in the 
						1980’s.  

						Makedonka 
						had a number of problems: difficulties procuring cotton 
						from the 1970’s onward when domestic production 
						drastically decreased; over-employment in the factory[41]; 
						and new openings of units to absorb unemployed persons[42]; 
						increasing indebting from getting loans to pay the wages 
						of the workers; bad management and political mingling 
						added to the negative effects of the wars and the 
						disintegration of Yugoslavia.


 


Around the same times similar problems faced the Stip 
						clothing industry. In the early 1980’s Astibo had 
						problems with regular payments for its sales on the 
						domestic market and decided to step up exports working 
						on the basis of the “lohnveredelung” production.[43] 
						This job was easy to do as the foreign partners, mainly 
						German ones, provided all the necessary materials and 
						Astibo had to do only stitching and sewing. The firm 
						now did not need to develop own products and sell them 
						to foreign partners; neither it had to purchase the 
						materials for manufacturing.[44]




 


Meanwhile, for various reasons that had little touch 
						with economic realities the number of workers of 
						Astibo grew to a record 4800 in 1987.[45]  
						Since Astibo was part of a system of command 
						economy the management was not much concerned about long 
						terms effects of employing huge amounts of workers. 
						During the massive employing of youth in the 1970’s for 
						example, the management boasted that “we will hire new 
						employees because we have plenty of orders…what will 
						happen when there will be no more orders- we will think 
						about this when such times come.”[46]




 


Besides over-employment, the wars of Yugoslav succession 
						which disrupted the quickest delivery to Western buyers 
						of apparel were factors that lead to Astibo’s 
						collapse in the 1990’s. The ratio between workers and 
						administration was striking: at the end of the 1990’s 
						out of the 2.000 workers, up to 700 were employed in the 
						non-manufacturing section of the company.[47] 
						The firm also could not realize its financial claims 
						from companies throughout the former Yugoslavia.[48]

Both 
						companies went bankrupt in the mid 1990’s but their 
						transformation then led to different outcomes.  
						Throughout the 1990’s the government tried to save 
						Astibo and Makedonka through various 
						‘programs for restructuring,’ laying off surplus workers 
						and subsidizing production through loans. Astibo 
						was liquidated only in the summer of 2002. Following one 
						unsuccessful tender a consortium of nine clothing 
						manufacturers bought Astibo to use the premises 
						for production purposes for 1,704,000 Euros. Each member 
						of the consortium paid a share according to the size of 
						the objects bought, the sum ranging from 110,000 to 
						280,000 Euros.[49]

On 
						the other hand, after much wrangling Makedonka 
						was broken up into eight separate legal entities, 
						liquidated at the end of 2001 and sold separately unit 
						by unit. During the liquidation of Makedonka much 
						of the equipment was disbanded and stolen, some of the 
						machines sold as scrap metal[50], 
						smashed by bulldozers[51]. 
						Throughout the privatization process eight of the newer 
						machines were relocated to the textile factory 
						“Alkaloid” from Berovo.  There is no document testifying 
						if the machines were sold or rented out.[52] 
						In the Makedonka compound the only machines that 
						survived the transition and are still used for 
						production are those from “AD Ros”. While in the late 
						1980s Makedonka was still one of the largest 
						textile companies in South East Europe, today most of 
						Makedonka has been rented out, only a small part 
						used for textile and clothing production. Only few firms 
						use the premises employing far less workers than in the 
						glorious past.

Stip’s Astibo and Makedonka have been 
						replaced by newcomers in the clothing manufacturing.  
						While in the socialist past of Stip there were two large 
						companies now there a dozen of clothing producers. 
						Managers, engineers, and economists from the socialist 
						times have started up own businesses using the skills 
						and the contacts of the two defunct. Most of the 
						newcomers, like Stipteks, manufacture clothes. 
						Textile production is almost disappearing. Like 
						Astibo in the 80’s, nowadays Stip companies are very 
						much focused upon “outward processing production", 
						having few value added products and currently doing only 
						‘sewing and stitching’. This activity is low-value 
						added, labor-intensive and is using unskilled labor for 
						a mass production of lower-quality and/or standard 
						products. Most of the companies are small and mid-size 
						and the workers are skilled in simple cut and make 
						techniques needed for the production of casual or “light 
						clothes”  


						such as shirts, blouses, t-shirts, etc. 
						They employ mainly female workers –semi-skilled and 
						unskilled – and outsourcing to household production is 
						quite common in the low end of the market[55]. 
						This is a sector where relatively modern technology can 
						be adopted very quickly due to the relatively low 
						investment costs and companies sprung up and close 
						often. Profits are small and life is hard for these 
						companies.  

For example, for a small size producer employing about 
						100 workers, the yearly turnover is about 200,000 Euros 
						and the monthly profit about 3,000 Euros[56].


 


The 
						producers of more complicated clothing items are better 
						off but are few. Only a  


						smaller number of Stip clothes producers such as: 
						Beas-s or Stipko, manufacture only or 
						predominantly jackets, coats and other more 
						sophisticated, semi-heavy and “heavy 
						apparel (tailored)”. 
						This production is less exposed to market vulnerability 
						due to higher transport costs, needs more skilled labor, 
						and more capital investment. The process of sewing such 
						clothes is longer than the production of casual clothes. 
						It takes about 45 minutes to sew a simply designed pair 
						of pants, compared to the 30 minutes needed for the 
						production of shirts. On the other hand it takes 150 
						minutes to manufacture a more complicated item such as a 
						working suite or a vest. The more sophisticated products 
						are more expensive, the basic product, a shirt, costing 
						1 euro to make, the pants 1.30 euros, but the working 
						suite 10 euros.[57] 
						Naturally then, the profits for manufacturers that make 
						heavy clothing are higher.


 


However, the systemic feature of clothing production 
						system, especially nowadays, is the domination of 
						buyer-driven value chains. Large retailers, marketers 
						and branded manufacturers, like JC Penney, Liz 
						Claiborne, Gap, Levis’, Wrangler and Tommy 
						Hilfiger, generally design and/or market—but do not 
						make—the branded products they order. They are 
						“manufacturers without factories”, with the physical 
						production of goods separated from the design and 
						marketing. In searching out producers for their items, 
						manufacturers and retailers scout the planet for the 
						lowest-cost production. The sub-contractors have to 
						follow orders and accept prices by retailers.  



 


That 
						is the case with 90% of the Stip base clothing 
						companies. For example, Stipteks the oldest 
						private clothing producers in Macedonia, having been set 
						up in 1989, has a production hall and the offices 
						located in a grey building in the industrial zone next 
						to two other clothes manufacturers. Stipteks has 
						German partners who come to Macedonia periodically to 
						order different kinds of clothes from local producers 
						and Stipteks.  Once the latest fashion trends are 
						clear the Germans send design of the products that 
						Stipteks needs to manufacture. The German partner 
						also sends the fabric or cloth to be made into t-shirts. 
						When the order is made the deadlines for production are 
						short and the work is intense. It is often required to 
						work over time. The T shirts are produced in a large 
						hall on the bottom floor where 200 women are seated in 
						five long rows.  In front of them are sewing machines, 
						the women forming Ford-like factory lines in which 
						everyone is focused on one specific task.  


 


The 
						cloth that enters the company is first cut by a tailor. 
						If not automated usually this physically demanding job 
						is done by men, Stipteks being no exception. The 
						manager is aware of the need of modernizing production 
						and minimizing costs through increased reliance on 
						automatic machines. Therefore, he plans to purchase a 
						machine for computer aided manufacturing that will 
						replace the tailor. Each line has about fifty women 
						working on a piece of cloth, i.e. the separate 
						components of a woman’s t-shirt. At the end of the hall 
						there are pressing machines ironing the shirts just 
						made.


 


While 
						the ground floor is huge but noisy, the administration 
						part of the company, on the first floor, is small and 
						modern. The office of the manager dominates the space 
						together with the offices of the accountants, the 
						secretary and of the sales representative. Here are a 
						computer with internet connection, fax machine, a 
						copier, and a telephone. On this floor, the contacts are 
						made, deals are considered and accepted. The manager is 
						busy, his mobile phone ringing constantly during the 
						working hours. Like many managers in Stip, 
						Dushko Zendelov is a former Astibo director.[58] 
						Obtaining such orders is a key to the company’s 
						survival. Competition is fierce and not only from 
						Macedonian companies. Stipteks managers are aware 
						of the fact that labor costs are particularly important 
						in the outward processing trade. The Stip low labor 
						costs (0.75 EURO/hour, which is similar to the labor 
						costs in Bulgaria and Romania)[59], 
						are incomparable with the even lower ones in Serbia, 
						Ukraine, Moldova or in the East - Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
						and China. Therefore, the managers of Stipteks 
						have invested part of their profits setting up a 
						production unit in Radovish where the wages are lower 
						then in Stip.  


 


The 
						next door company, Briteks, tells us a similar 
						story. The company is run by Risto Brashnarov, and his 
						sister Biljana Cvetkova Brasnarova. Their father was the 
						general manager of Makedonka. Founded in 1992, 
						the firm’ basic activity is the manufacture of ladies 
						winter and summer ready-to-wear lines for the domestic 
						and foreign markets. Briteks has 1,300 square 
						meters space, the hall painted in stark violet and 
						white. The manager’s office is at the entrance of the 
						premise, equipped with relatively new furniture, a 
						note-book on the manager’s desk. Although still enrolled 
						in a program for clothing engineers, Risto in his 30ies, 
						haven’t yet finished university finding it not quite 
						useful. Biljana is a graduated economist with interest 
						in clothing design. Opposite his office is the hall with 
						the workers. There is also a storage depot and the 
						tailor’s room.  


 


Briteks 
						produces some 300,000 clothing items annually in 4 
						lines. However, the manager admitted that the “company 
						lacks space” and that “the hall is overcrowded as it 
						should accommodate only three lines.” Finding extra 
						space is hard and costly. The factory started its work 
						with merely 30 employed people.  Today there are about 
						130 employees. 90 percent of employees are women, most 
						of them around 35 years old.  In 2002 another production 
						unit was opened in Skopje and managed by Risto’s sister. 
						However, the attempt was unsuccessful and now the family 
						concentrates their business only in Stip. About 95 
						percent of production is based on orders made from 
						foreign companies based in the Netherlands, Belgium, 
						Germany and Greece and arranged through an intermediary 
						firm Global. Unlike Stipteks which is sent 
						the cloth to sew by the buyer, Briteks uses the 
						services of Global to procure the necessary 
						fabrics from Italy, China and Indonesia. Brasnarov then 
						transports the final products through Birkart, 
						international logistics company.


 


Besides working for foreign clients Briteks also 
						produces own clothes, about 15 percent of its total 
						output. The manager, Biljana, designs the fashion lines 
						of the company.  She has visited international fashion 
						fairs. Yet Risto Brashnarov feels that they “need help 
						to create own brand-production, especially in the sphere 
						of design and marketing”. The latest Global 
						developments in the fashion industry affect their work: 
						the company receives smaller orders from clients that 
						need to be quickly finished. Faced with the difficulties 
						Brashnarov family decided to invest in 2,000 square 
						meters of real estate to rent. The rent is to cover 
						losses from the clothing company if they occur.


 


IV. TEXTILE FAMILIES




 

 

In the fall of 
						1990 Macedonia held its first free and democratic 
						elections.  In 1991 it declared independence. In the 
						same year the wars in the former Yugoslavia started in 
						Croatia, to spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina in spring 
						1992.  The end of communism, the break-up of Yugoslavia 
						and the imposition of an international sanctions on 
						Serbia -  reinforced in 1994 by a unilateral embargo on 
						Macedonia imposed by Greece – hit the Macedonian clothes 
						and textile sector severely.   

 

In 1994 the 
						Macedonian government set up a council to prepare the 
						privatization of Astibo, which at that time still 
						had about 3,000 employees.  An attempt by the former 
						management to buy out the company came to nothing.  At 
						the same time Makedonka was also struggling.  In 
						1994 it was included among the 25 biggest loss making 
						companies in the country.  Following strikes and 
						protests the liquidation of the company was postponed.  
						Only in 2000 bankruptcy procedures were initiated; in 
						December 2001 the company was liquidated.  One year 
						later Astibo was also liquidated.  

 

Today, 
						Makedonka and Astibo are history, their 
						premises used either by private clothes producers or by 
						other businesses.  But the textile families of Stip 
						remain the largest part of the towns’ workforce. If one 
						looks at what has happened to Stip’s proud textile 
						families from the socialist era one comes upon two 
						striking discoveries.  One concerns the changing role of 
						women, who have in many cases become the only 
						breadwinners in their households.  The other is the 
						growing dependency of younger family members on their 
						parents and even grand-parents, and in particular on 
						those who already receive a public pension.  

 

The 
						clothing companies 
are the
						biggest
						

						employer in Stip. 
						Most 
						of the employees 
in this sector
						
are 
						women. 
						Women and those younger than 40 or 45 in particular, are 
						almost exclusively employed in the clothing producing 
						sector. Half of the women that are less than 40 produce 
						clothes.[60] 
						An estimated number of 5,000 women work in the Stip’s 58 
						clothing companies, whereas another 1,000 women work in 
						other sectors. Today manufacturers looking for women to 
						work in clothing production have difficulty finding 
						suitable candidates: young, trained and skilful sewers 
						of the Macedonian clothes for Europe. This increases the 
						salaries for the Stip workers, the  

average one being between 150-200 Euros. The producers 
						claim that the wages in this sector are too high in 
						Stip, and highest in Macedonia. One response by 
						producers from Stip has been to move part of their 
						production to smaller towns and villages. Stipteks 
						has moved production in Radovish, Mavis is 
						opening a factory in Sveti Nikole and Probistip, Lars 
						in Zrnovci and Linea in Probistip. The salary of 
						one worker in Radovis is around 20 percent less than her 
						colleague in Stip.[61]

Today 36  percent of 
						the working age population has official employment (in 
						1994, the rate was 61 percent).  However, the employment 
						rate of the persons between 20 and 55 years old is 50 
						percent. From those older than 55 a small fraction (802) 
						are employed, and 287 registered as looking for a job. 
						The rest are pensioners. In total there are 8,562 
						pensioners in Stip. 


Most 
						of the pensioners have retired under the 1993 Law on 
						Pensions which stipulated the retirement age being 55 
						for women and 60 for men. Alternatively, one could have 
						retired with at least 35 years of working experience for 
						women and 40 years of experience for men. Therefore, the 
						number of pensioners is high and employment rate among 
						the age group 55-64 is minute. Since many of the young 
						are unemployed the pensions of their grandmothers and 
						grandfathers help the extended families survive the new 
						economic realities.


Since 
						independence in Macedonia as a result of the aging of 
						the population, rise in life expectancy and the 
						mentioned retirement eligibility criteria, the number of 
						pensioners grew significantly. Those that were employed 
						during the industrialization drive in the 1950’s retired 
						in the 1990’s. The data from the Pension and Disability 
						Fund show that merely in ten years (1990-2000) the 
						number of pensioners went up for 69%.[62] 
						As the unemployment also grew the number of contributors 
						to the pension scheme fell and the ratio between 
						contributors and pensioners according to the official 
						statistics went from 3.4 in 1990; to 1.3 in 2002. This 
						portrays a very serious situation where one and a half 
						employed person pays from his/her salary the pension of 
						one pensioner. The international standard for 
						sustainable pension scheme is to have at least three 
						people that pay the pension of a pensioner, but every 
						system strives for even bigger ratio, i.e. in Sweden the 
						ratio between contributors and pensioners goes up to 7.
						



Therefore reform of the pension system was needed to 
						introduce stricter criteria for retiring. According to 
						the new scheme, to be introduced in two years time 
						eligible for a retirement benefit are contributors with 
						64 years of age (for men), i.e. 62 years of age (for 
						women) and minimum 15 years of service. The question 
						that remains unanswered is whether the women presently 
						working in the clothing companies can work until they 
						are 62.  Nowadays the companies in Stip do not want to 
						employ older women than 45. As the today’s old, who have 
						secured pensions die out there will be huge consequences 
						for the Stip families. Stip’s women employed in the 
						clothing sector are not likely to physically endure the 
						demanding job beyond 45 and will face lay offs. On the 
						other hand, there are not many other jobs produced by 
						the local economy and their husbands or sons are likely 
						to be unemployed or forced to work in the grey sector of 
						the economy. Jobs in the public administration that are 
						more secure are coveted and will be even more so in the 
						future. But, Macedonia is also under pressure by the 
						international financial institutions to decrease the 
						size of the public administration. The future for towns 
						like Stip then, sEAM bleak.    

 

The present is 
						not idle either. Andon Mahojsev, Stip representative of 
						the Alliance of Trade Unions of Macedonia (the country’s 
						largest and oldest trade union), points to a little book 
						of some 80 pages with a black cover on his desk.  It has 
						the title Black Book – Stories from Stip and Karbinci 
						and is a collection of 150 statements of those who lost 
						out in the Macedonian transition. There are many 
						disturbing evidence of social decay and poverty. 
						Families have lost hope in the system and the state. 
						Young and old reveal that jobs are difficult to find and 
						that those that are available are poorly paid. Working 
						from dawn to dust for meager pay not being able to raise 
						children properly is a stark contrast to the conditions 
						and life styles of workers in socialist times.

 

Let us explore 
						some of the typical stories. In 1990, Kiril Dimitrov and 
						his wife were both employed as tailors in cloth producer
						Astibo, earning the equivalent of 700 € a month 
						together.  Their son and daughter were then 12 and 16 
						years old.  Milancho Manev was a worker in textile 
						producer Makedonka when it still had over 5,000 
						employees.  Stojan Stojanov, a former football player, 
						was also employed by Makedonka, as was his wife.  
						Zoran Andonovski, the son of a manager in a socialist 
						trading company, was in his last year at the Stip 
						Commercial Middle School.  Riste Basharov was 
						figher-fighter in Astibo, and his wife, with a 
						degree in economics, was working in Makedonka.  
						


 

Today, in 2005, 
						Kiril Dimitrov and his wife are still working as tailors 
						in the private sector, together earning about half as 
						much as they did 15 years ago (350 €).  Their son has 
						completed the secondary textile school and has been 
						unemployed for eight years.  He is drEAMing of 
						leaving the country.  The daughter is an economist, 
						married in Skopje.  Milancho Manev lost his job and 
						income and is today unable to pay his water bills.  A 
						newspaper reported that last summer there were another 
						100 people who, like him, worked for public utility 
						companies instead of paying their bills.  Stojan 
						Stojanov has also lost his job, and lives today of the 
						salary of his wife, who now works for a private clothes 
						producer.            
						 

  
						 

Not all textile 
						families have fared badly.  Zoran Andonovski is today a 
						manager of a company employing 60 people and producing 
						women’s blouses.  However, the annual profits of his 
						company are below 10,000 Euros; the lifestyle this 
						allows resembles that of a qualified worker in the 1980s 
						more than that of a successful entrepreneur.  Riste 
						Basharov has done best of all, taking over a private 
						pastry shop from his parents and expanding 
						successfully.  He has, however, left the world of 
						clothes and textiles behind.    


V.      MOVING UP 
						



 


How 
						can textile companies move up the value added chain?  
						What is most profitable today?  In clothing 
						manufacturing biggest profits are made from combinations 
						of skill-intensive activities, such high-value research, 
						design, sample making, sales, marketing and financial 
						services.  Improvements in quality control, packing, 
						warehousing and transport also earn large profits within 
						the clothing industry. As profitability is greatest in 
						these parts of the Global value chain it is 
						natural that there are high entry barriers for new 
						firms. In fact, leading clothing retailers and 
						manufacturers spend lavish advertising budgets and 
						promotional campaigns to create and sustain Global 
						brands. They use sophisticated and costly information 
						technology to lower costs and to have a “quick response” 
						to fashion whims of the public. In the world trade of 
						apparel, leading retailers, designers and marketers link 
						overseas factories with product niches in their main 
						consumer markets. Suppliers often need to undertake 
						frequent shipments to replenish stocks in retailer’s 
						stores. Working under tight schedules it is extremely 
						difficult for local suppliers to acquire the skills and 
						move from contract manufacturing to a full-package 
						supply and then to develop new production and marketing 
						niches.


 


Upgrading within production requires countries and 
						suppliers to co-contract with buyers, to provide both 
						the raw materials (i.e. textile cloth) and finished 
						garments achieving a ‘full-package’ of services - from 
						textile production to cutting, sewing, and packaging. 
						Full package production thus means that an EU retailer 
						can go to a Macedonian manufacturer and say ‘we want so 
						many thousand jackets; we will send the designs to you 
						down the line’. The Macedonian firm then gets the raw 
						material, designs the jackets according to the EU 
						retailer’s master plan, makes them, packs them and sends 
						them directly back to the EU.  


 


Thus 
						there will be a new premium on skilled labor, as 
						companies have to extend their range of skills from just 
						sewing and stitching. Compared with the mere assembly of 
						imported inputs, full-package production fundamentally 
						changes the relationship between buyer and supplier in a 
						direction that gives far greater autonomy and learning 
						potential for industrial upgrading to the supplying 
						firm.   


 


However, a move to a full package of services is very 
						difficult to achieve. It does not only require 
						improvement of production and design efficiency but also 
						financing, and expertise in marketing, material 
						sourcing, quality control, logistics (storage and retail 
						distribution). For example, efficiency in the marketing 
						of products increasingly becomes extremely important 
						factor of comparative advantage. Waiting for customers 
						to come is no longer sufficient to increase exports. 
						Marketing strategies have to be developed and applied. 
						Another factor in the consideration of comparative 
						advantage is the design and quality of products. 
						Permanent upgrading is essential for achieving, 
						maintaining and improving competitiveness. At the moment 
						the vast majority of Stip and Macedonian companies are 
						engaged in the assembly phase of the production of 
						clothes through outward processing agreements/programs. 
						This is a low value added activity which is very 
						vulnerable to market fluctuations.   


 


Delivering a full package of services is however still a 
						far step from producing own brands and etiquettes. 
						Improving through a functional upgrading means 
						moving into higher valued-added stages such as design, 
						branding, marketing and retailing and is more difficult 
						to achieve. Only when local firms are capable of making 
						retailer’s or branded buyer’s designs into finished 
						products on time, with volume and quality that fulfill 
						their standards they develop a potential to cut their 
						buyers and establish own brand names. This strategic 
						move requires services-related expertise in 
						designing, marketing, retailing, financing and the
						gathering of market intelligence on foreign 
						markets. The strategy has been tested in Turkey, Hong 
						Kong, and China where some leading manufacturers like 
						Mavi Jeans have launched their own brand names and 
						are entering retail distribution. Within this segment of 
						the clothing industry the biggest profits are being made 
						but upgrading is quite costly.


 


The 
						owner of EAM, Kole Patrakliski, a former worker 
						of Astibo, has succeeded in the business of 
						knitting and sewing.  

						EAM 
						has not only succeeded in achieving a full package of 
						service status but today is also a producer of own brand 
						apparel items. From a point of view of higher valued 
						added manufacturing this firm is the most successful 
						Stip producer. 
EAM 
						produces 100% of the clothing items under its own brand. 
						The company was founded in 1991 with 3 employees, while 
						today there are 45. Another forty are employed on a 
						part-time basis. Their basic activity is the production 
						of tricot fabrics and tricot garments. EAM aims 
						at vertically integrating production reducing costs for 
						purchasing textiles from abroad. Since January 2005 they 
						are trying to grow cotton on a small field near Stip and 
						have also experimented producing textiles for their own 
						products. EAM exports to Germany, Switzerland, 
						Slovakia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Last year he made 
						profits of about 2,1 million denars, or 35,000 Euros.
						



 


Very 
						few clothing producers from Stip are moving up and 
						upgrading production. Besides Kole’s EAM which 
						has own products marketed and sold abroad, few 
						companies make own designed clothes: Gracija 
						(with about 5% own production) Mond (10%) 
						Beas-s 20%, Briteks 15%, Milano/Modena 
						50%, Zen/Vivendi, 20% and Sthipko 30%.
						

						Moreover, only a 
						small number of Stip producers (11) such as: Anateks, 
						Kit-Go, Starteks, Beas-s, Star-teks, Stipko, Do-na, 
						Stilteks, Ziziteks, Makteks, and Galija 
						manufacture only or predominantly jackets, coats and 
						other more sophisticated semi-heavy and “heavy 
						apparel (tailored).”




 


Upgrading is difficult task if you cannot find partners 
						to sell your products. Stip companies have low 
						managerial and marketing skills. Many of the managers of 
						the new private companies come from the old textile 
						companies. There are numerous others besides Kole from
						EAM.  For example, eight 
						out of nine companies that bought the premises of 
						Astibo are run by former 

						Astibo 
						and Makedonka 

managers; Lars, Linea, V+E, Modena, Mont, Vabo, 
						Eskada and Vit. The last general manager of
						Astibo before the transformation, Panche Nasev, 
						also leads a clothing company, Zen. The father of Beti 
						Saneva, now the owner of Beas, one of the Stip’s 
						leading clothing companies, was one of the founders of
						Astibo. When it comes to exporting own products 
						Stip managers do business with old contacts from former 
						Yugoslavia. To find partners in Western Europe is a more 
						demanding task.  


 


Thus, 
						firms like Beas, which sews for Liz Claiborne 
						and is the largest semi-heavy producer with 250 
						employees producing coats, trousers, and jackets all 
						year round, exports own clothes to Bosnia, Croatia, 
						Kosovo and Albania only. In addition it produces goods 
						on the domestic market sold through 80 shops across 
						Macedonia, of those 17 being in Skopje. In order to 
						break out of ‘Lohn’ Beas is actively searching for new 
						business partners, regularly visiting international 
						trade (fashion) fairs- including Florence, Milano, 
						Düsseldorf, Paris. The company also plans to modernize 
						buying computer cutting system and a machine for 
						computerized ironing currently looking for second hand 
						machines in the Netherlands, Belgium. Until recently, 
						Beas worked through an intermediary- but in the 
						summer they contracted their partner directly.


 


Another good example is Milano, which first started out 
						with 30 employees and produced only for own brand 
						Modena. The manager rented a 400 sq. meter shop in 
						the center of Stip, hired young people and trained them, 
						and bought old sewing machines from Greece. From the 
						beginning besides contract manufacturing they exported, 
						to all former Yugoslav markets- destinations which were 
						familiar to the manager and where he had business 
						contacts during the time of Astibo. In 2003, 
						Milano moved to the large production facilities located 
						on Astibo grounds. The move triggered Milano real 
						expansion with 120 employees and 3 production lines 
						producing 50 percent of the clothes under its own brand 
						and planning to stop ‘lohnarbeit’/ contract 
						manufacturing in the future. All marketing is currently 
						done by the manager and his daughter.  


 


Like 
						in the past, the intermediaries are very involved in 
						marketing since they have good contacts in the West. The 
						sale intermediaries or agents had a very important role 
						in the textile and clothing industry in the SFR Yugoslav 
						period. At that time in Macedonia there were two 
						intermediary companies: Inteks and Makoteks. 
						Dealing with export of finished products and import of 
						raw materials and fabrics, Inteks was a trade 
						representative of a large conglomerate of 25 
						factories/producers from Macedonia. Makedonka and
						Astibo were members of Inteks. In fact, the 
						government of socialist Macedonia urged the smaller 
						apparel producers to join Inteks.[63] 
						In the 1985 “Inteks” had 58 percent of the total 
						turnover and 47 percent of the profits of the textile 
						and apparel producers in the Socialist Republic of 
						Macedonia, and made exports worth 22.8 million USD in 
						the Western markets and 30.7 in the socialist block.[64] 
						Today, the company has lost its intermediary position 
						and the owner Zoran Azmanov lives of renting the real 
						estate of the company.  


 


Former managers of Inteks have however, continued with 
						the old job. The two directors and partners of Texico, 
						a leading sales intermediary, Mr. Gruevski and Mr. 
						Vaskov, are an example. Texico exists since 
						November 2002 and employs six persons working with 10 
						foreign partners mainly from Germany, but also from 
						Italy and Belgium. Texico is intermediary in the 
						annual sale of one million pieces of apparel. Their way 
						of business is to negotiate deals with the foreign 
						buyers, together with the local producers. Texico’s 
						profit margin is five percent. The annual turnover of 
						Texico is around two million Euros.  


 


While
						Lavishbelt, INT, Polaris and Etra have 
						about the same annual turnover as Texico the biggest 
						company in this business nowadays is Global, 
						employing about 80 people and with an annual turnover of 
						about EUR 12 million. Global’s 80 percent of its 
						customers are from the EU, particularly from Germany, 
						Netherlands, Italy and England, and 20 percent are from 
						the USA. Global cooperates with the well 
						established German clothing company Steilmann Group. 
						The owner, Mr.Vladimir Ichokaev has built a logistical 
						centre in Skopje with a own clothing facility, a customs 
						depot, and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) with 
						computer-aided design (CAD) systems and plans to invest 
						in a laboratory for washing clothes. Some 60 other 
						companies throughout Macedonia manufacture for 
						Mr.Ichokaev.  


 


International aid programs like the Swiss Import 
						Promotion Program (SIPPO) aim at helping Macedonian 
						clothing companies improve marketing skills and find 
						contacts in the West. SIPPO, a service of the Swiss 
						State born out of the idea to support countries, that 
						have a large trade deficit with Switzerland, providing
						information for the Macedonian companies through 
						gathering general publications on the sector, through 
						contact to contact, and market overviews (in preparation 
						for textiles). SIPPO also organizes meetings between 
						Swiss clients and Macedonian producers, and various 
						trainings and seminars. Moreover, SIPPO organizes visits 
						to different fairs for producers of home textile. The 
						clothing manufacturers have not been helped in such a 
						way since most of them do contract manufacturing and 
						there is “little sense in representing at such events.” 
						Instead SIPPO has prepared a booklet of some of the 
						bigger Macedonian lohnveredelung producers having at 
						least 50 employees. Through the booklet SIPPO helps 
						apparel producers directly find partners. This activity 
						however, in a way disturbs the work of the 
						intermediaries as it empowers the apparel manufacturers 
						to make direct deals with buyers.


 


In 
						addition, the Dutch Government Agency CBI[65], 
						has recently started an “Export Development Program” 
						(EDP), to help the Macedonian textile sector to diminish 
						the share of lohnveredelung in the production of 
						Macedonian garments and invest into own collections 
						and/or move towards full-package services. The EDP, 
						envisaged to last for 4-5 years, is planned to be 
						launched in the beginning of 2006 with a total budget of 
						slightly more than 1 million Euros. CBI plans to help 
						through introducing Macedonian exporters to importers 
						from the EU, providing on-line access to updated market 
						information and business-to-business services, enabling 
						access to CBI’s “Trade Intermediary Service”, organizing 
						trainings in Netherlands as well as visits to fashion 
						fairs in EU.   


 


The 
						USAID supports the textile sector through two projects: 
						the Macedonian Competitiveness Activity’s Textile 
						Cluster) and the E-biz project (which established a 
						technological transfer centre in Stip and created the 
						Macedonian Fashion Portal). In June 2003, MCA 
						facilitated the establishment of the Macedonian National 
						Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness Council (NECC), 
						which on competitive basis selected the areas where 
						clusters will be promoted.[66] 
						The Council has two members from the clothing industry, 
						Gjorgji Miladinov the owner of Kimiko, and 
						Vladimir Ichokaev from Global. Following the 
						establishment of the lamb meet and cheese cluster; the 
						tourism cluster; the wine cluster; and the IT cluster in 
						the summer of 2004, the Council decided to found a 
						textiles cluster. Jasmina Miteva owner of Magnolia, was 
						originally a member of the Council too. She, together 
						with Mr. Ichokaev made the presentation in favor of 
						selecting clothing production as a new cluster. The fact 
						that the textile cluster was founded only year and a 
						half before the project is to be closed, questions the 
						criteria on which the clusters were selected, especially 
						because textiles alone is as important for Macedonia as 
						all the other economic activities together. The textile 
						cluster was established with the main objective to 
						improve the competitiveness of the companies in this 
						sector through introducing improved work methods in 
						production, sales, marketing and so on, and attracting 
						adequate buyers for its products.  


 


The 
						MCA’s Textile Cluster helps Macedonian companies take 
						part and market their products at industry fairs, most 
						recently at the Fair in Copenhagen in February, and the 
						Milan Fashion Fair held in early March, 2005. In 
						September they helped another 5 companies to display at 
						another fair in Milano including the Astibo 
						Export Consortium (Milano, Vit and Linea). MCA’s 
						Textile Cluster synchronizes its activities with the 
						Trade Textile Association (TTA) founded in late October 
						2003 by a number of clothing producers, supported by the 
						mighty intermediaries and policy makers, such as the 
						representative of the Ministry of Economy. The TTA 
						quickly filled the space occupied during the socialist 
						times by the increasingly passive Textile and Garment 
						Association of the Economic Chamber. A number of apparel 
						companies from Stip participate in the activities of the 
						TTA and the Textile Cluster.[67] 
						Moreover, the Council of Leadership of the Textile 
						Cluster consists of 8 members out of which 5 stem from 
						Stip while the leading person of Global Vladimir 
						Ichokaev, is in charge of the marketing and promotional 
						activities of the Cluster. Unfortunately the Cluster’s 
						activities are set to end in 2006. A question remains 
						what would happen with the institutions formed by the 
						Cluster, the TTA planning to join efforts and merge with 
						the Economic Chamber Association.   


 


Another tool for improving marketing is the web portal 
						“Fashion MK” launched in April 2005. This  fashion 
						portal is a “business-to-business 
						(B2B) online marketplace,” a joint-venture 
						between E-biz and Macedonian partner Ein-Sof. 
						Currently the portal has 36 registered members, 6 from 
						Stip, and is trying to interconnect international buyers 
						and suppliers with Macedonian manufacturers as a 
						“virtual intermediary”. Fashion MK has an ongoing 
						communication with the Textile Cluster, the Trade 
						Textile Association and the Economic Chamber. It helped 
						organize presentations of Macedonian companies at 
						fashion fairs in Milan and Madrid and endorses Russia 
						and Ukraine should be target market for Macedonian 
						companies.[68] 
						“Fashion MK” facilitates collaboration with Economic 
						Chambers from Russia, Italy and France.


 


Although the portal is operational it is not yet fully 
						updated with information, the investments page having 
						almost no data for example. Still since its opening the 
						portal has attracted quite an attention, with the number 
						portal visitors increasing from 800 in July 2005 to 1862 
						in October 2005. Until early November 2005, there were 
						90 advertisements altogether, the service being free for 
						foreigners, but costing 30 Euros for the Macedonian 
						companies. The portal’s software however, is limited. It 
						is not designed to promote Macedonian designed clothes 
						but the facilities of the companies that produce 
						lohnveredelung. It currently offers a virtual showroom 
						and virtual fashion catalogue and there are also links 
						to the companies’ web sites. For 50 Euros a domestic 
						company can attach 15 photos from its fashion line on 
						the portal. Although it surfaced as an idea, making new 
						specialized software enabling comprehensive on-line 
						presentation of Macedonian garment manufacturers is not 
						in the business plan of the portal. Although the E-biz 
						project was initially supposed to end on 31st 
						December 2005, the portal is to continue receiving 
						support until September 2006. According to the business 
						plan approved by E-biz and Ein-Soft the 
						Fashion MK should became self-sustainable within 
						three years.


 


In 
						order to move up, besides marketing skills, Stip textile 
						companies need access to raw materials and accessories. 
						Unlike lohn production, where the materials are shipped 
						by the buyer, when making own clothes Macedonian 
						manufacturers need to source all the necessary 
						materials. Given that Macedonian production of cloth and 
						fibers has since the transformation plummeted, clothing 
						producers need to procure materials for own 
						manufacturing from abroad. This is a task in itself. 
						Take Beas for an example. In the past they had a 
						bad experience with a delivery from Turkey that had low 
						quality and faulty materials.[69] 
						Today they cooperate with an intermediary firm from 
						Belgrade for importing raw materials, bought from Japan, 
						Korea, Italy, and Holland.  


 


On 
						the other had, a recent fashion line produced through by
						Astibo Export Group, a joint effort of three Stip 
						companies Milano, ViT, and Linea, was made 
						with Italian materials making it costly and difficult to 
						sell. Availability of cheap raw materials form other 
						countries is strongly conditioned by the state regulated 
						custom duties for import. On the other hand, EU policies 
						of regional diagonal cumulation also affect Stip export 
						oriented producers as they are not able to source cheap 
						raw materials from countries like Turkey or Bulgaria, 
						process them and sell the final products to the EU under 
						made in Macedonia labels.[70] 
						



 


Clothing manufacturers that aim at moving up also need 
						to have good designers to produce new innovative, trendy 
						items. Although Milano for example, has 3 in-house 
						designers there are few Macedonians educated in clothing 
						design. There is the Macedonian Fashion Formation 
						established in the spring 2005, although the founders 
						informally gathered and discussed contemporary issues 
						relevant to the clothing industry already a year before.[71] 
						The formation currently has 10 members (recently their 
						membership grew) while in the country there are around 
						15 designers, mostly from Academia Italiana, an 
						Italian school for design The Formation is also 
						represented in the MCA’s Cluster, trying to engage the 
						clothing producers. Yet most of the managers are 
						resistant and sceptical to take on fashion designers, 
						those represented in the Textile Cluster proposing that 
						the fashion designers and the textile companies should 
						equally share the costs of investment in the creation of 
						a Macedonian brand. This is mission impossible for the 
						designers, as they are usually not wealthy and lack 
						finances for such an investment. There is an uneasy 
						relationship between the two groups. The fashion line 
						produced by Astibo Export Group was made by a 
						Slovenian designer, the companies believing that the 
						Slovenian designer will help their collection be 
						promoted on European markets.  


 


Clothing manufacturers that aim at moving up also need 
						to digitize production and buy sophisticated machinery 
						and computers. Integrating computer-aided manufacturing 
						(CAM) with computer-aided design (CAD) systems produces 
						quicker and more efficient manufacturing processes. This 
						methodology is applied in different manufacturing areas. 
						Tailors like Mihajlo and his wife from the previous 
						section are no more needed in modern clothing producing 
						companies. Cutting the patterns of blouses or shirts is 
						no more done by human hand, machines do it. The 
						advantage of the CAD system is that the apparel 
						producers that use it make maximum use of the cloth and 
						minimize the work done manually. Moreover, the CAM 
						cutting is about 10% to 20% cheaper and faster than 
						hand-made cutting. But these computerized robots are 
						quite expensive to buy and only few companies in 
						Macedonia have bought them. CAD and CAM machines cost up 
						to 200,000 Euros and are found only in the Skopje based 
						clothing producer ORKA, and Global, and 
						the Stip based logistics company Birkart. They 
						are much needed and Beas for example is in the moment 
						looking for second hand machines in the Netherlands, 
						Belgium. Stipteks has also recently ordered a CAM 
						machine from its partner in Germany. Mavis, Albatros, 
						and Milano have also recently invested buying CAD 
						systems.


 


Easy 
						access to finances and cheap loans is of vital 
						importance for the apparel producers in Stip and 
						Macedonia in general because the moving up needs serious 
						capital investment. Besides buying updated machinery the 
						company planning to move up has to plan for other costs. 
						If a firm is to procure fabrics and other basic 
						materials on its own, instead of relying on the foreign 
						partners, it needs to invest a substantial amount of 
						money. For example, for 50,000 shirts to be made the 
						firm will need to buy 80,000 meters of fabrics plus 
						basic materials such as threads or buttons. The costs of 
						this procurement might be up to EUR 500,000. 
						Additionally, one should bear in mind that it will take 
						some time to produce and transport the shirts and a 
						period of time before the Western partner pays the 
						order. During this period the firm has to pay the 
						workers, the custom clearance house, the transport 
						company, etc. Two to three months may pass before the 
						Macedonian producer paid for the job done, meantime 
						investing substantial own financial resources.  


 


A big 
						problem for moving up of clothing producers therefore, 
						is the availability of cheap capital. The Macedonian 
						financial system is far from being developed as it lacks 
						many financial instruments and institutions existing in 
						Western countries, while those which are active are 
						either still undeveloped. That is a serious drawback, 
						particularly taking into consideration the low level of 
						domestic capital accumulation and the low level of FDI 
						in the country. While it takes a lot of capital to 
						invest in a new collection, bank credits are very 
						expensive. High interest rates (at least 10%) of the 
						commercial banks through which most credit lines are 
						administered and the high collaterals they require, 
						limit the access to finance of the companies and 
						determine the low level or no investments in the 
						clothing-producing sector, which are essential for 
						upgrade of the production chain and production of “Made 
						in Macedonia” clothes.  


 


In 
						fact, the vast majority of the interviewed managers of 
						the clothing producing companies in Stip did identify 
						access to loans and other financial means as one of the 
						biggest problems in their work and plans for the future 
						(high interest rates of credits and bank loans, high 
						collateral demanded, underdeveloped equipment leasing 
						etc). Apparel companies from Stip most frequently use 
						the short-term loans with relatively unfavorable 
						interest rates, while averting the longer-term loans 
						because obtaining them requires the high collateral.[72]  
						The banking policy is created on a central level, 
						although from very recently, branches have started to 
						grant loans based on their own decision, particularly 
						when the loan amount is not huge. Compared to those in 
						the neighboring countries such as Bulgaria, or Serbia 
						and Montenegro, the offered loans in Macedonia (with key 
						interest rate amounting to 6,5%) are expensive and 
						unattractive. To overcome such difficulties and to 
						bridge capital needs, a number of Stip based companies 
						have initiated the idea of jointly opening a bank to 
						serve the interests of the clothing producers even.


    
						



Capital is a less of a problem for companies such as 
						Birkart and Canda, dominating one segment of the 
						clothing industry, logistics and transport. 
						Interestingly, these two are the only Stip companies 
						that had foreign capital invested in.  


						Birkart 
						is the only international logistics/transport company 
						with a branch office in Macedonia. 


It is 
						a classical foreign investment by a German company- and 
						to this day it is fully owned by German Birkart.[73]



The 
						Birkart offices are completely modern, high tech 
						computers, generally young staff and everyone seemed 
						very busy. All computers are directly connected to the
						Birkart Global software, allowing them to 
						trace any delivery of any product around the world- if, 
						a fabric is produced in China, shipped to Hamburg, 
						transported by a German company to Macedonia for ‘Lohn’, 
						tailored in Stip and returned to Germany, Birkart’s 
						software can trace the product from China to Stip and 
						into the final retail outlet in Germany. 

						Birkart, 
						dominates the logistics in the Macedonian clothing 
						sector. It works with 80 apparel companies in total, 30 
						suppliers from Stip, and 50 retailers based in West 
						Europe. The company also owns a customs depot (carinski 
						sklad) with around 3,000 sq. meters, to handle up to 
						300,000 pieces, where it does custom clearance for the 
						apparel producers.  They provide services like labeling 
						of clothes, packaging, sorting and they prepare all 
						paper work for the final transport and export to 
						European markets.[74]




 


A 
						close company to Birkart is New Trend Center 
						for Textile Technology founded in the beginning of 
						the year as a joint venture between Zmaj Promet, 
						and E-biz.[75] 
						New Trend provides CAD and CAM services to interested 
						Macedonian apparel producers. They began with promotion 
						of the CAM in May 2005, and the Stip apparel producers 
						are increasingly becoming to use the service. The CAD 
						system is being used in two shifts whiles the CAM in one 
						shift. New Trend has currently 50 customers, 26 
						of them from Stip. The number of New Trend’s 
						customers is increasing every month. The machines are 
						both located on the ground floor of the main building. 
						Companies in Germany only have to send the design per 
						email, and the raw materials, and “New Trend” then 
						prepares the clothing pieces for the companies using 
						sophisticated software. New Trend provides 
						quality control of the materials and supplies clothing 
						companies, like Milano for example, with the 
						accessory materials intended for CAD and CAM services 
						importing them from Italy. They closely cooperate with 
						the intermediary company “Global” from Skopje. 
						For New Trend and Birkart it would be 
						great if there are more companies moving to 
						full-packaging, using their Global networks.[76]





 

VI. Politics and the Macedonian T-shirt


 


 


The 
						Macedonian clothing industry is struggling to survive 
						the fast changing world trends. The situation is 
						alarming because most of the production is low value 
						added. Yes, the absolute figures for the export of 
						clothing items have risen. However, the rise in the 
						exports has not been equal for all clothing items. In 
						the last ten years the production of simple clothing 
						materials to make, such as women’s suits, blouses and 
						shirts have risen while more complicated to manufacture 
						items such as suits for men or women have experienced a 
						dramatic decline in production figures. The decline is 
						particularly striking in the manufacturing of men’s 
						suits.

Production of “light clothing/apparel” is simple and low 
						value added. It is mostly dependent on the availability 
						of cheap labor. Stip is running out of such labor and 
						there are signs for trouble already showing. The plea of 
						the manager of the first private clothing making 
						company, Stipteks Mr. Dushko Zendelski  is 
						particularly alarming:  


 


						“If the state institutions continue with this kind of 
						public policy, the managers will transfer their capital 
						in other areas, for example, I have bought a milk 
						company. If the things get even worse then they are now, 
						I will transfer my capital in that area. The situation 
						in the textile sector has a downfall tendency from the 
						war in 2001 until today. The prices for the products 
						have fallen in the period of the war and until now, they 
						are the same. But from the other hand, all the expenses 
						have increased. This is one of the mayor problems. The 
						grip over the neck is strengthening every day. I really 
						do not now how much longer we can last.”[78]


 


Public policies attempt to aid the manufacturers from 
						Stip and elsewhere. But are they succeeding? There are 
						three main policies that affect entrepreneurs and 
						employees in the sector: trade and customs policy, 
						social policy and education policy. Let us look at each 
						of these three in turn. The most important steps in the 
						area of trade and customs were taken in recent years 
						through joining the World Trade Organization and signing 
						Stabilization and Association Agreement with the 
						European Union.  Acceding to the WTO meant possibilities 
						for trade increased. Having an agreement with the EU 
						also gives more opportunities for export. But exporting 
						to the EU is not easy for Macedonian clothing 
						manufacturers, because on top of the costs of their 
						production they need to pay on average twelve percent of 
						custom fees in accordance with the EU system of 
						cummulation of rules of origin.


 


In 
						fact, for Macedonian clothes to become more competitive 
						on foreign markets two important issues remain to be 
						resolved; the issue of Macedonian customs fees on 
						imports of raw materials for the clothing producing 
						industry, and the issue of diagonal cummulation of 
						origin for exports to the EU.  In early July 2005 the 
						government introduced a temporary measure allowing 
						import of raw materials for clothing manufacturing 
						customs free of Macedonia’s custom duties.[79] 
						The impact of this measure in the first two months of 
						its application has been that “around a million euro 
						worth of goods has been imported under this provision”[80]. 
						This positive measure for the Macedonian clothing 
						industry is now enforced under the new Customs Law 
						(implemented from January 2006).   


 


On 29th 
						June, 2005, the Minister of Economy announced that “from 
						January 2006 Macedonia will become member of the 
						European system of diagonal cummulation which will allow 
						the Macedonian clothing products to be exported in the 
						EU without custom fees. This will have a positive impact 
						on the overall economy and will improve the business 
						climate of the country and attract foreign investments”[81].


 


However the situation with diagonal cumulation is far 
						from resolved.  Macedonian did not become a member of 
						the European system of diagonal cummulation. A 
						significant part of the responsibility for this 
						situation lies with EU. The Commission agrees “regarding 
						diagonal cummulation the [former Yugoslav Republic of] 
						Macedonia fulfilled the conditions for accession to the 
						system which was particularly necessary for the 
						encouragement of foreign investment and the increase of 
						export.”[82] 
						Moreover, “there was a delay in the implementation of 
						this item of the Thessalonica Agenda, but the 
						responsibility for the slow progress was entirely on the 
						European Commission.”[83]


 But, 
						on a informal briefing held on June 22nd 
						2005, the EC offered to Macedonia and Croatia 
						sub-regional bilateral cummulation between the two 
						countries and the EU, and not membership in the Pan 
						European Association of diagonal cummulation, requested 
						by the Western Balkan countries several times and 
						promised by the EU at the 2003 Council Summit in 
						Thessalonica. In the same time EU is to extend the 
						afore-mention association to the Mediterranean countries 
						(Algeria, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and etc.)



 


Why 
						has there been no more lobbying to change this? 
						Macedonian Government has asked the EU to allow 
						Macedonia into the system of diagonal cumulation, and 
						has built administrative capacities for this to happen. 
						However, the lobbying from the side of the producers and 
						the traders with clothing has been insufficient. In the 
						case of the Mediterranean countries, strong support for 
						their application was given from the retail chains in 
						Europe that sell the clothes produced in these 
						countries. Macedonian producers did not lobby the 
						European retail chains. Neither did the Macedonian 
						traders with clothing. What is more they are not 
						organized separately in two different associations and 
						thus can not easily partner up with European lobby 
						groups such as the “EUROcommerce” (association of 
						European traders) and the “EUROtex” (association of 
						European clothing producers) position papers of which 
						they could use to influence EU policy on rules of origin 
						towards Macedonia. Macedonian clothing producers should 
						stop looking up to the government to solve this problem 
						of theirs and look up European partners to aid them.[84]


 


Who 
						is affected by the customs and cummulation issue? To 
						understand this, let us look at the companies we 
						presented from Stip. Those companies that produce their 
						own products for domestic market, but are highly 
						interested to export them to the EU, such as Modena, 
						VIT, Linea, Beas, Stipko, Gracija, EAM and 
						Briteks are most affected. They are sourcing raw 
						materials to make Macedonian clothes from countries like 
						Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.[85] 
						Under the new customs regulations they do not pay 
						customs for import of cloth and other raw materials. 
						However, in order to export the clothes made of these 
						materials in Europe, the Stip companies have to pay on 
						average 12% customs once the goods arrive in the EU. If 
						Macedonia is a member of the EU system of diagonal 
						cummulation the clothes of the Stip producers would 
						cumulate origin and would be possible to export them 
						customs free to the EU. In this case the Macedonian 
						clothes would be 12% cheaper and therefore more 
						competitive for EU markets.     


 


The 
						second main area that affects the competitiveness of 
						clothing companies is the area of social policy. The 
						Labor Law has been one of the main concerns of 
						Macedonian producers.  Albatros, Metro Premier 
						and others have complained to our researchers that their 
						“work is cyclical (made in specific time period, the 
						‘busy seasons’) and our workers need to work hard during 
						high season sometimes against the legal regulations 
						(they have to work Saturdays and extra hours, whereas 
						the law allows 40 hours a week).” Paying overtime 
						increases the company’s labor costs, whereas “foreign 
						partners are ready to leave Macedonia if the prices are 
						lower for a cent elsewhere.” Therefore, most of the 
						employers in the clothing sector require change in the 
						labor law and the collective agreements allowing work in 
						the clothing sector to be treated as seasonal work. 
						Others like Stipko’s Technical Director, Dejan 
						Popovski claim that “the Labor Law is not a problem for 
						us because we work in 2 shifts, 7 hours each.” He blames 
						the others for not planning well the production. “The 
						managers are greedy; they often overestimate their 
						capacities to deliver.”[86]




 


On 
						the other hand workers feel exploited by the owners of 
						the private apparel companies as they do not get paid 
						for the extra hours of their work. They cherish the 
						socialists time when they had to work for only 8 hours 
						per day and have been earning 350-400 Euros per month, 
						as opposed to the 150 they earn nowadays. The struggle 
						is over the value of the guaranteed minimal salary for 
						the clothing producing sector.[87] 
						On the other hand, the government, responding to the 
						numerous critics from international organizations and 
						the businesses that the Labor regulations are not 
						flexible enough[88] 
						adopted a new labor law that entered into force on 8th 
						September 2005. With this law a more flexible hiring and 
						firing arrangements were introduced.  


 


The 
						new Labor Law requires the employers to pay the overtime 
						and contributions for that overtime. In Macedonia the 
						social protection and health contributions account for 
						about 36% of the net salary. On the top of it, the 
						employers have to pay additional 15% for the personal 
						income tax. This has been a heavy burden to the 
						employers and many of them do not register all their 
						employees. Some of the workers in the clothing sector 
						complain about overtime abuses. When the labor costs are 
						the main factor determining the fate of an industry 
						obviously there is a clash of interests between the 
						managers and the employees concerning workers rights and 
						respecting the laws. It is difficult to find a solution 
						to the race to the bottom concept. While managers would 
						like to keep prices of production lowest possible, the 
						state needs to collect revenues from taxes and keep the 
						social welfare system functioning.[89]



 

Export of own 
						goods to the European markets is very far from the plans 
						and actual work of most producers of clothes. To be able 
						to design such clothes one needs adequately educated 
						staff, managers with a vision and clothing designers. A 
						clear vision is in a short supply in Stip. One of the 
						managers of the Stip clothing produces for example 
						bemoaned the perspectives of the integration of 
						Macedonia to the EU  as this would only cause the 
						downfall of the clothing producing sector.[90] 
						Indeed, many 
						of the managers of the clothing companies, CRPM 
						interviewed feel a need to get additional training in 
						management and marketing. Their knowledge of foreign 
						languages is very low and hardly any of them uses 
						internet. Moreover, although there are few designers in 
						Macedonia, none of them are educated in making fashion 
						at home. This is a general problem. It effects both 
						those that want or export own clothes abroad and those 
						who just sew for foreign buyers. Thus, Macedonian 
						clothing producers that want to co-contract, to make 
						direct deals with foreign buyers, need to exhibit 
						clothing samples. But there are few who can design their 
						sample shirts. There is no school of design in 
						Macedonia. Clearly then, the upgrade of the textile 
						production is related with the available human resources 
						which is contingent upon the existence of adequate and 
						good quality educational institution.


 


This 
						leads us to an analysis of the education policy in 
						clothing and textiles. Majority of the people that live 
						and work in Stip are poorly educated. The clothing 
						producing workers usually have only primary or at most 
						secondary school. But even graduating from high school 
						is a rare occurrence in Stip. Most of the people in this 
						town have elementary education only.

When 
						one considers the state of affairs in the educational 
						sector this is not a surprise. The secondary textile 
						school in Stip can serve as an example. Closely 
						cooperated with Makedonka for years, together 
						with the secondary school in Tetovo, it is the oldest 
						institution teaching students the textile and the 
						apparel trade.  Each year about 230 students graduate, 
						170 from a four year program and 60 from a three year 
						program. There is a lack of space for practical 
						instruction, i.e. apparel work as there are only 2 
						workshops for that purpose. That is why students are 
						sent to practice in five apparel companies Vabo, 
						Elena, Mavis, Viteks, and Beas. However, 
						there, due to various reasons they are not allowed to 
						practice much and are typically only let to observe the 
						apparel production. Due to the lack of space it is “an 
						art to properly train the students of apparel 
						production.”[91] 
						Another related problem is the old machines used in the 
						workshops.[92]




 


An 
						institution that should be teaching design is the 
						Macedonian Institute for Textiles in Skopje. The 
						institute exists for 35 years. In the past it had a 
						study program in textile engineering. Due to a dramatic 
						decline in the basic textile production, and a decreased 
						interest for enrollment in this program, in the academic 
						year 1999/2000 a program for clothing engineers was 
						opened. However, even though the program name was 
						changed, the teaching staff and the curriculum 
						essentially remained the same. The program has very old 
						curricula that  

does not offer 
						graduate students design skills. Paradoxically, the 
						curriculum is heavy on mathematics, chemistry and 
						physics and there 
						are only two design related courses, and no management 
						and marketing courses.  

 

Moreover, the 
						program offers  


						almost no practical exercises in clothing manufacturing.
						 This is 
						costly to organize as it requires equipment, time and 
						space, as well as experience in manufacturing clothes 
						which unfortunately the university professors do not 
						have. In the same tie their 
						colleagues in Romania work in computer labs operating 
						with CAD and CAM machines. There is a lack of interest 
						to enroll in the program. Even the quota of places 
						offered with free tuition is not filled at the time of 
						enrollment. Just two students have graduated so far.
						
The 
						students testify that “even after graduation they have 
						not seen how clothes are manufactured, so how would they 
						know to resolve any manufacturing problem.”[93] 
						Since this is a public institution the government should 
						consider modernizing it as quickly as possible.  

In 
						fact, there is interest in such kind of education. 
						Although in Macedonia there is not a design school, 
						there are 15 educated designers; most of them graduates 
						from the Florence based Academia Italiana. The same 
						school is interested in opening a branch in Strumica. 
						Since this is a matter of long term interest, the public 
						policy concerning this initiative should be aimed at 
						reducing legal or political barriers for opening this 
						academy.  


 

The clothing 
						sector, as the overall industry, does not have a defined 
						strategy that will be conducive to growth and innovation 
						and enhance the economic competitiveness of Macedonian 
						clothing.  

The 
						Ministry of Economy has in its jurisdiction to create a 
						coherent policy and regulatory framework for the textile 
						and clothing sector. The Ministry has an industrial 
						department within which only one person specifically 
						overlooks the developments in the industry that 
						contributes with 32% of the total exports and employs 
						every tenth Macedonian. This section of the industrial 
						department of the Ministry after fifteen years finally 
						succeeded in receiving 8 million denars (131.000 Euros) 
						in 2004 from Swiss Compensation Funds to cover the 
						expenses of an expert EAM that will develop the 
						new Textile Strategy. And if the tendering process did 
						not stall in the bureaucratic labyrinths of the Ministry 
						by October 2005 Macedonia would have had a Textile 
						Strategy. Now the 58 Stip based textile companies and 
						many others will have to wait until no specific date in 
						2006 for the guidelines of their sector’s future 
						development to be prepared. Macedonia does not have an 
						industrial strategy document, and needs to define an 
						industrial strategy encouraging growth and enhancing 
						economic competitiveness. What better way to start 
						preparing an overall industrial strategy but by writing 
						such a plan for the sector that produces the most export 
						items in the country.

							Sector Consolidated Report, IFM and partners, 
							February 2004, data from
							www.bgtextiles.org,
							www.romtextiles.com, and CRPM own research. 
							Employers in the sector pay obligatory contributions 
							for their workers to the Pension and the Health 
							Insurance Fund claiming an average salary of 4,500 
							denars per month. In reality the salaries are 
							a bit higher ranging from 6,000 MKD in the 
							economically weakest to 11,000 MKD in the strongest 
							apparel producing enterprises. We have taken the 
							average salary to be 8,500 MKD per month thereby 
							calculating the labor costs per hour given in the 
							text. In fact there is a discrepancy in the 
							registered salaries and the actually paid ones in 
							other countries in the world too. For example 
							Werner’s report notes that “the average labor costs 
							might not always check with the official statistics 
							of the respective countries for the textile 
							industry. They are based on data collected and made 
							available to Werner and are a realistic 
							representation of the actual labor costs.”


[60]             About 5,630 women 
							age 15-40 are not employed in clothing production. 
							In Stip there are

2000 female high school students in the age group 15 
							to 19. There are 741 female students at the 
							faculties of geology and mining and pedagogy of the 
							University of Cyril and Methodius in Stip. Although 
							not all of them are from Stip, a majority are most 
							likely. When one considers that young women from 
							Stip also study in Skopje or elsewhere, and that 
							some work in the other economic sectors then is 
							becomes clear that all women that want to work in 
							clothing manufacturing in Stip are employed. 



[61]             Radovish is a 
							mining city established by the workers in the copper 
							mine Buchim. 

In the transition period, the mine went through 
							bankruptcy has not been restarted. Meanwhile the 
							town developed a new niche, clothing manufacturing. 
							This sector nowadays employs many of the women in 
							the following companies: Koneli, Dekortex, Edinstvo, 
							branches of Stiptex, and ORKA. Sveti Nikole on the 
							other hand is an agricultural city. Its economy is 
							concentrated around the food processing facilities 
							exploiting the cattle breeding and agriculture in 
							the town and surrounding areas. The main companies 
							of the town are MIK-meat processing industry, 
							LAKTIS- milk processing industry, BIM-producing 
							building materials and MODA-producing clothing, and 
							branch of Stip based LARS. Both cities are rather 
							poor, underdeveloped and stagnating.

[70]             Where countries 
							are linked by a series of identical free trade 
							agreement (FTA) agreements

diagonal cumulation allows for intermediates 
							originating in any one of these countries to be 
							included in determining originating status. Thus, 
							diagonal cumulation operates between more than two 
							countries provided they have FTAs containing 
							identical origin rules and provision for cumulation 
							between them. Although more than two countries can 
							be involved in the manufacture of a product it will 
							have the origin of the country where the last 
							working or processing operation took place, provided 
							that it was more than a minimal operation. Regional 
							cumulation is a form of diagonal cumulation, which 
							only exists under the Generalised System of 
							Preferences (GSP) and operates between members of a 
							regional group of beneficiary countries (e.g. 
							ASEAN). Diagonal cumulation operates between the 
							Community and the countries of the so-called 
							"pan-European cumulation zone".

							Globistic’.


[74]             
		Birkart’s

INDEX ………………………………………………………………………........ 679 V Andrija Štampar
120 years ago, in 1888 in a village of Drenovac, Croatia, Dr Andrija Štampar was
born. His work in the first half of the last century (he died in 1958) marked the
milestones and ways of modern social medicine and public health.
Between two World Wars, Štampar started organizing and materializing his
grandiose, revolutionary hygienic-epidemiological and preventive-prophylacticcurative programme. He paid the greatest attention to the control of serious social
diseases, and to tuberculosis, malaria, endemic syphilis, typhus, and trachoma in
particular.
In 1926 with the financial support of the Rockefeller Foundation he founded
the School of Public Health with a task to study conditions which might have
favourable or unfavourable impacts on people's health.
During that period he visited many countries in Europe, China (three times),
India, the USSR and others. In 1936 he obtained the post of an expert at the Health
Organization in Geneva. At the invitation from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1938,
he delivered the Cutter lecture in Boston. After Boston, he toured a great part of North
America and lectured on hygiene and social medicine at a series of universities (Yale,
Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Cincinnati, Vanderbilt, McHarry, Tulane, Texas, Los
Angeles, Berkley).
Much of Dr Štampar's life energy and mental capacity was devoted not only to
the establishment of a school of public health in his own country but also to the
creation and shaping of the World Health Organization (WHO). He was called “the
father of WHO” in Copenhagen, Geneva, Manila, in any place where WHO was
active. He contributed to developing the Statute of WHO and through the letters of
this international document he spread progressive ideas and fought against
colonialism, racism, and for the equality of all nations and all people.
The International Health Conference held in New York in 1946, attended by
official representatives of 51 nations, established an Interim Commission of 18 states,
and Dr Štampar was elected its Chairman. The Interim Commission was in fact the
World Health Organization but did not bear this name untill its ratification by the
United Nations. This Commission, under Dr Štampar's guidance, carried out an
extremely important task of establishing collaboration in health issues and helping the
economically weaker countries.
Dr Štampar was elected the President of the First World Health Assembly in
1948. In his later years, Dr Štampar again travelled to distant countries. In 1955, he
was in Afghanistan where, at the request of WHO, he gave advice about the
reorganization of the medical school in that country. The following year he visited
Egypt and Sudan, as the leader of a seminar for public health administrators. In 1957,
he went to Ethiopia to see the conditions under which the Medical School could be
established there. Then he went to Sudan again to study the problem of health
services.
In 1955 Professor Štampar was awarded the Leon Bernard Foundation Prize
and Medal, the greatest international recognition of merit in the field of social
medicine.
This year, when we celebrate the 120th Štampar anniversary, this book is
devoted to memory of his work. VI Preface
This is the fifth book planed to be published in a series as a support to teachers and
trainers in teaching public health in South Eastern Europe. Originally, planned to be
on the internet platform only, the Public Health in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE),
Forum for Public Health in the Eastern Europe (FPH-SEE) and the MetaNET projects
decided later to publish this training material also in hard copy form. The first four
books were published with the support of the PH-SEE, and the last two with
MetaNET project. Both projects are funded by the German Academic Exchange
Services (DAAD) with funds from the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.
The book Management in Health Care Practice is collection of 45 teaching
modules written by 49 authors from 8 countries. The teaching modules in this book
covered areas of principles of public health, management cycle (planning,
implementation and evaluation), technology and interventions, organization of health
care and health services, change, leadership and some other fields of health care.
Authors had full autonomy in preparation the teaching modules, they were
asked to present their own teaching/training materials with the idea to be as practical
and lively as possible. Having that in mind the reader and the user of the modules of
this book can sometimes find that some areas of management and organization of
health services are not covered, some are just tackled and some are more deeply
elaborated. The role of editors was more to stimulate the authors to write modules,
than to conduct or edit the content. Preparing and publishing this teaching/training
modules authors and editors expect and wish to support and improve public health
education and training of public health professionals.
The editors asked and stimulate authors to incorporate in their teaching
modules exercises, tests, questionnaires and other practical forms of training. We will
be thankful for any comments on use of them in everyday practice.

Health and Development, Health Inequalities, Public Health,
Health Care
After completing this module students and public health
professionals should:
• be aware of importance of relation between development and
health;
• recognize needs for doing analysis of health inequalities in the
country;
• know the areas of health related to development;
• improve the knowledge and understanding of the function of
the health care system.
Better health leads to faster economic growth which in turn, leads
to healthier populations. Historical studies have shown that a
substantial proportion of today's economic wealth can be
attributed directly to past achievements in the health sphere.
Health contributes to human capital through higher productivity,
securing labour supply, through skills and the savings that become
available for investment in physical and intellectual capital. Poor
health negatively influences labour market productivity as
measured by earnings and wages. At the same time, life
expectancy increases with income across countries, but at a rate
that becomes progressively lower as income increases due to
diminishing health returns to income. However, the relationship
between wealth and health is not as straightforward as was
previously thought. Rather, it seems to be a more complex and
multidimensional one and factors other than wealth exist that also
influence the health of populations.
Introductory lecture, small group, individual work and panel

The final mark should be derived from the quality of individual
work and assessment of the contribution to the group discussions. 2 HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Luka Vončina, Luka Kovačić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Although health is primarily described as an intrinsic good, it also has qualities of an
investment good. One could hardly disagree with the notion that better health leads to
faster economic growth which in turn, catalyzed by the equitable distribution of
wealth, leads to healthier populations. In other words, richer and more equitable
countries will have healthier populations which will in turn nourish their
development. A quote from the World Bank’s 2004 World Development Report
clearly summarizes the point: “broad improvements in human welfare will not occur
unless poor people receive wider access to affordable, better quality services in
health, education, water, sanitation, and electricity. Without such improvements in
services, freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy - two of the most important
ways poor people can escape poverty - will remain elusive to many” (1).
Table 1.Monetary value of life expectancy gains in selected CCEE-CIS countries, 1990 - 2003 Source: Marck Suhrcke, Regina Sauto Arce, Martin McKee and Lorenzo Rocco. The economic
costs of ill health in the European Region. Background document for the WHO European 3 Ministerial Conference on Health Systems “Health Systems, Health and Wealth”. Tallin,
Estonia, June 2008. The evidence that human capital contributes to economic growth and
development is abundant. Health contributes to human capital through higher
productivity, securing labour supply, through skills and the savings that become
available for investment in physical and intellectual capital (2). At the microeconomic
level, poor health negatively influences labour market productivity as measured by
earnings and wages (3). Evidence from the EU suggests that people reporting “very
good” or “good” health have earnings as much as four times higher than those with
“poor” or “very poor” health (4). The evidence that ill health reduces labour supply is
also ample (5). At the macroeconomic level, historical studies have shown that a
substantial proportion of today’s economic wealth can be attributed directly to past
achievements in the health sphere. It has been estimated, for example, that about 50%
of the economic growth experienced by the United Kingdom between 1780 and 1980
can be attributed to improved health and nutrition (6). Many studies have shown that
health helps to explain economic growth differences between poor and rich countries.
These findings can be used to predict future trajectories of per capita income on the
basis of a country’s reduction in mortality. The outcome of such an exercise in five
low- and middle income countries in CEE and the CIS showed that even relatively
modest scenarios bring substantial increases in GDP.
When compared with the base scenario of no change, an annual reduction in
mortality of just 2% would increase GDP by 26% in Kazakhstan and the Russian
Federation and by 40% in Georgia and Romania over 25 years (2).
The relationship between income inequality and mortality, as Backlund and al.
stated in a study in the United States, is only robust to adjustment for compositional
factors in men and women under 65. This explains why income inequality is not a
major driver of mortality trends in the United States because most deaths occur at
ages 65 and over. This analysis does suggest, however, the certain causes of death that
occur primarily in the population under 65 may be associated with income inequality.
Comparison of analytical techniques also suggests coefficients for income inequality
in previous multilevel mortality studies may be biased (7). CASE STUDY
While it is common knowledge that, within countries, rich people are more likely
to be healthy than poor people; are people in rich countries necessarily healthier
than the ones in poor countries?
The concept of health inequalities both within countries and among different
countries is a particularly interesting one as it has the potential to provide insight into
different factors that can influence health. As such, it has attracted a lot of attention.
For example, it has been found that, within countries, levels of income individuals
earn seem to play a significant role. According to Abel-Smith “the unskilled manual
group in the United Kingdom has twice the rate of limiting long standing illness
compared with the professional group” (8). Others, on the other hand, argue that
factors such as social position, relative as opposed to absolute deprivation in wealth,
control and social participation also seem to matter (9). 4 Before engaging into discussion about health and wealth, a few remarks should
be made about the indicators used to describe both. WHO’s 1948 definition of health
defines it as “A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not
merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. As Abel Smith lucidly points out the
definition “expresses high rhetorical ideals but gives no indication of how health can
be measured” (8). Furthermore, as the concept of health is a multidimensional one
(Baxter lists five dimensions: disease, disability, frequency of illness, malaise and
fitness (10)), it is hard to imagine a measure that would embrace them all and
accurately measure health. In practice, statistics of morbidity and mortality are
commonly used to measure ill health and give indications about health in general.
Unfortunately, apart from methodological problems, the task of measuring health
suffers also from practical ones. The quality of data collected varies widely across
countries and regions. In the WHO published edition “Measuring Socioeconomic
Inequalities in Health” Kunst and Mackenbach conclude that “data problems are
common and can easily lead to incorrect conclusion”. Therefore, data should be
observed and countries should be compared with caution (11).
The link between levels of wealth and health of different countries is often
regarded as a crucial one. In 1975 Preston showed that life expectancy increases with
income across countries, but at a rate that becomes progressively lower as income
increases due to diminishing health returns to income (12). Pritchett and Summers
claim that country differences in income growth rates over the last three decades
explain roughly 40 percent of the cross country differences in mortality
improvements. They estimate that if income were one percent higher in the
developing countries, as many as 33,000 infant and 53,000 child deaths would be
averted annually (13). Samuel Preston’s millennium curve (12) seems to follow the
same pattern of thought. The curve is a non-parametrically fitted regression function,
weighted by population. The slope of life-expectancy with respect to income,
described by Deaton, is steep in the group of poorest countries suggesting that at low
incomes, income itself could be strongly related to health (14). However, in the same
article, plotting changes in life expectancy from 1960 to 2000 against the
corresponding average annual rate of growth of GDP in real PPP dollars, Deaton finds
that “the connection between income and life-expectancy at low incomes may be
plausible but, even among the initially poorest countries, differences in income
growth explain less than a sixth of the variance in improvements in life expectancy,
and even an increase in the 30-year growth rate by 2 percent a year would add only 1
year to life-expectancy”.
This finding clearly suggests that the relationship between wealth and health is
not as straightforward as was previously thought. Rather, it seems to be a more
complex and multidimensional one and factors other than wealth may exist that also
influence health of populations.
The same conclusion could be drawn from the facts the health indicators of
populations vary between countries that have similar GDPs and that some countries
have similar health indicators at very different amounts of GDPs. Furthermore, some
poorer countries seem to have healthier populations than some richer ones. For
example, according to WHO data in 2000, Cuba had a life expectancy at birth of 76,8
years and a GDP per capita of USD 2723, while the United States of America with
an almost thirteen times higher GDP per capita of USD 34602 had exactly the same 5 life expectancy. China is another good example. Although in the year 2000 it had a
GDP of only USD 3,760, it had a life expectancy at birth (total population) of 70.8
years (3). Figure 1. Millennium Preston Curve.

Trade Forum, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC. May 13th- 14th, 2004. In the 1980s, the Rockefeller foundation selected five countries (China, Costa
Rica, Cuba, Kerala and Sri Lanka) that appeared to have higher expectation of life
than could have been expected from their level of wealth and commissioned studies of
their health development to determine possible causes to these discrepancies.
Common factors found in all of them were: above average equality of income, well
developed primary education that covered females, a heavy emphasis on nutrition,
land reforms, priority given to health and community participation and well
developed rural health care (Halstead et al. 1987) (15). The importance of the findings
the study discovered and their applicability to policymaking have since then attracted
a lot of attention and stimulated a lot of research.
In the recent years, it has become widely acknowledged that inequalities in the
distribution of income play a highly significant role in determining health of entire
populations. Although some authors do not completely agree with this conclusion (see
for example Mellor and Milyo, 2002) (16), most of the literature on the subject
approves it. Le Grand argues that across countries, an association can be found
between inequalities in health and inequalities in income (17). Wilkinson claims that
the extent of income inequality in societies determines their average health status. He
argues that as the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor increases, the health 6 status of citizens becomes worse and worse and that it undermines social cohesion
(18). According to Kennedy et al., inequalities in income at the state level exert an
independent effect on an individual's risk of reporting fair or poor health (19). The
relationship between economic growth, income inequalities and health status is an
even more interesting one. According to Dreze and Sen, economic growth per se does
not automatically improve health and social well being. They claim that unless it is
effectively distributed, it merely increases socio-economic differences (20).
Generally, two major interpretations exist about the exact way in which
income inequalities affect health. They do not necessarily negate each other, but
rather observe the problem from different angles. The first interpretation advocates
the importance of psychosocial process based on perceptions of place in the social
hierarchy (18). The advocates of this interpretation argue that such perceptions
produce negative emotions like shame and distrust that affect health directly by
psycho-neuro-endocrine mechanisms and indirectly through inducing behaviours like
alcohol consumption and smoking. The second interpretation, know as the neomaterial interpretation, sees income inequalities in a wider picture of historical,
cultural, economic and political processes. It argues that these processes influence the
general availability of food, education, health services, quality housing and other
segments of infrastructure that influence health (21). Therefore, it sees income
inequalities as a symptom of a wider array of social conditions and suggests that an
unequal distribution of all of them influences health negatively on the deprived.
A closer look at the findings of the Rockefeller study also reveals that all of the
“poor countries with good health” it examined gave high priority to education. Female
education seems to be a particularly powerful tool for improving health. The World
bank’s World development report 1993: Issues in health reveals that studies from 25
developing countries showed that even as little as one to three years of female
education seem to be able to reduce child mortality by about 15 percent. Similar
levels of male schooling showed to have a more limited effect, reducing child
mortality by 6 percent. The effects of female education on good health are
heterogeneous. On the one hand it is known that female education reduces fertility
and that reduced fertility has a positive effect on infant mortality. It seems plausible
that educated women take better care of themselves during pregnancy, pay more
attention to hygiene; appreciate maternal health services better than the uneducated
and thus act more positive to health in general.
The impacts of malnutrition, sanitation and other hygienic measures on health
are historically well known. In the reduction of deaths from infectious diseases in
England before 1935, these factors played a much more important role than
immunization and health services (22). The World Bank’s 1993 World Development
Report claims that risks such as poor sanitation, insufficient and unsafe water
supplies, poor personal and food hygiene, inadequate garbage disposal, indoor air
pollution and crowded and inferior housing account for nearly 30 % of the global
burden of disease (1). According to Halstead, most of the countries observed in the
Rockefeller foundation funded studies developed programs that laid a heavy emphasis
on food policies, water supplies and sanitation (15). The text has so far dealt with the
health effects of wealth, wealth distribution, education, nutrition, sanitation etc. But,
what is about healthcare? If all the above mentioned factors seem to play such
important roles in determining health statuses of populations, how big of an effect can 7 it have? According to the World Bank’s World Development Report 1993 (1), the
developing countries as a group could reduce their burden of disease by 25% if they
redirected a half of the funds they are currently spending on services of low cost
effectiveness to public health programs. Primary healthcare delivered to the needy
besides not being expensive seams to be especially important and effective.
According to Gwatkin et al. a “well designed and carefully implanted interventions
can reduce infant and child mortality by as much as one half, within five years, at a
cost below two percent of per capita income” (23).
Arguments presented in this text strongly suggest policy guidelines primarily
for developing, but also for developed countries. It could be argued that all of the
above mentioned determinants of good health seem to be interdependent and that they
seem to be a part of a bigger picture. It would appear that countries more orientated
towards social justice, equity, equality and social welfare, rather than to the
accumulation of power and capital in the hands of a minority, could expect their
populations to be healthier. Social and political structures of societies could thus
significantly influence health of populations. Most important determinants of good
health would be sustained firstly through political commitment to social justice,
equity and equality which would than manifest themselves by social commitment to
welfare, universal healthcare, a strong emphasis on education and the will to ensure
everybody decent living conditions, or in other words in a commitment to wellbeing
for the whole population, EXERICISE
Task 1: Analysis of link between GDP and health in the
region
Course participants should be divided into groups of 4-6. Group should first come to
the decision which health indicators are related to the income, investment and wealth.
Group has to select 5-7 indicators. Group has also proposed 5-7 countries which will
be analyzed. Their decision group has to present to others in plenary. In the plenary
session the participants should come to the agreement on:
a) Indicators to be collected
b) Countries to be analyzed Task 2: Collection of data
Each participant has responsibility to collect GDP and health indicators from one
country in the region. It is recommended to use WHO data base and HIT (Health in
Transition) hard copy or electronic publication. Task 3: Data analysis
After collection of data the small group should construct the tables, graphs and
figures. After discussion group has to come to conclusion, which will be presented in
a plenary. To organize work in the group small group should elect the group chairmen
and reporter. 8 REFERENCES

BOUNDARIES, LEVELS
Luka Kovačić, Želimir Jakšić THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
The system
System can be defined as a set of inter-related elements organized to achieve a
common purpose in the environment in which the system exists. The elements should
function as a functional whole.
Inter-related elements and common purpose are the key words of the quoted
definition. Every element can be regarded as a subsystem, and on the other side, the
system makes a subsystem of a larger system. This structure is known as hierarchical
structure.
The term system is very much used in everyday language and because of that, it
may have many connotations and different meanings. The most frequent understanding
is that it means an organized hierarchical administrative structure. The term health
system is often used instead of the terms health administration or health services. Health
administration will sometimes be described as a “non-system” or “there is no system” to
stress that it is not well organized. Theoretically, this is not quite correct, because it
actually means that a system operates which does not meet our expectations, or we do
not understand it. Another example of misunderstanding is to combine elements without
any inter-relation or inter-dependency of components of the system. It is not correct
because in the system a change in one element is bound to affect other parts and the
functioning of the whole. The health care system is one of the subsystems of the
broader social system. Systems analysis
In order to know how the system or subsystems work the process of analysis known
as systems analysis could be applied. The term systems analysis has many different
meanings. In general, it could be defined as a formal inquiry carried out to help
someone (referred to as the decision maker) to identify a better course of action and
make a better decision than he might otherwise have made.
The characteristic attributes of a problem situation where systems analysis is
called upon are complexity of the issue and uncertainty of the outcome of any course
of action that might reasonably be taken. Systems analysis usually has some
combination of the following: identification and re-identification) of objectives,
constraints, and alternative courses of action; examination of the probable
consequences of the alternatives in terms of costs, benefits, and risks; presentation of
the results in a comparative framework so that the decision maker can make an
informed choice from among the alternatives.
The typical use of systems analysis is to guide decisions on issues such as
national or corporate plans and programs, resource use and protection policies, 12 research and development in technology, regional and urban development,
educational systems, health and other social services. The nature of these problems
requires an interdisciplinary approach. There are several specific kinds or focuses of
systems analysis for which different terms are used: A systems analysis related to
public decisions is often referred to as a policy analysis (in the United States the
terms are used interchangeably). A systems analysis that concentrates on comparison
and ranking of alternatives on basis of their known characteristics is referred to as
decision analysis (2).
System analysis is based on the notion of the systems. All situations in real life
can lead us to the description of a system. It can be a social system, an administrative
system, a biological system, or any other kind. One can describe the health services as a
system, there are different systems in our body, and there are railway systems and
systems of thoughts.
A systematic examination of a system (situation, problem) should be done in
steps in which each step is made as explicit as possible. The steps are:
− listing all elements which can be related to the system or its environment;
− defining goals and objectives of the system, identifying also their hierarchy and
the most important objective in an observed situation according to the purpose of
the analysis;
− choosing elements which will be considered as the proper system (bounding or
bordering the system) and others which will be regarded as environment
according to defined goals and objectives;
− describing and examining elements and their relations;
− generating optional solutions, alternatives by manipulating elements and
relations to fit better
the objectives of the system or to find solutions for
identified problems;
− comparing and evaluating different alternatives and modelling a complex
new system.
The question is how to choose elements which are relevant for the system? The
solution is to start from the common purpose. The element contributing directly to the
purpose will be regarded as the element of the proper system and all others as elements
of the environment in which the system exists. In that way different elements might
make our proper health system when we consider the financial situation of health
services, and different elements when we consider health status. The important point is
that in both situations all elements will be initially considered and some of them
deliberately chosen as elements of the proper system of our concern.
There are several advantages in using system analysis. First, it stimulates us to
list all relevant factors which might be involved. This is very important, because it helps
us to overcome a common mistake and to consider only few closest elements along with
our usual thinking. For instance, very often when we examine the health services, the
users are forgotten, the most important element of the system. Organizational structure,
resources, manpower, equipment and facilities are examined, but not people who will
use it.
Second, system analysis is forcing us to proceed systematically starting from
specified objectives. Every step is performed deliberately and when shortcuts are used
we are aware of them. 13 Third, system analysis stimulates us to think about different new approaches and
alternatives, even out of usual ways of thinking. It is made easier because some
elements which are considered “untouchable” in real life are also taken into account
during “theoretical” consideration. For instance, new ways in mobilizing resources, new
patterns of supervision and reporting, etc. might come into the picture. Organization
Organization (as a process) is the arrangement of parts which form an effective whole.
The term is also used to describe a structure: a group of people with a special purpose,
e.g. a unit of health services, an institution.
The organization may be regarded as an open dynamic socio-technical system.
It is a dialectical relation of a given technology and social aspects of its application, i.e.
work connected with that technology (division of labour, relations toward means of
production, inter-personal and group relations). Because of that, the organization of
health units with different types of technology has different work relations and different
organizational problems, for instance, a big hospital in comparison with a health centre.
The organization may also be regarded as having different characteristics as the
consequence of size, level of complexity and phase of development.
Macro-organization will deals with big overall systems, and micro-organization with
small units (e.g. a rural hospital or a district health centre). In every-day life expressions
such as “young organization”, “traditional organization”, “handicapped organization”,
etc. are used and they indicate the lively social dynamics of organizations.
Because organization is a complex socio-technical system it may be understood
from different points of view:
− as a functional system, in which the main importance is given to technology and
the purpose of organization is to perform in the best way, i.e. in accordance with
technological requirements and giving the maximal output of an acceptable
quality;
− as a rational system, in which a rational order is of the main importance, i.e. neat
division of tasks, clear responsibilities, hierarchical decision-making, disciplined
subordination;
− as a group of people in which the
psychological relations, individual
behaviour and group dynamics play the essential role;
− as a social system in which the main influence have interests of individuals and
groups, the power structure and permanent dynamic tension regarding
domination and authority to decide about utilization of resources, personal and
group benefits.
The described concepts reflect the relative importance given to different aspects
of the same process. Consequently they will also influence the style of how
organizational problems are solved.
Organizing implies the ability to coordinate activities necessary for
implementation in such a way that: the right things are done, in the right place, at the
right time, in the right way, and by the right people. To reach that, a manager has to
observe:
− Objectives; 14 − Definition of tasks for each group and every individual;
− Clear line of authority, command, responsibility. Health care system
The health care system is a whole of political, economic and cultural, technical and
organizational factors, relations, processes and elements, in which individuals, groups
and communities interrelate, having the goal to satisfy their health needs.
Health and health care can be well understood only in the broadest context of
human life. That includes social, economic and political issues besides understanding
of biological facts. It also requires the understanding of environmental, historical and
cultural circumstances.
These various aspects can be observed differently according to given situation
and purpose of study. The depth of understanding will be influenced by our own
experience, knowledge and ideology. Because of that, an active effort will be needed
to observe, listen and compare, sometimes with patience and prudent tolerance.
Without active involvement, honesty and openness the reward will be minor, or
meaningless. HEALTH SYSTEM Economics Education and Culture Environment HEALTH

various subsystems:
− Socio-political subsystem - the main health legislation is as a rule at the national
level, but communities could be more or less self-reliant and responsible for
planning and organization of health care. Solidarity and support is usually at
higher levels;
− Subsystem of users (communities and individuals) - responsibility and
participation of the community in planning, organization, operation and control;
− Socioeconomic subsystem - health insurance (obligatory, voluntary, private),
and private relation of health providers and users;
− Managerial subsystem (decision making process): level of autonomy of health
institutions, type of management (autocratic, birocratic, corporative laizess-fair);
− Technological subsystem - Comprehensive approach in provision of primary
health care, segmented at secondary level;
− Organizational subsystem – levels of the health infrastructure (primary,
secondary, tertiary), type of health institutions (individual practices, group
practices, health centres, day hospitals, clinical hospitals);
− Health care infrastructure (health care facilities) - infrastructure could be a
subsystem which supports the operations of an organization (health centre,
health sub-centre, hospital, medical centre, institute of public health,
rehabilitation centre and spas, pharmacy, specialized institutes - vaccine
production, emergency services in large cities, blood supply, etc, private practice
- dentists, physicians, nurses, herbalists and other alternative practitioners);
− Supporting systems - training and research institutes, health related industries
(production of drugs, equipment, etc.). Levels of the health care system
All models of health care systems are imperfect and there is no a model which is the
best and broadly accepted and recommended. There are big differences among countries
influenced by history, tradition, socio-cultural, economic, and political and other factors.
But, regardless of all present differences, there are some common characteristics, typical
for the organized health care system (3). One of common characteristics of organization
of health care is a level of organization. Health care systems are usually organized on
three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary. The main characteristics of each level are
presented in table 1.
On primary level we can recognize several sublevels with their characteristics:
− Primary community (home) level with 2-100 or more members. Primary
community (or group) is one in which people are in permanent relations, have
regular contacts and know each other well. Discussions and decisions are within
the group itself and through direct personal communication. This type of
communities is for example families, some neighbourhoods, small villages,
workers in smaller workers' units, members of some societies, etc. These groups
are often practicing self-help and mutual aid, traditional forms of health care.
Volunteer promoters have sometimes an important role. 16 − Local community level (2000-3000+ members). Local communities are groups
usually living in the same setting or otherwise sharing facilities or other
resources or interests. This community is often formally recognized and some
temporary social structures may exist with guiding and facilitating
communication. The members know each other, but they do not live so close to
have regular personal contacts. The decisions are often made at public meetings
or in other organized ways. Besides, there are informal structures sharing
information and exercising some power. The local communities are of a medium
size which is limited by efficiency in running different common social services,
like churches, shops, schools, etc. At this level the first recognized and
established health worker may be found. He/she works at least partly on a
professional basis. The first health facility is also established (dispensary, health
posts, health stations and similar). A midwife, nurse, health technician or a
general practitioner may be the typical health worker. In more developed areas
health teams operate. Usually integrated preventive and curative service is
provided, including simple common treatment.

health institute − Intermediate (municipal) level (population of 10.000- 50.000+people). The
municipality (commune) or other similar social structure usually needs to
function also as the basic administrative unit. Often the first official
administrative needs are fulfilled, and an office exists which operates
permanently. Very often the decision making is formally prescribed and
implemented according to certain rules and laws. At this level the offices may
exist, in which different governmental and local regulations are issued, data
collected and other administration fulfilled. The established health unit is staffed
with a team, having often some epidemiological duties (e.g. surveillance), and
also guiding and coordinating work of health workers in the local communities. 17 The unit is often called the health centre. A medical assistant, a nurse or a
general medical practitioner might be in charge.
− On the secondary level, the district (or region in some countries) with population
of about 50.000-150.000 or more people) is a larger administrative centre, being
also often a centre of trades, manufacture and more developed cultural and social
institutions. A representative of the government in his office performs different
governmental duties. Services start to be specialized, and local representatives of
different central programs might be permanently present. It is often a small or
larger hospital (depend on the population size) and/or a larger health centre,
comprising also beds for maternity and short-term observation and treatment.
Besides GPs, there might be several main medical specialists. The first referral
services are provided. The guidance, management and supervision of health
services is expected, and in training of health workers etc.
− The tertiary level is regional or national level (population of more than half of
million) is usually regional or national administrative centre with regional or
national authorities and legislation. Clinical hospitals or clinical centres located
on that level have referral function for the health services located on lower
levels, educational and research functions. These health institutions are usually
responsible for development of national guidelines and standards. National
institutes of public health are responsible for monitoring of national health,
international communications and high specialized public health services
(laboratories, blood supply, etc.). EXERCISES
Task 1: set-up the boundaries of an emergency health care
system in a district of 70,000 inhabitants
There are many ways to present a health care system. Many different elements may be
chosen as essential for the system depending on problems we are dealing with and
objectives of the exercise. A permanent thinking “forward-backward” is going on
during designing a system: what are the objectives, which elements can help in
satisfying them. All the time analytical and syntactical skills are involved. The exercise
cannot be solved mechanically. Creativity is playing an important role, supported by
imagination. It is difficult to decide how many details are needed and what can be
regarded as a subsystem. During designing the system you are already stating your
hypotheses and greatly determining the final conclusions.
Your task is:
1. Make individually a list of all relevant elements you think that they are in the
system of emergency health care in a district of 70,000 inhabitants. You could
make also a list of elements outside the emergency health care what can
contribute to that system.
2. Draw a diagram presenting elements in and out the emergency health care system
and connect the elements with the lines.
3. Comment and explain your findings in a small group. 18 Task 2: Levels inside primary health care
As it was described earlier in this module, it is possible to identify three sublevels of
social structures to which correspond levels of health care. There are however variations
in size and relative importance of individual levels, as well as in health manpower and
between rural and urban settings. It is important to identify these differences, explain
them and discover if they influence outcomes of primary health services.
The students’ task is to:
1. Describe a situation in your district or country: name, size, services and health
manpower in different sublevels inside primary health care in urban and rural
settings;
2. Compare your findings with those of other participants in your group and
identify differences. Discuss the reasons and consequences;
3. Report to the plenary and consider advantages and disadvantages of different
solutions.
In consideration of different solutions for the organization of services on the grass-root
level of primary health care, the following factors have to be taken into account:
• The interface between population and services;
• The inter-relation between levels, communication and span of control;
• Differences between the rural and urban settings, and explanations of that;
• Practical problems in functioning of different levels.
Expected outcomes: List of comments and experiences gained during discussions. Each
student should explain what changes are necessary in his/her circumstances. What type
of changes students expect in his/her situation during further development? REFERENCES

management
After completing this module students should:
• know the present health situation in Europe and the strategies that
were taken or are actual in the present to help people to preserve
their health,
• be familiar with project management approach in conduction of
health promotion projects.
In European society very important changes have occurred in recent
decades. They brought different health problems. Different
interventions were developed in order to preserve health in the society.
Health promotion has proved to be one of the most important tools in
this field. Implementation of health promotion is not possible without
radical changes in approach to and method of work. As this is the case
of intervention in several social subsystems, the project method is
considered the most adequate tool for implementation of health
promotion in organisations. Institutes of Public Health have, due to their
role in the society of today, developed various kind of knowledge and
skills to facilitate the implementation of project work. They are closely
connected with several social subsystems so they stand a real chance of
undertaking the role of project co-ordinators in health promotion.
The benefits, gained by the institutes of public health through
taking part in health promotion projects, will not only be those reflected
in broader social community and other organisations. The new working
methods will, above all, find their most rapid and positive expression in
the very same institutes i.e. in the process of performing their regular
professional tasks. Address for

THEORETICAL BACGROUND
Some useful definitions and considerations for
understanding the module
Public health
When speaking of “public health”, to many people, even medical professionals, this
term conjures up images of hospitals and ill people and has the same meaning as
publicly funded health systems. However, public health is actually quite different
from that - it has at its heart the aim of improving wellbeing, promoting positive
health and preventing diseases. Thus, the main focus of public health is health and
disease prevention. This is reached through its activities: it prevents epidemics and the
spread of disease, protects against environmental hazards, prevents injuries, promotes
and encourages healthy behaviours, responds to natural and societal disasters and
assists communities in recovery, and assures the quality and accessibility of health
services. According to this, public health has many subfields. Most typically is
divided into following subfields or categories:
• epidemiology of communicable diseases,
• environmental health (hygiene),
• social and behavioural health (social medicine), and
• health statistics.
The role of public health is of major importance for the health of the
population, since many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical
methods. Public health plays its role in prevention efforts through local health systems
or through international non-governmental organizations. Public health services
When we know what “public health” is, we can start discussion about public health
services. There exist several definitions of “public health services”, among them
being also the definition of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (1). According to OECD, prevention and public health services
comprise services designed to enhance the health status of the population as distinct
from the curative services which repair health dysfunction. Typical services are
vaccination campaigns and programmes. But prevention and public health functions
included in this definition do not cover all fields of public health in the broadest sense
of a cross-functional common concern for health matters in all political and public
actions. Some of these broadly defined public health functions (such as emergency
plans and environmental protection) are not part of expenditure on health (1). 22 Since the main focus of public health is health and disease prevention, this is
the main focus of public health services as well.
Activities, performed by public health services are so-called public health
interventions. The focus of a public health intervention is among others to prevent a
disease through surveillance systems of cases of various diseases (e.g. communicable
diseases surveillance system), and the promotion of healthy life style. But in addition
to these activities, in many cases treating of a disease can be vital to preventing it in
others, such as during an outbreak of an infectious disease. Vaccination programs and
distribution of condoms are examples of activities of public health services. Essential tasks of public health services
Essential tasks of public health services are to:
• monitor health status to identify community health problems;
• diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the
community;
• inform, educate, and empower people about health issues;
• mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems;
• develop policies and plans that support individual and community health
efforts;
• enforce laws and regulations that protect health and ensure safety;
• link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of
health care when otherwise unavailable;
• assure a competent public health and personal health care workforce;
• evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and populationbased health services; and
• research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems. Level of functioning of public health services
The population, covered by a single public health service, can be as small as a group
of people (a family or local community for instance) or as large as all the inhabitants
of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Thus the level of
functioning of a public health service can be:
• local,
• regional,
• national,
• international, or
• global.
On the national level, countries have their own government public health
agencies to respond to domestic health issues, on the top being ministries of health
and national institutes of public health. We can present some very well known
national agencies, which are not involved only with national duties, but also with
several international health activities:
• maybe the most known public health system is the system of the United States
of America (US). In the US, the agency responsible for the public health of the 23 US population is US Public Health Service (US-PHS), led by the Surgeon
General of the United States. The US-PHS administers a number of critically
important health agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) (with its headquarters in Atlanta), and
the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The CDC is the primary federal agency for conducting and supporting
public health activities in the United States. CDC’s focus is to protect the
health of all US people. CDC keeps humanity at the forefront of its mission to
ensure health protection through promotion, prevention, and preparedness (2).
It is composed of several units being National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, and six Coordinating Centres/Offices, including environmental
health and injury prevention, health information services, health promotion,
infectious diseases, global health and terrorism preparedness and emergency
response.
• an example of a national public health agency/institution is Finnish National
Public Health Institute KTL (3). KTL is responsible as an expert body under
the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, for providing various
professionals and citizens the best available public health information for their
choices. This institution could be classified among the most important public
health services in Europe. Its ideas have been spread even worldwide. An
example is an intervention programme for combating non-communicable
diseases known under its acronym CINDI (Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Diseases Intervention) (4).
On the international and global level, there exist several very well known
public health organizations/agencies:
• in the first place it is an organization which acts on the international and global
level, and which is in fact a guiding body for public health services at national,
regional and local levels – the World Health Organization (WHO) (5). WHO is
responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the
health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidencebased policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring
and assessing health trends (5);
• here, again, we have to mention CDC with its international activities,
• but not only US, also European Union (EU) established an agency, similar to
CDC - the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (6),
which was established in 2005. It is an EU agency with aim to strengthen
Europe's defences against infectious diseases. It is seated in Stockholm,
Sweden. ECDC's mission is to identify, assess and communicate current and
emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases. The ECDC
disease specific activities are organised within seven horizontal programmes
with team members from all technical units: Programme on influenza,
Programme on tuberculosis, Programme on food- and water-borne diseases,
Programme on other diseases of environmental and zoonotic origin,
Programme on vaccine preventable diseases and invasive bacterial infections,
Programme on HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and blood-borne viruses, 24 and Programme on Antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated
infections (6).
But not only national, international or global level is important. Regional and
local levels are of principal importance, since they are gate-keepers for diseases which
could spread over the borders of a country. This importance and an example of
organizational scheme will be presented via case study from Slovenia. There is no
average scheme how to organize public health services, since every country has its
own scheme of public health services organization, which depends on its health care
system organization.
Before introducing the case study, it is necessary to discuss some
contemporary public health issues and the present and the future role of public health
services in solving contemporary public health problems.
Some contemporary public health issues in Europe to challenge
public health services
Very important changes in society have occurred in Europe in recent decades: a
falling birth-rate has resulted in small families where both parents work, and many
children are cared for outside their home for most of the day. The divorce-rate is high,
urbanization is increasing, and more and more people live in satellite towns with long
travel times to their work. Further problems stem from the increasing proportion of
older people in the population.
The changing disease and health care demand patterns, with increasing
emphasis on the care of chronic diseases, are reflected both in morbidity and mortality
statistics. The balance between primary care and hospital care is everywhere under
review, with increasing stress on the importance on the long-term care and a welldeveloped primary care system. Reliable researches and statistical information is
important for monitoring these changes as the need for planning and priority –making
in public health grows.
The financial implications of the operations of health organizations are
enormous; painstaking planning, prior evaluation, and a detailed subsequent research
are increasingly necessary. All recent experiences show how difficult it is to achieve a
satisfactory balance between completing priorities in health care, between the
demands of effectiveness and equity, and between completing attitudes of different
health professions. Responses to contemporary pressure
Demographic trends
Crude live births in most of Europe are about 13 per 1000 population per year,
almost equal to mortality rates. As a consequence, the total population-size is
essentially stable. Only a few countries have recorded a slight natural increase many
other report an overall decline of the population. The population of Europe is,
however, aging. The proportion of children in the age-group 0-14 decreasing, and
the high-age groups are growing. These demographic changes have important
consequences for public health policy and planning. Low fertility will undoubtedly
continue, and the number of families with few children will further increase. The 25 number of large families will continue to be low, but they will tend to present health
services with social, economic, and health problems.
The modernization of family planning and the spread of more efficacious
and less hazardous methods have contributed to a decrease in the number of
unplanned pregnancies. The use of more dangerous methods such as abortions is
being discouraged but it is still quite high in a number of European countries. The
youth group is declining in size but the problems facing young people are important
for social and health policy. Accidents, drug abuse, smoking, unwanted pregnancy,
and sexually transmitted disease are very important in youth groups as are the
psychological and social effects of unemployment, family breakdown, loneliness,
homelessness, and migration. The AIDS epidemic took its place among these major
hazards.
The increase in the size of the older age groups also presents important
specific health problems. These are due to higher chronic morbidity, the
requirement for more visits by the physician and days in hospital, an increased
use of dugs, and a heavier utilization of nurses, home-help, and nursing homes.
These are all matters which will demand a high priority for resource allocations in
the coming years (7).
Mean life expectancy at birth, in Europe, varies from 65.8 years (Russian
Federation) to more than 80 years (Iceland) (Figure 1). In all European countries
women have a higher life-expectancy than men: on average 6.5 years more. The gap
seems indeed to be widening; women are tending to live even longer, whereas the
life-expectancy for men seems to be levelling off. The national differences in length
of life are probably to some extent due to differences in the standard of public
health services, but the contributions of economic variation und unhealthy lifestyles are undoubtedly of much greater consequence. This is reflected, within
different countries, in social class differences in mortality.
Major Public Health Problems in Europe
The main causes of death in the region in most age groups are diseases of the cardio
vascular system, cancers, and accidents. Suicides are important and so is mortality
from traffic accidents. The main causes of chronic disability are accidents, stroke and
other vascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, mental diseases and disorders, senile
dementia, arthritis, and the physical disabilities of extreme old age.
The main determinants of health lie outside the traditional health sector. Health
policy cannot remain a matter for health centres, hospitals, or other health-care
services, alone. Yet there are still serious problems in mobilizing the expertise of
health professionals and applying their findings and recommendations in health policy
areas outside their traditional framework of employment.
Meanwhile, the roles of national governments are chiefly restricted to
controlling costs, guaranteeing equity in the distribution of resources, and developing
local services. There is little evidence of engagement with true health objectives.
These deficiencies are serious, and acceptable solutions to these problems have
not in general been found (8). 26 Iceland

Health Organization) (9). The cost of health care
The cost of health care is being given great attention in most European countries
(Figure 2). Increasing costs are creating severe problems for many governments. The
capacity of governments to finance total health care costs is limited and, given a
harsher economic climate, the financial consequences on other fields of social
endeavour are becoming quite serious.
The size of the hospital sector is a crucial determinant of total costs. The
distribution of resources between hospital care and ambulatory care is a major policy
question. When considering these problems it should be noted that most of the costs
in the health care sector are manpower costs (between 55 and 80% of total costs),
which tend to rise faster than other production factors in the public sector. 27 Total health expenditure as % of gross domestic product (GDP), Last available Switzerland 2005

(Source: Health for All Data-Base, World Health Organization) (9). Intersectoral efforts to improve public health
In discussions of »public health«, it is generally assumed that the policies, actions,
and outcomes of importance are those originating from the public sector. It is the
activities of health department bureaucracies and associated bodies, of publicly
funded public health research and teaching institutions, and the laws and regulatory 28 provisions generated by health ministers that are taken to be the obvious subjects
matter to consider when assessing the practice of public health in a country.
However, an emerging dialogue within public health spheres is focusing on
evidence that the health of the community and the fruits of the labours of those selfconsciously engaged in explicit public health occupations are hardly co-extensive. An
»intersectoral« perspective on both, analysis and action to improve the health status of
populations, is increasingly being recognized as fundamental to any consideration
both of how the health status of populations does change, and of questions concerning
efficiency in the roles and work of those public sector agencies that have traditionally
addressed public health (7). The impacts, direct and indirect, on health resulting from
the policies and actions or other (non-health) Government portfolios, such as
employment, consumer affairs, education, housing, the environment, and agriculture;
from non-governmental agencies such as pensioners associations, leisure and sporting
groups; and from the private sector (e.g. the food, pharmaceutical, sunscreen, and
product safety design industries), are demonstrably of immense importance in
variously promoting or retarding public health.
Future prospects of public health services
These programmes will be closely associated with the development and provision of
primary health care in the twenty-first century. The fundamental policy for health
services should be established on the basis of the real health needs of the residents and
of an action plan which takes into account these various levels of health needs (10). It
is thus important to create effective organizations and functional structures for
primary , secondary, and tertiary health care systems in the community by the
integration of social resources with existing infrastructures such as social insurance,
welfare services, educational systems, labour standards and employment policies,
communications and transportation, and local industrial development. Comprehensive
health-care systems should promote a wide range of activities, such as promotion of
health, prevention of diseases, medical care, and in industry, and also the
development of international health services.
Needless to say, the most important problems in public health services in more
developed countries can be said to be those associated with the rapid ageing of the
population and related effects, changes in the disease pattern, increasing demand for
medical care and welfare services, and limitation in social resources. These indicate
the very important role that public health services must play, and the responsibility
they have in comprehensive health-care systems (11). Health Promotion – major challenge for Public Health Services
The member states of the World Health Organisation (WHO) had, on encountering
contemporary health problems, laid new foundations for a long-term health policy,
popularly called “Health for All” (8), which was updated in 1999 and is now known
as “Health 21” - the Health for All policy frameworks for the WHO European Region
for the 21st century (12). The basic principles of this policy are:
• health is a fundamental human right;
• equity in health and solidarity in action by reducing gaps in health status
between and within all countries and their inhabitants; 29 • participation and accountability of individuals, groups, institutions and
communities for continued health development
In 1986 the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion was adopted (13), which is
considered the key strategy for implementation of the new health policy. This
document outlines a comprehensive strategy for health promotion trough five
interactive means of action that cover the whole range of the new approach to health:
• building healthy public policy;
• creating environments supportive to health;
• strengthening of community action;
• development of personal skills and
• re-orienting of health care services toward primary health care.
Although health is, above all, considered a personal value, it is the very influence of
working and living conditions, which are practically beyond the control of an
individual, that makes the society and its organisations responsible for creating the
conditions of “a healthy choice being the easier choice”.
Such a radical change in attitude towards health as well as in chances of its
implementation and improvement requires a lot more than the mere adoption of
global orientation. One should not neglect the fact that various social sectors, having
major impact on human health, were caught completely unprepared for such changes
so there are still many parts of developing and developed countries, where even today,
after more than twenty years, no changes can be observed – WHO 1998 (7).
Organisations to play the “promoter” role
Health promotion represents an extremely ambitious public health intervention in the
society, which is in Europe already present (14). The success of such intervention,
however, depends on the knowledge about and accuracy of the structure and
dynamics evaluation for the system we wish to exert influence upon. It should be
pointed out that this can not be compared to building a new house on bare ground and
in ideal conditions. All health promotion efforts have been addressing a complex,
hardly recognisable social structure network, in which resources and energy already
interweave. Any modification is to affect all parts of such network. CASE STUDY: PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES IN SLOVENIA
Historical perspective
The organised preventive health services have a long tradition in Slovenia, with the
Central Institute of Hygiene in Ljubljana established already in 1923 to be soon
afterwards also followed by the district hygiene stations (15). The activities of the
Institute of Hygiene followed the ideas of Dr. Andrija Štampar, the then Director of
the Department of Hygiene at the Ministry of Health, and the ideological promoter of
social medicine. During a period of first two decades, the Institute of Hygiene
founded about 20 community health centres throughout Slovenia; among them was
the Community Health Centre in Lukovica near Domzale, established in 1926, which 30 was one of the first community health centres in Slovenia at that time, and which
became the prototype for such institutions.
Due to various reasons, however, this sphere of medicine later failed to keep
pace with the development of curative medicine, and has in a certain period of time
actually proved regressive. Especially the Second World War drastically interrupted
the development of public health at that time. It was continued only in the 1950s,
when the population, gradually recovering from the war and finding itself in different
political circumstances and with different people, began to project the further
development of public health.
There were several attempts made to pave the way for the preventive health
services, mostly in the form of various organisational interventions which in the final
phase achieved no desired effect. The tasks from the field of social medicine,
epidemiology and hygiene were performed partly within the basic health services, and
partly by the institutions which were predecessors of contemporary nine Regional
institutes of public health and the National Institute of Public Health of the Republic
of Slovenia. The co-operation between the individual regional institutes of public
health and their linkage with the National Institute of Public Health of the Republic of
Slovenia was scarce and not compulsory, except in some joint tasks, stipulated by the
legislation (16).
At the end of the 80’s, first radical changes took place, which had a significant
influence upon the present status and activity of the Regional and National institutes
of public health. A uniform national programme was adopted for the tasks in the field
of public health. The individual tasks to be performed by the National Institute of
Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia and the regional institutes in this field were
defined in detail. Both, the number of personnel and their required qualifications,
were defined as well. And, very importantly, the funds for the performance of such
tasks were also provided. At that time, all the funds intended for health care were part
of the integral national budget. Current organisational scheme of public health
institutions in Slovenia
Public health policy in Slovenia
For the time being, in Slovenia we do not have a special act, covering public health
sector, but many of public health issues are covered by the Health Services Act
adopted in 1992 (17).
According to the Health Services Act (17), there are nine regional institutes of
public health operating in Slovenia (Celje, Koper, Kranj, Ljubljana, Maribor, Murska
Sobota, Nova Gorica, Novo Mesto, and Ravne), covering corresponding health
regions (Figure 3), and the National Institute of Public Health of the Republic of
Slovenia.
The Health Services Act gives a more detailed definition of the services of
social medicine, epidemiology, hygiene and environmental health (17). According to
the content and sphere of activity, they could be summarized into four main fields: 31 Figure 3. Nine health regions of Slovenia where Regional Institutes of Public Health were
established. 1. Health situation monitoring and analysis, research, development and
implementation of innovative public health solutions;
2. Collection, analysis and interpretation of health informatics data and
evaluating of health care system;
3. Surveillance and control of risks and damages in public health, surveillance of
communicable and non communicable diseases, health promotion and
supporting healthy lifestyles, strengthening communities, and improving health
for vulnerable groups;
4. Analysis of data on environmental health with special emphasis on air, water
and foods quality, including of assessment of the health risk due the
environment and preparation of measures to preserve health of population.
Beside these professional tasks, which are partly financed by
government, numerous other tasks are performed:
5. Services of the laboratories for microbiology and for chemistry (samples of
human and environmental origin);
6. Monitoring of environmental elements;
7. Counselling in different sphere of public health;
8. Different expert and research projects, and
9. Education. Tertiary level
The national level of public health in Slovenia is in the domain of the Institute of
Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia. 32 Short history
As described earlier, this institution was established in 1923. Its first tasks were
monitoring the quality of drinking water and milk and preparing expert opinions
about safe drinking water supply.
Two years later, the Institute merged with the Ljubljana Permanent
Bacteriological Station, broadened its activities, and reorganized into three units:
• the bacteriological-serological laboratory,
• unit for monitoring the drinking water and food provisions, and
• unit for hygiene promotion and education.
The Institute was reorganized into the Central Hygienic Institute in May 1951.
Its tasks were to monitor the health of the population and improve it by taking
appropriate preventive measures; to monitor and improve the hygiene in the country;
to prevent and control communicable diseases; and to develop and coordinate the
work of all hygienic stations.
In 1974, the Institute reorganized again into the Institute of the Socialist
Republic of Slovenia for Health Care. The activities of the Institute covered the fields
of social-medicine, hygiene, epidemiology, and preparation of technical
recommendations for health care-related legislation.
The contemporary Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia
(IPHRS) was established in 1992 (15). Current organization
Currently, activities of the IPHRS are organized within five centres, two special units,
and three laboratory departments (18).

The IPHRS professionally links the otherwise autonomous regional institutes, which
will be presented later, and in co-operation with them performs the tasks of the
adopted national programme. Such solution does not encroach upon the independence
of individual institutes, yet dictates a similar, if not the same organisational pattern, as
the performance of joint tasks would otherwise be hindered. 33 Secondary level
As described earlier there are nine Regional Institutes of Public Health, covering
corresponding health regions (Figure 3). The populations they are taking
responsibility for, are of very different sizes: from about 75,000 to about 600,000. The
details are presented in Table 1.

74,000 All Regional Institutes of Public Health in Slovenia have more or less similar
organization, which is also very similar to the organization of the Institute of Public
Health of the Republic of Slovenia. They all have three major departments:
• Social Medicine Department – major activities of this department are health
statistics and assessment of health status of the population covered by the
Regional Institute, and proposals for necessary public health interventions in
the context of social medicine;
• Environmental Health (Hygiene) Department – major activities of this
department are monitoring of parameters of environmental health (outdoor
parameters such as air, soil, water, and food, and indoor parameters of
dwelling and occupational places), risk assessment, and proposals for
necessary public health interventions in the context of environmental health.
The other part of activities is health inspection of food industry processes,
potable water supply networks, swimming pools, etc;
• Department for Communicable Diseases Epidemiology - major activities of
this department are communicable diseases surveillance, and proposals for
necessary public health interventions in the context of communicable diseases
epidemiology. Vaccinations and counselling to passengers to regions at high
risk for communicable diseases also are in the domain of this department.
Beside presented activities, health promotion is coming to agenda of Regional
Institutes of Public Health in Slovenia more and more clearly, what will be discussed
later on. Some of them already have special units dealing with health promotion
issues, while in others health promotion activities are incorporated in activities of
other departments. 34 In addition to joint undertakings, the Regional Institutes of public health
perform some other tasks as well. An important activity and thus the source of funds
is the laboratory activity (human and sanitary microbiology, sanitary chemistry) as
well as performance of several other tasks for the needs of individual organisations,
private persons, and local communities. Primary level
One should place a special emphasis on the role of the National Institute of Public
Health of the Republic of Slovenia and the regional institutes of public health in
connecting and co-ordinating various health institutions (e.g. Community Health
Centres) and private sector in the implementation of preventive health care at the
primary level.
In the past, a lot was unclear in the implementation of preventive programmes
at the primary level. Those programmes were not carried out equally in all places,
neither in the scope nor in the quality. By introducing private practices and the
institution of a personal physician, it often happened that individual population groups
were not included in the preventive programme. For this reason, the Ministry of
Health reached a decision and at the beginning of 1998 issued special legal regulation,
being Instructions for the implementation of preventive health protection at the
primary level (20) with the detailed instructions for the implementation of preventive
health care at the primary level. In those instructions, the content and the method of
preventive programme implementation have been precisely defined. in the following
spheres (20,21):
• reproductive health care;
• health care for babies and infants till the age of 6;
• health care for school children and youth till the age of 19;
• health care for students;
• dental care for children and youth;
• health care for adults in general practice;
• health care for persons in the nursing care treatment, and
• health care for sportsmen.
This way, a uniformity of such services can be achieved in Slovenia. Furthermore, the
minister appoints experts responsible for each sphere of preventive health care, who
are in charge of the proper implementation of the programme. Health Promotion – major challenge also for Slovene
Public Health Services
In view of the situation in Slovenia, we should not be completely satisfied despite
some advantage we have over other countries. We can boast a clearly defined
orientation towards primary health care, one of the main focuses of this policy, as
well as rich infrastructure of preventive institutions. Besides, some preventive health
care measures have the tradition of several decades. All this might be one of the
reasons why our attitude became even more demanding and as such calls for a more 35 energetic approach to implementation of basic principles of joint European health
policy.
But why is this so? To put it briefly, the major problem lies in our inability to
determine who is to take the initiative. The existing professions and organisations
have their specially defined roles and tasks and have as such adapted to solving of the
problems, for which they were established and/or formed.
A problem of a particular nature is that the society still holds the prevalent
view of considering health as a task and commitment of health professionals and
health organisations and not an area of activity to be dealt with also by, or rather,
primarily by outside-health professionals and organisations.
In Slovenia, from organizational point of view, the existing public health
organisations already have their tasks and roles defined and assigned. The present
health care system puts emphasis on solving problems of ill health (diseases), which
is understandable – ill health certainly is one of the major problems.
Complex and sophisticated organisational systems have been developed for
treatment of diseases, rehabilitation and compensation of diseases. The tasks and
professional roles are well defined, with their working methods and their daily
routine. Moreover, they enjoy the benefit of being supported by the system of finance
and education (22).
Nevertheless, health is not viewed as a problem, so we have not yet reached
the decision, what institution is to undertake the tasks in health promotion. No
particular social system can be made responsible for health promotion as this issue
addresses several systems at the same time (Figure 4) (22). ILLNESS

health promotion are undertaken by the public health services which are in Slovenia
the institutes of public health, organised at the national and regional level and
considered the central preventive institutions, able to play an active role in health
promotion.
Numerous connections, both from the institutional as well as territorial aspect,
fostered for the purpose of performing various professional tasks, have enabled the
formation of an extremely rich network of adapted means of communication. These
organisations have the distinction of great flexibility and are, more than others, able to
seek paths yet not trodden and to create new social network, required in the
implementation process of health promotion strategy. Figure 5 shows the complexity
of connections made by e.g. regional Institute of Public Health. The interconnections
among individual organisations are not shown, although rich in number as well.
The advantages of the institutes of public health when applying for the
“promoter” role in the implementation process of health promotion strategy are:
• wide scope of connections made with various social subsystems and their
organisations;
• variety of communications skills;
• variety of professions, tasks and working methods used and thus more open for
successful introduction of new forms of work;
• awareness and understanding of the importance and possibilities of health
promotion. MASS

in Slovenia also have to undergo certain changes as well, to adjust their organizational
structure and method of work in compliance with the new tasks (23). Features of health promotion projects
In recent years the project management has become the most important tool for
performance of new, complex tasks. This kind of approach to work was initially
characteristic only for profit oriented enterprises, whereas it can currently also be
observed in non-profit organisations. In view of the international health promotion
movement the project method represents a fundamental approach to task performance.
Project management is considered a suitable tool for implementation of health
promotion in various settings e.g. business enterprises, schools, hospitals, and can, as
such, also be used in performance of programmes, focused on changing lifestyles and
improving ecological conditions. It is only through the project approach that
multisectoral and interdisciplinary co-operation can be implemented, which is
regarded as essential to the performance of new tasks in health promotion.
The development and adoption of health promotion policy is important not
only at the national, regional or local level, but also in organisations such as schools,
hospitals and business enterprises. By means of health promotion the health criterion
is being introduced into decision-making as well as into other activities of a system.
Projects and their successful management has become a favourite instrument
in recent years for performing new and highly complex tasks in organisations or in the
co-operation between organisations. In the international health promotion movement,
projects have become central implementation strategy. Project management is an
appropriate tool for promoting health in businesses, schools or hospitals, as well as
carrying out programmes on healthy lifestyles and ecological issues. Features of a
health promotion project are:
• it is a type of organisation to perform complex, new tasks of various sectors
within a single organisation or among various organisations;
• it is an instrument to introduce changes planned in an organisation;
• it mobilises and redirects resources from one or more systems to new tasks;
• it evaluates and verifies the efficiency of new forms of co-operation and
integration among individual departments and organisations;
• it gives the participants the opportunity to acquire fresh experience and skills
to be later incorporated in their everyday activity;
• it exerts influence on the entire organisation or other organisations, taking part
in the project.
Development and interaction of knowledge among professionals is an integral
part of project management. New tasks usually require new expert knowledge as well
as different application of knowledge with experience (24,25).
Projects can develop their innovative task solely through development of
autonomous activity on the one hand, while they, on the other hand, maintain and
make use of their connections with the parent organisation.
In distinction from the projects in the area of business enterprises, where
predictions of reactions in the target system are often relatively accurate, this is not
the case in health promotion projects. The response depends on the internal dynamics 38 of an individual social subsystem and autonomous understanding of the process by
such system. The provision of proper project management is therefore of vital
importance. Only in this way it is possible to currently adapt goals, working methods
and forms of intervention in the environment and to follow the project target to the
fullest extent.
Special emphasis should be laid upon the gains from the activity within the
project for the collaborators and the parent organisation. Successful work for the
project results in utterly positive impact both on an individual project team member as
well as on the team as a whole. It is of particular importance that through the project
activity the innovativeness of an individual can be boosted and developed. And the
opportunity for one's assertion leads to higher motivation for work. Motivation is also
encouraged by positively oriented interpersonal relationships and high level of work
culture, created in the team.
The activity within the project also very favourably reflects in the parent
organisation. The qualifications, acquired by the project team members through such
activity, often prove useful for their routine professional role. Social skills and
knowledge of organisational development, required in the project, usually to a large
extent satisfy the increased demand for such qualities in the rapid development and
organisational complexity of modern society. Conclusion
Implementation of health promotion is not possible without radical changes in
approach to and method of work. As this is the case of intervention in several
social subsystems, the project method is considered the most adequate tool for
implementation of health promotion in organisations. National and regional
institutes of public health in Slovenia have, due to their role in the society of
today, developed various kind of knowledge and skills to facilitate the
implementation of project work. They are closely connected with several social
subsystems so they stand a real chance of undertaking the role of project coordinators in health promotion.
The benefits, gained by the institutes of public health through taking part in
health promotion projects, will not only be those reflected in broader social
community and other organisations. The new working methods will, above all,
find their most rapid and positive expression in the very same institutes i.e. in the
process of performing their regular professional tasks. EXERCISES

Health policy, health priorities, doctor-patient relationship
After completing this module students and public health
professionals should be able to:
• Understand the spectrum of socio-medical problems in
health practice;
• Define and describe difference between doctor-patient
and institution-patient relationship;
• Explain the main root causes of socio-medical
problems;
• Understand the instruments, mechanisms and
responsibility flow for solving socio-medical problems
in health practice;
• Use a problem-solving technique to a given
scenario/case. 43 Abstract Teaching methods Specific recommendations

DIMENSIONS OF THE HEALTH PRACTICE
Neda Milevska-Kostova, Doncho Donev THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
History and context
The dramatic social and economic changes that have taken place in the past two
decades in South Eastern Europe (SEE) countries, have caused the existing
inequalities in health to grow even bigger, not only between but also within the
countries in the region. Backed up with the national health statistics, which gives a
stark illustration of the effect of economic crisis and reveals a growing health
divide, the issue is recognized to deserve greater attention; the once strong and sole
focus of the health services to offer better care, newer treatments and more effective
drugs, in the contemporary society requires to be accompanied with the much wider
scope of needs of the modern patient - including more complex social interaction,
better access to information through a multitude of sources, etc. The added
complexity of the interactions in the health system where both patient and the
doctor play a crucial role deserves much attention if we are aimed at reducing the
inequality, socio-medical and ethical disparities. Defining socio-medical issues
According to definitions in some standard worldwide renowned dictionaries (1), the
term socio-medical dimensions of health care practice refer to the relations of
practicing medicine in the societal context. Under such definition, we can look at
number of aspects, some of which are already defined in monetary terms: equity,
equality, healthcare spending; in socio-legal terms: physician-patient relationship,
institution-patient relationship, patients’ rights; or which are still in developmental
stage or at the level of concept: like patient safety, for example. Further below, we
will look at each in the attempt to define the complex milieu of the interrelatedness
of medicine and society, yet more focusing on the legal and social aspects. This,
will, ultimately give us an idea of how to address problems that might occur at the
crossroad between medicine as science (represented by the medical profession) and
the subjects of society (represented by the patients and other users of medical
services). Equity
A key consideration in addressing the performance of any health care system,
including those of the SEE countries to which this book is dedicated, is equity.
Equity in health means that ideally everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain
their full health potential and, more pragmatically that no one should be
disadvantaged from the achieving this potential, if it can be avoided (2). In terms of
health care delivery it means that citizens get the care they need without 45 consideration of their social status or other personal characteristics such as age,
gender, ethnicity or place of residence (3). Equity addresses questions such as
whether some groups in the society have better access to health care or better health
benefits and outcomes than others (4). The term inequity in health refers to
differences in health which are not only unnecessary and avoidable but, in addition,
are considered unfair and unjust (2). Equality
The equality in healthcare is usually associated with the economic and social
equality in the society. It is true to some extent; as Wilkinson states “the greater the
economic and social inequality within a society the lower the health outcomes” (5).
Yet, there is another aspect of "equality of access" to healthcare, which should be
considered as vital part of the medical care in each country. As Canadian
Commissioner on Future of Healthcare in Canada in his report explains, the rapid
growth of private magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clinics, which permit people to
purchase faster service and then use test results to “jump the queue” back into the
public system for treatment, is a troubling case-in-point (3), and can disturb the
balance of the system, offering lower possibilities to those that cannot afford private
services, that are otherwise available under the insurance scheme). This becomes a
fertile ground for flourishing the financial discrimination within the social-welfare
healthcare systems. Healthcare spending
Spending on health care does usually appear to make a difference in health
outcomes. Health indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality clearly
show that problems are ameliorated when spending increases (6). A financially
inefficient system, however, may use additional health resources to provide higher
salaries to health care providers without a corresponding improvement in services
(3); it may also lead to shift of health services demand from the free-of-charge
public health services to private out-of-pocket paid services, which to a large extent
instigates the financial discrimination between those that can and those that cannot
afford the private payment for services, otherwise available under the basic
insurance package. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those that due to poor
accessibility cannot benefit from the health system, despite the fact that they may
belong to the category that needs it most. Unfortunately, the available data on
healthcare spending in some countries is recorded only for the public healthcare
institutions (7), who give a much fragmented and highly unrealistic picture, while
the private healthcare services are flourishing especially for the basic package of
health services. Physician-patient relationship
The sensitivity of this issue when it comes to the scope of socio-medical problems
in healthcare delivery is obvious from its defining; it represents a relation of two
parties that are equal in the mission to sustain, improve, promote one’s health
condition, but are unequal in many other aspects, like specialist knowledge and
medical information (information asymmetry), objectivity in approaching the
problem and sobriety to make informed decision. This to a large extent explains the 46 paternalistic roles very commonly taken in the physician-patient relationship, rather
than the paternalistic concept of the health care system. Several countries reported a
similar situation with the physician-patient relationship, in some occasions even
expressed as “the father-physician taking care of the child-patient” (8). Patients,

technological and decreasing the human aspects of medical care. These advances
brought and enlarged the alienation between patients and physicians. At times,
physicians forget or simply do not have time to be compassionate; they often perceive
themselves as absolute authorities in judging patient needs due to their medical
knowledge supremacy and they do not perceive the need to discuss diagnoses and
proposed treatment with patients that in their opinion are not capable of making
reasonable decisions. Thus the most common complaints of patients across the
national milieus investigated are that in largest number of cases the physicians don’t
listen, don’t take much time and don’t explain or give a partial explanation in a
difficult to understand (referring to the professional and specialized terms) language.
At the same time if anything happens beyond the expected procedure, the physicians
would in the first place “blame it on” the patient for non-compliance (8), whereas the
patients would consider it to be the physician’s mistake for any of the above reasons.
To this end, it is often difficult to quantify the influence, but the relationship
between the physician and the patient should have its place in the model defining
the socio-medical problems, at least on a qualitative level. Institution-patient relationship
In many cases, the hospital visit and the patient’s health are usually associated with
the patient-physician relationship, to a large extent, besides the expertise, 47 professionalism and ethical principles of the medical personnel. But, the preparedness
and level of equipment of the healthcare setting plays crucial role in the outcome of
certain intervention; this is another angle of the complex health systems’ relations:
patient-institution relationship. Most of national legislations are regulating the right of
the patient to access to healthcare, but also the right to healthcare itself, to access to
medications and technology (based on maximum availability in the system) – rights
and conditions that cannot be regulated and met by the physician alone. In this sense,
the need to include the patient-institution relationship into the equation for
understanding and solving socio-medical problems is evident, and further more it can
be quantified in monetary terms. Health

professionals responsibilities – patients vs. healthcare As in every relationship, patients and physicians in their interaction have both rights
and responsibilities; as much as this might sound inhumane and too bureaucratic, in
lot of cases these rights or responsibilities have been a driving force or inhibiting
factor to proceeding with interventions much more than the substantial medical
knowledge or practice (8). Despite the fact that both patients and physicians are on
the same side of the healthcare system - with their mission being health condition
improvement or life prolongation - the ethics of holding each of them responsible
against the inequality of their positions explained above becomes a complex issue
not only difficult to prove and measure, but also unpopular to convert into monetary
value. 48 In each country, there are at least several mechanisms for addressing the
violation of the rights or non-compliance with the responsibilities by patients or
health professionals; ranging from health mediators, in-house (clinical) patients’
advocates, ombudsman, administrative and court procedures (civil and criminal).
The level of their implementation or applicability is always questionable, for
both technical and ethical reasons, such as lack of medical knowledge of judges or
justifiable compassion with the peer physician in a case of unintentional medical
error and adverse outcomes.
Thus, the intention is for the concept to go beyond the simplified version of
“good guy-bad guy” situations but to rather look into the potentials of objectivising
the cases and anonymization of malpractices (9), for future use of the case-based
knowledge in extending the medical practice. This aspect is further elaborated
under the section of patient safety. Patient safety
The concept of patient safety happens to be a relatively recent initiative, as a response
to the generally low level of awareness and knowledge about the frequency and
magnitude of avoidable adverse outcomes in healthcare industry; the first serious
approach to this issue was given in 1990s, when reports in several countries revealed
a staggering number of malpractice patient injuries and deaths each year (10).
Patient safety is a serious concern in most developed and developing countries
alike. Recent studies consistently show, in an increasing number of countries, that
health care errors occur in around 10% of hospitalizations (11). The concept of the
patient safety is described with many operational definitions - each defined by the
research context. In general, the term patient safety describes the tendency to provide
conditions and interventions for patients in the healthcare settings that would enable
and ensure the desirable outcome. The broadness of this concept embraces both
medical and non-medical errors that can incur during the patient visit or stay at the
healthcare setting.
Nevertheless, the scientific literature shows that the healthcare sector is a
decade or more behind other high-risk industries in its attention to ensuring basic
safety for its key players (both patients and health professionals) (12). Aviation for
example, has focused extensively on building safe systems since World War II;
between 1990 and 1994, the U.S. airline fatality rate was less than one-third the rate
experienced in mid century (13). In 1998, there were no deaths in the United States in
commercial aviation; in health care, preventable injuries from care have been
estimated to affect between three to four percent of hospital patients (14,15).
Yet, the patient safety does not imply responsibility only on the physicians
and healthcare settings - it involves other medical professionals, such as
pharmacists (through their contact with the patients, education about use and abuse
of medications, etc) and patients themselves - with their understanding of the
procedures and willingness to comply with given instructions. Regardless if the
advice is aimed at improved nutrition or regularity of taking medicines; both can
equally affect the patient and his/her role in increasing own safety as patient.
Under the Luxembourgian presidency of EU, in April 2005, the European
Commission DG for Health and Consumer Protection issued the Declaration
“Patient Safety - Making it Happen!” widely known as the Luxemburg Declaration. 49 The Declaration calls for active involvement of EU institutions, in establishment of
EU forum to discuss issues regarding patient safety, in cooperation with other
patient safety initiatives, like the WHO Alliance on Patient Safety etc. The
Declaration recommends to the national authorities to establish national forums, to
ensure full and free access to personal health information to patients, to optimize
the use of new technologies, and above all to work towards creating a culture that
focuses on learning from near misses and adverse events as opposed to
concentrating on “blame and shame” and subsequent punishment (16).
Denmark became the first example of a country that introduced nation-wide
mandatory reporting of medical errors and adverse outcomes. The Danish Act on
Patient Safety (9) enacted by the Danish Parliament in 2003, sets the ground for
obligatory reporting of adverse events by the frontline personnel to a national
reporting system; the famous Article 6 of this Act (9), which reads “A health care
professional reporting an adverse event shall not as a result of such reporting be
subjected to disciplinary investigations or measures by the employing authority,
supervisory reactions by the National Board of Health or criminal sanctions by the
courts”, is opening a space for professional yet sincere debate grounds for gathering,
analyzing and communicating the knowledge of adverse events, in order to reduce the
number of such events in the healthcare system. In January 2004 the national
reporting system on adverse events in Denmark was set in place, obliging not only the
frontline personnel to report, but also the hospital owners to act on the reports and the
National Board of Health to communicate learning from the reports, after making data
anonymous, and in that way lifting it to the meta analytical level. More details of this
reporting system are available from the National Board of Health and Danish Society
for Patient Safety (DSFP) (17, 18). Figure 3. Adverse event reporting in the Danish healthcare system (18, modified) 50 (PSO = patient safety officer)
CASE STUDY: MEDIATION IN HEALTHCARE
For simple overcoming of the socio-medical problems in the health practice they
can be negotiated and potentially resolved, with good will and without judicial
intervention, by introduction of health mediators and patients’ advocates who are
taking up a role of a neutral middle-person in sensitive health-related issues. These
forms have been more or less successfully adopted in Romania (health mediators)
and Serbia (patients advocates), thus this case study is illustrating their existing and
potentially expanding role in solving socio-medical problems for a wider range of
health-related issues (including professional patterns of behaviour, adverse events
and malpractice). Romani health mediators in Romania
Roma Health Mediators (RHMs) are members of the Romani community who work
with their communities, physicians, and national health care systems to improve
Romani health, as attempt to challenge the health conditions of the 12 to 15 million
Roma living in Western and Eastern Europe exhibit some of the region’s worst health
indicators (19). Infant mortality rates among Romani communities in the Czech and
Slovak Republics and Hungary are about double the national average (20).
One of the most visible elements of the government strategies for addressing
the health issue of Roma is introduction of the programs for Roma Health Mediators
(RHM). RHM programs are meant to respond to the current situation and stereotyped
conditions of the Romani population by selecting individuals from Romani
communities to work as mediators who: (a) facilitate communication between
Romani patients and physicians during medical consultations, (b) communicate with
Romani communities on behalf of the public health system, (c) provide basic health
education, and, (d) assist Roma in obtaining the health insurance or identity
documents necessary to visit the doctor (19).
Although a similar concept in education was developed in France in 1986-87,
the leading country in the introduction of this comprehensive concept to healthcare
mediators is Romania. As the statistics is showing that large percentage of Romani
population in this country is not properly covered by health insurance, due to various
reasons, such as traditional practices or lack of personal identification documents, the
health status of this minority has been steadily showing a downwards trend, with
different disease structure than the general population. The initiator of the RHM was
the non-governmental organization CRISS (Roma Center for Social Intervention and
Studies) which in 2000 has introduced it as pilot version through training health
mediators to provide liaison between Roma families and mainstream public health
services (20), funding it through international and domestic project schemes.
In August 2002, the Ministry of Family and Health passed an ordinance
making Roma Health Mediator an official profession within the Romanian public
health system (21). According to the ministry’s ordinance, all mediators must be
trained and certified by Romani CRISS. The Romani CRISS theoretical training
covers communication, access to prevention and treatment services, the public health 51 insurance system, and first aid. However, RHMs must not provide any medical
services, as they are not qualified medical providers (19).
In addition to the standard curriculum, a small percentage of the mediators
have also been trained by Romani CRISS to address discrimination. The training
structure is somewhat flexible, and training in a long distance format is possible (19).
Graduates of the theoretical training must complete a three-month on the job
apprenticeship with a “qualified medical staff [person]” (21).
In 2002, the Ministry of Health and Family asked county public health
departments and Romani organizations to send their suggestions regarding whether or
not mediation was required, how many mediators were needed, and nominations for
who should fill this role.
Approximately 200 RHMs now work throughout Romania. Geographic
distribution is based on need as well as local level willingness to participate. RHMs
are currently paid about €83 monthly, which is equivalent to a nurse’s salary. They
are supervised by local and national authorities, as well as informally by Romani
CRISS. Each RHM is assigned to a local contact GP, who is based in a nearby health
facility. The GP meets weekly with the RHM to discuss tasks completed and any
problems. A representative of the Family and Social Assistance Section of the local
county public health department has monthly meetings with each mediator to provide
additional supervision and any required assistance (19).
The Family and Social Assistance Section should also reimburse RHMs for
travel costs associated with their work. In terms of interactions with national agencies,
the RHMs have four meetings per year with staff from the Ministry of Health’s
Department for the Health of Mother and Child, and must respond to an annual
ministry questionnaire. A representative of Romani CRISS phones each mediator
about every two months to discuss how work is progressing (19).
The concept also has its disadvantages and problems; despite the fact that local
authorities had nominated them, some RHMs had problems being hired following the
initial trainings. Moreover, many medical staff and county public health departments
did not understand the role of the mediator, and required substantial support from
Romani CRISS and the Ministry of Health and Family to cooperate effectively with
the RHMs. However, this is certainly an initiative that can be expanded when it
comes to addressing the health needs of the Romani population, and which can be
adjusted and replicated for the general population in the rural areas. Patients Advocates in healthcare settings in Serbia
The new Law on health protection (22) of the Republic of Serbia established a
system for protection of patients’ rights as a powerful tool for mediation and
solving one of the largest categories of socio-medical problems in the healthcare
practice.
The article 39 of the aforementioned Law (22), which regulates the right to
complaint, is also stipulating the mandate and responsibilities of the patients’ rights
advocates (“zastitnici prava pacijenata”). Among other, the Law stipulates that the
healthcare settings are responsible to provide conditions for work of the patients’
rights advocates; the director is appointing the advocate from the employees of the
healthcare setting, most usually the lawyer of the healthcare institution. Procedures 52 are set for both oral and written complaint, with timeframes within which the
patients’ advocate has to respond to the complaint, in a form of: legal advice,
opinion or information. The Law also regulates the format of the written complaint
to be submitted when patient right has been violated.
The patients’ rights advocate has obligation to submit written monthly report
to the Director of the healthcare setting, and a six-month report to the Board of the
healthcare institution and to the Ministry of Health.
Second level procedure includes complaint filed to the Ministry of Health of
Serbia, after what, if the patient is not satisfied with the reply, and still believes that
his/her rights have not been exercised and implemented, he/she or a member of
their family can forward to using court procedures.
The main role of the patients’ rights advocates is to mediate a dispute
between the patient and the healthcare setting or healthcare professional in a
peaceful and good will manner. Using this procedure, most cases of general
misunderstanding or misinformation about rights and responsibilities can be
resolved, thus avoiding extra burden on the judicial system in the country. Effective
as it sounds, however, this system, already existing in some other developing and
developed countries, has its own drawbacks, such as subjectivity of the advocate,
who works for one of the sides for which he/she has to mediate. EXERCISE
Task 1
Given the case study above, think about an initiative in your country for mediating
socio-medical problems in the health practice; try to consider the advantages and
drawbacks of the initiative. Task 2
From your knowledge and practice, think about a mechanism of health mediation
that might be applied for a particular health discipline (surgery, outpatient setting,
etc.). Write a brief explanation of the idea, fitting it into the currently available
medical and legal procedures of the chosen healthcare setting. REFERENCES

health care, quality, patient satisfaction, accreditation
After completing this module students and public health
professionals should:
• improve knowledge about characteristics and elements;
• of the quality of health care;
• be acquainted with concept of the total quality
management (TQM) and continuous quality improvement
(CQI);
• improve knowledge about patient satisfaction as element
of quality of health care;
• be acquainted with basic characteristics of accreditation in
health care.
WHO policy “Health for all” defines ten global goals and one of
them is relating to health care quality: “Improvement of
comprehensive high quality health care”. There are numerous
definitions of health care and WHO defines it as “the level where
delivered health care achieves the best results establishing the
balance between the risk and benefit within specified economic
conditions”. Basic dimensions of quality are equality, relevance,
accessibility, acceptability, effectiveness and efficiency. Motives
for establishing the system of quality in health care are
professional, socio-economical, patients’ satisfaction, and the final
and the most important at the same time – improvement of
population health. Modern concept of quality means
implementation of TQM (Total Quality Management) and CQI
(Continuous Quality Improvement) that represent managing
strategies whose main steps are managing consciousness, strategic
planning, management implementation and training of employees.
Principles are that patients’ needs, opinions and experience are the
important information in permanent improvement of quality, that
it has to be integrated part of everyday work, that all employees in
the system of health care have professional responsibility
according to permanent improvement of quality and particular
responsibility have managers at all levels in health institution, that
permanent improvement of quality means positive approach to Address for

Vera Grujic, Mirjana Martinov Cvejin THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction One of ten global goals of WHO policy “Health for 21st century” is “Improvement of
comprehensive, high quality health care”. This WHO policy approach has opened
new prospective and one of them is to focus the entire concentration to final effects of
health care, the one that considers health promotion/ disease prevention/ diagnostics/
treatment/ rehabilitation not like separate entities but as permanent group of activities
aimed to improve health. Such approach is supported by health services and care
system that is structurally and functionally integrated, both horizontally and
vertically. Therefore, one of specific goals within the global objective “Integrated
health sector” is “that all people should have better access to family-and-community
oriented primary health care by 2010, supported by flexible and responsible hospital
system in particularly: at least 90% of countries should have comprehensive primary
health care, enabling continuity of care through efficient, cost-effective referral
systems and feedback from secondary and tertiary hospital care. Results of health care
in at least five priority health problems should be significantly improved and
investigation should identify the greater satisfaction of patients with the quality of
delivered care” (1).
The question comes out what is the quality in general and what is quality in
health care and how to estimate it? Quality of health care can be defined as “the level
of excellence achieved and documented in the process of diagnostics and therapy
based on the best knowledge which achieves the less possible mortality and
morbidity” or “the level on which the health system increases possibility of desired
effects”. According to ISO (International Organization for Quality) (3) quality of
health care is defined as: ”the level where the group of more characteristics of
products or services satisfy specific or expected requirements”, while some define
quality as “that systematic, critical analysis of health care quality also includes
procedures used in diagnostics and therapy, then resources and results of effects,
patient’s quality of life (2). At the other hand, standards of health care quality should
be at the level where the health care is available, suitable, and continual and
documented as well as to be at the level where the adequate therapy is based on the
precise diagnosis, not on the symptomatology. Deming, one of creators of the concept
of quality management emphasizes that “quality should focus its activities to existing
and future requirements of users”; WHO defines quality as “the level where delivered
health care achieves the best results creating the balance between risk and benefit
within existing economic conditions” (4). There are other numerous definitions of
quality and therefore one American physician said that “quality is difficult to define,
impossible to measure but easy to recognize” (5). In general, those without enough
experience in clinical field require easy, precise and complete measures. The truth is
that some elements of quality are easy to be defined and measured while the others
require more complex procedures. 57 Quality means the level of excellence and it is recommended that quality
development shouldn’t be administrative control of previously defined quality levels
but it is a dynamic process. Health service should be organized in a way that medical
results are the main in input identification, process definition and evaluation of results
(output). The whole process has to be directed towards improvement of health,
patients’ satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, in contrast to traditionally managing
concept. Dimensions, characteristics and quality elements
Maxweell defines six basic dimensions of quality in health care (6):
1. Equality – offering the same health care to persons with the same needs,
regardless to their participation to some social or other group;
2. Relevance – means the requirements of community for health care, i.e. solving
priority health problems;
3. Accessibility – meaning that health care should be available in geographical,
time and functional sense;
4. Acceptability – suitable for population;
5. Effectiveness – to make right things in the right way that bring results, and
6. Efficiency – to make right things in the right way, i.e. to use available
resources rationally.
High quality components include high degree of professional excellence
regarding to actual situation and available technology, efficiency in resource
utilization, minimal risk for patient, patients’ satisfaction and final outcome of
delivered health care. The key element is that quality is complex and
multidimensional and very often it is not easy to be quantitatively expressed in a
simple way.
Main characteristics of modern system of quality in health care are:
− It is focused to the user;
− The process of quality improvement is managed by the highest leadership;
− Each person in health institution has responsibility for quality;
− It is directed to prevention of errors, not to their detection, and
− Quality has to be accepted as the lifestyle in health institution.
The key elements of health care quality are:
*Customer
*Commitment
*Expectations and
*Continuity
These elements all together make the quality diamond (2).
The customer is in the centre of the health care system. Each patient has to be
examined individually and not as anonymous person classified in some group
(diseased etc.). It has to be taken care that any patient is not the same, that each of
them has its own specific problems, needs and expectations. Commitment starts from
the physician, both towards patent and quality because without commitment nothing 58 representing the full meaning of quality is going to be achieved. Patients’ expectations
have to be recognized as well and they have to be satisfied and if it is possible to
overcome it, while health care requires continuity. Continuity enables permanent,
consistent concentration towards quality, to be permanently improved and never to be
finished. Quality has to be incorporated in all activities and gradually it becomes
habit. Customer

Patients’ satisfaction
Motivation of the staff
Professional work, and
Successful practice. Quality diamond describes what is considered to represent four critical
elements of health care quality and it should be taken care not to ignore any of these
elements. Sometimes there are various obstacles in implementation of quality, such as
insufficient commitment, sometimes it is difficult to decide wherefrom to begin the
action, sometimes quality is treated like additional work and sometimes there are just
attempts to do something exceptionally rapid or excessively much, that is also the fact
to be taken care in decision making concerning establishment the system of quality
(2). Reasons for establishing the system of quality
The answer to the question why to establish system of quality in health care is of high
significance, aiming also to find justification and purpose of these activities. 59 According to Donabedian, the answers are going to be different, depending on who is
asking that question, but a few basic motives can be noticed:
− Professional motivation is of vital importance in order to motivate medical
staff to be more active in enabling and improving of health care quality.
Certainly, one of professional elements is also desire of an individual to
develop and improve its own work, but characteristic for all medical
professionals is also their ethical approach towards their profession. Related to
this is the fact that obtaining the quality is observed as the way to notice
shortages and more important, as the way and possibility to improve quality in
everyday work. Participation and engagement of medical professionals in
establishing and application of the quality system is also professional
challenge for all employees and their additional motivation for work and it is
important mechanism in identification and analyses of differences in results of
health care that is the basis for further activities in improvement of quality;
− Socio-economic motivation is also important for activities in the field of
quality improvement. Quality in health care is the measure for efficiency that
indicates not only to importance in achieving of particular results but also to
efficient and rational allocation of available resources in order to obtain
desired results, but financials spent to health care have to be justified. Health
care becomes increasingly expensive, and at the same time an increasing
disappointment is expressed because principles of equality, effectiveness,
efficiency and quality in health care are not much more expressed, including
patients’ satisfaction with available health care.
− Patients’ satisfaction is important parameter of health care quality that also
includes their expectations and their assumptions on health service but also
represents the result of delivered care and treatment and finally, it represents
essential contribution in further treatment since it inspires patient to continue
cooperation with physician in order to solve his own health problems. All
together with other motives should lead to
− Improvement of population health as the general and main goal of entire
activities in health care (7,8). TQM and CQI
After the II World War the new concept of quality is developed – TQM (Total Quality
Management) and CQI (Continuous Quality Improvement). TQM is “universal
strategy of organizational changes and also the change of attitudes that enables people
to learn how to use methods for improvement of quality in order to be able to reduce
costs for health care and to satisfy needs of patients and other users (professionals)…
TQM is in the same way philosophy of management just like its method and it has
four main functions that are defined as the basis of good management:
− Strengthening of clinicians and managers in health care to gain knowledge to
conduct analysis of work process in order to be able to improve it;
− Acceptance of the attitude that the patient is not the only user in health care but
it is also the health worker and also the adoption of standards where the user is
the primary goal in the quality; 60 − Development of multidisciplinary approach which is above and out of
conventional limitations like departments, specializations etc.;
− Enabling the motivation for rational, data based approach to the process of
analysis and changes (9,10).
Both concepts are managing strategies described as “permanent efforts of all
members in particular organization focused to needs and expectations of customers”.
Regardless to numerous critics that application of TQM and CQI in health care is only
“temporary fashion”, just in USA these programs are applied in around of 4000
hospitals spending more than a billion dollars annually to them. It is also estimated
that there are more than 1000 practical guides applied in everyday activity. Similar
situation is also in the other developed western European countries. It is interesting to
be mentioned that Japan as well, the leader in quality management in industry, is at
the beginning of its efforts to introduce TQM and CQI in the field of health care (9,
10, 11).
TQM should be incorporated in the whole organization, and the main steps are:

highly qualitative clinical services according to patients’ requirements should have
the following elements:
1. Delivered services have to be:
− Acceptable;
− Effective;
− Available, and
− Appropriate, concerning the patient and other interested subjects.
2. Health services have to be organized in the sense of:
− Clear managing devotion, leadership and capability;
− Optimal teamwork and recognition of values among employees;
− Implementation of quality techniques (existing standards, clinical
control, communication with patients etc.);
− Monitoring and identification of performances. 3. Quality of health services has to be analyzed at the following levels:
− Hospital level (the level of health institution);
− Manager level;
− Specialist level;
− The level of individual members of employees.
−
The important part in the process of quality management is to enable all processes to
be controlled, confirmed that are complete, documented and also to enable
corresponding persons to be included (12-15).
CQI is based on the following principles:
− Patient’s needs, opinions and experience on all aspects of their health care
(structure, process, result) are important information for permanent quality
improvement that should be regularly collected in order to obtain feed back
information on delivered health care;
− Permanent quality improvement has to make integrated part of everyday work
of all employees;
− All employees in the system of health care have professional responsibility
concerning permanent quality improvement of their work. This is related to
responsibility from the aspect of presented satisfactory level of health care and
from the aspect of patient s and other subjects (public etc.);
− Activities in permanent quality improvement require cooperation of different
profiles of medical workers and other professionals as well as of various
sectors;
− Managers at all levels in health institution are responsible for organizational
structure that enables incorporated permanent quality improvement in
everyday activity;
− All activities are carried out in order to realize objectives of quality, mutually
defined by health workers, patients and other who make decisions related to
health care; 62 − Permanent quality improvement means positive approach in everyday work.
The objective is to identify the best results that are going to be used in further
improvement of work quality, not only to identify and eliminate unpleasant
results, and
− Activities in permanent quality improvement should be based on data and
information, i.e. on scientific principles not on assumptions (9-11). Improvement in culture of quality

Total Quality Management in Health Care. Longman, 1992:248 Patients’ satisfaction
Significant element in health care quality is patients’ satisfaction concerning delivered
health care because users of the system of health care give great contribution in 63 identification of quality and standards used in measuring of these aspects. Their
opinion and estimation, i.e. their satisfaction is one of measures in health care quality.
It can be defined in the easiest way as - satisfying of their expectations, desires and
needs. WHO defines patients’ satisfaction as the result of estimation of an individual
about coordination of expected and obtained health care or “the level of satisfied
patients’ expectations by health care system”. Certainly, patient is going to be more
satisfied if he is not waiting too long for delivery of health service, when there is
existing continuity of health care and when patient can rely on the same physician
every moment, and when he is in situation to present his problems without hurry and
to obtain clear explanations for recommended treatment, including the risk of various
procedures (15, 16).
Answers why it is important to estimate patients’ satisfaction are as follows:
− Providers of health care desire to satisfy expectations of their patients and
therefore their satisfaction is the objective of the universal system of health
care;
− Patients’ satisfaction is also the consequence, i.e. the result of provided health
care;
− Patients’ satisfaction contributes to positive effects of provided health care
because satisfied patient is going to accept recommendations of his physician
much better than unsatisfied patient and this is going to have positive influence
to the result of treatment and to the quality of his life as well (17). Accreditation in health care system
By establishing the system of quality in health care the question of accreditation of
health institutions arises. Accreditation is defined as “the system of external
estimation of coordination with the set of standards”. The point is that term of
accreditation is used to mark the wide range of measures or inspections in health care,
including certification, license acquirement etc.
In the system of accreditation all procedures have to be documented. This
documentation should include:
− The field of activity: what has been done;
− Applied procedures: how it has been done;
− Quality standards: how good it has been done;
− Procedure verification: how much we know how good it has been done.
The accreditation system is the best recognized through the following five
characteristics:
− Estimation of performances of health institution;
− External involvement in estimation that is usually coordinated or is managed
by some professional agency;
− Standards which define performance attributes that are to be estimated;
− Measuring of performances regarding standards and identification of parts with
identified deviations where changes are necessary, and 64 − Report on results of the process of inspection which can include one explicit
judgment on the level of performances and whether the acceptable level is
achieved, while conclusion can also include certain recommendations (18).
The basic objectives, i.e. purposes of accreditation are:
− Quality improvement – using the accreditation process in order to achieve
changes in practice that are going to improve health care quality;
− Gaining information in order to make decisions – presenting data on health
care quality, health insurance fund, politicians, managers, medical
professionals, public and others who can use these data as the basis in various
decision makings, and
− Responsibility because in this way, health institution, usually responsible to
various subjects – government, health insurance fund etc. – is able to regulate
and coordinate its behaviour in order to protect interests of patients and other
users.
Accreditation has long history in so called public services, particularly in
health care. The first real accreditation system is developed in USA established by
American Surgeon Association, just after the II World War. In 1951 the new
organization is formed – Mutual commission for hospital accreditation. In that period
Canadian hospitals also took part in activity of this Commission, since 1959 when
Canadian Association for hospital accreditation has been formed. In 1974
accreditation system was established in Australia as well. During the long period
these three counties were the only where accreditation was applied. Later on the real
explosion of accreditation came out in the international level with various
accreditation systems in France, Spain, Great Britain, Hungary, South Africa and
many other countries.
Reasons for this great interest are numerous – effects in society due to
increased consumption, increased patients’ expectations, changes in health care
system - greater than before application of various technologies, increased health care
expenses etc.; they all had their part in regulation and explicit measuring in health
care.
Nowadays accreditation is very widely applied as an approach in managing
and improving of health care quality. In many countries various accreditation
programs are established and such high variations - regarding the way of
implementation, who is going to manage the program, which standards should be
used etc. - have many advantages because they offer possibility to achieve new
knowledge from different experiences and approaches that reaches to improvement of
health care quality and also to improvement of population health quality of life. EXERCISE

Helmut Wenzel THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Health is perceived as most precious good, and people feel its vulnerability. Societies
have been trying to absorb, ameliorate or compensate consequences and health risks
with varying emphasis and varying success. Due to the uniqueness of good health to a
persons’ ability to live the life he or she wants, health care and performance of health
care systems are under critical observation. In this context many discussions swivel
around ethics, justice, equity, equality and fairness, very often using these notions
interchangeably. Sometimes they are used as arguments to challenge every economic
consideration by claiming “the freedom of therapeutic choices”, and pointing out the
humanitarian aspect of an individual’s health and the danger of withholding intervention options or rationing. It is not surprising to see, that many health care
professionals and patients see a certain incompatibility between financing, operational
aspects of health care, like allocation of resources, and ethical expectations. Nevertheless, this is not necessarily so. In the following we will discuss what principles
should rule a health care system. Furthermore conflicts and trade-offs between performance measures like effectiveness and efficiency and equity considerations will be
discussed.
The provision of health care takes place in a complex system (see figure 1). In
the framework for producing health, the citizen’s health or patient’s outcomes are
determined by several factors. It is quite obvious that primarily the configuration of
the existing structure of the care environment and the processes by number and quality make up the frame of action and finally determine the patient’s outcomes. Nevertheless, the state of the art of medicine, training, education, and last but not least the
financial resources define the portfolio of feasible interventions. Thus, the organization of health care, e.g. financing, and provision of care is a limiting variable in this
context which deserves specific attention.
The set-up of the health care system is critical to an appropriate and feasible
care. In Western economies health economists think that a suitable organizational
make-up of a health care system should fulfil the following criteria (1):
− Sovereignty and personal responsibility of citizens;
− So-called secondary liability of state-run actions;
− Equity (horizontally and vertically);
− Effectively and efficiency;
− Sustainability and stability;
− Legal certainty;
− Transparency. 68 Determining Factors of Health Care H. Wenzel Structure:

Source: Helmut Wenzel, unpublished Besides criteria that pick out more or less aspects of self-conception and selfdetermination - like sovereignty, personal responsibility, and elements of performance, e.g. stability - effectiveness and efficiency are seen to be equally important.
Furthermore, we expect that the access to health care and the available care should not
be limited by the social standing or financial potential. Limited resources and its
usage always raise questions of justice. Equity considerations are therefore inseparably linked to fair processes of resource allocation. The relative importance (weights)
of the various criteria might be different in different societies. They have to be seen in
the light of a societal consensus - a kind of societal treaty. In this treaty it is laid down
how a society is made up. Basically important considerations have to be made with
respect to the questions whether the societal self-conception is socialistic, communistic or more liberal. Is the governance autocratic or more democratic? And finally is
the economy based on free-market or more regulated? Depending on the combination
of the above features, the expectation on the quality of a health care system might
vary substantially. Anyhow, questions will come up like, what health services should
be publicly funded, how indications for particular interventions should be defined,
whether societal groups need specific attention and how.
Researchers from different scientific disciplines have been working on justice,
ethics or equity in health care with various tools, paradigms and intentions. Philosophers (2) with the view on justice and ethics came to a similar appraisal as economists who specify criteria for an appropriate health care system. However, the
philosophers’ view is more focused on the “direct” human needs and consequences.
Justice is understood here as an equivalent of normative ethics, and the way how moral topics are analyzed. It describes primarily a set of tools and methods (3). They
conclude that four principles should be the basis for an ethical evaluation of health 69 care, independent from the make-up of the system. They are seen as a kind of normative guidance. Those principles are (1) respect for autonomy, (2) beneficence, (3)
non-mal-efficiency and (4) justice. Researchers with focus on 'medical ethics', aiming
specifically at regulating the relationship between patient and health care professional,
have been specifying six principles that should guide the behaviour of an ethical
doctor. These principles are: (a) preserve life, (b) alleviate suffering, (c) do no harm,
(d) tell the truth, (e) respect the autonomy of the patient and (f) deal fairly with
patients.
None of these principles are absolute or independent; each may conflict with
the others. There might even exist trade-offs which are quantity-dependent. Hence,
the binding character of those principles is “prima facie”, which means that the binding is unless it conflicts with another moral principle. If it does, one has to choose
between them (4). The resolution of such conflicts is a matter of personal value judgment. Unfortunately, philosophers don’t provide a method for this kind of appreciation and for solving value conflicts. Following Samuelson’s definition of economics
this is the typical domain of economics and health economics. He states” the study of
how men and society end up choosing, with or without the use of money, to employ
scarce productive resources that could have alternative uses, to produce various
commodities and distribute them for consumption, now or in the future, among
various people and groups in society. It analyses the costs and benefits of improving
patterns of resource allocation (5). Equity and Ethics
As mentioned earlier, fairness, justice and equity are notions that are often used synonymously to describe concerns about access to health care and the amount of care
citizens will get without discrimination. The Office of Health Economics (OHE) outlines this concern as follows: “Efficiency is not everything. We are also concerned
with what is fair. If we had a market distribution of health care, then only those who
could afford to pay would be able to purchase it. Most people regard that as unacceptable. This is a major reason why most societies regard health care as different from
other commodities”.
Questions regarding equity have been the main reason for government involvement in health care world-wide. OHE further states “A concern about equity was
one of the main motivating forces behind the creation of the National Health Service
(NHS) in the UK. William Beveridge, the architect of the welfare state, argued for a
health service which would provide treatment "to every citizen without exception,
without remuneration limit and without an economic barrier at any point to delay
recourse to it". Equity has remained a major goal within the UK system. A concern
about equity has also been reflected by other countries' approaches to health care.
McGuire, Henderson and Mooney have pointed out that the introduction of public
health insurance in Canada in 1971 "was explicitly stated to be motivated by a
concern to make health care utilization less dependent upon income". Blewett has
suggested that in Australia "The introduction of Medicare in February 1984 was
designed to ensure that all Australians have access to medical and hospital services on
the basis of need". Even in the US, which has the most market orientated health care
system in the developed world, the state intervened to provide Medicare and Medicaid
to help the poor afford health care”(6). 70 The Content of Equity
Looking at literature, there seems to be no uniquely correct way of defining equity
and its determination. Mooney for example listed seven possible definitions: Equality
of expenditure per capita, inputs per capita, inputs for equal need, access for equal
need, utilization for equal need, marginal met need, and health. He finally comes to
the conclusion that a mix of equal inputs for equal need and equal access for equal
need might be the most practical (feasible) description of equity (7).
WHO refers to equity as “principle of being fair to all, with reference to a defined and recognized set of values”. More concretely it says “equity in health implies
that ideally everyone should have a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential
and more pragmatically, that no one should be disadvantaged from achieving this
potential, i.e. everyone should have geographical and financial access to available
resources in health care ...” (8). The crux with this statement is that it establishes a
relation between the undetermined notion “equity” and the undetermined notion “fair
opportunity”.
A more illustrative definition comes from Mayberry et al. stating equity means
to “provide care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such
as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status” (9).
For further considerations it turned out to be useful to distinguish between
horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal equity means equal treatment for equal conditions; it applies especially to the delivery of health care, e.g. equal resources, utilization, and access per head. Most discussions refer to this. In this case, the efficiency
and equity aspects will tend to move together. Nevertheless, most conflicts are seen in
vertical equity. Vertical equity deals with the question whether unequal cases are
treated unequally. In prevention one could think about a case where for a majority of
a population the risk could be reduced a little and would save fewer lives than concentrating the same resources on a few at high risk. The case could be even more delicate
when we assume that the few are at higher ages. Another example, if there was a rare
blood type of which the hospital only has access to one unit of blood, and they at the
same time receive two patients who both need one unit of that rare blood. One of
them is a 22 year old recent college graduate who was in an accident with a drunk
driver, and the other is an 80 year old widower, who has been sick for 5 years. Representatives of a “fair innings” approach (10) would say that we should give the unit to
the 22 year old because there is more life to be lived by him than the sick 80 year old
man. Another case with ethnically grounded disparities and conflicts between efficiency and equity deals with kidney transplants. The efficiency of transplantation
could be improved by human leukocyte antigens (HLA) matching. The closer the
match the better is the chance of a successful transplant. From the viewpoint of using
scarce resources efficiently this matching makes sense. Gaston et al (11) found out
that this policy discriminates black patients for whom it is less likely to find a match.
They conclude that for the sake of equity diminished efficiency has to be accepted. The Philosophical Basis of Equity
Even when we refer to the universal principles mentioned earlier the application of
moral rules comes to different results. Obviously, the definition of equity and its practical use depends on the underlying, not always overt - philosophical theories. To 71 understand ongoing discussions and solutions offered in the literature one has to come
back to the philosophical theories. The different schools can be classified into:
Utilitarianism, Rawlsian, Entitlement/libertarian, Egalitarian, Deontological, Virtue
and “Rights” oriented theories.
Each of them has a specific focus. The underlying concept of utilitarianism is
maximizing for the greatest utility for greatest number. This is compatible with
economic efficiency considerations. Critical question is whose utilities are meant?
The Rawlsian position expects an allocation conducted under a ‘veil of ignorance’,
aiming at balancing between higher and lower risk in people who are discriminated by
nativity (Rawls, 1971). “Veil of ignorance” means that a principle of allocation would
be called just, when people would agree on the principles in a situation where they
don’t know whether they are sick and whether they would benefit from the principle.
In fact this theory assumes total risk averseness, and leads to a position of less well
off in society being maximized. Entitlement/libertarian (Robert Nozick, 1974) holds
the view that individuals are entitled to get what they have acquired “justly” within a
market situation. Emphasis is put on freedom of choice and property rights, assuming
minimal state involvement. This is similar to utilitarianism. Moral rules as a strict
guiding principle play the central role in deontological and virtue based theories.
Moral rules like ‘do to others as you would have done to you’ (Kant), depict an
absolute moral code of how life should be lived. Rights based theories focus on indisputable ‘rights’ which cannot be overridden, e.g. ’right’ to life. They are absolute and
inflexible.
According to their main focus they also can be divided into theories that deal
primarily with distributive justice, highlighting fairness of outcomes and those that
look at procedural justice concerned with the processes in achieving the outcomes.
Figure 2 gives an overview. Figure 2: Categories of Ethical Theories. Source: Health Economics Network UK The definition of equity is as multifarious as the heterogeneity of philosophical
theories. Which philosophical concept is appropriate for a given health care system
and which definition of equity should be chosen depends on the societal consensus.
Even when we accept that the four ethical rules are universal, the application of ethics
to practical decision-making is very much guided by the expectation of a society. A 72 kind of lowest denominator is the criterion of equality of access which is consistent
with most ethical theories and consistent with efficiency (it preserves consumer sovereignty). Guidance for Analyzing Equity in Health Care
Disparities may occur at different parts of a network. At the level of the health care
system, at an individual and community level and, last but not least, on a patientprovider level. Mayberry et al. propose a theoretical framework for the analysis of
disparities. Figure 3 shows those parts of a kind of influence network. Indicators of
inequality are access, use and health outcomes. Figure 3: Three Dimensions of an Influence Network of Inequalities. Source: Based on
Mayberry (9) The individual/environment entity covers factors like socio-cultural norms and
values, social network and cohesions, and individual health promotion and careseeking behaviour. The patient-provider part focuses on communication between patients and provider. This includes factor as trust, respect, patient participation in clinical decisions and ability to navigate the health care system. Finally, the capacity of
the health care system is put on a test-bench. This is, in a narrow sense, the classical
topic for analyzing equity.
The basic practical problem facing an equity policy is to find out which patients are the worst-off and should receive priority. Practically it is not easy to determine the degree of inequality. Rutten even stimulates the creation of an aggregate
measure of expected misery (12). At least, on a national or regional level disparities
can be determined by calculating measures of statistical dispersion like a Gini Index
or a Suits Index, to display disparities in financing or health. 73 Economics in Health Care: Compatibility or inexpiable Polarity
Many clinicians and citizens don’t feel comfortable with economically grounded
assessments. They believe that allowing costs to influence clinical decisions is unethical. They are mistaken in this belief. It cannot be ethical to ignore the adverse consequences upon others of the decisions you make, which is what 'costs' means from an
economist’s view. Of course, there are some important ethical issues in deciding what
costs to count, and how to count them. But these dilemmas are equally strong with respect to what benefits to count and how to count them, some of which expose ethically untenable assumptions about such widely-used clinical criteria as survival rates.
One of the advantages of systematic economic appraisal tools, like cost-effectiveness
analysis is that it exposes these hidden assumptions, and requires explicit judgments
to be made about which ethical position is appropriate in a particular policy context.
By creating transparency this should have the important incidental benefit of improving the accountability of policy-makers to the community they are serving (13).
In opposition to these cited conflicts economists should have no difficulty
in seeing their own work in the health care field as being directed towards the
fulfilment of those same ethical principles. According to their professional
terminology they would probably name it differently. Williams points out that, for
instance, the demand to preserve life and alleviate suffering would be seen as a description of the objectives of health care, concentrating our attention on improving
both the length and quality of people's lives. The postulation to do no harm would be
seen as a request to minimize the risks of adverse effects from treatment and even as a
plea for prevention. Telling the truth is a general duty accepted by all analysts, and
respecting the autonomy of the patient would be seen as referring to the need to have
the patients' values count rather than those of the practitioners when decisions about
treatment are being made. But the final item on the list - about dealing fairly with
patients - reminds us that we will seldom find ourselves dealing with situations in
which only one patient's interests are affected, so that we will have to face the
problematical question of how much weight to attach to the (possibly conflicting)
values of each affected individual in such circumstances. And in any system in which
the individual patient pays only part of the costs of care, the number of individuals
who are affected in one way or another by a treatment decision may be very large
indeed (14).
Consequently, economists have been trying to overcome the vagueness and
high level argumentation by breaking down those principles into applicable principles, processes and tools. The health economist is seeking, through the use of
appraisal techniques to help decision-makers to maximize the benefits of health care
within the constraint of whatever level of resources society has chosen to devote to
health care. These benefits are seen as improvements in people's length and quality of
life in which the distribution of these benefits between individuals is a matter of some
importance. Clearly, there is nothing there that conflicts with conventional medical
ethics. Even the stress laid by economists on the need to examine carefully the 'tradeoffs' that are established at the margin between the competing good things that we
seek in health care, simply mirrors the relativity of ethical principles and the
acknowledged need to strike a balance between them. The difficulties seem to arise
because economists go further than others do in the quantification of these elements.
We must now explore why they do so, and for this purpose adopt a somewhat
different perspective, that of welfare economics (14). 74 Williams explains that economists have sought to avoid making explicit interpersonal comparisons when judging whether one situation is better or worse than
another, and a whole branch of the subject - i.e. 'welfare economics' - has grown from
that ambitious objective. The basic idea is to separate 'efficiency' from 'equity', with
'efficiency' being kept free of interpersonal comparisons of welfare, all such judgments being encompassed in 'equity'. The definition of efficiency which achieves this
separation is due to Pareto (and hence is often called Pareto-efficiency) and it declares
a situation to be efficient if in that situation it is not possible to make anyone better off
without making someone else worse off. If resources are being used 'wastefully' it
should be possible to put them to some other use which will not harm the person from
whom they are taken but will benefit those to whom they are given, thus the initial
situation would have been 'inefficient'. The same would generally be true if resources
are lying idle or are underutilized.
In the Paretian framework it is the individual's own judgment of whether he or
she is better or worse off that counts, not the judgment of any third party; thus it observes very strictly the ruling to respect the autonomy of the individual. No judgments
are made about the status quo, which is simply accepted as the starting point, our only
concern being whether or not some change is an unambiguous improvement on it.
The realm of application of this strict Paretian notion of 'efficiency' is, however, severely limited, since there are very few changes in real life that do not adversely
affect the welfare of somebody or other. To ease this restriction on the applicability of
the strict efficiency criterion, it was extended to cover situations in which the potential gainers from a change could fully compensate the potential losers, and still have
some gains left over (compensation being paid in money terms, say). But identifying
actual gainers and losers precisely, and setting up an incorruptible mechanism to
enable such compensation actually to be paid, would in most cases be very costly. So
this 'compensation principle' in turn got watered down to include cases where the
compensation did not actually have to be paid, thus under the 'potential Pareto
criterion' it has only to be shown that for a change to be declared 'efficient' the gains
must on balance outweigh the losses (gains and losses generally being evaluated in
money terms). To decide whether gains outweigh losses they must be measured in
commensurable terms, so there has grown up a strong tradition of quantification and
valuation, which has been applied to all kinds of gains and losses, including the value
of life and safety. Calculating the 'efficiency' gains and losses in this way still leaves
us with the distributional consequences to think about, and these are typically
transferred to the 'equity' realm to be evaluated separately. In practice they are often
ignored, however, in the hope that in the long run, over a multitude of different
activities, they will all wash out. Thus the efficiency calculus as used in practice by
economists does not really achieve the desired avoidance of all interpersonal
comparisons of welfare. At best it says there are no losers, and it assumes that it does
not matter who the gainers are. At worst it says that there are both gainers and losers,
but it is up to somebody else to look at the equity implications (15). Dealing with Limited Resources
No health care system can satisfy all the possible demands made upon it, so decisions
about allocating resources are of particular importance. The allocation takes place at
different levels: i.e. allocation between institutions and by type of care. For instance
decisions have to be made about the amount of money that should be devoted to 75 hospitals, even different kind of hospitals, and how much money should go to
ambulatory care. Those decisions are very often overlapped by regional or municipal
considerations that lay outside the health care sector and the appropriate provision of
care. There are connections to other sectors of a national economy and respective
goals, like strengthening the regional economic performance. Figure 4: Alternative Ways of allocating limited Resources. Based on: J. Coast et al (15) Even more complex are decisions that have to allocate money between the
different kinds of prevention, cure and rehabilitation. Again, facing the fact that
resources will always be limited, the question is how this task can be achieved in a
way that satisfies most of the expectations of modern, democratic societies.
According to Coast (15) more or less two options exist: Rationing and explicit priority
setting.
Rationing is a crucial issue, sometimes it is even misunderstood. Health care
rationing refers to “any planning, resource allocation or pruning of ineffective or
unproved processes” (16, 17). Rationing is thus merely another term for stating that
we must decide how to allocate our limited resources (18). Much rationing takes place
by controlling the access to the health care system. It is not only debatable who is
entitled (or authorized) to make these decisions. It is also critical how the rationing
procedure looks like and what are the relevant criteria and who defined it. In an
implicit rationing procedure the decisions and the preferences are not revealed, which
is hardly acceptable in modern societies. There is no real awareness of the principles
used. In contrast, explicit rationing is concerned with making clear the decisions that
have been made and the basis upon which the decisions have been made. It results
from political bargaining processes and/or technical methods as promoted by
economist. In political processes the consent of society could be received by either lay
participation in the decision processes or by the anticipation of the citizen needs by
experts. In the late sixties this kind of effort to integrate as many citizens with their 76 specific needs as possible in political planning processes was called advocacy
planning. The basic and progressive idea was that experts (and politicians) would be
able and willing to anticipate the problems of those people that have not the ability to
participate in political processes in a democratic appropriate way. In reality this
approach was not very successful and should not be seen as a significant option. In
contrast economists rely on the “art” of making rational choices and promote that
choices should be made more explicit and be based on efficiency appraisals (19).
Looking at the very nature of health economics the starting point is
straightforward, “In the beginning, middle and end was, is, and will be scarcity of
resources” (20), and the issue of choice and priorities. Taking a choice - priority
setting means that a decision has to be made not only about what to do, but also what
to leave undone. Opportunities forgone - what we leave undone - is central to health
economics. Opportunities forgone are cost: “The cost of a unit of a resource is the
benefit that would be derived from using it in its best alternative use.” (21) The
concept of cost in health economics is different to the concept of cost in accounting
that relates to cash outlays. Therefore, when economists argue that attention should be
paid to efficiency in health care they are implying that health care programmes,
treatments and procedures should be compared not only in terms of their relative
benefits, but also in terms of their relative costs, i.e. benefits forgone. The Concept of Efficiency
The concept of efficiency is central to the models and techniques proposed by
economists. Economic theory believes in the rational nature of men (paradigm of
homo oeconomicus). This further leads to the assumption that each individual wants
to maximize its degree of satisfaction, which is measured in terms of benefits. In
order to maximize the benefits the individual will make sure that the last unit of
money spent will create the same amount of benefit. Efficiency can be classified into
different forms:
1. Technical efficiency, with two sub forms:
a) Cost-efficiency: Product applications or intervention strategies which
achieve a given health outcome at the lowest level of resource
utilization are called efficient or economical. This is also called
operational efficiency and sometimes cost-effectiveness (22). It refers
to the so-called fixed effectiveness approach, too.
b) Output-efficiency: Product applications or intervention strategies which
generate the best possible outcome or goal achievement for a given
resource input are called efficient or most productive. This is also called
fixed cost approach.
2. Allocative efficiency
Looks at the combination of goods that have to be financed and goes
beyond looking for the most cost-effective types of interventions. This
could mean that what conditions should be treated is subject to
evaluation as well. The theoretical foundation is the definition of
efficiency of Pareto (so called Pareto-efficiency). A situation is
perceived to be efficient if it is not possible to make anyone better off
without making someone else worse off. 77 Efficiency evaluations include an assessment of resource input (or costs) and
outcomes. Generally speaking, efficiency is measured by the relationship between the
level of accomplishment of these goals (consequences) and the resources used or
expenditures. The fact that something is efficient does not necessarily mean that it
will lead to cost reduction; cost reduction and efficiency generally represent two
different perspectives. An intervention can be called efficient when an additional
resource input or higher cost are required to achieve a better outcome with a higher,
overcompensating benefit.
Therefore, even those interventions which are more expensive than
established alternatives, but which exhibit higher performance of medical tests in
terms of predictive value, greater effectiveness in treatments/interventions, more
safety, fewer side-effects, etc. may be efficient.
Whereas private accounting is generally limited to factors measurable in
monetary terms, classical economic analysis extends the examination to qualitative
and intangible costs and consequences. It explicitly attempts to measure factors which
are difficult to evaluate monetarily. Statements regarding the relative economic
efficiency of intervention strategies compared require an examination of the entire
spectrum of costs and consequences of interventions.
There are different ways to define and to measure benefits. Some of those
methods are based on the principles of welfare-theory, some are based on the
assumption only that men are deciding in a rational way (pragmatic decision-makers).
Other methods incorporate the preferences of patients into the desirability of
outcomes. Table 1 gives a short overview.
The appropriate choice of a method depends not only on the availability of
data; it rather has to be guided by the purpose of the assessment. Insofar scientific
strictness is the guiding principle. The various stakeholders have different views and
goals (see figure 5). The usage of the results determines the viewpoint and
consequently the number of effects measured and the way how they are valued.
Health economics literature describes three different perspectives an analyst can take
when determining the cost and benefits of a health program: welfarist, extra-welfarist
and pragmatic (decision-maker oriented). Each of those perspectives have specific
objectives, are based on different principles and assumptions, values the costs and
benefits differently and therefore demands specific data. A welfarist has a strong
welfare economics theoretical background. He puts considerable emphasis on the
valuation from an individual’s viewpoint, thus preferring the willingness-to-pay
method or the method of prevailed preferences to the human capital approach. A pure
perspective of the health sector budget holder is taken by the extra-welfarist.
The pragmatist’s view theoretically is the weakest. Choosing the appropriate
evaluation approach not only depends on the problem being addressed, but also on the
institutional framework and the measurement challenges (24). Within the scope of the
operationalization of an evaluation project one must crosscheck the research question
with the specific attention and motives of stakeholders and subsequently find the
relevant outcome measures and criteria of economic performance and the respective
evaluation method. Finally one has to cover topics like level of evidence needed, the
economic criteria and the decision rules to be applied. 78 Table 1. Study Types and Goals Type of Study

Care (23) Effectiveness and Efficiency
Efficiency can be seen as the final stage of a logical process of three steps measuring
economic performance from efficacy to effectiveness and finally to efficiency (see
figure 4). Without efficacy and without effectiveness no efficiency is possible.
Efficacy and effectiveness both describe to what extend a goal could be reached. If a
goal cannot be reached, any resource input is wasted and therefore inefficient.
Historically effectiveness measurements come from engineering science where
technical performance had to be measured. The result has been typically displayed as
physical units per resource used. In the health care sector for example cost per saved
years of life or prevented cases. The measure of effectiveness can be
multidimensional. This can lead then to challenges when making the comparison with
and without a project. For that reason analyst always try to have one outcome measure
either by finding an algorithm to aggregate the various indicators into one measure or
by applying measures that are multidimensional, like a quality of life measurement
scale. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) specifically takes this into consideration. 79 Figure 5: Medical and Economic Benefits from different Viewpoints. Source: Wenzel,
Presentation at EDMA meeting in Brussels, 2008 Efficacy is a specific measure of effectiveness used in the health care sector.
Efficacy is the study outcome under ideal, i.e. controlled conditions and is expected to
be an unbiased proof that an intervention works. It is a “proof of principle”, based on
randomized clinical trials (RCT). Controlling for possible confounders implicates that
compliance is higher than in real life and the patients are highly selected (exclusion of
certain conditions, i.e. multi-morbidity, age and gender) and therefore not
representative for a specific target population. Transferring efficacy data directly to a
target population would lead to an overestimation of the effects. As a next step one
wants to know now how it works under real conditions in a target population. This
kind of evaluation provides effectiveness data. It is the classical area for empirical
studies of health services research and public health. If efficacy and effectiveness are
proven, efficiency analysis would be the final step, then. As efficiency depends on the
health care system, the viewpoint of the evaluation and therefore on the number of
effects and assessed data of efficacy and effectiveness do not necessarily lead to
efficient results.
In summary on can say, that efficacy and effectiveness data are prerequisites,
and in terms of formal logic, essential but not sufficient conditions. It happens that
effective interventions are useful and efficient in one country but not in others. One
has to be cautious to transfer (uncritically) data between various countries. The study
types shown in the table above will deliver different kinds of information that might
not be suitable for any research question. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will
only display relative efficiency, i.e. compare only two alternatives aiming at the same
objective. Therefore many economists express their concerns whether a CEA is
suitable for comparing across different forms of health care (allocative efficiency)
thus providing technical efficiency only. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) displays 80 absolute efficiency, like in a business investment calculation, where the return of
investment is calculated. The valuation of life (saves years of life) in terms of money
has been disputed for many reasons. Equity issues are seen in way how the valuation
of saved cases of different ages are weighted or how life and health will be valued.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to carry out a CBA. The valuation of physical
units, like saved years of life, can be based on willingness-to-pay or on the human
capital approach. With the willingness-to-pay approach the preferences of citizens or
patients are used to put a monetary value on time. From an economic perspective this
is the adequate way. Figure 6: Medical and Economic Performance from different Viewpoints. Source: Presentation
at EDMA meeting in Brussels, 2008 In practice there is much preparatory work required. With the human capital
approach lifetime is valued based on the earnings of person that are either forgone or
could be saved when life is prolonged and/or morbidity is prevented. It has been a
challenge to value lifetime of pensioners, housewives and children in an acceptable
way. In spite of that, this approach has some advantages with respect to feasibility
(availability of data). In addition to the question whether a type of valuation is in line
with the evaluation goal and the design, it is the human capital approach that
contributed to the disrepute of economic evaluations and raised ethical questions. Conclusion
In conclusion one can say that the request for efficiency and inherently effectiveness
and for equity has the same roots: It is scarcity. So, efficiency and equity are flip sides
of a coin. Equity without efficiency is not feasible, and efficiency without taking
equity into consideration is unethical. There is no universal agreed ethics for objecti- 81 ves of the health care sector. But equality of access is consistent with most ethical
theories and consistent with efficiency - it preserves consumer sovereignty. EXERCISES
Task 1.
After introductory lectures students will work in small groups divided according to
their countries. They will be given the case study to discuss the question of equity and
effectiveness in a health system. This exercise should take 45 minutes. Task 2.
For the next exercise, they will be grouped in two larger groups, the first group will
be pro equity oriented and the second group pro efficiency oriented. They will
participate in debate (pro equity vs. pro efficiency). The aim of the discussion is to
explore the possibilities for change and improvement of equity and efficiency in their
case study health system. The exercise will be concluded with discussion summary
given by teacher. It is recommended that exercise lasts 90 minutes. REFERENCES

professionals should:
•
Increase their knowledge related to financial and regulatory
principles in European health systems;
•
Be aware of recent challenges and opportunities in front of their
health systems;
•
Recognize the necessity for investing in health;
•
Understand the basic mechanisms of market development in
healthcare and its regulation.
•
Identify different methods and types of regulation in the
healthcare market.
The authors analyze the basic financial principles and the regulated
entrepreneurship in the healthcare systems in Europe. They point out
that the European countries organize, manage and finance their
health care in different ways. Thus the health systems vary not only
in the financial methods used, but also in the payment scheme of the
insurance institution and the healthcare providers as well as the ways
in which the state regulates the health services provision and the
development of market relations in healthcare. Some of the most upto-date challenges and opportunities in front of European healthcare
systems are overviewed. An example case study is presented in order
to illustrate the need for investing in health as well as for careful
financial and regulatory planning and management.

REGULATION IN THE EUROPEAN HEALTHCARE
SYSTEMS
E. Shipkovenska, Tz. Vodenicharov, M. Dyakova THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Investing in health – an ethical necessity or economic demand
Health is already widely accepted as a basic human necessity and right. The aspiration
for good health is natural and leading in almost every human being. At the beginning
of the 21st century the World Health Report 2000 was issued “Health systems:
improving performance”. Despite the controversial and much discussed analyses and
comparisons of different countries’ healthcare systems, it draws the attention to the
cost of ill health or illness – not only physical and psychological, but also social and
economic (1): “… illness itself… can threaten people’s dignity and their ability to
control what happens to them… Health systems have a responsibility not just to
improve people’s health, but to protect them against the financial cost of illness…” It
stresses on the state’s responsibility for investing in health and preventing economic
losses due to unexpected disease.
The role of health as a driver of economic growth has been recently
acknowledged in Europe. It’s already considered to be of great importance for the
commitment of Europe's governments to make Europe the most competitive and
dynamic knowledge driven economy by 2010 (2). Several years ago, the Commission
on Macroeconomics and Health concluded that ill health was contributing to the low
level of economic growth in poor countries. The report showed that investment in
health interventions would lead to substantial economic growth (3). Despite
increasing recognition of the link between health and economic development in lowincome countries, the relationship has received attention in rich countries as well (4).
Nevertheless reasons for investing in health in rich countries may differ in detail from
that in low-income countries, there is considerable and convincing evidence that
significant economic benefits can be achieved by improving health not only in
developing, but also in well-developed economies. In spite of the remaining evidence
gaps policy-makers in developed countries should consider investing in health as one
(of few) ways by which to achieve their economic objectives (4).
Several mechanisms, falling into four main categories, could account for the
relation between the population health status and national economic growth (5):
− Productivity. Healthier populations tend to have higher labour productivity,
because their workers are in good physical and mental condition. They also
suffer fewer lost workdays.
− Education. Healthier people who live longer have stronger incentives to invest
in developing their skills, which promotes greater productivity and, in turn,
higher income. Good health also promotes school attendance and enhances
cognitive function.
− Investment in physical capital. Longer life-expectancy creates a need for
savings for retirement. Increased savings lead to increased investment. 86 − “Demographic dividend." Transition from high to low rates of mortality and
fertility in many developing countries in recent decades. This gradually gives
way to an increase in the proportion of the population that is of working age.
Income per capita can rise dramatically, if people are engaged into productive
employment.
Thus the design of the national healthcare system and the financial resources
allocated to its development and improvement appears to be crucial for population
health, which on its side has a major influence on the economic growth of certain
country. Every health system has developed on its own way, influenced by cultural,
historical, social, economic and technical factors. Grounded on this, the healthcare in
the European countries differs mainly in two aspects:
1. The financing mechanisms: types of health provision (insurance) models,
payment mechanisms, revenue distribution etc;
2. The regulation of the healthcare services and market development: public –
private balance and level of entrepreneurship regulation. Basic financial principles and challenges in the European
health systems
A health system is complex structure, consisting of people, institutions, and
organizations, which interact to mobilize and allocate resources for prevention and
treatment of diseases and injuries. This structure is based on certain fundamental
pillars - essential elements that enable the healthcare system to function: information,
management, human resources, and financing (6). In the present paper we shall
discuss only aspects of the forth pillar – healthcare financing.
The European countries organize, govern, manage and finance their healthcare
systems in different ways, but all of them are based on few common principles:
1. Universal access to medical care;
2. Solidarity in the distribution of resources and expenditures;
3. High standard (quality and safety) of healthcare services.
The challenge of healthcare financing is twofold: to mobilize sufficient
funds for the health system and to apply (manage) those funds well (6). Mobilizing
funds to finance public health interventions is difficult both because health services
are becoming more and more costly and because raising revenues in low- and middleincome countries is not easy. Choices of different financing mechanisms also have
important implications for that who will bear the costs of health care: the population
at large may share spending; thereby providing effective insurance to those who
become ill, or it may fall most heavily on the sick ones. There are also a number of
initiatives to promote health insurance coverage through voluntary schemes. Strong
arguments can be made in favour of pooling the financial risk associated with paying
for health care among the widest population possible, effectively paying for the health
care of the poor and the sick with taxes and premiums paid by those who are healthier
and wealthier. 87 There are two main financial sources in healthcare:
− Public: state (governmental, semi-state) / insurance / mixed;
− Private: out-of-pocket (official and unofficial) / private insurance / mixed.
Private health insurance exists in a number of countries and is most often used
as supplemental or complementary. In Denmark, Germany, Greece and the United
Kingdom, many patients use private health insurance so they can be treated by the
physician of their choice or escape waiting in patients’ lists in the public sector. The
available empirical evidence shows that income is the key parameter in the decision to
buy additional health insurance and not health status or “need”. High premiums may
make it impossible for poor patients to buy private health insurance and this problem
is further exacerbated if premiums are risk-based where less healthy individuals, who
are disproportionately poorer, pay more. However, in most countries, due to the fact
that insurance is often bought in group settings, premiums remain more or less
independent of health status and may therefore remain affordable for large groups of
the population (6).
The process of financing and provision of health services can be simplified into
two inter-related and complementary processes – transfer and exchange:
− The providers transfer health resources (products) to the patients (customers);
− The patient’s transfer (exchange) financial resources towards the providers –
directly or through a third party (insurer).
The relation between the financing and the health results (outcome) can be
resumed in figure 1 (7). Figure 1. Influence of healthcare financing on the outcome (7) Demographic change in Europe presents further economic, budgetary and
social challenges in coming decades due to people living longer and a potential drop
in the workforce from the falling birth rate. While in many ways this can be seen as a
triumph for public health, it also poses a particular challenge for the health and social 88 sector. Predictions are that the ratio of elderly, economically inactive people (> 65
years) to people of working age could more than double between 2005 to 2050 in the
European Union. It is more important than ever that people remain healthy and
independent to as late in life as possible, so that premature deaths among the middleaged working population are avoided and morbidity is “compressed” towards the end
of life. As a result of these tendencies, in the last decade, most of the European health
systems, especially in well-developed market economies, are characterized by an
increasing financial deficit, despite the considerable amount of resources allocated for
healthcare. The gap between the health expenditure and health resources is increasing
due to mostly three main factors (7):
− Aging of the population and epidemiological transition to chronic, life-long
morbidity,
− Fast development of health science and technology and
− Incompetent health policy, governance and management.
Facing this constant increase in the financial deficit, governments worldwide
are facing the dilemma: increase in the resources (revenues) or restriction of the
expenditures. In general, there are two mechanisms possible (8):
First option: increase in the revenues – insurance contributions, co-payments,
fees, taxes etc. This can eventually lead to decrease in the number of insured people,
especially in systems with voluntary health insurance.
Second option: restrict the resources for medical care. This may eventually
cause decrease in the quality of health services and in the human capacity in health.
When taking decision on investing in healthcare and distribution and redistribution of resources and spending, we should not forget that the provider of
health services is mainly aiming at profit while the user (patient / customer) is
orientated towards higher utility (effective care) (8). The goal of all European
countries is achieving balance between profit and utility (fig. 2). Figure 2. Balance between profit and utility in the health sector (8) 89 In general, the challenges for the European health systems can be
summarized as follows:
1. The costs of medical care increasing more than costs in other social and
economic sectors - scientific innovations, information, communication,
diagnostic and treatment technologies etc;
2. Excessive demand of health services by the population:
− increased life expectancy and aging;
− increased awareness, education, expectations;
− increased income and financial stability of the population.
3. Free market and competition is not a reasonable option for a healthcare
system;
4. Difficulties in maintaining solidarity principle and universal access to
healthcare;
5. Difficulties in maintaining high quality and safety of health services;
6. Free movement of goods, services, people and capital in the EU. Regulation, entrepreneurship and market development in
healthcare
„If it moves, tax it.
If it still moves, regulate it.
If it stops moving, subsidize it“
Ronald Reagan
The 1990s witnessed a dramatic upsurge in the scale, character and calibre of
entrepreneurial initiatives within European health care systems (9). A wide variety of
market-inspired efforts to stimulate service innovation, including increased quality
and greater efficiency, have been launched in both public and not-for-profit private
sectors, and in core health service activities as well as in more peripheral supplies and
services. In practice, the last 10 years have been a period of substantial organizational
reconfiguration in the health sector, and increased entrepreneurial activity has been at
the core of that process of change (10,11).
Entrepreneurial behaviour is perceived to stimulate innovation and initiative.
The conceptual and practical emphasis on entrepreneurialism can have a positive
impact on health systems when the changes undertaken help strengthen the ability of
national policy-makers to achieve their stated policy objectives (12). At the
organizational level, entrepreneurialism seeks to modernize and rationalize
organizations to increase their operating efficiency. The powerful impetus to innovate
generated by entrepreneurialism can have decidedly less positive effects, however,
when it has not been adequately fenced in by effective state regulation. Entrepreneurs
inevitably seek to segment markets so as to exploit profitable niches, while publicly
accountable regulators try to ensure that the entire market is served efficiently and
affordably (12).
Health care has a unique character as a social as well as a private good, which
increases the importance of the regulatory role in the health sector. What is obvious
from the last decade developments in European health systems is that a substantial
volume of new regulation has been generated. Most European countries established 90 new types, as well as expanded the existing range, of what can be termed steer-andchannel regulation. Thus, as areas of entrepreneurial activity grew, they were
accompanied by a parallel growth in related state regulation. At present, the state is
expected to ‘row less but steer more’, its role in driving the health sector forward has
to increase in scale, scope and sophistication. The state’s supervisory responsibilities
have evolved to the point that the term ‘stewardship’ has now been applied to its
overall policy and management obligations in the health sector (13). The concept of
stewardship obliges the state to steer overall health system activity in an ethically
grounded as well as a financially efficient manner. Regulation, as a central instrument
of stewardship, must from this perspective similarly satisfy these two basic
requirements calling for ethical and efficient state behaviour. Failing to regulate
entrepreneurialism adequately in the health sector would be a serious breech of the
state’s role as a responsible steward (9). The mechanisms of regulation
Despite wide-ranging definitions and contradictory rationales, there is broad
agreement about the source and general mechanisms of regulation. Regarding who
regulates, we can find national level as well as regional and local levels of
administration. With the emergence of new pan-European agencies, European Union
regulation can also be supranational. While most regulation in Europe is conducted by
some form of government department, it can be undertaken by independent regulatory
agencies or by self-regulatory bodies (9). Regulation to ensure health gain necessarily
addresses actors outside as well as inside health care and intersectoral collaboration is
a necessary tool for successful regulation. The mechanisms of regulation can be
grouped into three basic categories, tools and strategies, which can in turn be
combined in various mixes (9). The major categories are legislation, administrative
decree and judicial order, one for each of the three branches of government
(legislative, executive and judicial). Each of these three can be generated in many
different forms and formats, particularly administrative decrees (advisory regulations,
guidelines, etc). Two dimensions of health sector regulation (9):
1. Social and economic policy objectives. It is normative and value-driven in
nature, concerned with specific policy goals and with the broad public interest (which
may be different in different countries). These broad policies also need to influence
government decisions in other sectors such as education, transport, employment,
housing and agriculture (14). These objectives are:
−
Equity and justice: to provide equitable and needs-based access to health
care for the whole population, including poor, rural, elderly, disabled
and other vulnerable groups;
−
Social cohesion: to provide health care through a national health care
service or to install a social health insurance system;
−
Economic efficiency: to contain aggregate health expenditures within
financially sustainable boundaries;
−
Health and safety: to protect workers, to ensure water and food safety; 91 Informed and educated citizens: to educate citizens about clinical
services, pharmaceuticals and healthy behaviour;
−
Individual choice: to ensure choice of provider, and in some cases
insurer, as much as possible within the limits of the other objectives.
− 2. Health sector management mechanisms. This level is practical and
operational and is concerned with the specific regulatory mechanisms through which
decision-makers seek to attain the type of policy objectives set out (9). These means
are largely technical in nature, concerning efficient and effective management of both
human and material resources:
− Regulating quality and effectiveness: assessing cost-effectiveness of clinical
interventions; training health professionals; accrediting providers;
− Regulating patient access: gate-keeping; co-payments; general practitioner
lists; rules for subscriber choice among third-party payers; tax policy; tax
subsidies;
− Regulating provider behaviour: transforming hospitals into public firms;
regulating capital borrowing by hospitals; rationalizing hospital and primary
care/home care interactions;
− Regulating payers: setting rules for contracting; constructing planned markets
for hospital services; developing prices for public-sector health care services;
introducing case-based provider payment systems (e.g. diagnostic-related
groups); regulating reserve requirements and capital investment patterns of
private insurance companies etc;
− Regulating pharmaceuticals: generic substitution; reference prices; profit
controls; basket-based pricing; positive and negative lists;
− Regulating physicians: setting salary and reimbursement levels; licensing
requirements; setting malpractice insurance coverage. Rules of the regulatory road (9):
Regulate strategically
− Regulation is part of strategic planning;
− Regulation is a means rather than an end;
− Regulation should further core social and economic policy objectives;
− Regulation is long-term not short-term.
Regulate complexly
− Regulation involves multiple issues simultaneously,
− Regulation can combine mechanisms from competing disciplines,
− Regulation requires an integrated approach that coordinates multiple
mechanisms,
− Regulation should fit contingencies of each health system,
− Regulation requires flexible public management.
No deregulation without re-regulation
− Deregulation requires a new set of regulatory rules,
− Re-regulate before you deregulate. 92 Trust but verify
− Regulation requires systematic monitoring and enforcement,
− Self-regulation requires systematic external monitoring
enforcement. and Regulatory approaches in the health sector (9)
Regulating capacity
Many countries have adopted some form of regulation aimed at limiting the capacity
of the health system.
Regulating prices
Regulation can also be aimed at prices in the health system, for example by using
centrally determined fees or differential payments such as the diagnosis related group
(DRG) method. Government can also use ‘price’ regulation in the health insurance
sector by regulating contributions, premiums and risk-adjustment mechanisms as well
as the terms under which such insurance is provided.
Regulating quality
Government can also regulate the health sector through the collection and
dissemination of information on provider performance. A different aspect of quality
of care that can be regulated is implementation of patients’ rights.
Regulating market structure and levels of service
Regulation often takes the form of establishing the ‘rules of the game’ for the
participants in the health system. Most prominently, this involves establishing
conditions for entry into health markets and setting levels of service. One method of
regulating the incentive to ‘cream skim’ is to offer health insurers per capita payments
(e.g. capitation) adjusted for the risk of each enrolled citizen. The prevalence of such
practices depends on the incentive structure offered by government and, in particular,
on the level of actual risk-sharing. On the other hand, governments may have less
success monitoring so-called ‘quality skimping’, in which chronically ill and elderly
patients fail to receive adequate care (15).
Regulating entitlements
Once citizens are covered, the entitlements available to them may be subject to
government regulation. Many countries are struggling with the issue of determining a
package of health services that sick funds are obliged to provide. In addition, various
supplementary insurance policies may be available for services not covered under
national health insurance. This raises perplexing problems of differentiating between
what is provided and how it is provided under the different schemes. This is another
example of how difficult it can be to develop and apply regulations aimed at
supplementary insurance.
We can summarize five major forms of regulation, found in European
countries:
− Decentralization; 93 −
−
−
− Compulsory self-regulation;
Accreditation and licensing;
Independent regulatory institutions;
Regulation through inter-sect oral collaboration. Who is regulating? Regulatory organs:
− Parliament;
− Governmental institutions (Ministry of health, National Institutes);
− Independent regulatory bodies (Accreditation, audit agencies; professional
organizations etc);
− EU structures (European Commission);
− Courts;
− Self-regulation.
In terms of the conceptual framework outlined above, it could be said that
health systems have been moving from control by standardization of professional
norms, to various forms of command-and-control, and on to attempts to standardize
outputs and evaluate outcomes. Moving away from command-and-control, however,
did not necessarily mean less regulation. The evolution of regulation in the health
sector, therefore, is not a matter of a linear progression from one mechanism of
control to the next, but rather a constant mixing and remixing of regulatory tools that
have accumulated throughout the years of a health system’s development (9).
We can also suggest that most European healthcare systems will achieve a
slower but steady growth in the number of social entrepreneurs, working in the public
sector but importing a variety of private sector concepts and incentives. Policymakers would become more and more comfortable with this situation. There should
be a noticeable increase in what was termed ‘social entrepreneurialism’ (16). This
middle territory between purely bureaucratic public and purely for-profit private may
itself blur the public-private boundaries by incorporating, elements of not-for-profit
private in partnership with independently managed public-sector organizations. In
such system the regulatory challenges will be considerable, and successful outcomes
will depend on the evolution of strict regulatory arrangements. One potential
regulatory framework that has yet to be adequately explored in the health sector is the
application of the notion of independent regulatory agencies (9). As the overall
entrepreneurial level increases within health systems, the range, scope and capacity of
state regulation will have to increase with it. The challenge to policy-makers will be
to concentrate on designing a better framework with which to conduct that
supervision.
The state and the market in European healthcare:
1. The European Union analyses regarding the benefit and damage from the free
market competition in health care are contradictory.
2. The market competition in health care requires strict regulation through
specific legislation.
3. The final goal of the market regulation in healthcare is to assure that every
decision and initiative taken is in the public (social) interest.
4. The mixed public-private model of healthcare is evaluated as the most efficient
way for reorganization of the European health systems. 94 5. The future belongs to a market-orientated, patient-centred healthcare system.
6. One of the most effective ways to achieve better health for the whole
population, in conditions of restricted resource, is through health promotion
and preventive medicine.
7. The long-term experiences of certain countries as well as international
analyses suggest that the choice for a health insurance model should be made
on:
− The level of economic development of the country;
− The level of the social moral values and ethics;
− The level of political responsibility to health issues;
− The tested models in international experiences. CASE STUDY
Healthcare financing and reforms in Bulgaria on the way to a
modern market-orientated health system
General introduction and context
In the period since 1989, the countries of south-eastern Europe have invested
significant efforts in the pursuit of wide-ranging reform of their health sectors,
addressing issues of financing, organization and management of health care services.
These efforts were a reaction to the inadequacies of the health systems inherited from
the communist era, the pressures arising from political and economic transition, a
collapse in the funding available for health care and, to differing degrees, the effects
of wars, conflicts and economic sanctions. While the countries have followed
different trajectories, their overall aims in the health sector have often been similar in
the process of reform. With the exception of the former Yugoslavia, all the SEE
countries followed the Semashko model of health care provision developed in the
USSR in the 1920s, till the 1990s. In the 1990s, health funding collapsed in all
countries of the region (17). Transition in health financing and system in Bulgaria during the
process of reform (18)
In general, the health care reforms in Bulgaria were aimed at changing the health
system financing methods in order to: ensure sufficient and sustainable health care
budget; guarantee equity in the public health sector; enhance efficiency and quality of
services; reorganize primary health care and rationalize outpatient and inpatient
facilities. The health reform remained on the periphery of public sector reform until
the late 1990s and little changed until 1997. The health insurance system was
introduced in 1998 when the Health Insurance Act was adopted, introducing
compulsory and voluntary health insurance. The contributions were set at 6% of an
individual’s income, shared between the employer and employee at a ratio of 80:20.
The State and the municipalities cover the contributions of pensioners, children and
low-income groups. The Health Insurance Act defines direct patient co-payments for
using health care services covered by the basic benefits package. Since 2000, patients
pay 1% of the minimum monthly salary for each outpatient visit and 2% of the
minimum monthly salary per day of hospitalization, up to 10 bed-days per year. The 95 compulsory health insurance system guarantees a basic benefits package of health
care services to the insured population; however, this package is not clearly specified,
which creates financial burden for the population. Health care financing was
separated from health care provision, and contract-based relations were established.
Private practice was legalized in 1991, public and private health care facilities were
reorganized. Financial reforms were followed by change in the payments to hospital
sector providers and the introduction of a scheme based on performance and cases –
“clinical pathways” with a single flat rate per diagnosis. The change in hospital
financing was supposed to enhance the competition between the health care providers
and increase the quality of services. The primary care and GPs as gatekeepers to
specialized care were introduced, allowing cost-containment, but also opening a
discussion of whether such policies would hinder the free provision and access to
health care. Total health expenditure has been increasing since 1998. It accounted for
7.7% of GDP in 2004, i.e. it was higher than the 6.8% average of the EU10 countries
(19). However, there was a general decline in levels of public health expenditure,
accompanied by a relative increase in private sources from 34.6% in 1999 to 45.5% of
total health financing in 2003 (20).
Contribution-based financing of health care has not been able to provide
enough funding for the system. The fact that 1 million people do not pay their
contributions results less resources for the NHIF. In order to cope with these
difficulties the contribution rate is planned to be increased and the ratio of employer:
employee contributions is intended to reach 50:50 by 2009, in order to provide
disincentives for the employer to escape paying contributions, conceal the real income
of employees or not to hire new workers. However, at the same time, the planned
initiative led to a discussion of whether this might create additional financial burden
for the population and public dissatisfaction with the health system (18). The way forward – opportunities to improve the financing of
Bulgarian healthcare system and open a way to more efficient
public-private mix system
The analysis of the Bulgarian healthcare financial status reveals chronic lack of
resources for health and considerable number of cases of ineffective and inexpedient
management of the spent financial resources. Considering the restricted state budget
as well as the NHIF incapacity to provide enough finances for the routine activities of
the healthcare system, a multifaceted strategy has to be accepted in order to solve the
problems of the Bulgarian healthcare. It needs to find new sources and approaches for
collecting the necessary funds for healthcare. The specific circumstances in Bulgaria
require the introduction of an up-to-date and efficient healthcare financing, which
would be able to provide balance and stability in the system at the present situation.
Some of the most important prerequisites for this are (21):
1. Surrounded by a constantly changing social, political and economic
environment, the Bulgarian people are trying to protect themselves and their families,
considering health protection on first place.
2. In correspondence to the widely discussed and already implemented in many
European countries Theory of Human Capital, the working force with higher social
and health status has higher productivity.
3. Every company and organization would logically prefer to direct certain
amount of money for the health of its employees, instead of compulsory paying these 96 amounts as taxes to the state. This payment could be part of the collective labour
agreement, which requires respective changes in the taxation legislation system.
4. The policy of the Ministry of Health for savings at all costs in the medical
establishments is equalizing the economic effectiveness with the medical
effectiveness, which is unfavourable for the patient. In this case the patient should pay
the difference, which leads to decrease in the formal income of the medical staff. Basic principles of the suggested approach (21)
1.
2.
3.
4. Defining a basic package of health services, obligatory covered by the NHIF.
Free choice of health services and benefits for the population.
Free choice of health insurance fund for supplementary health insurance.
Financing of the primary health care, based on the number of actually
registered insured and for services done.
5. Free (liberal) hospital prices. The fees should be officially announced by the
hospital board. The part, covered by the NHIF basic package should be
indicated as well as the amount of the additional payment. The prices vary in
certain limits, set by the professional organizations and the state for every year.
6. Free choice of medical establishment by the patient on the basis of quality and
price.
7. Regulation of the hospital capacity in response to the health services
requirement.
8. Pluralism in the options for and ratio public/private mix, formulated in the
health strategy of the Ministry of health as well as by the market necessities.
9. Implementation of DRG financing system in the hospitals, aiming at provision
of real funds for real expenses.
10. Competition among the different medical establishments. Basic concept of the financial model (21)
The model foresees the increase of the health insurance contribution, through
implementation of an elaborated three-pillar model, as follows:
− Mandatory basic health insurance, provided by the NHIF as existing at present.
− Mandatory supplementary health insurance, covering the so-called “extended
package” of health services and benefits, provided by the NHIF or another
licensed HIF.
− Voluntary health insurance, covering the “VIP package” of health services and
benefits. Conclusion
The chance for Bulgaria is to implement a specific for the country health insurance
model, in which its own experience as well as that of other European countries has
been integrated. The further reforms in the health system should be taken with longterm responsibility by the decision-makers, based on clear evidence, multi-sectoral
and international consultations and wide public debate. 97 EXERCISES
Task 1
The students (divided in groups of 3 to 5) are asked to make comparison between the
healthcare systems and their financing between two different European countries. The
comparison is presented according to several indicators (criteria) in the form of power
point presentation. A discussion is opened afterwards. By doing so, it is possible to
distinguish common challenges for the future as well as areas where a greater effort
needs to be made in some countries of the region than in others. Task 2
The students should make a SWOT analysis of their own country’s healthcare system
and propose a possible Action plan for improvement, especially in economic terms. Task 3
The students are asked to search (through recommended readings and internet) for
different sustainable possibilities for private entrepreneurship in their own healthcare
system. A brainstorming is made to point out the strengths and weaknesses of any of
them. REFERENCES

Public Health Glossary, Health Care, Education
After completing this module students and public health
professionals should:
• help to escape in misunderstandings of meanings of
similar terms;
• recognize importance of group work and active
participation;
• increase knowledge of specific terms.
The field of public health has a distinctly uncoordinated
terminology. The reason for this is that terms are taken over
from different other scientific fields or are created according
to historical needs and circumstances in different countries.
A local jargon is frequently used.
The task of this module is to review a group of terms on the
enclosed list which will be often used during the public
health course.
It is expected from students to give short description of
definition of previously unknown terms and list of terms
which students find ambiguous.
Exercise: individual work, small group discussions.
It is recommended to use this module in the beginning of
the course in order to harmonize the students
understanding of the public health terminology and to
develop participation and cooperation within group. The
first part of the exercise could be individual work followed
by small group work and reports from the group in plenary
session. Each group can work on by the teacher selected
group of terms.
The glossary printed as attachment at the end of this
module could be distributed to students after exercises.
Assessment could be done through observation of
discussion and participation in the exercise. 101 TERMINOLOGY 1
Želimir Jakšić, Luka Kovačić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The field of public health has a distinctly uncoordinated terminology. The reason for
this is that terms are taken over from different other scientific fields or are created
according to historical needs and circumstances in different countries. A local jargon is
frequently used. That is why the understanding of meanings and coordination of
terminology is one of the first tasks in the public health course.
Understanding of terms will not come from learning by heart their definitions,
but from analysis of their meanings in meaningful messages and understanding of their
origin and destiny. Like other words, scientific and technical terms are living and
changing in spite of strict definitions. It is helpful to find a responding word in student
mother tongue, but do not be disappointed if that would be hard or impossible. During
the studies students will gradually discuss terms as they come, so that at the end the
course students should complete the vocabulary. EXERCISE
Task 1: Definition of terms
The task is to review a group of terms on the enclosed list which will be often used
during the course.
1. Choose the terms you do not understand, find their definition in a text-books or
internet and write it down.
2. Mark the terms which you feel ambiguous and discuss them with your
colleagues and teachers in small group.
3. Elect the group representative to report the main conclusions and the group
process. Expected outcome
1. Short descriptive definition of previously unknown terms.
2. List of terms which students find ambiguous. List of terms

_____________________________________ Task 2: Difference in meanings of “management” and
“administration”
Point of consideration
The terms “management” and “administration” are often used with the same meaning.
They are indeed to a certain degree interchangeable. However, because of
different traditions in countries we might even not be aware of different connotations
they have for us. The word administration comes from the Latin word administrare
meaning to help. Management comes from the English word to manage.
For some people it would be very difficult even to imagine the differences
between two terms. In some countries two terms would be used in opposite direction. If
one reads some books and articles it could be found that in different historical periods
one or the other term was more fashionable. The same is true for different countries and
cultural settings. Task for students
Imagine that you are coming into an office building where you find two doors. One has
the label ADMINISTRATION and the other MANAGEMENT.
Answer the following questions:
• What do you expect behind each of these doors? 104 • Behind which door do you expect to find people working on a higher
hierarchical level?
1. Each member of the group answers the given questions separately;
2. Discuss your answers in small group explaining similarities and differences;
3. Compare your findings with descriptive definitions printed in Annex;
4. Report shortly in plenary on findings and proposals for utilization of terms
during the course. REFERENCES

4. Glossary of Health Care and Health Care Management Terms compiled by Laura
Larsson. ANNEX
This glossary should be distributed to students at the last part of the second task. It
includes some of terms often used in the public health courses. The other terms
could be finding throughout of this book, and in other publications.
ADMINISTRATION means control or direction of affairs, especially putting
something into operation by someone with official power to do so. It implies the use of
formal and hierarchical lines and procedures. It tends to follow inflexible rules and
regulations. Traditionally it reflects functioning of the public sector institutions.
Sometimes it is used for government services and government itself.
MANAGEMENT means using resources of all kinds (3 M = Men + Money +
Materials) so that they jointly as a system reach given objectives and produce attainable
results. Management is following flexible and dynamic procedures. Management is
specially used for work in business and with money, but it means also skilful dealing
with other persons. It has a positive connotation so that managing problems or
difficulties means their successful solution. Traditionally it is connected with business
and industrial enterprises. Sometimes it is used to describe the people who are in charge
or a governing body of a firm. 105 ORGANIZATION (or organization) is a social arrangement which pursues
collective goals, which controls its own performance, and which has a boundary
separating it from its environment. The word itself is derived from the Greek word
ὄργανον (organon) meaning tool. The term is used in both daily and scientific English
in multiple ways.
In the social sciences, organizations are studied by researchers from several
disciplines, the most common of which are sociology, economics, political science,
psychology, management, and organizational communication. The broad area is
commonly referred to as organizational studies, organizational behaviour or
organization analysis. Therefore, a number of different theories and perspectives
exist, some of which are compatible, and others that are competing.
− Organization – process-related: an entity is being (re-)organized
(organization as task or action).
− Organization – functional: organization as a function of how entities like
businesses or state authorities are used (organization as a permanent
structure).
− Organization – institutional: an entity is an organization (organization as an
actual purposeful structure within a social context)
PLANNING in organizations and public policy is both the organizational
process of creating and maintaining a plan; and the psychological process of thinking
about the activities required to create a desired future on some scale. As such, it is a
fundamental property of intelligent behaviour. This thought process is essential to the
creation and refinement of a plan, or integration of it with other plans, that is, it
combines forecasting of developments with the preparation of scenarios of how to
react to them.
The term is also used to describe the formal procedures used in such an
endeavour, such as the creation of documents, diagrams, or meetings to discuss the
important issues to be addressed, the objectives to be met, and the strategy to be
followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the political or
economic context in which it is used.
The circumstances in which we assume that future activities will be performed
are determining feasibility of our plans. Feasibility has the same meaning as
possibility. A plan is feasible when we have the power and resources to implement it, to
make it possible. The examination of feasibility is done in a systematic way,
scrutinizing all possible obstacles and constraints.
In the described interplay the planner has an opportunity to design many
optional solutions (strategies), what gives him a chance to choose the best of them or
combine them in an acceptable way.
Designing of optimal (alternative) strategies is the challenging part of planning.
In stimulating that process different techniques have been recommended.
Plan of action is formulation of action to be taken by different subjects. Master
plan of action is formulation of actions needed to fulfil results of broad programming
and the operative plan of action is the same for detailed programming. 106 GOAL is the most general, not constrained by time and existing resources,
rather descriptive than quantified, not necessarily attainable, but an ultimate, desired
state expected as a result of a policy or broad programming.
Examples: Increase regular exercise among older adults; Ensure all children
have access to health care; Eliminate second-hand smoke in public places.
OBJECTIVE is the intermediate, specified in time, usually measurable and
attainable end-result expected of broad or detailed programming. Examples: by 2010,
increase the use of safety belts and child restraints to at least 90% of motor vehicle
occupants (Baseline: 70% in 1997); to reduce breast cancer mortality by 25% 5 years
after start of the screening program.
TARGET (the desired end point amount of change, reflected by a number or
percentage) is the most specific, measurable with precision in short- term periods,
useful as an indicator for monitoring the detailed program achievements. They may be
used in different horizons of time as milestones along the way toward an objective.
OBSTACLE is a created difficulty preventing the planned activity. It is mostly
created by an opposing interest group and often is an expression of political conflicts or
tensions.
CONSTRAIN is a set of limits due to economic, social, administrative,
professional and cultural conditions.
PROGRAMMING is translation of health policy goals and objectives into
strategies and targets to be implemented in practice. It could be divided into broad and
detailed programming.
− Broad programming can be described as translation of health policies into
strategies for achieving clearly stated objectives.
− Detailed programming is conversion of strategies into technology,
manpower, infrastructure, financial resources and time required to implement
program.
SYSTEM ANALISYS is a systematic examination of a system (situation,
problem) in which each step is made as explicit as possible. The steps are:
− Listing all elements which can be related to the system or its environment;
− Defining goals and objectives of the system, identifying also their hierarchy
and the most important objective in an observed situation according to the
purpose of the analysis;
− Choosing elements which will be considered as the proper system (bounding
or bordering the system)and others which will be regarded as environment
according to defined goals and objectives;
− Describing and examining elements and their relations:
− Generating optional solutions, alternatives by manipulating elements and
relations to fit better the objectives of the system or to find solutions for
identified problems;
− Comparing and evaluating different alternatives and modelling a complex new
system. 107 HEALTH POLICY has different meanings:
A statement of a decision regarding a goal in health care and a plan for
achieving that goal; e.g., to prevent an epidemic, a program for inoculating a
population is developed and implemented.
2. A field of study and practice in which the priorities and values underlying
health resource allocation are determined.
A policy is a deliberate plan of action to guide decisions and achieve rational
outcome(s). The term may apply to government, private sector organizations and
groups, and individuals. Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and
parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy. Policy differs from rules or
law. While law can compel or prohibit behaviours (e.g. a law requiring the payment
of taxes on income) policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to
achieve a desired outcome.
Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important
organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as
programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact
they will have. Policies can be understood as political, management, financial, and
administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals.

EVALUATION
Luka Kovačić, Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Health care is a set of measures, goods and services designed to promote health,
including “preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to
individuals or to populations” (1). In order to maximize effects and minimize cost of
applied measures health care should be planned. The planning process includes
several steps making a cycle. The cycle is known as management cycle or cycle of
organization and management. The health care planning cycle could be divided into
different number of steps or elements, depending on the level on which the health care
is organized. Here are presented four main steps for the illustration of the
management cycle (Fig 1). Planning Evaluation Organization Implementation Fig 1. Four main elements of the management cycle
In each step there are several functions, and the cycle can be divided into more
elements.
Each step has specific characteristic and tasks of those involved in the step of
the cycle. In different parts of the cycle different actors are involved. Elements of the
cycle followed each other, some tasks are common for two or more cycles and some
are overlapping, what makes the health care system very complex. Planning
Although in the reality at one moment the planning cycle could be in the different
steps, for the purpose of the training we will start with planning step. 111 In this first steps the main task is setting aims, defining the goals, identification
of health problems, select priorities among them and choose the strategic course of
interventions. This is the task of health policy and the process is usually done on
country or province level.
This step of the cycle is based on the careful analysis of present health
situation, on health situation assessment, which could be also a separate step in the
cycle. Good and comprehensive diagnosis will lead to effective and efficient
intervention.
In this part of the political process the economic possibilities and constrains
should be analyzed, political interest of different social and professional groups taken
into account, feasibility of health care services calculated, and other elements must be
analyzed and taken into consideration. This political process is responsibility of
representative and/or political bodies (parliament, government, political parties).
Health professional organizations (or their representatives) are usually
involved (chambers, association of health workers, etc). From technical point of view
the outcome of this part of the cycle should be a set of indicators and milestones to be
reached in certain period of time (short-term, middle-term or long-term period). The
indicators are set up mostly as aims and goals for the region, state or larger region for
longer period of time, while objectives and targets are set up for smaller areas and
shorter period of time. It is important to set up the level of indicators which are
realistic and reachable in defined period of time to prevent social disappointment in
the future when planning time will pass.
To come to the reachable and realistic level of health indicators it is
recommended to analyze the situation in neighbouring countries and countries with
similar economic and social situation. Besides the set of health indicators in this part
of the cycle it should be also defined the main strategy (e.g. support the primary
health care, introduction of DRG system, implementation of screening programs for
certain diseases, share of GDP for health, etc.), involvement of citizens in decision
making process, and other important issues.
In this step of the cycle all actors should understand their role and
responsibility, should be familiar with the planning process and work together with all
political actors. Public health professionals should explain and inform them, and not
take their role in defining aims and goals instead of them.
Ones health policy is defined, the health managers are responsible for reaching
them through the next steps, organization, implementation and evaluation, usually
on a lower level of the country organizational structure, district, county or
municipality.
Any health planner faced with the task of formulating long term goals, objectives
and setting targets needs some assessment of the present situation, some description of
the point he is to regard as starting point, and some knowledge of the processes which
have led to the present situation.
The planning and programming is a part of the management circle dealing
with arrangement for carrying out some future activity. From the point of management
it is an unavoidable and everywhere existing part of the managerial process. Often we
are not conscious of it, as in planning some routine everyday activities. On the other
side it is a major formal procedure involving many people to work together and even
prescribed by laws and regulations. 112 The meaning of words planning and programming is practically the same and
used interchangeably, however, to a certain extent there is a different connotation. The
word programming is coming to us from a Greek word and is more underlining contents
and goals of future activities. The word planning is originally a French word and is
underlining different arrangements of resources, time, etc., necessary for
implementation of future activities. Considering hierarchy of these terms in technical
jargons one will find that the word program is used to define the goals and orientation
defined at the highest level, based on what plans are designed. There is for instance
program of a political party, of a president or prime minister. That program will be later
elaborated into plans. Some groups of experts might feel that planning is indicating a
higher level than programming, because usually the state plans are further elaborated
into programs of different organizations and institutions. Actually both groups are right.
To avoid misunderstandings in the national managerial process the WHO escaped to use
both terms and preference was given to programming. The programming could be split
in the three sub-processes: the broad programming, detailed programming, and
plan of action. These words distinguish also three phases in the process of planning.
One has to differentiate:
1. Choosing and defining objectives along with the given policies and strategies
(the closest is the word programming or broad programming);
2. Arranging ways and means of activities to reach objectives and targets under
given conditions (the closest are the words planning or detailed programming);
3. Detailing and scheduling of activities (plan of action).
Broad programming can be described as translation of health policies into
strategies for achieving clearly stated objectives.
Detailed programming is conversion of strategies into technology, manpower,
infrastructure, financial resources and time required to implement programs.
Plan of action is formulation of lines of action to be taken by different subjects.
The desired end-states (outcomes) are defined as goals, objectives and targets.
Goal is the most general, not constrained by time and existing resources, rather
descriptive than quantified, not necessarily attainable, but an ultimate, desired state
expected as a result of a policy or broad programming.
Objective is the intermediate, specified in time, usually measurable and
attainable end-result expected of broad or detailed programming.
Target is the most specific, measurable with precision in short- term periods,
useful as an indicator for monitoring the detailed program achievements. They may be
used in different horizons of time as milestones along the way toward an objective.
The planning/programming process varies according to circumstances in which
it is carried out so that several classifications are possible. Among the most important
are classifications by:
Subjects who perform planning:
− central planning/programming;
− decentralized planning/programming;
− participatory planning/programming;
− convergent planning/programming. 113 Period for which it is envisaged (horizon):
− long-term or perspective (10-20 years);
− medium-term or strategic (5-/10/ years);
− short-term or tactic or operative (1-3 years).
Basic orientation in resource allocation:
− input planning (oriented towards existing resources);
− impact planning (oriented toward end-results);
− output planning (oriented toward processes, e.g. work of health services);
There are numerous inter-relations and combinations of different types of
planning/programming. For instance, the central national plans tend to be long-term or
at least strategic. They are also more oriented to impact and development of inputs, than
to outputs.
According to circumstances the middle-level managers perform planning
(programming) in a special way, differently from national as well as grass-root
managers.
Specific characteristics of middle-level (regional, district) planning/programming
Specific characteristics of planning the middle level are:
− short-term horizon;
− input (resource) orientation;
− intuitive solutions of complex problems;
− flexibility;
− detailed planning;
− stress on implementation;
− community participation;
− reserve for interventions in unpredictable crises.
It depends on the socio-political situation and administrative arrangements in
each particular place how many decisions and in which areas are given to the
middle-level management. In a decentralized system there will be more freedom and
that will be reflected in deciding on targets and allocation of resources. In a centralized
system the planning would cover mostly detail scheduling of activities and distribution
of tasks and duties. However, in both situations the result of planning is formulated as
plan of action and has the same elements.
The format of the plan of action has 10 elements. The format is usually
prescribed by rules and regulations, but essentially they include always the same
elements:
1. objectives and targets;
2. covered population;
3. legal and administrative requirements;
4. specification of activities to be performed;
5. time-table for their implementation;
6. budget;
7. manpower (incl. recruitment, training, management);
8. constructions, transport, equipment, supplies, logistics;
9. evaluation and monitoring; 114 10. information support.
The effective planning is negatively influenced by obstacles and constraints.
Obstacle is a created difficulty preventing the planned activity. It is mostly created by
an opposing interest group and often is an expression of political conflicts or tensions.
Constraint is a set of limits due to economic, social, administrative, professional and
cultural conditions. They are common in all levels of management, but the following are
quite typical for middle-level planning either because of imposed limitations or poor
knowledge and motivation of local planners:
− poor data analysis;
− priority given to centrally planned (vertical) services;
− orientation to services and not to communities;
− limited powers in allocation of resources;
− competition or poor cooperation with other sectors;
− strong influence of “local authorities”;
− limited influence on infrastructure (training, logistics etc.).
The circumstances in which we assume that future activities will be performed
are determining feasibility of our plans. Feasibility has the same meaning as
possibility. A plan is feasible when we have the power and resources to implement it, to
make it possible. The examination of feasibility is done in a systematic way,
scrutinizing all possible obstacles and constraints. Priority setting
Priority setting means the different problems are listed according to priority. It is an
important task as not all problems can be attacked simultaneously. The setting of
priorities requires the planner to formulate the criteria own wishes to use when choosing
priorities. Very elaborate lists of criteria do exist, but each planner does well to establish
his own criteria. However some criteria often used are:
− the size of the problem (in terms of people affected by the problem);
− the severity of the problem (how serious is the problem affecting people);
− the inter-linkage of the problem with other problems (what are the chances that
attacking that problem will also influence and diminish other problems);
− the cost-effectiveness of the measures likely to attack the problem;
− the technical feasibility of attacking the problem;
− the trend in the size of the problem (is it an increasing problem or a problem
which is already on its way to diminish by itself).
When all criteria have been chosen, the planner has to decide for himself
whether he considers all his criteria equally important or not. In other words, he has to
give relative weight to his criteria. Only after this weighing has been done (e.g. with the
aid of a simple numerical scale ranging from one to three, or by expressing it in %), the
rating of the problems (again by putting them in a scale, according to the different
criteria can be undertaken. The process of rating the problems in order of overall
priority finally gives the planner the final picture, the comprehensive diagnosis. 115 Although this numerical rating is a helpful tool for the planner, he is advised to
check with his own feelings whether, after the whole process the outcome is consistent
with his intuition.
Just as in clinical medicine, the more comprehensive the diagnosis can be
established the more it will be possible to realize an effective and causal therapy.
Treating hypertension with drugs lowering the blood pressure is not as effective and
causal as combining this with reducing the patient's overweight, changing his diet and
trying to diminish the stress in his life. In health planning this is even more so. The
processes and factors linked to health are complex, the time spans during which
decisions have their consequences are long and usually a considerable number of people
are affected by the decisions and significant amounts of resources are involved. A
wrong or superficial “symptom diagnosis” like “a shortage of hospital beds” can divert
and mislead the planner from the real underlying causes and withdraw valuable
resources from essential causal measures attacking the roots of the problem like
preventing diseases or treating these at earlier stages.
Yet unfortunately, often health planners, even when they know the
comprehensive diagnosis, must content themselves with symptomatic measures because
the measures necessary to eliminate the underlying causes are beyond their direct
control. Even in these cases, however, knowledge of the comprehensive diagnosis is
essential for the health planner. It enables him to proportionate his symptomatic
measures and to enter the dialogue with those whose influence is closer to the roots of
the problem.
Diagnosis without consequences is useless and costly, consuming time and
resources. However, both in clinical and in administrative health work, an unproportionally big effort is often spent in diagnostic procedures, without adequate
influence in practice. Either the diagnosis is “overdone” (more examinations, data, etc.
than necessary for decision), or the proposed solutions are not relevant (because
available resources and other general conditions do not permit their application).
Because of that, during the diagnostic procedure the probable outcomes and
consecutive interventions have to be envisaged (tentative diagnosis, alternative solution,
hypotheses). In real life an inseparable part of diagnostic thinking is what one has to do
later: how to help a patient, or, which strategy to choose in controlling an epidemic.
Contemporary research has shown that a manager, similarly to a doctor or other health
worker, will come to better diagnosis if:
− he/she during examination keeps in mind the wider range of possible measures
to be taken after diagnosis;
− he/she is critically analyzing existing opportunities and constraints
(feasibility);
− he/she is flexible to play with concepts, relations and combinations of facts
even if it appears strange, unusual and “lateral”.
A good manager needs an openness, “brain-storming” initiative, and creativeness
together with a strict, critical and logical internal evaluation of facts: a combination of
imagination and realistic experiences, initiative and hierarchical discipline, together
with a clear vision of goals. 116 Intervention
Intervention means interfering with the usual, “natural” course of events. Often the
diagnostic process by itself makes the first part of intervention. For instance an
epidemiological survey is at the same time a health education activity. Intervention
means a change. How intensive and deep that change will be, is determined by the
intervention model we have to use.
Listing of all possible interventions or actions which can help in counteracting
each of the problems listed in earlier step. It is useful to indicate also at which level each
action should be undertaken (national, provincial or local level).
Selection of those interventions which are likely to have influence on as many
problems as possible and which can be considered as technically feasible. These can be
regarded as the “building blocs” for the strategy.
All selected interventions are now grouped in a logical time-scale in which levels
and “critical pathways” are indicated.
Critical pathways indicate the sequence of different interventions which can only
be realized in one given order. For this purpose it can be used scheduling and network
planning techniques such as Gantt chart, PERT, CPM and others. Organization
In this part of management cycle the manager has to deals with an organization as a
process, and an organization as a structure. The organization as a process is the
arrangement of parts which form an effective whole. The organization as a structure is a
group of people with a special purpose, e.g. a unit of health services, an institution.
The organization may be regarded as an open dynamic socio-technical system.
It is a dialectical relation of a given technology and social aspects of its application, i.e.
work connected with that technology (division of labour, relations toward means of
production, inter-personal and group relations). Because of that, the organizations of the
health units with different types of technology have different work relations and
different organizational problems. For instance, a big hospital in comparison with a
health centre.
The organization may also be regarded as having different characteristics as the
consequence of size, level of complexity and phase of development. Macro-organization
will deals with big overall systems, and micro-organization with small units (e.g. a rural
hospital or a district health centre). In every-day life expressions such as “young
organization”, “traditional organization”, “handicapped organization”, etc. are used and
they indicate the lively social dynamics of organizations.
Organizing implies the ability to coordinate activities necessary for
implementation in such a way that:
− the right things are done;
− in the right place;
− at the right time;
− in the right way and
− by the right people.
To reach that, a manager has to observe: 117 1. Objectives - each group of tasks in an organization must have an objective that
contributes to the main objective/s/ of the organization, the system or the
program;
2. Definition of tasks - each group and individual must have clearly defined tasks
so that everyone knows exactly his tasks and duties;
3. Command - each group must have one person in charge and all concerned must
know who this person is.
There are a several important rules related to command:
− Responsibility - the person in charge is responsible for the performance of the
people in his group;
− Authority - each person in charge of a group must have authority equal to his
responsibility;
− Span of control - no person in charge of a group should be expected to control
more people than his knowledge, time, energy and effectiveness permit (1:5 15);
4. Balance - the person in charge of several groups must see that the groups'
interests, opportunities and conditions of work are in balance. Evaluation
Evaluation could be simply defined as “finding out the value of something”. The same
meaning has the terms to assess or to appraise.
Evaluation is a systematic process of assessing the extent to which an action
achieved its objectives and/or to which extent it is regarded as beneficial. This broad
definition includes two possible types of evaluation: the one in which the objectives are
not well specified in advance (close to general goals or aims) and the second in which
objectives are predetermined explicitly (close to targets). In both situations the
information generated by evaluation is serving as a feedback to planners and concerned
about future activities.
The evaluation process consists of:
1. comparing the objectives and outcomes of activities; and
2. adding a value judgment to obtained results.
The value judgment is based on objective findings, but also takes into account
complex set of factors influencing results, consider marginal opportunities and benefits,
and apply the value system of those who perform evaluation. In this way evaluation is a
combination of objective finding and subjective (moral, political) interpretation.
Obviously it is most important who is doing evaluation and why. For instance, if
evaluation of health services is done only by health administration the result may differ
from those by users. The second important consequence is that the process is not
completely “objective” and “scientific” as it is usually suggested in managerial text
books.
The comparisons of predetermined objectives and obtained results may be
considered as objective but it cannot cover the whole range of evaluation in health care.
The question is who is predetermining the objectives, and how one is judging the 118 difference between findings and objectives. For instance, the budget for operation of
primary health care units in a district was not completely used and 10% of “savings” are
accounted. There are several possibilities in evaluation of that finding:
1. It may be regarded as very positive (e.g. by district health authorities), because
the savings are considered as results of better organization of work;
2. The results could be judged as negative (again by higher health authorities),
because “savings” are result of acceptable, but incomplete, fulfilment of
requirements;
3. The results may be regarded as negative (e.g. by users), because the work of
health units being poor quality and “cheap”, below of expectations;
4. It could be regarded as positive (e.g. by local health workers), because health
outcomes measured as change in infant mortality rates shows improvements. The
question is which position we will take in evaluation. All may be right to a
certain extent. In principle, the right decision should be based on understanding
the main purpose of evaluation, i.e. the future improvements of health care.
Evaluation should be a continuous process, but for practical reasons it has to be
summarized and reported at given times and specified intervals, coinciding with data
collection routine, preparation of new plans, new budgeting periods and similar. For
narrow operations and programs it will be more frequent (weekly or monthly), for
national policy formulation every 3-5 years.
In routine activities the evaluation has to be done in specified regular intervals,
as part of monitoring activities. Besides, it is recommendable from time to time to have
a review, a comprehensive (“in dept”) evaluation.
In special project and when new activities are introduced the evaluation should
be applied when plan is completed (preliminary evaluation), based on a theoretical
consideration of probable outcomes), during the implementation (process or formative
evaluation), and at the end (final or outcome evaluation).
The comparison of findings is most important part and basis for value
judgments. In most cases it will be the comparison with expected, planned and
predetermined targets. In some cases, and also as a useful addition, two further types of
comparisons are useful: the before/after comparison (comparison with findings obtained
last time, e.g. last year, or obtained before start of activities we would like to evaluate),
and the comparison with other areas, where similar activities have been undertaken.
The measures used in evaluation are based on relation between main elements of
the working process. The main elements are needs, input, process, output and outcome.
In process of health services it is particularly important not to mix output and outcome.
Output is product in terms of services, supplies etc., and outcome is effect or
result of these services.
The most frequently measures used in evaluation, specified as indicators, could
be grouped in the following groups, described the specific results of health services:
Relevance is assessed by relating needs and outcomes. It should answer the
question: Does the working process satisfy the needs? Relevance is one of the most
important indicators, the very basic one, because if health services not satisfying real
needs, all other measures are irrelevant, or change their meaning. For instance, if we
evaluate some laboratory procedures we may come to conclusion that they are effective 119 and cheap in identifying a disease (e.g. malaria), but this is worthless and even very
costly if applied in situation with no malaria. Relevance is most important in evaluation
the costly high-tech procedures, but it is rarely done. Effectiveness

Impact Objective Effectiveness Input Process Output Outcome Performance
Efficiency Figure 2. Relations between main elements of the health care process (adapted to Wollas) Adequacy relates output of services with needs. The relation can be observed in
terms of type (kind) and quality (appropriateness) and in terms of quality (sufficiency).
The indicator should answer z
The question if there are right and sufficient services provided to satisfy needs.
For instance, the adequate immunization would mean that sufficient number of children
(e.g. 85%) where immunized in an appropriate way with fully valid vaccines. In this
case even three factors are important: quality, quality of work, quality of vaccine.
Coverage is measuring population covered by services, and can be regarded as a
special case of adequacy. It is a complex measure close to sufficiency. Needs are
expressed as number of people who need and/or demand different services (formal
coverage), or who actually utilize services (actual coverage).
Coverage may be expressed in terms of total population, population having
particular risks, certain population groups (social, professional, etc.), or defined territory
(people who live in defined territory).
While coverage is a measure of formal nature, in real life situation, 3-A
indicators would demonstrate what extent to which coverage is transformed into
utilization is.
Accessibility is answering to the question to which extent and which services
can be physically reached by people. The reason why people do not use services might
be that services do not exist (availability). Among barriers of different kinds, one most
important is that people may not utilize available services because they are too costly
(affordability). 120 Effectiveness is measuring the desired effect of services, relating output and
outcome elements of the working process. It is answering the question: Providing these
services, how much will be reached of the desired health effects? For instance, by
finishing the program of health education on health diet, how much will be changed
regarding dieting and nutrition of the community. After screening a population for
cancer, how many new case will be discover in right time for treatment. The
effectiveness has usually a technical connotation. How effective are drugs or diagnostic
procedures and tools, but it can also be used in a managerial meaning when we speak
about organization. For instance, how effective is a hospital, or health centre, or
epidemiological services. HEALTH NEEDS EFFICIENCY PROCESS PRODUCTIVITY Money

Quality ACCESSABILITY Supply: OUTCOME Figure 3. Measures for evaluation in the health care process Special case of effectiveness is efficacy which is defined as effectiveness in real
life situation. For instance, if a drug is very effective under experimental conditions, it
does not mean that it will be as effective when applied in a rural hospital or at home. Or,
a screening procedure applied in different population groups will not give the same
effect. 121 Efficiency is related to use of resources, and the term has primarily a managerial
connotation. It has to answer the question: How much of resources have to be used to
reach the planned level of effectiveness? It relates input to output.
Efficiency is the major managerial tool. It includes all types of resources like
financial, human, technical, and also time. For instance, we will tell that a service is
more efficient either if less financial or other material resources are spent, or the work is
done in less time, or by less people. Efficiency is the starting point to be specified as
financial, organizational or other efficiency. However, often all different factors are
translated into financial terms and expressed as cost.
There are two additional indicators of general nature on relating the observed
activity (working process) as the whole in the relation to time and to the environment:
1. Impact is measuring the effect of evaluated activities on broader issues, the
environment, on the overall health development, health status of the whole
community and on related social and economic productivity, demographic
changes etc.;
2. Progress is an indicator used for assessing development of project or services in
relation to time. The question is: What are the changes occurring during the last
year in terms of meeting project deadlines, but also other improvements of
services, coverage, etc? It is an important measure of overall development in
time, and not only control of planned schedule.
The evaluation is part of the control and administrative procedures, but it has
to become also a contribution to technical improvements and social changes. This will
be achieved only when the comprehensive evaluation is done in a participatory way,
including into the process users, people and communities, and on the other side health
workers whose work is evaluated, technical experts and professionals.
The evaluation has an impact on those whose work is evaluated, which is not
always what was intended. Insisting on utilization of formal and objective data will
pretty soon produce expected type of report, regardless what is happening in real
practice. Data have to be used only after double checking and careful interpretation. EXERCISES
Task 1: Selection of goals, objectives and targets
From WHO or other Data base select several indicators which will respond to goal,
objective and target. Find their values as millennium goals, Europe, own country,

diseases (cancers) to start the screening program. To solve this task you should do
process of priority setting.
1. In a small group (3-4 participants) you decide by consensus after discussion:
− Select and list criteria for assessment;
− Give the relative weight to selected criteria (you can use a simple
numerical scale);
− List the diseases you think that screening is a relevant intervention.
2. Do ratings (give score for each disease and criteria).
3. In the same small group:
− Compare your scorings;
− After discussion construct the new scoring table (use consensus);
− Select two diseases for the screening program;
− Write comments (what additional criteria except “objective”
scorings you use for your decision);
− Present your decision in plenary. 123 Criteria

Health need, health care need, demand, health care demand, a population
perspective, a health-care provider perspective, economic perspective
After completing this module students should: be familiar with concept of
“health needs” from public health perspective.
The concept of “health needs” is one of key concepts in public health. From
the public health standpoint, the most important perspective on this concept
is the perspective of a population, or an individual respectively. But along
this perspective there exist several other perspectives, which can be to the
certain extent similar, but also could be also very different. All this enters an
enormous confusion in its understanding, and consecutively this concept
seems rather elusive. This confusion originates from the fact that the
concept of “health needs” is very difficult to define exactly, like it is also
very difficult to define exactly the concept of “health itself”, since both
concepts are extremely complex entities
The module is trying to enlighten some problems concerning the
“health needs” concept”.
An introductory lecture gives the students first insight in “health needs”
concept”. The theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study.
After introductory lectures students first carefully read the
recommended readings. Afterwards they discuss the characteristics of
“health needs” concept” with other students.
In continuation, they need to find the examples from their own
experience.

PERSPECTIVES AND DIMENSIONS FROM THE
PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
This module could be rather difficult to understand since it is dealing with
philosophical aspects of public health rather than with practical. Nevertheless for
public health students, it is extremely important to be familiar with the concept of
“health needs”, since it is one of key concepts in public health.
Here, at the very beginning of this module, we should emphasize, that there
exist several different perspectives on this concept. From the public health standpoint,
the most important perspective on this concept is that of a population, or an individual
respectively. This perspective will be the central under consideration. Different perspectives on “health needs” concept
In introduction, we have already emphasized that there exist several different
perspectives on the “health needs” concept, what enters an enormous confusion in
its understanding. Figure 1 presents majority of the most important perspectives
(Figure 1). population/individual
perspective health care providers

perspective Figure 1. Different perspectives on “health needs” concept As a consequence, this concept seems rather elusive. This confusion originates from
the fact that the concept of “health needs” is very difficult to define exactly, like it is 126 also very difficult to define exactly the concept of “health itself”, since both concepts
are extremely complex entities (1).
Trying to enlighten “health needs” concept from the public health point of
view, we meet several terms which are continuously used interchangeably. We will
try to define/explain those terms which are most frequently brought into use, and
place them in different perspectives on this concept, as well as their dimensions. Definitions and explanations of terms
Central terms
In explanation of “health needs” concept two central terms are “health need”, and
“health care need”, but we need to start just from the term “need”. Need
The simplest term, “need”, is used widely, but it can have a variety of meanings. In
Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English (2) we could find four
meanings of this term:
1. a situation when something is necessary or must be done,
2. a strong feeling that somebody want somebody/something or must have
something,
3. the things that somebody requires in order to live in a comfortable way or
achieve what he/she wants,
4. the state of not having enough food, money or support.
All these meanings share the same idea - a need refers to a lack of something. Health need and health care need
In public health, the term “need” is used in a context of “health needs” concept.
The problem is that under this term several meanings could be met. These
meanings are on one hand closely related, while on the other they must be clearly
distinguished.
1. “Health need” in its basic sense of “health need”.
The term could be explained in different ways. Since term “a need” refers to a
lack of something the most easily understood explanation in the context of
concept of “health needs” could be that “health need” refers to a lack of health.
Another simple explanation is that “health need” is a desire of people to
remain healthy.
2. “Health need” in a professional (medical) sense of “health need”.
Health need may be defined also as scientifically (biologically,
epidemiologically, etc.) determined deficiencies in health that call for
preventive, curative and eventually (where appropriate) control or eradication
measures (3).
3. “Health need” in a sense of “health care need”.
The “lack of health” (from the population or an individual perspective) could
be perceived as strong enough to be expressed in terms of “health care need”.
This means that “health care need” could be perceived as “health need” which
is strong enough for an individual to seek a help in a health care service.
4. “Health need” in an economical sense of “health care need”. 127 In health economics “health need” is defined as the minimum amount of
resources required to exhaust an individual’s or a specified population’s
capacity to benefit from an intervention (4, 5). Some other important considerations
Some other important considerations about “health needs” concept are:
• health need like health is not an absolute concept,
• there are gradations of health need, therefore health needs of a population or of
an individual have to be prioritised,
• health need is a subjective rather than an objective, scientific concept,
• perceptions of need vary depending on the observer,
• health need is not a scientific judgement and it is not the domain of the medical
profession only.
Frequently, the term “need” in the context of “health needs” concept is confronted
and/or interchanged by a term “demand”. Other important terms
Demand
In Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English (2) we could find three
meanings of the term »demand«:
1. A very firm request for something; something that somebody needs,
2. Things that somebody/something makes you do, especially things that are
difficult, make you tired, worried, etc.,
3. The desire or need of customers for goods or services which somebody wants
to buy, or use. Health demand and health care demand
We could notice that from a semantic point of view the last meaning of the term
“demand” is very close to the term “health care need” In fact, these two terms could
be understood from three perspectives at least.
1. “Health care demand” in the sense of “health care need”.
The term “health demand” is used as a synonym in this context as well.
In this sense the term “health care demand” or “health demand”
respectively, could be explained as an attempt by an individual in need to seek
health care services help.
2. “Health care demand” in the sense of “demand” in economic sense.
For economists the word “demand” is reserved for the desire for a good or
service (such as health care) in addition to the ability to pay for it.
According to Last (4), demand for health care services is willingness
and/or ability to seek, use, and, in some settings, pay for services. Sometimes
further subdivided into “expressed demand” (equated with “use of health care
service”) and “potential demand”, or “need”. This division was proposed by
WHO experts group in 1971. 128 3. “Health demand” in the sense of “demand” in population/individual sense.
“Health demands” are usually measured in terms of the actual utilisation of
health services. But, consideration must be given to the fact that all felt needs
by a population (most usually in curative medicine) cannot be translated into
expressed need or demand for various reasons (like absence of accessible
health services, lack of information, lack of confidence, low income, etc.). Other related terms
Health care
According to A Dictionary of Epidemiology (4), health care is defined as service
provided to individuals or communities by agents of the health services or professions
to promote, maintain, monitor, or restore health. Health care is not limited to medical
care, which implies therapeutic action by or under the supervision of a physician. The
term is sometimes extended to include self-care. Health care provider
According to a Glossary of Health Care and Health Care Management Terms (6, 7),
health care provider is an individual or institution that provides medical services (e.g.,
a physician, hospital, laboratory). This term should not be confused with an insurance
company which "provides" insurance (7). Health care supply
In this place also a term “health care supply” need to be mentioned. The three terms,
being “health care need”, “health care demand”, and “health care supply” should be
clearly distinguished. According to Stevens, health care need is what people might
benefit from a health care system, health care demand is what people wish to use in a
health care system, and health care supply is what is actually provided (8). Some expert’s/expert groups’ perceptions of health need
concept and classifications
In literature we can find perceptions of “health need” concept of different experts or
groups of experts, and their classifications, among them WHO Expert Committee on
Health Statistics’ perception, and Bradshaw’s, and Kalimo’s perception. Classification of WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics
A classification of “health need” was proposed by the WHO Expert Committee on
Health Statistics in 1971 (9):
• perceived need - perceived need is the need for health services experienced by
the individual and which he/she is prepared to acknowledge. Under certain
conditions it may exceed the professionally defined need;
• professionally defined need - professionally defined need is the need for health
services recognised by a health professional from the point of view of the
benefit obtainable from advice, preventive measures, management or specific
therapy. Under certain conditions it may exceed the perceived need;
• scientifically confirmed need - scientifically confirmed need is the need
confirmed by objective measures of biological, anthropometric or 129 psychological factors, expert opinion or the pas sage of time. It is generally
considered to correspond to those conditions that can be classified in
accordance with the International Classification of Diseases.
A classification of “health demand” was proposed by the WHO Expert Committee on
health statistics in 1971 as well:
• potential demand - potential demand is the demand for health services
corresponding to whichever is the greater of the perceived and professionally
defined needs for each particular conditions or for all the conditions affecting a
given population;
• expressed demand - expressed demand is the demand actually made on the
health services available to a population. It may be greater than the actual
utilisation because of the existence of waiting lists, limited resources or
differences between patient’s perception of their needs and professional’s
definition of those needs. Bradshaw’s classification
At about same time, Bradshaw in sociological sphere presented his classification of
needs (10). This classification could be often met in public health as well. He
distinguished among four types of needs, being normative, perceived, expressed and
comparative:
• normative need - normative needs are those that agree with norms, as defined
by health professionals;
• perceived need - perceived needs are those perceived by individuals,
depending on health services available;
• expressed need – perceived needs become expressed needs, once articulated;
• comparative need - generalization of evaluated needs in a population results in
comparative needs. Kalimo’s classification
In 1976 Kalimo, Finnish expert for health care systems, proposed his perspective
on “health needs” concept, in fact for health care service need. He operationally
defined health needs as the difference between observed and ideal levels of health
(11).
According to Kalimo, ill health in the individual can conceptually be
understood as a disturbance in one or more subsystems, being psychobiological,
perceptive, and social activity. As a consequence he distinguished among three types
of “health needs” (11):
• medically defined need - when a disturbance is present in the psychobiological
subsystem on the basis of clinical evidence;
• perceived need - when a disturbance is present in the perceptive subsystem on
the basis of perceived or subjective evidence;
• socially determined need - when a disturbance is present in social activity on
the basis of behavioural or social evidence. 130 “Health needs” concept and public health
Public health view on the “health needs” concept is (or should be) comprehensive.
Such a view originate from the fact that public health itself is a knowledge and
profession that encompasses knowledge of several other professions and sectors
(and it is as such multiprofessional and multisectoral), and integrate them to
credit of people that seek for health. Thus, a public health professional needs to
be familiar with different perspectives on this concept to be able one side to
confront, and on the other to integrate population/individual, health care
providers, health care payers, industry/economy, and politicians perspectives.
Two of the most important perspectives in a context of health are the
perspective of lay people/population, and the perspective of health care providers and
perspective of health care payers (Figure 2). The first are thinking about “health
needs”, and the others about “health care needs” (Figure 2). NEED
in a context of health HEALTH NEED HEALTH CARE NEED population/individual perspective health care provider/payer perspective Figure 2. The most important perspectives on “health needs” concept. Mostly, both groups are thinking that they are talking about the same issue, but
this is in fact far away from the truth. As it will be discussed later, the “health
need” is a multidimensional concept and “health care need” is only one way to be
expressed. That means that the health need could only partially be fulfilled
through health care systems, especially those typical for western countries. In
these countries health care is understood to be mostly provided by medical care.
The fact is that great deal of health is gained and lost outside of medical care, and
the underlying determinants of good health are to be found in the environments of
everyday life, people’s social, cultural, and economic circumstances and the
interaction of lifestyles and behaviour with those circumstances. A great deal of
“health need” thus cannot be fulfilled through a health care system.
Also inside the group of health care providers and payers there are differences
in understanding of the health needs concept. For example, medical need is mostly
defined as medically modifiable morbidity burden while demand for medical services
is defined as the request of the citizen, this time in the role of patient (a »consumer«)
for medical care services (12). This definition is primarily related to payer’s
perspective. In some cases, that what is “a need” for one, it is “a demand” for the
other. Detailed discussion on this issue is beyond the scope of this module, and should
be worked out in a separate one. 131 At this point we could simply stop this philosophical debate, but in fact, it
could be continued, and additionally made even more complex with including the
ethical perspective on the issue. This very important perspective is often neglected
from the pure industry/economy stand point where most frequently only the rules of
capitalism are those that count. But this issue is also beyond the scope of this module,
like beyond the scope are all more economical considerations of health needs,
including supply of health care.
From public health point of view the most important perspective is certainly
the perspective of population and the member of a population - the individual. Thus
this perspective will be discussed in more details. “Health needs” from the population/individual
perspective
There exist several dimensions of health need from perspective of
population/individual, at least being physical, mental, social, and environmental (in
the sense of natural, physical and biological, environment) (Figure 3). HEALTH NEED
of a population/an individual physical mental social environmental Figure 3. Some dimensions of health need of a population/an individual. The disruption can occur in one or more subsystems at the same time.
Whatever health need dimension is, it could be perceived or not (Figure 4).
When and how the need is perceived depends on different factors:
• mainly it depends on the amount and intensity of disruption. Every disease
has its natural course, and most of them have preclinical phase before it is
fully expressed with symptoms. If there are no symptoms, or symptoms are
of low intensity, or are not frequent, the disruption is not disturbing for an
individual. As a consequence it is not perceived as a health need;
• to the certain extent the perception of health need also depends on cultural
and normative environment of an individual;
• today, health need perception could be also driven by remedies industry
(e.g. pharmaceutical industry) using marketing methods to enhance
consumption of their products;
• contemporary information technology (e.g. internet), as well, could raise
the perception of health needs that otherwise would not be perceived. 132 HEALTH NEED
of a population/an individual physical mental social unperceived perceived unexpressed environmental expressed Figure 4. Perception and expression of health needs from the perspective of a population/an
individual. If health need is perceived, it could be expressed or not (Figure 4). If it is
expressed, this could be in different terms, among others in terms of need for
professional health care (medical care).
With expression of health needs in terms of health care need, it is similar
situation as in perception. Only in this case, the cultural and normative
environment has bigger influence. Also social, economic, and natural
environment influence expression of health needs. For example, if an individual
has only moderate perception of health need, expression in terms of health care
need will probably not occur, if the health care provider is far distant, or too
expensive.
Meeting “health needs” of a population/an individual through health
care system
If we consider only the physical and mental dimension of a health need which is
usually searched for, and also (at least partially) fulfilled in the frame of health care
system, we could confront the expressed perceived physical or mental health need to a
health care need, recognized by health care professionals (Figure 5).
In fact, mostly the physical dimension is considered inside health care systems,
while the mental dimension is mostly not in the first plan. 133 HEALTH NEED
of a population/an individual physical mental unperceived perceived unexpressed HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM expressed recognized not recognized HEALTH CARE NEED Figure 5. Expressed health needs confronted with recognized and not recognized health care
needs. When the health care needs meet the health need of a population/an individual
we are talking about met need, otherwise the needs are unmet (Figure 6).
The unmet health need is even greater if we consider that great deal of health
need is not generated physically or mentally, but also has other dimensions as well
(e.g. social and environmental).
In some problems, it also happens that the need is recognized by health
professionals, but it is not perceived by population/an individual (Figure 6). This is
the case for example in screenings for diseases with unfavourable outcomes like
cancer. Health needs assessment in public health practice
At this place we need to introduce also a concept of “health needs assessment”. This
is (or should be) an important task for public health. The detailed discussion is beyond
the scope of this module. An extra module is needed to deal with it, so at this place
we will consider only very basic views.
Assessment of health needs is not simply a process of listening to patients or
relying on personal experience. It is a systematic method of identifying unmet health
and healthcare needs of a population and making changes to meet these unmet needs.
It involves an epidemiological and qualitative approach to determining priorities
which incorporates clinical and cost effectiveness and patients' perspectives. This 134 approach must balance clinical, ethical, and economic considerations of need that is,
what should be done, what can be done, and what can be afforded (8, 13). HEALTH NEED
of a population/an individual physical mental unperceived perceived unexpressed expressed
met
needs HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM recognized unmet
needs not recognized HEALTH CARE NEED Figure 6. Met and unmet health needs of a population/an individual. Health needs assessment should not just be a method of measuring ill health,
as this assumes that something can be done to tackle it. Incorporating the concept of a
capacity to benefit introduces the importance of effectiveness of health interventions
and attempts to make explicit what benefits are being pursued. Economists argue that
the capacity to benefit is always going to be greater than available resources and that
health needs assessment should also incorporate questions of priority setting,
suggesting that many needs assessments are simply distractions from the difficult
decisions of rationing.
For individual practices and health professionals, health needs assessment
provides the opportunity for:
• describing the patterns of disease in the local population and the differences
from district, regional, or national disease patterns;
• learning more about the needs and priorities of their patients and the local
population;
• highlighting the areas of unmet need and providing a clear set of objectives to
work towards to meet these needs;
• deciding rationally how to use resources to improve their local population's
health in the most effective and efficient way;
• influencing policy, interagency collaboration, or research and development
priorities. 135 In Box 1, questions that should be answers in health needs assessment are presented.
Box 1. Questions to be asked when assessing health needs. Questions in health needs assessments:






 What is the problem?
What is the size and nature of the problem?
What are the current services?
What do patients want?
What are the most appropriate and effective (clinical and cost) solutions?
What are the resource implications?
What are the outcomes to evaluate change and the criteria to audit success? Importantly, health needs assessment also provides a method of monitoring
and promoting equity in the provision and use of health services and addressing
inequalities in health (8, 14, 15).
The importance of assessing health needs rather than reacting to health
demands is widely recognised, and there are many examples of needs assessment in
primary and secondary care.
There is no easy, quick-fix recipe for health needs assessment. Different topics
will require different approaches. These may involve a combination of qualitative and
quantitative research methods to collect original information, or adapting and
transferring what is already known or available.
The stimulus for these assessments is often the personal interest of an
individual or the availability of new funding for the development of health services.
However, assessments should also be prompted by the importance of the health
problem (in terms of frequency, impact, or cost), the occurrence of critical incidents
(the death of a patient turned away because the intensive care unit is full), evidence of
effectiveness of an intervention, or publication of new research findings about the
burden of a disease. Conclusion
From the public health perspective is very important to be aware of different
dimensions of health need of a population/an individual, and how they could be
fulfilled. Public health’s role is to be advocate in fulfilling population’s health needs
if they are legitimate and justified, and to prevent fulfilling unjustified health needs,
especially if their fulfilling would result in cutting down fulfilling other justified
health needs.
At the end we need to emphasize again that health needs are not only what
people can benefit from health care system (this is health care need), but also from
wider social and environmental changes. In meeting health needs in such a
comprehensive meaning, health needs assessment is extremely important public
health task to be done. It involves epidemiological, qualitative, and comparative
methods to describe health problems of a population; identify inequalities in health 136 and access to services; and determine priorities for the most effective use of
resources. CASE STUDIES
To illustrate the theory on health needs we prepared several case studies. All of them
are virtual, and could be only by chance similar to real situations. Case study 1
A twenty-two years old student of medicine has got very high temperature
accompanied by dry cough. He felt so badly that he decided to search for medical
care. He visited his personal medical doctor who prescribed him antibiotics after
pneumonia was diagnosed.
In this case, health need was perceived and expressed in medical terms. Since
student’s condition was evidently a clinically expressed disease, which could be
treated inside the health care system, there was no doubt that his need for medical
care was recognized by a medical professional. His health need was met. Case study 2
A group of people living in a small valley, in which different kind of industry is
located, expressed health need in terms of environmental health when they were told
that a waste incineration will take place in one of factories. After they tolerated for
decades the pollution and degradation of the environment they live in, they decided to
search for professional help to prevent additional pollution.
In this case the health need was perceived and expressed but not in terms of
medical care. It is expressed in terms of public health advocacy. Since environmental
pollution in this valley is evident, evidence based public health reaction is justified,
and steps to prevent further pollution needed. Case study 3
A fifty-year old university professor has strongly perceived physical health need,
expressed as a need for physical activity. He does not feel comfortable if he cannot be
physically active at least few times per week. He mostly uses spinning combined by
mountain climbing.
In this case the health need is perceived and expressed but not in terms of
medical care. It is expressed in terms of sports activity which could be fulfilled
through using recreational facilities provided by community or self-provided
recreational facilities. Case study 4
A new vaccine was launched to the market. The studies, mostly driven by the
producer of the vaccine, showed for the time being its probable effectiveness in
combating the disease that it is meant for. The biggest problem is that the price is
rather high. To systemize vaccination with this vaccine, providing of some other
health good would be necessary to cut down, since a huge population group needs
to be vaccinated by this vaccine. Additionally, the optimal target group is not 137 clear yet. The producers use economic marketing principles to advertise the
availability of their product, and a group of citizens with a political support
triggered a campaign in support of systematization of this vaccination.
In this case there are a lot of obstacles. First, the health need perception is
mainly artificially driven by producer of the vaccine before its definite effectiveness
is evident, and before optimal target group is clear. Second, the price of the vaccine is
rather high. Third, not advantage of all other available and cheaper measures was used
yet. EXERCISES
Task 1
Carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module and recommended
readings. Task 2
Critically discuss the differences between the terms:
• “need” and “demand”;
• “health need” and “health care need”;
• “health care need” and “health care demand”.
Use method of fishbowl. Task 3
If yes, then try to find out its characteristics. If not, try to find an example from other
countries (e.g. FINBALT Health Monitor Surveys). Task 4
In a group of three to four students prepare a virtual scenario describing a health need
of an individual or of a population group. Prepare a short presentation for other
students. The scenario will be a part of the assessment. REFERENCES

Planning, mission, vision, health organization
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should have:
• increased their awareness of strategic planning significance;
• identified drivers for strategic management of health organization;
• understood how strategic intentions vary by level of health care and
stakeholders; and,
• explored the similarities and differences between missions and
visions of existing organization.
Raised awareness of macro-environment change pointed out the
necessity for strategic planning and management of a modern health
organization. The apparent management concern is how to maintain a
pace with dynamic environment and innovations and to preserve
proactive position. Economic transition in health systems of south east
Europe countries acts as driver for strategic respond to imposed
changes. Health organizations do vary by their corporate values and
level of their autonomy. Like entities they have to define their purposes,
missions, visions, functional capabilities and unique personalities. Also,
as an open system; they must relate effectively to its external and
internal environment.
After introductory lectures students will work in small groups up to 8
members. They should be divided according to working place in their
countries. They will participate in brainstorming technique in order to
recognize and to define their health organizational values and purpose.
Then, they will discuss the possibilities for change and improvement in
their own environment, while developing their vision and mission.
Teacher should assist by introducing good examples and by highlighting
organizational values. Finally, groups will be asked to present their
work and explain their organizational current and future direction.
Teacher should be familiar with examples of different health
institutional strategic orientations. Also, teacher should be ready to help
students to explore internet sites of various health organizations and
their
strategic
concepts
and
directions
(e.g.

Group presentations and discussions. 140 A HEALTH ORGANISATION PURPOSE AND
STRATEGIC INTENT: CREATING VISION AND
MISSION
Milena Santrić Milicević THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The environment of rapid changes calls upon health organizations to respond
appropriately to them (1). While health managers in high developed economies
struggle with global trends trying to stabilize their positions on competitive health
service markets, those in transitional countries and particular in public services seek
for opportunities and appropriate means for effective development (1,2,3,4). In the
course of generating insight into how to manage strategic change and get forward to
the goals, two standpoints appeared interesting. First is the Ohmae`s formula for
success that comprise knowledge of organizational boundaries (three R): reality,
readiness, and resources of the organization (5). The second is the Pettigrew and
Whipp observation, based on empirical case studies, that a strategic change is a result
of the interaction between content of change (what: objectives, purpose and goals),
process or how of change is implemented and the organizational context of change
(the internal and external environment) (6). In practice, it is seen that some private
sector health organizations were better able than others, and especially than public
ones to improve their competitive performance. Moreover, while young organization
tends to be energetic and oriented to change, a mature one is prone to conservatism
and protection of the resources and authority they have acquired (6). For that reason,
health organizations alike other open systems must relate effectively to its external
environment, without sacrificing hard won prior accomplishments. As a start in
response to the specific needs identified, health organizations should have developed
missions and visions statements.
Vision and mission declarations are necessary step in strategic planning,
management and leading processes. Thus, a significant management concern is how
to remain dynamic and innovative while acknowledging that health organization
development is determined by several factors like it is the position in the system, their
functional capabilities and unique personalities. In addition, governing body
arrangements act as drivers of change, by influencing who should the health
organization serve and how should purpose be determined. On the other side, who is
health organization supposed to serve, is imposed by powerful external stakeholders.
Besides, the suitability, acceptability and feasibility of health organizational
change are to be assessed within the ethical stance of the organization and social
context. The climate of integrations and globalization itself open the space for new
values and new generations of health managers (7-10). The principles like solidarity,
equity and accessibility which are legacy in some health systems sometimes are
confronted with feature of other philosophy values that imply fast growth and
accomplishments (11,12). Finally, usual macro-environment forces (historical,
cultural, economic and political factors) require balancing between directions to “fit”
and to “stretch” to all of the mentioned challenges (1,6). 141 Fundamental reckoning for a strategic leading of a health organization are the
well designed vision and mission. The leader of a health organization should have
imagination, should be unorthodox and challengeable, but at the same time be clear
and practical to assure objectives achievability and realization within the legislative
framework (6). Therefore, leaders are rare, instead frequent are managers or
management teams, but more often we see directors of health institutions (who follow
directions). Since it is likely they face multiple priorities and pressures they should
constantly strive to maintain a proper balance between reactive and proactive
postures. The passive posture of management boards of directors should be replaced
by proactive and sometimes aggressive one. As it is understood a decade ago, “what
we need today, maybe is not new theory, or new conception or framework, but they
are people that can thing like strategists” (5). The key strategic values of the new era
are innovations, quality, speed, flexibility and continual improvement. Those
attributes are also the prerequisites for a modern strategic and health management in a
complex and dynamic social ambient.
Important for heath manager who is strategist also, is to frequently re-inquire
the aim of the health organization, strategic position and operational policy, since
everything that will happen is hard to plan, and it is important to take into account the
fact that any intervention may set off unexpected costs (2,3,4). By analyzing the
internal strengths and weaknesses of an organization in the light of the external threats
and opportunities one should be able to adequately determine the vision, mission,
objectives, policy and goals of a health institution. The key questions, modified after
Norburn and Birley, in planning the strategic orientation of a health institution are
presented in table 1 (2).
Table 1. Keys questions for mission and vision development of a health organization
Questions Keys What is our job? To understand the field where health organization
operates, the level it is in and the services it offers to
whom.
To analyze the external environment, health sector
market and competitors. What is our position in the
health
service
production
framework?
Where are we now? To analyze resources, competences and competitive
advantage. What should be our future
position? To analyze stakeholders` expectations, power,
energy and interest. What activities
successfully to it? To analyze approaches,
benchmarking will lead good models and Where do we want to be? To create organizational vision, strategic intent and
strategic positioning in future. How do we get there? To plan organizational structure, directions,
development, strategies and to design policy. The mission statement is generalized statement of the purpose of the
organization. Also, it defines and specifies the vision of the organization starting from 142 the geographical territory, target market, philosophy and production conditions (like
quality) and social responsibility. In the literature various approaches exist for
development of mission. Prescriptive approaches usually emphasize the need to set
out a mission and objectives for the next few years. Some managers accept the need
but emphasize the bottom up approach and inclusive development of health
organizational core values. Emergent approaches doubt the usefulness as the future is
so uncertain. Ansoff and McDonell point out that mission represent the aspiration or
intentions of stakeholders that organization serves (13). Johnson and Scholes call it
like „raison de`être” - the reason it exists as such in social and economical context
(2). Complementary, Drucker signifies it as the way that one could create its new
clients or customers (14). In summary, it should be in line with the expectations of the
key stakeholders and the reasoning behind it. Key values of health organization
should be incorporated in the mission in the form of beliefs, attitudes, image,
tradition, truism, symbols, legitimacy, cultural web and sometimes values are
stakeholders themselves.
Mission statements should be visionary description of the position in the
`health service production framework’. As it outlines the broad future directions,
missions are followed by objectives which are more detailed, usually quantified,
measurable and achievable in a specific a time period. So, the identity of health
institution is its mission, philosophy (cultural web, values, principles, beliefs and
policy) and is its purpose.
The mission is important to be set before putting into practice an effective
change initiative or strategic plans, because it should guide the health organization
through strategy implementation.
The strengths and competencies of managers to improve the position of health
organization are reflected in vision. Vision should be clear inspiration for the both
internal (e.g. employees, owners, and unions) and external stakeholders (e.g. clients,
suppliers, competitors, and local community). Clarity can be obtained by very natural
statements, like what are our purpose framework, competencies and unique values.
For the vision development it is useful to explore what stays the same in health
organization despite continual efforts and necessities to change (5). The crucial health
organization stewardship comprises intelligent use of the knowledge and power,
regulations and data sets that will upgrade understanding and commitment of
employees to the mission and vision (2,7,8,11,12). Besides managers, it is expected
that other professionals and staff of health organization show a growing interest in
understanding how they can develop the skills and attitudes required in a visionary
health organization and service. A team of high performance that creates vision for
the longer period should interact with each other in real talk and open listening, to
confront the obstacles with risk tolerant high energy, and high trust. There is a large
and growing body of evidence that demonstrates a positive linkage between the
development of human capital and organizational performance. Moreover, a health
organization market value depends less on tangible resources, but rather on intangible
ones, particularly human resources, all human capital forms, notably intellectual,
social, and organizational (2). In shaping a health organizational performance human
resources are assets and liabilities in linking overall coherence with vision. Depending
on how internal and external business communication is regulated, the local and
national prestige and growth among customers will eventually be visible (16). So 143 sharing the vision with all multidisciplinary teams in his/her organization is another
core issue.
The final points will be that vision is „what can be“(e.g. our new way of
organization, functioning, values, and image), and that it should not be blind nor have
tunnel outcome or myopia effects (2,9). In conclusion, the overriding purpose of a
health institution is outlined in its main intentions as well as in the broad directions to
be followed in the future. Strategically thinking from the vision agreed upon, we
realize what should be our mission and objectives of the organization starting from
the real circumstances and creating new one if necessary. In other words, modern
strategic planning should be supported by creativity.
Below are presented strategic statements of some health organizations,
showing how they fit with the key stakeholders’ values, and are stretched with
internal and external customers’ expectations.

achieve this through providing subsidized medical services while promoting
individual responsibility for the costs of healthcare services. Our population is thus
encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle, taking responsibility for one’s own health.
Safety nets are provided however, to ensure that no Singaporean is denied access into
the healthcare system or turned away by public hospitals because of lack of money.

Task 1
After introductory lectures students will form small group consist of up to 8 members.
Students will be divided in groups according to their countries and health
organizations (primary health care institution, hospitals, non-governmental health
organization, pharmacy, etc). They will participate in brainstorming technique in
order to recognize and to define their organizational values and purpose. Each student
will give an example of health organizational value according to his/her experience
and knowledge and should be warned to be ready to explain it later. Group leader will
write down each example on the flip chart. Students should make an extensive list of
organizational values by naming as many as they have been aware of. Each of the
listed values should be explained in relation to organizational aim and purpose.
The work will continue in small groups to discuss their routine tasks,
responsibilities and clients and stakeholders. Group leader will summarize them on a 145 paper. Teacher should point out the differences that exist among various health
organizations to help them in clarifying their mission reports. The necessary time for
this exercise is 45 minutes, if the group is consisted from 20 students. Task 2
The second exercise will be to discuss the necessities in their organizational
environment and the possibilities for improvement. Within the small groups they will
create the vision statements. After small group presentations, discussion will be in
front of the whole group. Teacher will support students to search Internet resources of
useful links to health care sites around the world with intention to explore existing
models of organizational missions and visions. For this exercise additional 45 minutes
under the supervision are suggested. REFERENCES

Health policy, health priorities
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• Understand the steps in creating a health policy (problem
identification, research design, research plan, and/or policy paper);
• Compare and contrast alternative approaches to health policy
development;
• Explain the concept and process of health policy development;
• Define and illustrate elements of the health policy;
• Learn how to assess, in real-life situations, the need for change
and the scope for change;
• Prepare policy brief/policy paper for arguing certain health policy
issue.
This module examines the health policy development and in
particular the functions of health policy analysis in the policy-making
process. The module starts with a short overview of the historical
background of policy analysis, which shows that the aim of policy
analysis, today as in the past, has been to provide policymakers with
information that can be used to solve practical problems. The module
continues with a description of the policy development in the health
sector. Although policy analysis is an intellectual activity, it is also
embedded in a social and political process known as policymaking.
Health policies are important because it is what gives content to the
practices of the health sector. Policies are expressed in a whole series
of practices, statements, regulations and even laws which are the
result of decisions about how we will do things. 147 Teaching methods Specific
recommendations
for teachers Assessment of
students This module contrasts and compares several models of health policy
development, each of which captures an important aspect of the
complex process of policymaking.
An introductory lecture gives the students first insight in elements
and process of health policy analysis and development. The
theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study.
Before/After introductory lectures students carefully read the
recommended advanced readings. Afterwards they discuss the
elements of health policy and the process of HP development with
other students, especially the designing and planning phase (problem
identification, policy options, etc.). In continuation, they need to
identify a policy issue, find published materials (e.g. papers), write a
short assignment/seminar paper (policy brief, including all its
elements) and present their findings to other students.

Neda Milevska-Kostova, Elisaveta Stikova, Doncho Donev THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Policy analysis in the policy making process
Public policy and policy analysis
Even though the roots of the policy as science and the policy analysis lay in the
political sciences, over the past several decades, public policy has developed in a
separate scientific discipline, with policy analysis as its tool aimed today as in the
past, at providing policymakers with information that can be used to solve practical
problems.
The main purpose of policy analysis is to improve policy making. This is not
an easy task, especially when we consider that many of the most important policy
changes are gradual, disjointed and incremental; large discontinuous changes are
relatively rare and they stem from shocks that are exogenous to the policy-making
process, not from a relatively marginal influence of analyses conducted within the
process (1).
Among the policy analysts there is an unwritten rule that good policy
analysis often yields better policies. In order to make good policy analysis, it is
essential to know its rules, elements and procedures that combine it. This module
essentially deals with the elements and procedures, but also with the whole context
in which the policy analysis would take its place in a most efficient way to give
informed and timely positions and opinions to the policy-makers during the process
of decision making. Policy-making and the policy cycle
The process of policy-making is often solely related to the actions of preparation,
adoption and implementation of policies; it is associated with policy makers or
decision makers as the ultimate power holders to adopt political decisions. But, this
complex process is much more than a "galvanistic twitch" (2) - it embraces some
hidden aspects of agenda setting through a systematic approach as well as through
mobilization of interest groups around particular issue; it involves advocacy and
lobbying for stakeholders’ most preferred policy alternative at one, and the
evaluation and monitoring of the implementation at the other end of the spectrum.
Some authors describe the policymaking as a reiterative process often called
policy cycle. The policy cycle has defined steps which can be repeated, depending
on the level of achievement of the goals or satisfaction of the stakeholders; it can
also be repeated as many times as the policy process requires in order to establish
effective policy, which in reality does happen, even though it is not resource-wise
an efficient way of policy making. 149 Elements of policy cycle
In search for geometric and logical explanation of the otherwise fairly intuitive
process, the researchers have proposed a model of policy cycle with defined steps
that lead into effective policy making.
Basically, the policy cycle consists of 4 to 6 steps, depending on the level of
fragmentation of the steps by various authors. The cycle opens with: a) policy
agenda setting; b) issue identification; c) formulation/specification of the policy
alternatives; d) decision on the most acceptable/optimal policy alternative; e) policy
implementation; and f) monitoring and evaluation of the policy implementation.
Additionally, some authors (3) propose that the segment of policy maintenance,
succession or termination be separated from the last step, as it is recognized as very
important part embedding another round of decision making.
But, the cycle does not have to be started at the agenda setting; it can also
commence from the evaluation of previous policy, or it can continue from any given
point at which the process has once stopped for various internal or external reasons.
Thus, it is very important to understand that policy cycle is a “messy order” of
events and actions that eventually lead to applicable solution of the chosen policy
problem. Figure 1. Policy process stages - simplified timeline Policy agenda setting
The policy agenda setting is by far the most delicate step of all in the policy making
process; here, all stakeholders have an open arena for putting forward issues,
alternatives and solutions in front of the political power holders. It is often thought
that this step is closed and exclusive to the decision makers, but in reality we
experience much more interference from other, usually very influential parties, such
as the business sector or strong civil society movements.
The importance of this step in furthering one's policy issue higher on the
agenda is closely related to the significance of the timing chosen for pushing certain
policy issue; there are more and less suitable times for introduction and advocating
for certain policy issue. For example, it is very unlikely that the pro-abortion policy 150 will be adopted during a conservative party ruling; it is highly inefficient to push an
environmental issue during a nation-wide security crisis at the border, etc. Thus, it
is up to the advocates of the policy issue/alternative to assess and wait for an
appropriate time to seed it and to expect fertile soil for their position to be grown.
These so-called policy windows are times when we can expect wide acceptance
from both politics and general public, and those are judged and forecasted by
experienced policy analysts.
Public interest alone does not guarantee that an issue will be placed on the
policy agenda. To be placed on the agenda, policy makers must consider the issue
within the purview of government action and deserving of public attention. Many
different approaches are used to place an issue at the forefront of the policy agenda.
Enormous influence in the process of agenda setting can be expected from
the powerful business sector, depending on the relevance of the issue to their
operation(s). However, one should not underestimate the power of the opinion
leaders in the society; those are sometimes influential researchers and professionals,
think-tank organizations, international community, and of course - the media. As a
major source of political information, the media help shape the public’s perception
of the reality. These perceptions constitute a basis for the public’s political activity.
It’s very important to emphasize that political parties serve as linkages or
intermediaries between the citizens and their government. As Edmund Burke said in
1770 (4), a party is a body of man united, for promoting by their endeavours the
national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed.
Regarding his statement, officially and unofficially political parties have a major
role in agenda setting process. Party leaders have major role in determining the
agenda of the party in advance of an election and than balancing the conflict
priorities of various interest groups between elections (5). Issue identification/specification
Once the issue is set sufficiently high on the political agenda, policy makers must
develop a broad policy agenda into specific policy option. It is the process of policy
formulation. Policy formulation involves developing alternative proposals and than
collecting, analyzing and communicating the information necessary to assess the
alternatives and begin to persuade people to support one proposal or another. Policy
formulation involves compromising and bargaining in order to satisfy various
interests and build a coalition of support. The decision makers are themselves
becoming the moving force for solving the policy problem; they seek analyses,
opinions and advice from their own or external sources that they find relevant and
reliable. It is not unusual for the policy and decision makers to look for several
positions before making a decision. Even though, in the newer democracies this
process is often ended by selection of the issue among the peers of the ruling
government.
This is also a stage at which researchers and professionals should exhibit
their views and findings, as the issue identification and its formulation can give way
to improper understanding or misleading outcome for the policy.
In policy formulation, information is assembled, arguments developed, and
alternatives shaped towards winning the approval of policy makers. 151 Analysis and specification of policy alternatives
Issue identification requires tough decision by the decision makers; the policy
analysis and specification of policy alternatives puts this burden on the shoulders of
policy analysts and researchers. Any given issue can be solved in an infinite number
of ways, which are dependent on different social, economic, but also political
factors. This part of the policy process is very much relying on understanding of the
national context and specificities, legal framework and economic potentials of the
country, as well as on the degree of political will, mentality of the people and
readiness of the social and physical infrastructure.
For example, there may be a significant political will to introduce a smoking
ban in the country, but other factors may impede its implementation, such as the
willingness of people to understand and accept, potentials of the commercial sector
to adapt to the needed standards, and sufficiency of the inspection services to
implement the measures so that the policy will become fully effective. Since, if any
of the given factors and pre-conditions are not met, the created leak of policy will
lead to further anarchical behaviour, lined with diminishing of trust in the
government institutions and disbelief in their capacity to implement any policy in
the future.
Another important factor when choosing the most optimal policy alternatives
to be presented to the decision makers is the forecasted or calculated (in case of
sufficient data) fiscal implication of the alternative. It is highly unlikely that the
decision makers will choose even a more effective policy solution that places big
budgetary burden over another, maybe not as effective but which requires minimal
or no budget spending for implementation. Choosing the most suitable/optimal policy alternative
Any decision maker would not like to be placed in front of one policy solution that
has to be taken for granted, based on the judgment of the policy analyst(s).
Knowing this, experienced policy researchers will often present at least 2 - most
often 3 - policy options on the table; of them, almost without exception the "zero"
alternative or the "status quo" policy option is one, as it shows what would happen
if the situation of the selected policy remains unaltered, while other circumstances
inevitably change with time. An illustrative example would be the analysis of the
introduction of electronic health cards, in which the zero option of continuing the
practice of paper health records is matched against the developing IT society, in
terms of funds consumed by paper use, possibilities for abuse of data, time
consumption for communicating health data among institutions, storage space, etc.
In this part of the work, as can be seen from the example, the analysts offer
social, economic and political analysis (and forecast!) to the decision makers for
each offered policy alternative, while at the end proposing the most preferable one
against all mentioned criteria.
In the real world, however, sometimes it happens that the decision makers
already have their own preferred solution, even before the analysis is done. This
kind of “pre-commissioned” work is referred to as garbage bin policy approach (1),
in which the solution is known before the problem is identified, or simply - the
solution is attached to a problem, for reasons such as political image building, 152 pushing certain group’s vested interests instead of public interests, etc. Once the
policy has been formulated, statements of government policies and programs are
promulgated. Policy implementation
After another round of difficult decision-making, finally the policy comes to the
stage of implementation. Here, the decision makers should be aware (and maybe
made aware by the policy analysts) of the necessary infrastructure for proper
implementation, or the actions that should be taken to strengthen or enlarge it.
Those actions become priority and take immediate execution. This is the test for
both the political willingness and the potentials for success of the selected policy
alternative.
Implementation involves three activities directed towards putting a policy
into effect. The three activities required for implementation are:
− interpretation;
− organization; and
− application.
Interpretation means the translation of the programmatic language into
acceptable and feasible administrative directives. These can be lows, regulations,
decisions and resources allocation.
Organization requires the establishment of administrative units and methods
necessary to put a program into effect. Resources like money, building, staff,
equipment are important for implementation of the formulated policy issues.
Application requires the services to be routinely administered.
The process of interpreting and organization to implement policy goals it is
often termed strategic planning. Strategy planning must be then followed by
operational planning and management as a part of the application phase of the
implementation.
Yet, putting certain policy in the daylight should go hand in hand with its
monitoring and evaluation - for the simple reason of knowing its effects, but also
gaps and challenges, as well as possibilities for improvement, once they are
identified. The policy analyst again here plays crucial role in walking hand-in-hand
with the decision makers, using its forecasting and policy adaptation skills. Monitoring and evaluation
Each policy-making authority in the country should consider monitoring and
evaluation as its integral part, and thus always make sure that there are sufficient
resources for their execution. This is often not the case in the newer democracies, so
usually even good policies suffer in their implementation, as there is no corrective
mechanism to alarm about the faults in the system.
Essential part of the monitoring is setting realistic performance indicators,
measuring them and evaluating each one against the expected outcomes of the
policy, set during the issue identification and policy analysis stages. The results
obtained will serve as feed into the next step, which will be made fairly easy to
perform, once the necessary decision-making data is in place. 153 Deciding the
termination? Policy fate: maintenance, succession or Under the condition that the monitoring and evaluation stages have been properly
performed (and this is not to be considered a one-time action!), the decision on
whether the chosen policy alternative is to be continued, modified or completely
ceased is relatively easy to adopt; if, of course, other political interests are not
interfering with the decision. As the later is often the case, the role of monitoring
and evaluation is thus more important, as it can strengthen the position against the
decision made solely on the political interest base. Figure 2. The Process of policy analysis (adapted from Dunn W.N, 2004) Health policy development
Health policy agenda
In the health sector, the ultimate goal of the policy and decision makers is expected
to be the wellbeing of the population, universal access to health services and/or
providing better healthcare at optimal budget spending. As this is a very broad
definition of a mission of health authorities, it includes infinite number of issues
that need to be solved, addressed or improved. So, it is of quite an importance the
order by which they are addressed, or the timing at which they are put onto the
table. For example, the issue of propagating breastfeeding is not an unimportant 154 one, but it has lower priority over providing health access to the whole population
(including the rural areas); not that the healthy diet and nutrition programs are less
important, but the vaccination preventive program will certainly be given a higher
priority on the government policy agenda; etc. Yet, one should be aware that
sometimes some apparently “less important” issues are put on the agenda for
different reasons (among which e.g. the political rating improvement), and those
policy windows should be used to push forward particular policy alternative(s),
ideally optimal for the general public or the vast majority of population.
Major role in setting the health policy agenda is played by the international
community, especially in the developing countries. This very noble intention, can
sometimes be motivated by the objectives of solving the macroeconomic situation
in the country, rather than by the goals of establishing a good system that would
provide high quality healthcare; other times, it is related to a trend in the world, that
would not necessarily be of high value if applied to an unprepared national context.
Thus, it is very important to judge the source of the policy agenda setting, in order
to be able to react upon it according to the national priorities and needs in this very
sensitive social service sector. Health policy analysis
In a not much different way from other areas in the society, the health policy
analysis is using the methods and procedures as explained above for informing
health policy-makers and decision-makers. The political consensus over the
importance of a certain issue is much easier to obtain in the health sector rather
than, for example in the sphere of national security; thus, here a much bigger
challenge is the issue selection, together with the choice of the preferred policy
alternative. Health sector being one of those in which there is always relatively
higher demand than supply, or much bigger need than resources available, the
choice is often difficult to make from the aspect of financial or human resources
and infrastructure availability. For example, there is no government that will not
agree with the importance of providing equal access to high quality healthcare for
all citizens, but the financial limitations will certainly play crucial role in navigating
the process.
To this end, the key criteria for the health policy analysis are bound to
financial constraints of the country’s economy, and overcoming these constraints is
elaborated below and in the case study, given at the end of this module. Key criteria in setting priorities, health policy formulation and
alternatives
As said before, one of the key criteria in health policy making is related to the
financial constraints or possibilities of the country’s economy. Taking into
consideration the fact that still the health sector is predominantly perceived as
“resource spending” (spending on healthcare) rather than as “resource generating”
(building a healthy workforce), this criterion will have the last word in deciding the
most optimal health policy alternative (Box 1).
Another, not less important criteria, is that most of the policy makers would
like to see in the policy analysis the outreach and the scope of population that
would benefit from the given policy. To each policy maker that considers fulfilment 155 of the mission of his/her organization would ask on the magnitude and effects of the
policy if applied as priority in the system; he/she will certainly understand a
comparison between a policy on drug abuse prevention and vaccination, for
example. Choosing one over the other will have to give good arguments and
justification for making such choice, in terms of holding themselves accountable in
front of the citizens that voted for them.
Last but not least, among the key criteria is the timeframe of achievement of
results or visibility of the policy implementation. Short-term objective are always
preferred, but a good argumentation of a long-term and strategic goals can lead to
choice of a far better solution over just another “headline for this month’s journal”. Major players in health policy formulation
Regardless of the efforts of the governments in developing countries, it is an often
seen scenario that the major players in setting the policy agenda and health policy
formulation are the governments of developed countries or the international
community. This is sometimes deliberate, but many times also unintended outcome
of bilateral or multilateral agreements and relationships. Offering international or
own solutions for local problems heavily bound to national contexts is a common
practice among different health sector consultants, projects or programs. Even
though made with good intentions, such applications of unadjusted policy solutions
can lead to major damages to the health system in one country - and, as health
sector is vitally dealing with human lives, such damages by faulty health policy
decisions can have unforeseeable consequences to the nation’s economy as well.
Box 1. Criteria for setting priorities in health policy and planning
Medical criteria:
 Frequency of the disease (prevalence and incidence)
 Disease duration
 Seriousness of the disease (consequences, complications)
 Disease lethality and fatality (rabies, AIDS, tetanus)
 Needs for problems solving according to professionals’ evaluation
Economic criteria:
 Financial expenses regarding the disease (for doctor service delivery
payment, medicaments, rehabilitation etc.);
 Permanent incapability for work (disability);
 Temporary incapability for work (absence/absenteeism);
 Economic rationality and sustainability of investments in finding decision
for certain health problem (e.g. construction of water supply and drainage
systems, immunization);
 Financial constraints or possibilities of the country’s economy
Social criteria:
 Particular socio-medical importance of certain population groups (children,
students and youngsters, women, workers, elderly people etc.);
 Possibilities for practical solution of the problem;
 Possibility for encompassing certain population groups (compactness of the
group, for e.g. school children, workers);
 How much the solution of one problem is independent from the solution of
another problems;
 Timeframe of achievement of results and visibility of the policy and program
implementation 156 Human criteria:
 Number of people that will benefit from the solution of a certain problem or
from the given health policy;
 Population's requests for finding solution regarding a certain problem;
 The effects that will be achieved when the problem is resolved (more effects
together). Thus, it is very important that the health policy is created and structured by
researchers and analysts that have profound knowledge of the national context and
specificities; imported solutions may be a good base for change, but only if matched
against the local background, needs and possibilities. Advocating health policy
In every policy issue or problem there are a number of stakeholders that have their
positions, interests and knowledge or information, and therefore an environment of
different pressures is created. In the case of health policy, not only the pressure
from the professional community or government can be very high, but also the
patients or users of the health system can have strong positions about a certain case,
since the health policy is directly influencing their life, lifestyle or living standard.
In the process of advocating for certain health policy, in most of the cases,
the first issue that should be addressed is the common misunderstanding of the
standing of the patients and medical professionals within the system; as often seen,
the medical profession finds itself opposed to the patients, and in fact this is major
misinterpretation of the roles of both; the doctors and the patients are on the same
side of the coin, as they both work and aim at - better health and prolongation of
human life - each in their own role and own way. Once having planted for this,
through the selected health issue that is advocated for, the health policy process will
much easier move through the labyrinths of its own development.
There are different ways of doing advocacy; it can be both formal and
informal, with or without written documents. It can take several months to several
years, depending on the readiness of the stakeholders to take into account the
opinion of others and listen to their arguments. But, whichever pathway is selected,
the key to successful advocacy is to be ready to give up the ownership of the idea
(something not very typical in the scientific and research community), to be
prepared to hear others advocating for the idea (which helps the process, as it shows
acceptance and raised awareness on the issue) and to be open for dialogue
objectively accepting other positions and alternatives. CASE STUDY: PATIENTS RIGHTS AS POLICY ISSUE - CASE
OF MACEDONIA
Introduction
In most of the countries of South Eastern Europe prior to the transition there was no
single legislation regulating the rights of patients, but those rights were stipulated in
several healthcare and healthcare insurance laws and bylaw documents. One of the
activities of some of the new EU member-states during the process of preparation
for accession in the EU was the adjustment of the health care legislation towards the 157 European legislation and standards. Such was the case with Hungary that in 1997
enacted the New Health Care Act, in which most of the patients’ rights are
regulated, such as: the right to healthcare, right to be treated with dignity, right to
information, right to refuse treatment, right to information privacy, right to leave
the health care institution, right to complaint, right to die with dignity, right to
participation in decision-making in health care, etc. (6).
Further, the dramatic changes that have taken place in the past decade in
Central and Eastern Europe have caused the large inequalities in health to grow
even bigger, not only between but also within the countries in the region. This
statement can be well backed up with the national health statistics, which “give a
stark illustration of the effect of economic crisis and widespread pollution of the
environment on the health of whole populations are revealing a growing health
divides” (7).
The process was driven by the common health and social policy in the EU,
which despite the differences of the national health systems, is placing the same
rights of patients, consumers, users, family members, weak populations and
ordinary people at risk. As described in the Preamble of the European Charter of
Patients’ Rights, “financial constraints, however justified, cannot legitimize
denying or compromising patients' rights. The Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights
will soon be part of the new European constitution. It is the basis of the declaration
of the fourteen concrete patients' rights currently at risk: the right to preventive
measures, access, information, consent, free choice, privacy and confidentiality,
respect of patients' time, observance of quality standards, safety, innovation,
avoidance of unnecessary suffering and pain and personalized treatment, and the
right to complain and to receive compensation” (8).
As this process has not been completely undergone by the candidate
countries for EU membership, among which the Republic of Macedonia, we have
decided to start the process of preparation of the terrain for endorsement of a single
legislative document, which will consolidate all existing and newly introduced
rights. The process
Prior to the transition, in the Republic of Macedonia there was no single legislation
regulating the rights of patients, but those rights were stipulated in several
healthcare and health insurance laws and bylaw documents.
The previously existing healthcare legislation (Health Law of 1970; Law for
Healthcare of 1983) has regulated the patients’ rights and duties to certain extent.
The currently governing Law for Healthcare (1991) is more extensive in regulating
these rights. However not all of the rights described in the European Charter of
Patient’s rights have been regulated.
The Health Care Act of 1991, regulates the functioning of the healthcare
system in the country, and consists of the following chapters: (a) the health
insurance; (b) rights and responsibilities of the healthcare users; (c) the rights and
responsibilities of the healthcare providers; (d) organizational structure of the
healthcare system, and (e) financing of the healthcare (9). According to the existing
legislation, 8 of the 14 rights were regulated, in one of the mentioned documents. 158 However, the analysis of the existing legislation regarding the exercising of
rights and duties of the patients and of the implementation practices in the country;
the following conditions have been identified (6):
− Lack of appropriate and systematized legislation directly regulating patients’
rights;
− Insufficient level of implementation of the existing legislation;
− Lack of knowledge and ignorance of patients regarding their rights;
− Non-transparent attitude of the healthcare authorities regarding information
of the citizens for their rights (but also duties) as patients;
− Lack of technical support in the healthcare facilities for complete
implementation of certain rights of patients, such as the right to privacy and
confidentiality of personal and medical data.
The team decided that a health policy in R. Macedonia should be developed
following the identified conditions. Methodology
The first step taken after the situation analysis in R. Macedonia in 2005 was the
screening of the legislation and practices in the neighbourhood and in the EU, as
ultimate reference for the country’s governance. The similar laws adopted in these
countries have been taken as samples to start the drafting process of the law.
The questionnaire was prepared based on several sample questionnaires
used for surveying of patients’ satisfaction in different healthcare facilities. Bearing
in mind the local mentality, practices and the level of trust in the institutions of the
system, a number of general questions have been put in the first part of the
questionnaire, in order to get the patients’ confidence and sense of real involvement
in the survey. In order to collect more data for construction of case studies database
of this project, the participants have been interviewed by a group of trained
interviewers (6).
The sampling technique was the one of multistage sampling; this included
the selection of healthcare facilities (the so-called series of clusters), based on the
target group (e.g. facilities to which certain ethnicities gravitate), from each of
which a random sample of patients has been selected (e.g. patients visiting the
healthcare facility on the day of the survey). Results
Despite the different but very high levels of regulation of patients’ rights in the
legislation, the implementation levels have been expectedly similar. The interviews
reported a situation with the physician-patient relationship even expressed as “the
father-physician taking care of the child-patient”.
The reasons can be searched in the previous system, but can also be found in
the ignorance of the patients regarding their rights. The only survey that was
undertaken under this research (conducted in Macedonia on 282 individuals) shows
that over 80% of the interviewed are not aware of the benefits from or the mere
existence of most of the patients’ rights. The most commonly heard of (but not
often exercised) is the right to compensation for treatment received abroad; next to
it is the right to compensation for the medications on the positive list (heavily 159 subsidized), which have been purchased for a full price in a private pharmacy. The
main reason why the 85.8% of the interviewees were not exercising these rights is
the complicated and lengthy procedures administered by the Health Insurance Fund,
as well as the unclear method of reimbursement.
Apart from these two, the other rights are mostly looked at as obligations.
For example, the right to free choice of physician in the primary healthcare (the socalled “maticen lekar”, with similar functions as the family physician) is considered
an obligation imposed by the law; on the other hand, the more general explanation
of the right to free choice of physician is almost prejudicially linked to the visit of a
private physician’s office (most of which have no contract with the Health
Insurance Fund, charging the full price for the health services provided), which can
be done without any referral and upon free judgment of the individual. Closely
resembling to this is the attitude for signing the informed consent, which for over
half of the interviewed patients is just another “administrative procedure”.
The survey has confirmed the general notion and the acceptance by the
patients of the paternalistic approach in the physician-patient relationship. Among
the interviewees, 90.8% are satisfied (56% very and 34.8% averagely) from the
services received; over 60% have never intentionally been to another physician or
asked for a second opinion. Furthermore, 86.5% are convinced that the physician is
prescribing them the best possible medications/therapy that they need, and 93.6%
comply, as much as they can afford, with the recommendations and advices given
by the doctor.
Even though the right to complain is regulated and guaranteed in the
legislation, an astonishing 84-86% has never had any questions or complaints
regarding the medical services received or healthcare facility procedures undergone.
The background to this is more likely the decreased confidence in the institutions of
the system, or ignorance regarding the mechanisms and institutions in which the
legal advice or cure can be sought.
The reasons for such high level of satisfaction may be partly related to the
structure of the interviewed group; namely, 60.9% have no official job or no job at
all, of which 92.2% are covered with basic health insurance through the
unemployed benefits system - the basic health insurance which is in no way
different than what a regularly employed person receives by regular payment of
taxes and payroll contributions to the state budget and to the single Health
Insurance Fund (Note: the Macedonian system of health insurance still being in a
very initial stage of healthcare reforms, does not have different health insurance
policies and health insurance institutions which employees or employers can choose
from for better health care coverage).
The comparative analysis of the legislation and regulative instruments in the
countries of Southeast Europe and the survey of the level of implementation of the
legislation in the Republic of Macedonia, two approaches for improvement of
protection and promotion of the patients’ rights impose, both involving changes in
the legal environment (in terms of improved implementation of the current
legislation or introduction of new instruments and mechanisms for exercising
patients’ rights), combined with other advocacy and public awareness raising
activities involving the civil sector. 160 Alternatives
Following the health policy development process, the results were then transformed
into policy alternatives that were offered to the policy maker - the Ministry of
Health. Alternative 1: Improved implementation of the current
legislation
This alternative includes changes in the implementation mechanisms of the
legislation, but also assuming undertaking public awareness raising activities. One
of the main components to protection of patients’ rights is the understanding of
their violation by both the patient and the physician or the institution.
Moreover, as the patients are usually treated by a team of physicians, nurses,
and technicians in a complex, unfamiliar, and sometimes frightening setting, they
are often being treated as non-person and thus raising feelings of anonymity and
isolation. Because of this the institution-patient relationship is almost equally
important as the doctor-patient relationship.
Significant aspect in the improvement of the implementation of the
legislation is the enhanced knowledge and perception of the general public but of
the health professionals as well, in which the civil sector is expected to play major
role - through awareness raising campaigns, offering legal advices and assistance in
understanding and utilizing the mechanisms of the system.
The main portion of the costs for implementing this alternative will be
related to the public awareness raising campaigns. Yet, a significant portion shall be
considered for providing technical support (computers, database servers, software
development) for enabling the implementation of certain rights, such as the right to
confidentiality, but also the right to information about the medical condition of the
patient. Alternative 2: Improvement of the legislation
A far more complex alternative is the one requiring changes in the current
legislation. This means restructuring of the existing healthcare acts for better
presentation of the patients’ rights in one place (commonly in one chapter of a
single law, as seen from the experiences of the countries in the region), but possibly
introduction of new mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of the level of
exercising of patients’ rights.
One such idea, vastly debated in the health and legal professional
communities is the introduction of a separate system of Healthcare Ombudsman,
under which patients can sought legal advice and assistance through
recommendations for the institutions of the judiciary system. In some countries, like
Hungary, and since recently Serbia and Montenegro, each health care setting has an
appointed “advocates” responsible for receiving and advising upon patients’ claims
or complaints. This approach provides first-hand legal aid on the existing
mechanisms, but can also serve as a filter for the unjustified claims, thus
contributing towards the more efficient implementation of the legislation regarding
this very neglected but important legal sphere. 161 The costs incurring from implementing this alternative are mostly in the
setting up and maintaining the newly proposed institutional settings and
mechanisms; however, in this alternative as well, some public health education
campaigns will be required, mostly in the direction of increasing the knowledge and
awareness of the general public both of the existing rights but of the novelty in the
system as well. With the current level of reforms in the healthcare system, but in the
judiciary as well, it is hard to expect that additional funds can be provided for the
implementation of this alternative. Rather, the existing Ombudsman office and its
infrastructure can be used for engagement of a specialized health law professional.
Also, another low-cost intervention is the public reporting of the Ombudsman about
the number and types of claims, which will encourage the patients in a more aware
way to accept and exercise their rights, but duties as patients as well. The process - continued
Based on the results of this initiative from the civil sector, the alternatives offered
and the EU directives, in November 2006 the Ministry of Health established a Task
Force for preparation of Law on protection of patients’ rights, inviting key experts,
government and professional community representatives, NGOs and patients’
organizations, as well as media representatives to participate in this process.
After almost one year of polishing the differences in the stakeholders’
opinions and positions, at professional meetings and public debates and finally in
November 2007 the Government adopted the Law and passed it on to the
Parliament for final endorsement. In the Parliament, more than 100 amendments
were made by the Members of the Parliament; the relevant ones were adopted, and
the ones that were not of essential importance or were in collision with other
legislation were rejected with sufficient and justified explanation. In February 2008,
the Draft-Law was put on the Parliament Agenda for voting. Advocating Health Policy
The process of advocacy for this health policy was not very different from the one
explained in the theoretical part of this module. The issue was perceived as such,
that it required strong commitment from the government, but also large support
from the professional community; the level of understanding the patients’ rights and
duties to a point of being able to convert them as the rights and duties of the health
professionals was not present, and this needed to be advocated for. Instruments such
as policy briefs, informal communication with Doctors’ Chamber, Medical
Association and other professional organizations were made, together with formal
presentations of the concept at scientific meetings.
However, the end result of this health policy development is not the
endorsement of this law. It is yet to be confirmed and monitored how it is
implemented, whether it should be maintained, improved or simply terminated if it
does not show results comparable to the fiscal implications it may have. In other
words, this and any other health policy is a continued process with constant need of
evaluation and adjustment according to the changing needs and demands of the
society and all its segments. 162 EXERCISES
Task 1
Read the recommended readings before the class. In-class exercise will be to
discuss the case study and to determine which part represents which element of the
policy cycle. Task 2
Based on the case study above, select a similar issue on which you might like to
make a case for development of health policy. Write a policy paper that would
include all elements of the policy cycle. The teacher will use this paper for student
assessment. REFERENCES

Survey, cross-sectional study, public health intervention programmes, CINDI
programme,
After completing this module students should:
• know the role of cross-sectional surveys as an effective tool in planning
public health interventions;
• know the position and importance of cross-sectional surveys in evidencebased public health;
• be familiar with some cases of domestic and foreign cross-sectional
surveys.
Health surveys are observational epidemiological studies of health status of the
population in which usually a cross-section through frequency and
characteristics of health outcomes and other health related events like
exposures are studied and therefore provide prevalence data.
Surveys are very applicable in searching for general insight in health states
and conditions that last a relatively long time as well as various risk factors for
them. Their results could be efficiently used in planning public health Address for

methods The module is presenting basic theoretical background necessary for
understanding the usefulness of health surveys in planning public health
interventions, as well as it provides a case study.
An introductory lecture gives the students first insight in characteristics of
cross-sectional studies. The theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study.
After introductory lectures students first carefully read the recommended
readings. Afterwards they discuss the characteristics of health surveys and their
potential power for effective health care planning, especially in the field of
public health.
In continuation, they need to find published materials (e.g. papers) on
health surveys and present how they were used (or supposed to be used) in
planning public health interventions. 164 Specific

PLANNING PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS
Lijana Zaletel-Kragelj, Ivan Eržen THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Basic definitions and explanations of terms
Surveys and health surveys
Surveys could be defined in several ways, two of them being:
• according to A Dictionary of Epidemiology (1), surveys are defined as
investigations in which information is systematically collected but in which the
experimental method is not used, and
• according to Rossi and Freeman, surveys are systematic collection of
information from a defined population, usually by means of interviews or
questionnaires administered to a sample of units in the population (2,3).
Health surveys are surveys designated to provide information on the health status of a
population. They could be descriptive, exploratory, or explanatory. Synonym for a
disease frequency survey is a cross-sectional study (1).
In health surveys data could be collected by the means of questionnaires (faceto-face interview, telephone interview, or self-completed questionnaires), or by the
means of health examination, usually in combination with interview. According to
which tool is used to collect data in health surveys, there exist two main types of them
(4):
• health interview surveys or HIS - surveys in which collection of data is carried
out only by the means of questionnaires. In HIS, questionnaires may be
communicated to the study subjects in three ways: through mail questionnaire,
through personal or face-to-face interview or through telephone interview,
• health examination surveys or HES - surveys which are usually a combination
of questionnaires and health examination including diagnostic and laboratory
tests. In HES, the contact between participants and research personnel is
personal since the health examination is a component part of the survey. In this
type of surveys, also questionnaires are usually communicated to the selected
study subjects through personal interview. Cross-sectional studies
There exist several similar definitions of cross-sectional studies:
• according to A Dictionary of Epidemiology (1), cross-sectional studies are
studies that examine the relationship between diseases or other health-related
characteristics, and other phenomena of interest in a defined population at a
particular time,
• a summary of several other definitions is that cross-sectional studies are
observational epidemiological studies of health status of the population in 166 which a »snap-shot« of or a cross-section through frequency and
characteristics of health outcomes and other health related events like
exposures are studied (5-9). This characteristic also gave the name to this type
of epidemiological studies, cross-sectional studies are studies that measure the
prevalence of health outcomes or determinants of health, or both, in a
population at a specific point in time, or over a short period (7).
Health outcomes and other health related events could be measured in crosssectional studies on different measurement scale. In those cross-sectional studies in
which the outcome event is dichotomous the prevalence of this dichotomous event is
recorded. This is the reason that cross-sectional studies are also called prevalence
studies (6, 5, 10, 11). Prevalence studies thus could be on one hand regarded as a
subgroup of cross-sectional studies (11), while on the other hand all cross-sectional
studies could be regarded as prevalence studies since we can dichotomize values of
every observed outcome.
The selected specific point in time could be a time window within which data
are collected (e.g. calendar week or month). It could also be a specific point in time in
the course of events, differing in respect of each individual study subject with regard
to the actual time (beginning of schooling, retirement, etc.) (6, 12, 13).
Frequently, cross-sectional epidemiological studies are designated as crosssectional surveys (7).
Detailed description of cross-sectional studies’ characteristics is given in
numerous textbooks and handbooks including advantages and disadvantages (5, 7, 11,
13), aims (5, 6, 7, 9, 14), methods and tools (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15-18), and course
(phases and periods) (7, 10, 19-21).
Although all phases/periods of cross-sectional studies’ course are important,
planning period is the most important and most sensitive period. If designing and
planning the cross-sectional study in the wrong way, the whole study could be set on
an inappropriate basis, and the deficiencies of this period are very difficult to be
eliminated in the later phases of the cross-sectional studies. In order to avoid as many
faults as possible, the course of the cross-sectional studies must be planned
systematically and with all due care. A precise management of individual crosssectional study is very difficult to be advised. Nevertheless, common
recommendations on actions in designing and planning phases of the cross-sectional
studies exist (7,13,19,21,22-24). Intervention and public health intervention
Several definitions exist of what the intervention is, among which could be find the
following:
• an intervention is a generic term used to denote all public actions e.g. policies,
programmes, projects (25);
• an intervention is an action or programme that aims to bring about identifiable
outcomes (26).
Planned/desired effects of an intervention expressed in terms of outcomes are
general objectives of an intervention.
A public health intervention is an intervention, which is applied to many, most,
or all members of a community, with the aim to deliver a specific benefit to the 167 community or population as well as benefits to individuals (26,27). Public health
interventions include (26,27):
• policies of governments and non-governmental organisations;
• laws and regulations;
• organisational development;
• community development;
• education of individuals and communities;
• engineering and technical developments;
• service development and delivery; and
• communication (including social marketing). Cross-sectional surveys – an important tool in evidence
based public health
Today, cross-sectional surveys represent one of the most important tools of evidence
based public health (14). Unfortunately, these studies are less powerful in comparison
to randomized controlled trials - the main study design in evidence based medicine.
Also the volume of evidence is smaller, and the time from intervention to outcome is
longer (14). Nevertheless, they have some advantages over randomized controlled
trials. Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Diseases
Intervention (CINDI) programme surveys
The World Health Organization (WHO) Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Diseases Intervention (CINDI) programme is an intervention
programme with integration as a key concept in prevention of chronic noncommunicable diseases (28-30). It arose out of experiences of one of the first
community-based health intervention projects in Europe - the North Karelia Project
in Finland, which started in 1972 and reached remarkable achievements as well as
global recognition (31).
Surveys which are aimed on one hand at assessment of burden of risk factors
for non-communicable diseases, and on the other hand at evaluation of process of
CINDI programme, are essential component part of this programme (29, 32).
Today, we distinguish between two types of CINDI surveys (32, 33):
• CINDI Risk Factors and Process Evaluation surveys (30,32) - this type of
surveys is a HES type of surveys, and represents a basic type of CINDI
surveys which provide the basic data for starting a CINDI programme in a
country, and on its progress. This type of surveys is in most CINDI countries
performed on a level of demonstrational area or at most region,
• CINDI Health Monitor Survey (33) - this type of surveys is a HIS type of
surveys his surveys which offer the most rough but comprehensive overview
on the problems tightly associated with non-communicable diseases. This
type of CINDI surveys is mostly aiming at monitoring, assessing and comparing the
trend of health behaviour in CINDI countries with different politically-economic 168 systems. Owing to comparability, monitoring should be conducted under the uniform
methodology and on a national level. CASE STUDY: COUNTRYWIDE INTEGRATED NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTERVENTION (CINDI)
PROGRAMME AND RELATED SURVEYS IN SLOVENIA IN
PLANNING PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS
Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Diseases
Intervention (CINDI) programme and related surveys in
Slovenia
There exist several types of surveys which provide important information for
planning public health interventions for controlling non-communicable disease in
Slovenia (34,35):
1. CINDI Health Monitor Survey (33-35) - This type of survey was performed
in Slovenia for the first time in 2001 (36), for the second time in 2004, and
for the third time in 2008. With its national and at the same time regional
level, this type of surveys in Slovenia represent very strong support to
development of evidence based policy on both levels, what is extremely
important in the process of diminishing interregional differences. At the
same time, it is very powerful tool for evaluation of the effectiveness of
health promotion programmes. All databases include data on about 9000
participants’ health behaviour.
2. CINDI Risk Factors and Process Evaluation Survey (30, 34, 35) - so far,
there were three surveys performed at the demonstrational level (Ljubljana
demonstrational region) – in winter 1990/1991, in winter 1996/1997, and in
winter 2002/2003.
3. Ad-hoc surveys - among ad-hoc surveys, the Beltinci process evaluation
surveys should be mentioned in the first place (37). With the means of two
consecutive surveys of HES type of surveys the effect of one year
intervention programme in Beltinci community was evaluated. The surveys
were basing on CINDI Risk Factors and Process Evaluation surveys
methodology.
These surveys and resulting data-bases are the basis for different specific studies
aiming at planning as much effective public health interventions as possible. CINDI Health Monitor Surveys as a tool for development of
effective intervention programmes for enhancing healthy
nutrition and physical activity in adult population
Background
Behavioural risk factors are among the most important risk factors for non-communicable
diseases (38,39). A study showed that prevalence of some risk factors for cardiovascular
diseases among which unhealthy nutrition and physical activity habits seems to be the
most unfavourable one in Eastern Slovenia (40). In order to determine population groups 169 at highest risk for unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes as well
to determine population groups at highest risk for insufficient physical activity a special
study was performed. The intention was to prepare a high quality basis for working out the
strategies, guidelines/recommendations as well as concrete implementation action plans
for long term diminishing high mortality attributable to non-communicable diseases (41). Methods
The data from CINDI Health Monitor (CHM) 2001 data-base were used (41). The sample
size was 15,379 and the age range 25-64 years. The response rate was 63.8% (9,666
responses). The questionnaires of 9,034 respondents were eligible for analysis (eligibility
criteria: sex and age provided by SORS). In analysis of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition
related to obesity and diabetes all of them were considered, while in insufficient physical
activity only 7,718 questionnaires of participants without any kind of disability (41).
Comprehensive synthetic indicators were constructed (41):
• complex indicator of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes
was defined on the basis of several guidelines and recommendations (42-44), taking
into account circumstances specific to Slovenia (cultural and economic), and
possibilities of the CHM Questionnaire. Complex indicator was derived on the basis
of several questions of the CINDI Health Monitor questionnaire on nutrition
habits. The containment of energy in foods was the most important criterion to select
questions to be incorporated in this complex indicator. All the most important
components recommended by the WHO (high/frequent intake of high energy density
foods, high/frequent intake of fats, especially those composed of saturated fat acids,
high/frequent intake of sweet soft drinks) (45), available in our database, were taken
into consideration (41). The participants were classified into three groups on the basis
of the median value on the number of unhealthy components for the whole sample as
follows: healthy (0 components); moderately unhealthy (1-2 components); very
unhealthy (3-7 components). The prevalence of very unhealthy behaviour was
observed (41),
• complex indicator on the average level of physical activity was derived on the basis
of several questions as well. Questions were basing on International Physical activity
Questionnaire (46) as suggested by the CINDI WHO. They were taking into account
different types of physical activity - moderate physical activity, vigorous physical
activity, or walking). According to type of physical activity and frequency (frequency
of at least 4-times per week was considered as regular) participants were classified
into the following groups: inactive, irregularly active, low intensity regularly active
(regular walking), moderate intensity regularly active (regular moderate physical
activity), and high intensity regularly active (regular vigorous physical activity).
Absence of physical activity and irregular physical activity of any type or intensity
were considered as insufficient physical activity and any regular physical activity
(including regular walking which is one of popular types of regular physical activity
in elderly in Slovenia) was considered as sufficient. The prevalence of insufficient
physical activity was observed.
The observed outcomes were related to sex; age; level of education; employment;
social class (self-classification); type of residence community, and geographical region.
On the basis of the logistic regression model, the risk-score for each participant was
calculated and converted to the estimation of risk for the observed outcome. All participants 170 were put in an array according to their risk estimate. Those with estimate values above the
95th percentile were classified in the very-high-risk group. The combinations of seven
observed characteristics (sex, age, education, employment, social class, type of residence
community, and geographical region) were then examined. Different combinations denoted
different population groups’ profiles. The most frequent profiles within the very-high-risk
groups were observed. Those ranked as top 10 were considered as convenient for public
health (PH) actions (41). Results
Very unhealthy nutrition related to obesity
The highest odds ratios were observed in: men, aged 25-29 and 30-39, adults with lowest
education level (uncompleted or completed primary school), heavy workers in rural
economy, people self-classified in labour social class, those living in rural communities, and
those living in Eastern Slovenia.
Risk for this unhealthy behaviour was possible to estimate in 8,052 participants with
data on all seven factors considered in the multivariate analysis (89.1%). The highest
estimated risk score value was 0.73, while the value of the 95th percentile was 0.59. 409
participants were classified on or above this cut-off point in the very-high-risk group for
unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes. Profiles, ranked on the top
10 ranking places according to frequency are presented in Table 1.
Insufficient physical activity
The highest odds ratios were observed in: women, aged 25-29, adults with lowest education
level (uncompleted primary school), administrative/intellectual workers and job seekers,
people self-classified in lowest social class, those living in urban communities, and those
living in Central Slovenia.
The highest estimated risk score value was 0.38, while the value of the 95th percentile
was 0.28. 341 participants were classified on or above this cut-off point in the very-high-risk
group for insufficient physical activity. Profiles, ranked on the top 11 ranking places (the
profiles on 10th and 11th place had the same frequency and both had to be considered) according
to frequency are presented in Table 2. Discussion on using the survey results as a tool in planning
public health interventions
With the above-described methodology we succeeded to identify population groups at
highest risk for two unhealthy behaviours related to chronic non-communicable diseases:
• In unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes the worst situation
was observed in Eastern Slovenia. This was expected as on general the unhealthiest
traditional lifestyle from the nutritional point of view was seen to be in Eastern, and the
healthiest in Western Slovenia (40). This thesis was confirmed by the basic results on
elements of unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes as well.
• Healthy nutrition habits e.g. consumption of sea food and olive oil were more expressed
in Western Slovenia, while unhealthy nutrition habits e.g. consumption of lard, fried
food, or sweet soft drinks were most expressed in the most eastern part (47). The results
indicated that from the PH point of view in unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to
obesity and diabetes it was essential to start to intervene in Eastern Slovenia (41). 171 7

central • In insufficient physical activity there were many problems with interpretation of
the results. We do strongly believe that this was the obvious consequence of
the questionnaire used (41). A short last-7-days self-administered format of
IPAQ is designed to observe at the same time vigorous and moderate physical 172 activity, and walking of different sources (leisure time activities, housekeeping
work, physical activity at the work-place, and transportation physical activity)
(46). With regards to the impact of regular and sufficiently intensive physical
activity on human health this inevitably means mixed-information data, which
are less applicable for such types of observations. Despite significant amounts
of energy could be spent in some of the considered types/modes of activity, not
all kinds of physical activity are equally healthy - often they could be even
unhealthy. Vigorous physical activity in compulsory positions of the body for a
longer time periods, as it is the case in heavy physical workers in industry and
rural economy, could be extremely unhealthy while periodical vigorous
physical activity during the leisure time could constitute both physical and
psychological relaxation and is obviously healthy. From the viewpoint solely
to the daily expenditure of energy, it is understandable that the situation with
regular physical activity was shown as it is the best in Eastern Slovenia, because
the economy there is largely rural (47,48). On the contrary, another more indepth survey, CINDI Risk Factors and Process Evaluation 2002/2003 survey,
which comprised also some elements of health examination survey (and not
only health interview survey), in cooperation with a multisectorial and
multidisciplinary research project “Physical activity for health”, showed that
the prevalence of practicing regular leisure-time physical activity was the lowest
in Eastern Slovenia, in rural environments, and in hard workers in rural
economy (49). This indicated again that it was the priority to start with
intervention programmes in the same part of the country with very similar
population profiles as in nutrition, related to obesity and diabetes. On the basis
of the results presented we can conclude that in view of future research on the
impact of physical activity on health the part on physical activity in the CINDI
Health Monitor questionnaire at the international level has to be reassessed as
a lot of countries have already experienced similar problems with the same set
of questions (50). Also we should try to assess the physical activity patterns of
different population groups in the past as health condition in the present is
mainly influenced by physical activity and nutrition habits in the past.
The results of this study, combined with results of other CINDI studies in Slovenia,
confirmed that the situation in unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and
diabetes, and in leisure-time physical activity, is the worst in Eastern Slovenia, especially in
Pomurje. Indirectly, the situation just described could be supported also by other results of
the CHM survey, which showed that the percentage of obese adults (body mass index ≥30.0)
was the highest in the Pomurje (18.8% in contrast to 9.7% in most North-Western region
Nova Gorica) (51).
Changing the traditional lifestyle is one of the most important elements in reducing
the unhealthy behaviours of different kind but extremely difficult, as a process is long lasting,
and tightly bound to the political and economical situation of a country (52). In unfavourable
socio-economic circumstances, the preservation of traditional lifestyle is endorsed and can be
reduced only by strong multisectorial engagement (53). Such conditions currently exist in
Eastern Slovenia (47,54). But despite unfavourable socio-economic circumstances in this
region which could seriously affect the success of the PH interventions, the multisectorial
and multidisciplinary project »Mura«, which started in 2001 in Pomurje, in only a couple of
years offered several extremely positive results (37). It was a project based on intervention 173 programmes based on the pattern of a similar process in Finland, which proved as successful
and effective (31). Its development and implementation was strongly supported by the
results of presented study with its unique methodology as well by the results of
related studies. Numerous multisectorial activities, including primary health prevention
activities, were focused on changing the nutritional and physical activity behaviour of the
population, and have been in process since the end 2001 at the regional (first in the Pomurje
region) (37), as well as at the national level (55). With regard to health prevention activities,
specific socio-economic and cultural circumstances were taken into consideration. On the
level of population groups-at-risk the concrete health promotion and health education
approach was already applied in Beltinci Community in Pomurje region (37), where the
prevalence of many other unhealthy behaviours, beside insufficient leisure-time physical
activity and unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes, is the highest
(40), as well as combination of multiple risky behaviours (56). According to the first analysis
of CINDI Health Monitor survey 2004 (which serves as an efficiency evaluation tool for
activities) it was shown e.g., that prevalence of every day consumption of sweet soft drinks
decreased from 42.9% in 2001 to 29.1% in 2004 (57). The same study showed strong shift to
more healthy behaviour also in use of fat for food preparation. The percent of people using
lard decreased from 30.3% in 2001 to 20.8% in 2004, while the percent of people using olive
oil increased from 7.1% to 15.2%. Unfortunately the comparison in physical activity
behaviour was impossible since in 2004 the long last-7-days self-administered format of
IPAQ was used instead of the short last-7-days self-administered format (46) in order
to distinguish between physical activity from different sources (leisure time activities,
housekeeping work, physical activity at the work-place, and transportation physical
activity).
Conclusions
The results of this study with its unique methodology proved to be powerful tool in
development and implementation of an effective healthy nutrition and physical activity
intervention programmes in Slovenia, as well as in robust assessment of their
effectiveness and efficiency. The information on the prevalence of unhealthy
behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes and insufficient physical activity in
Slovenia, even rough, is very important for high quality health promotion and disease
prevention planning at national or regional levels, since these data provide
information about the comprehensive dimensions of the problem in the community. CINDI and related surveys in developing other
interventions for controlling non-communicable
diseases in adult population
The results of above described study, as well as of the other studies based on CINDI
methodology certainly serve as a basic knowledge of high-quality and applicability in
preparation of PH strategies/activities in Slovenia as well as in evaluation of their efficiency.
Similar methodology as used in analysis and identification of population at risk for
unhealthy behaviours in nutrition related to obesity and diabetes and insufficient physical
activity was used in different other unhealthy behaviours (e.g. frequent perception of stress)
and in some diseases/health states as well (e.g. musculoskeletal diseases and disorders). A
detailed description on CINDI Health Monitor Survey 2001 results is available in an
extensive survey report in Slovene language for fund providers - Ministry of Education and 174 Sports and Ministry of Health of Republic of Slovenia (58). This report is composed of
several in-depth studies on different unhealthy behaviours in Slovene adults. A short version
is available in English language as well (48). Some of in-depth studies basing on CINDI
Health Monitor Survey 2001 data-base were published in domestic or international
periodics, mostly in English language. Additionally, interregional differences in different
health phenomena inside Slovenia were possible to assess since the data enabled this kind of
analyses. Chronologically these studies are as follows:
1. The studies on interregional differences in health (59) and health behaviours
(40),
2. The study on identification of population groups at very high risk for frequent
perception of stress (60) (in English language),
3. The study on identification of population groups with multiple hazardous
health behaviours for cardiovascular diseases (56) (in English language).
4. The study on prevalence of selected musculoskeletal diseases and disorders in
different population groups (61) (in Slovene language).
5. The study on seat-belt use and non-use in adults (62) (in English language),
6. The study on population groups at high risk for poor oral self-care (63) (in
English language), and
7. The study on self-rated health with emphasis on poor self-rated health (64) (in
English language).
Also studies basing on CINDI Risk Factors and Process Evaluation surveys
data serve to the same purpose. They are less numerous but not less important:
1. The study on efficiency of CINDI programme in controlling hypertension in
adult population of Ljubljana demonstrational level in 12-year period (65,66)
(in English language), and
2. The detailed study on prevalence of arterial hypertension, its awareness and
control in the adult population of the Ljubljana area (67) (in English language).
Some other surveys were in the last years performed in Slovenia as well. The results
were published only in Slovene language so far:
1. The study on effectiveness of Beltici “Let’s Live Healthy” project (37) (in
Slovene language).
Results of Beltinci process evaluation surveys showed considerable improvement
not only in health behaviours but also in some of the physiological risk factors. The
study was performed on 158 adults with monitoring/observation of health
indicators on physiological risk factors before and after the intervention
programme was carried out. After only one year of intervention activities,
the average values of systolic blood pressure decreased by 4.7%, diastolic
blood pressure by 4.1%, and blood cholesterol by 4.9%. All differences were
statistically highly significant. This project was already spread from Beltinci
community to other parts of Slovenia as a part of implementation of already
mentioned nation-wide strategy for prevention of cardiovascular diseases (55). The
results are very promising and stimulative and people susceptible to them but
sustainability is under the question as Slovenia is still in the time of transition and the
priorities are changing all the time.
2. A multisectorial and multidisciplinary research project “Physical activity for
health” (49) (in Slovene language). 175 This project was composed of several cross-sectional studies in adult
population as well as in children. It was focused particularly in leisure-time
physical activity. As already mentioned, results of this project showed that the
prevalence of practicing regular leisure-time physical activity was the lowest in
Eastern Slovenia, in rural environments, and in hard workers in rural economy. EXERCISES
Task 1
Carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module. Critically discuss
the characteristics of health surveys with your colleagues. Task 2
From domestic (e.g. Biomedicina Slovenica, and COBISS-Cooperative Online
Bibliographic System of Slovenia in Slovenia), and/or international bibliographic
data-bases (e.g. Medline, PubMed) find out if any other health survey has been
already performed in your country. If yes, then try to find out its characteristics and
how its results were used in health care planning. Task 3
If not, try to find an example from other countries (e.g. FINBALT Health Monitor
Surveys). Task 4
Discuss with your colleagues how the advantage was taken of in these surveys and
make proposals how they could be used more efficiently. REFERENCES

Economic evaluation, public health, decision-making, folic acid, folic
acid food fortification
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should be able to:
• understand the role of economic evaluation in public health
decision-making;
• be aware that types of economic evaluation are more applicable in
some areas of public health than in others;
• understand different possibilities of neural tube defects’ prevention;
• recognize public health benefits and potential adverse effects of
folic acid food fortification;
• understand that the decision for folic acid food fortification, its
implementation, and evaluation is a complex process, where
different professionals need to be fully involved and where
economic evaluation needs to be introduced.
The central problem addressed by the discipline of economics is that of
resource scarcity, and so the purpose of economic evaluation is, in a
very broad sense, to help decision-makers when addressing problems
arising due to the scarcity issue. Therefore, such evidence is generated
with the direct intention of influencing policy. Over recent years, there
have been repeated expressions of concern about the usefulness of
health economic analyses, and responses have tended to centre on
questions of how research by health economists can be made more
useful and accessible to policy makers.
How an economic evaluation can be used in practice, is presented
in the case of folic acid food fortification. After the introduction of
folate deficiency problem and discussion of strengths and weaknesses
of folic acid food fortification, it is demonstrated how an economic
evaluation can add value to decision-making process.
However, it is important to understand that, even if the best
possible economic evaluations were available, they would be only one
element in a complex process of decision-making that is also shaped by
scientific evidence and political feasibility. Address for

PLANNING AND EVALUATING PUBLIC HEALTH
INTERVENTIONS: THE CASE OF FOLIC ACID
FOOD FORTIFICATION
Jerneja Farkaš-Lainščak, Lijana Zaletel-Kragelj THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Decision-making is a crucial element in the field of medicine. The physician has to
determine what is wrong with the patient and recommend treatment, while the patient
has to decide whether or not to seek medical care, and go along with the treatment
recommended by the physician.
Decision-making is vital component of public health as well. Health policy
makers and health insurers have to decide what to promote, what to discourage, and
what to pay for. Together, these decisions determine the quality of health care that is
provided. Therefore, public health and health care policy-makers need a trustworthy
source of evidence on which to build health policy.
World Health Organization (WHO), Regional Office for Europe, brought out
at the Fourth Futures Forum of High-Level Decision-Makers, entitled Tools for
decision-making in public health, which was held in Brussels in 2003 (1), several
important conclusions, among which two could be pointed out as most important
ones:
1. the need for evidence-based decisions and, as a consequence, evidence-based
recommendations, has never been greater, and that
2. the use of evidence enables decision-makers to be transparent and explicit
about the basis for decisions.
At the same time we should be aware that (1):
1. evidence changes with time and the utility of evidence-based recommendations
is therefore time limited;
2. the speed of decision-making does not always allow time for the generation
and use of evidence;
3. evidence-based decisions may not always be acceptable to the public and this
will inevitably be a consideration in taking public-health decisions and in
determining policy;
4. a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of an intervention does not mean that
the intervention is necessarily ineffective; it may be that the research has yet to
be undertaken;
5. interventions known to be successful in improving population health can fail if
the necessary organizational capacity is not made available to ensure their
success. Implementation factors, such as finance, skills and organizational
capacity, are therefore an essential part of the evidence review process. 183 In the frame of WHO, Regional Office for Europe, a body entitled Health
Evidence Network (HEN) was established, aiming at giving rapid access to
independent and reliable health information and evidence (2).
Nowadays, medical, as well as public health decision-making is a rapidly
expanding field that includes different quantitative theoretical tools for modelling
decisions, psychological research on how decisions are actually made, and applied
research on how decision-making can be improved. Economic evaluation is one of
these tools. Economic evaluation as a tool for public health decisionmaking
Health care resources are limited, and where, how and when to allocate them are the
main questions if we want the health care system to be efficient. We all agree that this
issue is extremely complicated. The situation is even more complicated when in this
story public health, especially disease prevention and health promotion, is placed.
Health economic through economic evaluation can give some answers to this set of
questions.
The central problem addressed by the discipline of economics is that of
resource scarcity, and so the purpose of economic evaluation is, in a very broad
sense, to help decision-makers when addressing problems arising due to the
scarcity issue. Therefore, such evidence is generated with the direct intention of
influencing policy. Over recent years, there have been repeated expressions of
concern about the usefulness of health economic analyses, and responses have
tended to centre on questions of how research by health economists can be made
more useful and accessible to policy makers (3,4). The increasing need for
economic evidence to inform policy decisions, but the inevitable limits on the rate
at which such studies can be undertaken and published, has raised questions about
the extent to which the conclusions of a given study undertaken for one specific
context hold true for others. This has also stimulated interest in new methods to
assess quantitatively the extent of variability in results and to make adjustments
across contexts. Recent developments in economic evaluation concerning
public health
In recent years, there have been some important developments in economic evaluation
concerning public health.
1. The first important development has been its increasing prominence in public
health decision-making. Although there is continued uncertainty about the role
of economic evaluation studies in decision-making at the level of individual
hospitals and health authorities (3), a number of health care systems are now
using economic evaluation to make system-level decisions about which
interventions to fund from collective resources (4).
Economic evidence has been used for some years in Australia and
Canada to establish whether new pharmaceuticals represent a cost-effective
use of the resources available to the public health care system (5,6). More
recently, a number of European countries have developed an economic
dimension to the regulation of health care technologies, including Portugal, 184 Sweden and Finland (7). Even in the USA, the need to ensure efficient use of
collective health care resources has led some health maintenance organisations
to use formal economic criteria in decision-making about which interventions
will cover (8).
2. The second development is the emergence of new economic evaluation
methods in particular areas. These include alternative approaches to handling
uncertainty in the context of studies based on patient-level data (e.g.
randomised trials), and in decision models; and preference-based measures of
health status which link data on patients’ health states, as collected in trials and
similar studies, with the public’s health state preferences to facilitate estimates
of QALYs (7). There remain, however, a number of important sources of
controversy in the field, for example, the role and methods of productivity cost
estimation and how to reflect equity considerations in economic evaluation (9).
One area of methodology on which much has been written but in which few
new methods have emerged relates to the generalisability of economic
evaluation (9).
The proposal put forward is that the objective of health care services should be to
maximise population health benefits (3). For many this appears not to be a highly
controversial suggestion and, in broad terms, receives support from policy makers and
the public more generally (10). The difficulties and disputes arise primarily around
attempts to measure health. How to make valuation of health in economic analyses?
Over the course of the last 20 years or so, the subdiscipline of health economics has
had a methodological focus on the measurement and valuation of health. The result
is a measure of health that can be operationalised for use in policy making, i.e. the
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) or quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) (10).
The decision rule, therefore, for normative health economic analyses, is to advocate
investment in those technologies that produce the largest QALY gains for a given
level of cost. In order to inform such decisions, normative analyses tend to provide
results in the form of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), net-benefit
statistics and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC):
1. the ICER reports the ratio of additional costs to additional health effects
associated with a new intervention (e.g. cost per QALY gained);
2. the net-benefit statistic expresses the additional health effects in monetary
units by using an estimate of the “maximum willingness to pay” per unit of
health gain, where available;
3. the CEAC plots the probability that the intervention in question is costeffective against threshold values to define cost-effectiveness (11). The role of economic analyses in public health decisions
Yet while economic evaluation is often of little help in deciding whether to
undertake an intervention in the first place, it has rather more potential in helping to
decide which of a series of options should be chosen to achieve a specified goal, by
means of cost-effectiveness analysis. While recognizing the potential benefits of
cost-effectiveness analysis, it should also be noted that it is more applicable in some 185 areas of public health than in others (11). For instance, secondary prevention
initiatives like screening, for example, have been subject to numerous costeffectiveness analyses, to help choose between different methods of screening or
target groups. However primary prevention has been subject to rather less economic
evaluation to date, in part due to the difficulties of measuring costs and effects and
determining causation.
Recent review by Allin and colleagues describes the models of public health
decision-making in eight countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, and Canada. It has been written to inform the
debate on future policy options and it represents an initial attempt to map prioritysetting in public health (12). This investigation revealed that none of the eight
countries has explicit, systematic procedures for making decisions affecting public
health or setting priorities among different public health interventions. The
methodology used for making decisions and setting priorities in public health across
the eight countries is consistently related to population health status,
epidemiological data, burden of disease and, often, scope for prevention. Also
important in this process are political negotiations, pressure from interest groups
and informal processes. In addition to the other methods, Sweden bases decisions
on an “ethical framework” encompassing human dignity, need and solidarity.
Likewise, France highlights the importance of ensuring that decisions fit with
societal values. Australia and the Netherlands increasingly are utilizing economic
evaluation and evidence of interventions’ effectiveness to guide decision-making.
In this way, they are progressing more rapidly towards creating an evidence-based
policy environment (12).
However, it is important to understand that, even if the best possible
economic evaluations were available, they would be only one element in a complex
process of decision-making that is also shaped by scientific evidence and political
feasibility. Like every analytical tool, also economic analysis has its limitations.
And not at the end, also the public health decisions should (to the reasonable extent)
keep in touch with society’s health values (13,14). Comprehensive example would
be a case of folic acid food fortification. CASE STUDY: CASE OF FOLIC ACID FOOD
FORTIFICATION AS AN EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH
DECISION-MAKING
Prevention of neural tube defects
Neural tube defects (NTD) are a group of heterogenous and complex congenital
anomalies of the central nervous system resulting from failure of normal neural
tube closure between the third and fourth week of embryonic development (15).
Each year approximately 4500 pregnancies in the European Union result in a
livebirth, stillbirth or termination of pregnancy of an infant affected by NTD,
mainly spina bifida and anencephaly (16). All infants with anencephaly are
stillborn or die shortly after birth, whereas many infants with spina bifida have
substantially enhanced survival rate thanks to recent improvements in medical
and surgical management. However, these individuals continue to be at increased
risk for morbidity and mortality throughout their life as they face severe, life-long
disabilities and are at risk for psychosocial maladjustment. Their medical 186 problems may result from the neurologic defect itself or from its repair (e.g.,
paralysis, hydrocephalus, endocrine abnormalities, deformations of the limbs and
spine, bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction, and learning disabilities) (17).
In addition to the emotional cost of spina bifida, the estimated monetary
cost is staggering. In the United States alone, the total cost of spina bifida over a
lifetime (the direct costs of medical, developmental, and educational services and
the indirect costs associated with morbidity and mortality, in 1992 dollars) for
affected infants born in 1988 was almost $500 million, or $294,000 for each
infant (18). Recently, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published data
about average cost of caring for a child born with spina bifida for life, which is
about $636,000 (19).
NTD develop within the first few weeks of embryogenesis, at a time before
many women know that they are pregnant. Studies of Smithells and colleagues
(20), confirmed by many other studies and randomized clinical trials by the early
1990’s (21,22), showed that supplements containing folic acid, when consumed
around the time of conception and early in pregnancy, can reduce NTD by an
estimated 70% or more. It is generally accepted that prevention can be obtained at
a dose corresponding to 400 µg of folic acid per day. Three different strategies are
available to reach the daily dose; women may consume a diet rich in folate, they
may take supplements with folic acid, or consume foods fortified with folic acid.
Because folic acid is inexpensive, safe, and easy to use, many professional
organizations and some governmental agencies promote the use of folic acid
supplements to prevent NTD (23). The format of such recommendations varies,
but they typically include statements that women should eat a healthy diet and
take folic acid supplements when planning a pregnancy or throughout
childbearing age. In a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Chile,
and South Africa, recommendations to consume folic acid are integrated with a
policy of widespread fortification of flour to ensure that the entire population
receives at least a small additional amount of folic acid regardless of access to
supplements (23).
A crucial question is how effective are recommendations alone, in the
absence of fortification. A study was conducted by the EUROCAT Working
Group to review progress in the last decade in European countries in terms of
developing and implementing public health policies to raise periconceptional
folate status, and analyze data on the prevalence of NTD to determine the extent
to which NTD have been prevented up to the year 2002 (16). Representatives
from 17 countries participating in EUROCAT provided information about policy,
health education campaigns and surveys of folic acid supplement uptake in their
country. Surveys showed that in all countries, a minority of women were taking
supplements during the entire advised periconceptional period, with
supplementation rates varying from 5% to 46% between countries. The situation
regarding lack or low uptake of supplementation advice is reflected in the lack of
a clear decline in the prevalence of NTD across Europe. Authors concluded that
the potential for preventing NTD by periconceptional folic acid supplementation
is still far from being fulfilled in Europe (16). The most likely possibility is that
recommendations were not implemented to the point of inducing a sustained
change in behavior in a sufficiently large proportion of women to cause
measurable effects (23). Whereas any improvement in primary prevention is 187 desirable and should be promoted, a detectable change in the population requires
a major shift in the proportion of women consuming adequate amounts of folic
acid. It is unclear how successful recommendations alone will be in achieving this
goal, given the influence of cultural, social, and economic factors such as the
acceptability, availability, and cost of daily supplements. In general, use of
supplements tends to follow economic and educational lines, so targeting the
entire population through recommendations on supplementation alone may not be
practical (23). Only a public health policy including folic acid fortification of
staple foods is likely to avoid widening socio-economic inequalities in NTD
prevalence and result in large scale prevention of NTD (23,24).
In view of the findings that there has been a lack of substantial decline in
NTD prevalence in Europe since 1991, and even countries which have pursued
supplementation policies relatively actively have found a limited preventive
impact, EUROCAT has issued the following recommendations:
1. Countries should review their policies regarding folic acid fortification and
supplementation, taking account of WHO Europe recommendations.
2. European countries could prevent most neural tube defects in planned
pregnancies by putting in place an official policy recommending
periconceptional folic acid supplementation and taking steps to ensure that
the population are aware of the benefits of supplementation and the
importance of starting supplementation before conception.
3. As many pregnancies are unplanned, European countries could achieve
more effective prevention of neural tube defects by additionally
introducing fortification of a staple food with folic acid. The particular
objectives of this policy would be preventing neural tube defects among
women who do not plan their pregnancy, and reducing socio-economic
inequalities in neural tube defect prevalence.
4. Health effects of supplementation and fortification should be monitored,
and policies should be reviewed periodically in light of the findings.
5. The European population should be covered by high quality congenital
malformation registers which collect information about affected
pregnancies (live births, stillbirths and terminations for fetal abnormality).
One important use for the information would be to assess the effect of folic
acid supplementation and fortification on NTD rates as well as rates of
other congenital malformations (16). Folic acid food fortification – pro et contra
In this context, fortification of flour represents an additional opportunity to
deliver some folic acid to nearly the entire population, across social and economic
barriers. Where dietary and food processing conditions are favorable, fortification
can be effective quickly and at low cost (24). In countries that have fortified
flour, blood folate concentrations have risen quickly, and although the reductions
in incidence were not as large as that achievable through supplementation, such
reduction occurred soon after fortification was implemented (25,26).
In 1992, the United States Public Health Service issued a recommendation
that all women of childbearing age should consume 400 µg of folic acid per day
to reduce the risk of having an infant with an NTD (27). The Institute of Medicine 188 made a similar recommendation in 1998 suggesting that women of childbearing
age should consume 400 µg of folic acid per day from fortified foods,
supplements, or both, in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet
(28). In 1993, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Folic Acid
Subcommittee recommended that folic acid fortification be implemented to
ensure that 90% of women of childbearing age consume 400 µg folate daily or
folic acid from all sources, but the FDA did not implement fortification at the
level required to achieve this because of safety considerations (29). The FDA
began requiring folic acid fortification of enriched cereal-grain products in 1998
at a level (140 µg /100 g) that was estimated to provide an average person
approximately 100 µg additional folic acid daily (30). On November 11, 1998,
fortification with folic acid of all types of white flour, enriched pasta, and
cornmeal became mandatory in Canada with the goal to increase by
approximately 30 to 70% the average intake of folic acid among women of
childbearing age without posing a risk to the general public (25). In any case,
average serum folate concentrations increased significantly after the
implementation of folic acid fortification, and the prevalence of NTD in the
United States in 2000 was 26% lower than that before folic acid fortification (26).
In Canada, a 46–48% decrease in NTD was seen to coincide with folic acid food
fortification (25).
Although the primary goal of folic acid fortification is to reduce the
occurrence of NTD in women of reproductive age, the potential benefit to the
general population in reducing the risk of chronic disease via homocysteine
lowering is also highly relevant (31). Recently published population-based study
suggests that the temporal decline in stroke-related mortality in the United States
and Canada coincided with the introduction of folic acid fortification (32). More
importantly, a meta-analysis of clinical trials just published shows that
supplementation with folic acid reduced the risk of stroke by 18% overall, by
29% in trials with a treatment duration of less than 36 months, and by 25% in
those trials in subjects with no history of stroke which strongly suggests that
either folic acid or homocysteine lowering plays a role in the primary prevention
of stroke (33).
Population-based exposure to folic acid through fortification, however, is
controversial because of concerns about potential adverse effects on health. The
most widely documented concern is the possibility that high-dose folic acid may
mask the diagnosis and thereby delay the treatment of vitamin B-12 deficiency in
older adults (34). In addition, there is some concern that high-dose folic acid may
promote the development of colorectal cancer if precancerous lesions or
neoplasms are already established in the mucosa (35). Thus, mandatory
fortification with folic acid remains virtually nonexistent in Europe. Furthermore,
although many European countries allow the addition of nutrients to foods on a
voluntary basis (ie, at the manufacturer’s discretion), others prohibit fortification
of any kind. Thus, national fortification policy varies considerably throughout the
European Union (23). The European Commission, however, is aiming in the near
future to regulate in its member states the minimum and maximum amounts of
vitamins and minerals allowed to be added to foodstuffs (36). 189 Economic evaluation of folic acid food fortification
Economic evaluation plays an important role in translating research findings into
practice and policy. Economic evaluations can be ex-ante, conducted before the
adoption of a policy on the basis of results from pilot studies and theoretical
assumptions, or ex-post, carried out after implementation using information on
observed outcomes.
Before the adoption of fortification in United States, 3 independent
economic evaluations concluded that folic acid fortification at 140 µg of folic acid
per 100 g of cereal grain product would yield net economic benefits or cost savings
(37-39). This conclusion was confirmed and strengthened by postfortification
analysis where Grosse and colleagues calculated the economic impact of
fortification using both cost–benefit and cost-effectiveness analytic techniques on
the basis of prefortification and postfortification epidemiological data (40). They
believe that folic acid fortification has proven to be a public health success in the
United States and Canada, although an economic evaluation of fortification in
Canada has yet to be conducted. The net benefit and cost savings surpass estimates
prepared before fortification. By any measure, folic acid fortification provides a
remarkable return on investment. Other industrialized countries could benefit by
following the lead of the United States and Canada in adopting folic acid
fortification of cereal-grain products (40). Furthermore, the benefits of fortification
are not restricted to higher-income countries; wheat flour folic acid fortification
program in Chile showed an increase in blood folate levels and a 40% decrease in
the risk of NTD (41). Llanos and colleagues conducted ex-post economic
evaluation, findings of which strongly support the continuation of fortification of
wheat flour with folic acid in Chile. Furthermore, these findings serve as important
evidence for policy makers from other countries to consider the implementation of
folic acid fortification of cereal grain products (42).
Due to uncertain risks, the Dutch Health Council advised the government
against fortifying food with folic acid, in 2000 (43). Their conclusions were based
on uncertain risk suggested above. In particular, the elderly population would be
at risk for excess intake of folic acid, which was considered to be highly
undesirable. Jentink and colleagues produced estimations of the costs, savings,
health gains, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility for bulk food fortification with
140 µg folic acid per 100 g flour (43). Estimations were conducted in a base case
analysis (presenting the most likely situation) and in sensitivity analysis around
the base case assumptions. They applied the societal perspective for economic
analysis, which included the whole spectrum of direct, indirect, medical and nonmedical costs. Their model suggested that folic acid fortification of bulk food to
prevent cases of NTD might be a cost-saving intervention in the Netherlands as
well (43). EXERCISES
Task 1
Individually, carefully read the theoretical part of this module and recommended
readings. 190 Task 2
Make two groups for discussion using method “pro et contra”. The group No.1
prepares arguments for “pros”, and the group No.2 for “contras”. Perform the “pro
et contra” discussion in a limited time. Task 3
Fortification of food with folic acid has the potential to reach a large proportion of
the population and increase the level of folate consumed. Some governments in
Europe are now seriously considering folic acid food fortification. What
information would you need to support this public health policy in your own
country? Make a short written report, and present it to your colleagues. Task 4
Discuss the fortification of food with folic acid issue in a plenary session. REFERENCES

Satisfaction, needs, patients’ experiences, inpatient hospital care.
Keywords
Learning objectives After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• be aware of methods for patients' satisfaction and expectations
of hospital care assessment;
• recognise the particular dimensions of quality of care;
• increase knowledge of different aspects of patient satisfaction
and experiences of hospital care;
• differentiate the aspects of patient satisfaction with hospital
health services;
• identified problems related to patients' experiences with
hospital care supply;
• improve the knowledge and understanding of patient needs
and expectations of inpatient hospital care as well as the
necessity of applying for such investigations.
Abstract
There is an increasing interest in eliciting feedback from patients
to highlight aspects of care that need improvement and to monitor
performance and quality of care. Hospitals increasingly need to
adopt a patient-centred attitude.
Traditionally, assessments have ignored the reports of patients in
preference to technical and physiological reports of outcome.
Healthcare systems have sought to achieve a balance in services
that offer not only clinically effective and evidence based care, but
which are also judged by patients as acceptable and beneficial.
Questionnaires that ask patients to rate their care in terms of how
satisfied they are tend to elicit very positive ratings, which are not
sensitive to problems with the specific processes that affect the
quality of care delivery.
A more valid approach is to ask patients to report in detail on their 195 Teaching methods

EXPECTATIONS OF HOSPITAL CARE: THE CASE
OF BULGARIA
Petya Trendafilova, Kiril Kirilov THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
Patients' Satisfaction and Experiences of Hospital Care
Background
Evaluation of healthcare provision is essential in the ongoing assessment and
consequent quality improvement of medical services. Traditionally, assessments have
ignored the reports of patients in preference to technical and physiological reports of
outcome. More recently, however, healthcare systems have sought to achieve a
balance in services that offer not only clinically effective and evidence based care, but
which are also judged by patients as acceptable and beneficial (1).
Health care which improves health only in some limited technical sense, but
does not improve the quality or length of life, is not likely to be viewed as beneficial
by patients (2).
Governments and regulatory authorities in some countries now require
hospitals to organize patient surveys at regular intervals.
Interest has therefore grown not only in the assessment of treatment interventions by
patients, but in the systematic evaluation of the delivery of that care (3). Most
significantly, attempts have been made to determine the features of patient care that
are likely to influence patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction is not a clearly defined
concept, although most typically it appears to represent attitudes to care or aspects of
care (4).
While numerous questionnaires have been developed which ask people to rate
aspects of care, such an approach has limitations. Attitudes to services do not tell us
very much about the nature of those services. Surveys of patient satisfaction tend to
elicit very positive ratings which are not sensitive to specific problems in the quality
of care delivery. It has been argued that questionnaires should attempt to measure
patients’ experiences of their care, and then determine how such experiences are
related to satisfaction (5).
Questionnaires that ask patients to rate their care in terms of how satisfied they
are tend to elicit very positive ratings, which are not sensitive to problems with the
specific processes that affect the quality of care delivery (6).
A more valid approach is to ask patients to report in detail on their experiences
by asking them specific questions about whether or not certain processes and events
occurred during the course of a specific episode of care. This type of questionnaire
can provide results that can be easily interpreted and acted upon (5).
The results of a round of studies show that more meaningful information is
gained when patients are asked to report on specific aspects of their experience of
care. It has been suggested that age and health status are major influences on patient
satisfaction (3). Authors from the Picker Institute of Oxford have published series of
papers which show that age is an important factor in reported satisfaction, but self- 197 reported health status was not. However, the most important determinants, as
indicated by the regression models, appear to be physical comfort, emotional support,
and respect for patient preferences (7).
The aim of patients’ satisfaction reports is to allow insurees/patients/ on one
hand and physicians and medical personnel, on the other hand, to make an informed
choice of hospitals based on quality indicators.
Hence over the past decade there has been increasing realization of the need to
take into account patient reports of their hospital experiences in the development of
action plans for improvement of services, safety and care provided. It is suggested
that efforts to improve health care will be wasted unless they reflect what patients
want from the service (8).
A variety of methods have therefore been employed to assess the patients'
preferences for care, evaluations of what occurred, or factual reports of care.
Examples are questionnaires to assess patients' needs and surveys among patients to
provide feedback to care providers or the public (9,10).
Development of newer tools and techniques to assess patient opinion is an
emerging trend around the globe highlighting the need for providers of hospital care
to assess and improve the quality of care they offer, and to continue expanding their
use of questionnaires and surveys (11). Figure 1. Proposed conceptual framework for HCQI Project. Source: Kelley E, Hurst J.
OECD Health Working Papers. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2006)3) (12). 198 Patients' Needs
A number of countries have asked for the specification of the conceptual framework
which should guide the development of an international set of health care quality
indicators at the OECD.
The framework below presents a visual summary of the dimensions of health
care performance including: quality, access, cost, efficiency and equity. It also
presents a visual picture of factors related to, but distinct from, health system
performance, such as: health system design, policy and context; non-health care
determinants of health and overall levels of health. It highlights the particular
dimensions of quality of care that will be the focus on the HCQI Project namely:
effectiveness, safety and responsiveness (patient centeredness) (12). CASE STUDY
The Case of Bulgaria
Bulgarian hospitals must adopt appropriate market-based approaches in order to
survive and serve to the public health needs.
National Health Insurance Fund is a typical example for imperfect provider
market in Bulgaria. Monopoly is at the opposite extreme of the competitive spectrum
from perfect competition. In a monopolistic market, like obligatory health insurance
in Bulgaria, there is a single provider who, because of a lack of competition from
several other providers, can influence price. Such a situation is allocatively
inefficient.
Bulgarian hospitals in the environment of health insurance system tend to be
more efficient due to financial constraints, than a few years ago in the environment of
governmental budgetary financing. Still there is a recognition that the delivery of
health care is ineffective and inefficient and that these unpleasant outcomes are a
product of the perverse incentives inherent of the ex health care system. Patients' Experiences of Hospital Care in Bulgaria
A study is required to survey patients' opinions of general aspects of inpatient care
provided to them during admission. Such a study becomes even more important in
light of the limited budget allocation to the health sector and the inability of many
patients to afford expensive treatment modalities. Hence there is further need to
prioritize spending and this study hopes to fill this void by production of data that can
help managers and doctors to identify and address unsatisfactory factors in the care
they provide (13).
Building on extensive qualitative research to determine which aspects of care
are important to patients, we used standardized instrument to measure the quality of
care in relation to problems identified as a result of inpatient stay in hospital in
Bulgaria.
The purpose of this study was to measure patients’ experiences of hospital care
in Bulgaria and to identify existing problems with health services supply and inpatient 199 stay. The study design could be used to make comparisons between different hospitals
within the country or abroad and for monitoring trends over time.
A questionnaire of items is used developed for use in in-patient surveys
undertaken by the Picker Institute of Europe for the purposes of assessing the quality
of care. PPE - 15 became an important tool in the processes of monitoring and
improving quality of health care services. Each item in the questionnaire is coded for
statistical analysis as a dichotomous ‘problem score’, indicating the presence or
absence of a problem. A problem is defined as an aspect of health care that could, in
the eyes of the patient, be improved upon.
A total of 1316 patients (response rate: 71.01 %) filled the questionnaire as a
part of a pilot study. Patients’ experiences in Bulgaria were at a lower level
comparable to European surveys for most aspects of hospital care.

The results of this study have shown that a significant majority of patients reported
they were not told of the side effects of medications given to them (61.3 %). 200 The percentage of patients who never received clear answers to their questions from
nurses was pretty high (56.7 %), comparing to the studies undertaken in other
European countries where this percentage was significantly lower. The explanation
of that result can be attributed in part to a lack of knowledge of the nurses or the
fact that patients may be asking questions from them that should normally be
addressed to doctors.
The study shows that compared to developed countries, a higher number of
patients had to wait too long after pressing the call bell before a nurse attended to
them.
6.2 % of the patients received conflicting information from the staff while in
other studies this percentage is 5.3 %.
The percentage of patients who wanted greater involvement in their care was
much higher (35.3 %) than the percentage in the western countries.
31.0 % of the patients felt that their families were not given enough opportunity to
talk to the doctors.
The results from our study show that 46.6 % of the patients did not find
easily anyone in the staff to talk to about their worries and fears while 32.7 % didn’t
discuss anxieties or fears with doctors.
More than one third felt that the amount of information provided was not
enough. This is despite the fact that all patients are required to sign an informed
consent form before all the procedure.
Too high is the percentage of people that reported persistent pain and they
thought that the staff didn’t do enough to control their pain (27.2 %). Conclusions
PPE - 15 provides basic information and other optional questions can be added;
scores are easy to interpret and can be action upon. It consists of a minimum dataset
of issues that are important to patients.
The patients’ experiences presented here indicate that many patients with
inpatient hospital stay in Bulgaria did not receive optimal care.
Applications of this survey instrument could be used to monitor these basic
aspects of hospital care over time, which are expected to lead to a quality
improvement of hospital care in Bulgaria.
Patients should be provided with more information during their stay at
hospitals. Doctors as well as nurses need to improve their communication with
patients. The health care team should provide more emotional support to patients so
that they get at least someone in the staff with whom they can talk about their
concerns.
The staff should make sure that they explain all the risks and benefits to
patients and patiently listen and answer their questions before getting the informed
consent form signed for every procedure.
Finally, there has to be much more efforts for pain control in order to provide
better health services for patients and to receive feedback about their views on the
care provided.
In conclusion, the PPE – 15 represents a step forward in the measurement of
patient experience enabling the comparison of hospital performance and the
establishment of national and international benchmarks. 201 Many sections of patient care require considerable improvement in order to
provide better quality of health care services in Bulgaria compared to other
European countries.
Subjective health status measures are used to assess the impact of medicine
on the well-being of patients.
Feedback on patients’ experiences of health care is sought in order to
determine priorities for quality improvement.
Measurement of patients’ experiences is also seen as an important component
of performance assessment. EXERCISE

Economics, assessment, management, ageing
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• know the definition and characteristics of demographic ageing and
its economic consequences;
• be familiar with some approaches of economic assessment of
ageing;
• be familiar with ageing and employment policies.
Demographic, social and economic status of Bulgarian third age
population is one of the less favourable among the EU member states.
Population in Bulgaria decreased from 8 948 649 in 1985 to 7 640 000
in 2007 with stable reduction of growing generation, standstill of atlabour-age persons and increase of the above-labour-age population.
Major problem is the low employment level of ageing population,
unsatisfactory health care services and unsupportive pensioning
system. Elder people find themselves in completely new economic and
social situation, which together with the usual changes create
complexes of vulnerability, inability to manage daily tasks and health
problems.
The training aims at improvement of the competencies of students,
professionals and aged people, their skills to manage the economic
reality, enhance their health culture and diminish their exposure to
diseases.
Teaching methods: lectures, exercises, round table discussions,
seminars. The training will be ended with an individual thesis on a
problem of ageing.
Proportions within work under teacher supervision - 75%; individual

PROCESS OF AGEING IN BULGARIA
Jasmine Pavlova THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Seventeen years ago in the Republic of Bulgaria has started an accession from
centralized planning to market oriented economy and one year yet Bulgaria is a full
member of the European Union. The current Bulgarian economy can be described
following some specific operational market relations: completed structural changes,
achieved macroeconomic stability, availability of market institutions in all spheres of
the public life. The consequences of these changes have substantial economic and
social dimensions.
The beginning of twenty-first century was marked with successes and
difficulties for the Bulgarian society. The basis laid in the end of the last century
develops at a good pace (during the last 3-4 years Bulgaria rated about 6% growth of
the gross domestic product (GDP)). According to the official data, the unemployment
dropped to 6-7%, but yet its distribution by regions remained still uneven. The
country is affiliate of the European Union one year yet. In order to let Bulgarians feel
themselves Europeans not only de jure, but also de facto, it is necessary to follow a
sustainable overtaking development of the economy, which by the means of the
figures means maintenance of not less than 6-7% of GDP for about 20 year. The
condition of the population, though, provokes serious anxiety and raises multiple
problems to be solved.
Bulgaria is not an exception from the other European countries when
comparing the negative phenomena in the demographic development of the
population. In distinction to them, these tendencies are much more extreme and of
much stronger impact to the social systems.
Therefore it was considered that training of students, health and social
professionals as well as aged people in managing the new economic and social life
realities, and acquaintance with the natural psychosomatic changes of age advancing
is of urgent importance.
Corresponding to training targets and problematic areas, the following
programme themes were selected:
− Information on specific diseases of third age;
− Possibilities for protection and reduction of disease complications;
− Stressogenic factors in the third age;
− Motor regime and healthy nutrition;
− Adaptation of behaviour based on the living and social experience;
− Demographic ageing and economic consequences;
− Retirement, pensioning systems. European experience;
− Application of market approaches for improvement of the third age people’s
living standard;
− Basic knowledge in information and computer technologies. 205 Demographic aging in Bulgaria
Bulgaria is not an exception from the other European countries when it concerns the
processes of demographic development of the population. Differing from the other
EU countries, processes here are much more extreme and with much higher impact on
the social systems.
The study of population goes back quite a long way. After the Liberation in
1878 the Third Bulgarian State was established and the interest to the population
increased due to the necessity of statistical data, labour force and overall development
of the new country. Factors and reasons, determining the growth of the population in
Bulgaria, are complex: biological, social, economic, ethic and others.
In 1880 according to the census of the population in Bulgarian Principality
there were 2007919 people and in 1884 in Eastern Rumelia there were 942680. After
the Union of Eastern Rumelia with the Bulgarian Principality in 1885 the population
exceeded 3 millions.
The peak of the growth of Bulgarian population was in 1985 when it reaches
nearly 9 millions people. After this it begins to decrease due to many factors.
Analyzing the data of Table 1 we can mention some important tendencies:
decreasing of total population and people under labour age and increasing of
townspeople and aged and old population in the country. The migration from villages
to towns is a global process in European countries and Bulgaria is not an exception.
Towns offer jobs and higher standard of life that is why they attract many people,
mostly young generations. Gradually villages become depopulated, the agriculture
falls into a crisis because of the lack of young labour force (1,2,3,4).

Sources: NSI - 2007, UN, Population Division, DESA, According to prognosis data The ageing of population is seen as one of the major challenges to the
Bulgarian society and economy. In the beginning of 20-th century people under
labour age were 42.9%, those over labour age were 9.8%. The birth-rate was 42.2‰,
the general mortality rate – 22.5‰, the children mortality - 200‰. The natality in
Bulgaria was high till 1926 and it determined the high level of natural growth. The 206 country has a model of “Young population” for a period of nearly fifty years. After
1926 the decrease of natality changes constantly the demographic structure of the
population. The changes in correlations between groups of people over and under
labour age show that the demographic ageing of the population begins about 19101920. This tendency was manifested continuously until 1965, when the relative share
of old people was 16.1. Bulgaria converts into the group of countries with
demographic model “old population”. The last year’s data show decreasing of natality
and increasing of mortality.
The natural growth is negative. It is the greatest demographic fall in Bulgaria
except periods of Balkan and First World Wars. These processes intensify the
deformations in age structure of the population and decrease the life and labour
potential of the country.
Bulgaria relatively quickly passes the four stages of the demographic
transition. The first period until 1924 is characterized with high levels of natality and
mortality. The generations change each other very rapidly. The middle duration of life
was 42-45 years (1900-1905)! The second period comprehends years 1924-1939. The
natural growth of the population was reduced considerably, more than twice (Table
2).

-5.1 This stage was interrupted by the Second World War. The natality was 22‰,
the mortality - 13‰. After 1950 the second stage of the demographic transition
continued till the middle of the 60s when the natality reached 15‰, the mortality –
8‰ and the natural growth - 7‰. The third stage of the demographic transition begins
in the end of the seventh and the first half of the eighth decade. In 1985 the natality
reached 13.3‰, the mortality – 12‰, the natural growth – 1.3‰. In the end of this
period the net-coefficient for reproduction of the population decreases less than 1.
This is a sign for the beginning of the fourth stage of the demographic transition: the
indexes of natality and mortality approximated and the natural growth of the
population in 1990 was – 0.4‰ already.
We have to note that this transition proceeded at accelerated rates in Bulgaria,
during 50-60 years, while this process continued more than a century in European
countries. From the beginning of 1990 Bulgaria felt in a condition of depopulation.
The average life expectancy had increased from 51.75 years (male – 50.98;
female – 52.56) in 1935-1939 to 72.60 years (male – 69.10; female – 76, 30) (1,4,5).
Very often the notion “old population” is connected to long-life of the nation.
The publication of statistic for long-livers in Bulgaria creates an idea that the country 207 is a one with old population. But the demographic ageing is not identical with the
category “long-life”. It measures the bio-social stability of the population in certain
groups. The phenomenon “long-life” is typical for nations with “young population”
model and inversely, there are a few long-livers in regions with old population.
According to the classic rule higher longevity is observed in countries and
regions with high percentage of old people. We couldn’t confirm this. In Bulgaria in
regions with old population the number of long-livers is considerably smaller than
this one in regions with younger population. In the case of Bulgaria there is a direct
correlation between the number of long-livers and the high birth-rate. Such are
districts of Smolian, Kardjali and Blagoevgrad (St. Vizev, A. Hadjihristev).
The correlation between sexes is: from 961 female/1000 male (1900) to 1051
female/1000 male (2000). According to the UN prognoses in 2025 the inequity will
increase: 1095 female/1000 male. In a large part, the greater number of women is due
to the higher mortality and higher migration among men.
In the past the age structure of Bulgarian population was progressive, that is to
say the age pyramid was with a large foundation and little by little narrowed,
increasing the age. Later the basis of the pyramid was equal to the middle part.
Nowadays the deformation continues as it is shown in the figure 1 (Age
pyramid of Bulgarian population 1990-2020). The age structure of the Bulgarian
population is of regressive type, which is also influenced by the emigration of young
people mainly. The foundation of the pyramid narrows, on contrary its middle and
upper part extend (4,6). Development of the Bulgarian economy after 1990
The period 1990-1997 is specified with a transition from planned and centralized to
market economy, where the basis of the free competition among economic entities is
laid , and the prices of goods and services are being defined from the market’s
demand and offering. This period of transition was hampered by the inherited
negatives of the economic, cultural and political life. As a result, and comparing to
the other countries of the Eastern Europe, the country slowed down the processes of
privatization and reimbursement of lands and, respectively its integration in NATO
and the EU.
During the period about 4000 entities were privatized, some 1500 before 1995.
A main part of the privatized subjects is municipal property as the state property
represents only 600. At the end of 1998 there were 500000 active economic entities
from which 9000 were state, 10000 – municipal, and the rest of it – private. Almost
25% of these economic entities were registered in the capital, about 15% in the region
of Plovdiv. The latter reflects the regional differences of work occupation which is
due to both traditions and local conditions.
During the same period the volume of GDP per capita changed from 943 in
1991 up to 1543 in 1995. During 1998 it dropped down to 1484. Comparison of this
criteria shows that GDP in Bulgaria is more than 20 times lower than in Norway,
Denmark, Luxemburg or any other developed country. Industrial production also
decreases as in 1997 it represents only 55% of 1989’s volume. The main fall off
concerned branches, strongly dependent on expensive import row materials: machine
building, ferrous metallurgy, etc. This decrease continued during the next year as
well. Meanwhile, a rapid increase of private owned share in the industry was 208 registered as in 1998 it reached 42.4%. About 20% of the private economy
supplementary net value resulted from this sector. At the same time most of
enterprises in the sector remained unattractive for potential buyers due to their
enormously large debts and unstable markets for realization of the production
(4,7,8,9).

Legend: Жени – Female; Мъҗе – Male: г – year After 1989 started a long and tormenting process for restitution of agricultural
lands to their former owners. This led to a decrease of the agricultural production and
deficit of food in the country. Restitution was accelerated during the last years and as
a result, by 1998, about 80% of the land ownership was restored with muniments
covering 23% of the existing agricultural lands. Restitution of land allowed for a fast
increase of the private share in the sector of agricultural production up to 95-98%
recently. It represents 32.5% from the net added value (NAV) create din the private
sector of the economy. Through the development of the private sector of agriculture is
attended by lack of financing for machinery, fertilizers and chemicals. This resulted in
decrease of plant growing average yield, changes of its structure into an increase and 209 prevailing of the share of commercially demanded products such as vegetables,
potatoes, grain and other sub-branches products.
At the end of the day, the deep and long economic crisis in Bulgaria imposes
the necessity for implementation of a strict financial discipline regime, e.g. of a
currency board. Economy crisis, corruption and legislative uncertainty were obstacle
for potential foreign investors. The lack of such investments slowed the development
of the country and limited the real income of the population.

Source: Bank Austria Creditanstaalt, BNB, NSI, EAPA, November 2007 Tourism decreased its development until 1997-1998, which is a logical
explanation taking into account the crisis from that period. Though, since 2000 a
sustainable tendency of ascending improvement was recorded. Since then over 5.5
million foreigners visit Bulgaria, about 2 million transit the country and more than 4
million Bulgarians travel abroad.
Bulgarian economy develops sustainable since 1997. During the last years the
GDP growth is within the margins of 6.2 – 6.3%. There is an increase of the
capacities utilization in the industrial and construction sectors. In 2006 an increase of
the added value in the agrarian sector at the rate of 0.9% compared to the previous
year was registered. Labour occupation of the active population increases as there are
sectors were there is a shortage of manpower. Labour market item will be further
discussed in a separate chapter (7,10,11). The external trade balance of Bulgaria is
negative for years. Nevertheless it is quite encouraging that the increase of export
rates is higher than those of import (Table 3).
Main factor for increase of the real income during the last years is the
expanding of the economic liberty. It is related to the implementation of the currency
board, ensuring relative stability of the Bulgarian lev, as well as the privatizing of
most of the state enterprises, liberalization of some of the branches and removal of
barriers before the new participants on the market, reduction of obstacles in external
commerce like decrease of duties and tariff limitations. All these improve the
potential for long-term growth as the goal is to encourage the individual initiative and
personal responsibility. Due to a strong dependency on natural conditions, climate
change and lower sustainability of the sorts, a drop down of agricultural production
was recorded during 2007. the logical expectations for this year is that yield will be
insufficient again this year and according to the official data the net added value
(NAV) from the agricultural sector will drop down with 43% real expression.
Notwithstanding that the share of this sector in the total added value becomes
lower and lower, such a sharp decrease leads to slow down of the general growth.
Increased subsidies from European funds do not yet have results. This will effect in
more expectations for state support as part of the funding will be targeted only for
maintenance of the land and not for cultivation instead of effective production and
generation of profits. Therefore no high improvements are to be expected during the
next years and dependency on climatic conditions will become deeper and deeper
(7,8,12).
Situation in the other sectors looks more positive. The real growth of the NAV
in the industry reaches 10.5%, and 9.7% for the services (2007). Relatively lower 211 remain the correctives, which include net taxes on products and indirectly measured
services of the financial brokers.
Concerning expenditures, a slight tendency for increase of the GDP share in
the investments, measured through gross conversion into fixed capital. It reaches
35.3% on annual basis. This is a precondition for increase of the potential economic
growth in near future. On another hand the gross savings in economy decrease up to
15% annual basis, though the share of end consumption in the GDP decreases. This is
a result from lower net current transfers and lower net income. The reasons could be
found in the increased volume of foreign investments in the country, which are due to
interest fees and increasing dividends. From another part, the increased income in the
country and the immigration of whole families abroad, leads to smaller foreign
transfers (8,9,11).
As a whole, data for gross domestic product development are positive. Certain
delay of the economic development is due to the ineffective agriculture.
Most probably the emerging of new actors on the market, for example the
funds for agricultural lands, would result in land consolidation, and consequently – to
long term opportunities for generation of profits. It might be expected, though, that
upcoming subsidies would distort farmers’ incentives and decline their attention from
increasing of the efficiency to drafting of applications with unclear final results.
Subsidies for agricultural sector shall come from the European budget in total
and moneys from Bulgarian taxpayers shall be reduced to minimum. Another
negative factor for the development of the economy is the hidden economy, which by
its nature represents quite a complex social-economic phenomenon. Practically it
concerns all public-economical structures on international, national and regional level.
Following the expert evaluations the relative share of the hidden economy
amounts at 10-12% of the world’ GDP (making such evaluation is very difficult and it
is conditional in some sense) (Table 4). For Bulgaria this “product” varies between 20
and 25%. Problems, causing this phenomenon, are multiple: payment of labour
becomes non-monitored and undeclared income for both employee and employers;
production from it is not taxed (added value tax, income tax, etc.); hidden economy
operates with two very serious tools: smuggling and drug-traffic (5,9).
From the variety of scenarios concerning the economic future of Central and
Eastern European countries for the period until 2020 and 2050, according to some
economy experts from Bulgarian Academy of Science, Bulgaria can chose two
extreme versions for development :
− Slow down of the development with about 2% average annual rate of the GDP
growth or slow development with about 3% average annual rate. This means
that following the first scenario by the middle of the century we will have 3035% GDP per capita from the EC-15 average level by that time or 40-45%
following the second scenario. Such projections mean that will cause to
Bulgaria social-economic stagnation with heavy strategic consequences (Table
5).
− Overtaking or quick overtaking economic development with 5.0-6.0% average
annual rate of the GDP growth. In order to realize economic overtaking it is
necessary to have an annual growth 2.5-3.0 times higher than the growth of the
countries in EC-15. In this case we will reach 50-55% GDP up to 2020, and
75-80% of the growth of EC-15 by 2050. Such favourable prospective for
Bulgaria is possible, but not sure (7,10,12). 212 Table 4. Real GDP growth rate 1998 – 2009

Following the results of a research on the manpower, implemented by the National
Statistic Institute during 2006 – 2007, the economically active persons (manpower) in
the country were 3408.1 mln. (1805.9 were men and 1602.2 women). The relative 213 share is 51.3%, respectively 56.8% men and 46.4% for women. The economical
activity coefficient for the age group of 15-64 is 64.9%, respectively 69.4% for men
and 60.5% for women.
The share of the employed population in cities, which are at age of 15 and
older (52.4%) is with 17.7 grades higher than the one in villages (34.7%).
From total number of employed population, 121900 (3.9%) are employers,
218800 (7.0%) - self-employed, 2762300 (88.1%) are employees, and 32400 (1.0%) –
no paid family workers. 840600 or 30.4% of the total number employed people work
in the public sector, and 1921700 or 69.6% - in the private sector (3,9).

Source: eurostat – www. ec.europa.eu/eurostat 214 In the service sector there are 1800100 (57.4 % of totally employed) people, in
industry - 1125500 (35.9%), and in agriculture and forestry – 209000 (6.7%).
Unemployed people in 2007 are 272700 or 8.0% from the economically active
population. Workless men are 138500, and unemployed women – 134200.
Coefficients of unemployment per gender are respectively 7.7% for men and 8.4% for
women. Unemployment is significantly higher in villages - 13.3% compared to the
cities - 6.4%. Unemployed persons at age between 15 - 64 accomplished years are
271300, and the coefficient for unemployment for the same gender group is 8.0%.
Unemployed persons at age between 15 - 24 accomplished years are 45700, and the
coefficient for youth unemployment is 16.0% (3,9).
The educational status among unemployed persons shows that 8.9% have
university degree, 47.0% have accomplished high school, and 44.1% have
accomplished primary or lower level school.
Some 151700 or 55.6% of the total number unemployed persons have been
workless one or more years as in villages this number reaches 60.6%. Territorial
distribution of unemployed persons is unequal. In 10 regions the level of
unemployment is lower than the average for the country as lowest it is in Sofia-city
(1.66%). the level of unemployment in the rest 18 regions is above the average for the
country and its highest levels were recorded in Targovishte region (14.55%).
The average rate of salary increase, but it still cannot be compared to the levels
in the other countries EU member states. The average salary in 2007 for the public
sector reached Bulgarian lev (BGN), 513 which means 18 per cent nominal growth
compared to 2006, when the average working salary was 436 BGN. The number of
insured persons is 2 762000, which means an increase of more than 110000 compared
to 2006. The average working salary in the sectors for production of food, drinks and
tobacco are the highest in the public sector – 1369 BGN with a nominal growth of 43,
compared to 2006. Relatively high average working salaries were monitored in the
following branches: financial brokerage - 1065 BGN, production of energy carriers –
1100 BGN, etc. The average salary for production of food drinks and tobacco in the
private sectors is significantly lower - 365 BGN. Statistics show that the highest
average working salary on the territory of the country was recorded in Sofia-city –
562 BGN, the lowest one salary was registered in the regions of Blagoevgrad – 323
BGN and Haskovo – 323 BGN (8).
Monthly income of Bulgarian households in 2007 has increased with 111.3
BGN (20%) compared to 2006. the main source of the incomes is the working salary.
The volume of all reimbursed social transfers (compensations, pensions, grants,
family supplements) increased. Maintenance of relatively stable level of the incomes
from family farm was registered. Incomes from entrepreneurship in 2007 increased
with 23.4 % compared to 2006. a tendency for reduction of incomes generated from
real estate sales. The expenditures structure shows that most significant expenditures
were made for food – about 40%, something typical for the countries with low life
standard. Consumption of food products is characterized with poor relative share of
the fruits and vegetables (2,3,5,9,11). Living standard of Bulgarian population
improves but still remains one of the lowest in Europe. Pensioning system
Significant demographic problems in Bulgaria, emigration of young people, great
number of pensioners and the high unemployment rate brought an inevitable necessity 215 of reform in the pensioning system. The way of financing was changed first of all.
The tree-pillars pensioning system was implemented and a capital pensioning system
was established except for the cost justification system. During 2007 the social
pension of age amounted at 68 BGN per moth (the average was 162 and maximal 490
BGN), which represents an increase of 8.5% compared to the previous year. There are
2.270 millions pensioners, and 2.773 millions pensions, because some people receive
more than one pension (for example for disability and for their age). The expenditures
on pensions during 2007 amount BGN 4.5 billions, which is the largest expenditure
item of the National Statistical Institute’s budget (3,5).
Reasons for the high pensioning fees are the non-operational economy, poor
competition among enterprises, and insufficient collection of the insurance fees as
well as the low cost of labour force. But one shall in no way rely on the increase of
the fees aiming to fill up public insurance taxation funds. The fee payable by the
employees will increase in during next years versus decreasing of the employers fees,
but yet, the amount of the salary shall be increased in order to compensate the
increased insurance fees. The rate of the insurance fees is determined on annual basis
by a specific law being a percentage of the gross labour remuneration. Maximal rate
of the insurance income due to insurance payments is 10 minimal labour salaries for
the country.
Introduction of additional mandatory pensioning insurance (AMPI) since 2002
does not lead to increase of the total rate of insurance instalments because it is
provided for redirecting a part of the public insurance tax to the funds, established by
private pensioning insurance associations. Bulgarian employers have some doubts
that still higher rates of the mandatory insurance instalments will not allow for the
active participation of most of the employers in the process of the additional voluntary
pensioning insurance, which, on the other hand, will slow its development. The
described past and current financial status of the social insurance system gives certain
grounds to assume that even in future the achievement of financial equilibrium will be
an extremely difficult task. One of the reasons is the rate of the insurance fee which
has almost reached its maximal level already. Even if we assume that we base on the
lowest insurance instalment, collected through the rest of the instalments under
Professional Qualification and Unemployment Fund (PQUF) and health insurance, it
would exceed the insurance fees of countries like Germany (35,2 %), France (49,4
%), and others. If in future balances are still tipped towards the employers, the result
will remain definitely negative. Increased social expenditures, part of the common
volume of the production costs in high cost industries, will continue to limit the
competitiveness of the enterprises on the internal and external market, and
respectively their profits. Such industries will aim at reducing of working places and
keeping low labour salary level. This is an absolute stimulus for the black labour
market. As we can guess, social insurance gains no profits from the enlarging of this
market (3,9).
There is a sustainable insufficiency of funds. Current pensioners are the most
affected social group because the social insurance system cannot afford an increase of
the pensions and keeps their levels suck to the administratively determined ceiling.
Alternatives are two: either increase the instalment rates in order to compensate
insufficiency, or, increase subsidies, which on its part will lead to misbalance of the
state budget, i.e. to budgetary deficit. Yet the increase of the instalments’ percentage 216 will come into collision with the employers’ indignation only. This is the first barrier,
which the social insurance is facing when targeting a relative stability of the system.
If we assume the controversial option – eventual transfer of part of the insurance fees
burden to the insured people, this will definitely facilitate employers, but in macroeconomical plan it will not reduce the financial load to the active population. The
question is, that having in place expenditures distribution system of financing, such as
it is in Bulgaria (Pillar I), the increasing number of pensioners leads to growth of the
expenditures and a corresponding necessity to increase percentage of insurance fees
(3,5,11).
In Bulgaria the pensioning burden on the active population is due to the
comparatively low pensioning age threshold. Currently this threshold age is corrected
due to the before mentioned reasons. Even though, if the tendency for irregular
increase of the pensioner’s number compared to the active population’s number, it
would create serious difficulties for financial equilibrium and social insurance as well.
In such situation it is good to raise one more question – whether the active population
will bear this burden, whether the system of solidarity between generations will stand
it, i.e. the question is not only economic but also a moral one. Currently economically
active population bears the consequences of the crisis and except its own standard it
has to guarantee the good life standard of the inactive part of the society. It is claimed
that paying insurance fees today means ensuring future guarantees. In our conditions,
though, this assertion is not valid. Paying their insurances the active population
replenishes the funds from which the pensions of the retired population are paid.
Analyzing this vicious circle, it is essential to understand that the limits of the
solidarity between generations are strongly dependant on the economic interests of
each member of the society and the society as a whole. In conditions of crisis and
dependency on external factors the active population can support the preceding
generations, which from logical point of view is quite logical. But the working people
do not agree to put aside money for insurance because they doubt they would be able
to use these “savings” and moreover, they doubt they can count on future generations’
solidarity.
Based on the above mentioned findings several fundamental conclusions are
due:
− mandatory pension insurance cannot guarantee higher level of the future
insurance instalments because the current insurance fee has reached its
maximal rate;
− Maintaining insurance instalments within the limits of the bearable is of critical
importance for the improvement of the economic conditions, including the
increase of the employment and decease of unemployment.
After conclusions comes the turn of the concrete measures which could be
undertaken in order to mitigate the negative tendencies. The increase of the
threshold age for pensioning and the necessary employment record are a fact
already, but taking into account the worsened health status of Bulgarian population
it is not considered to be an optimal decision. This measure was applied due to the
extremely unfavourable demographic picture. Increasing the threshold of
pensioning age up to the one in the other European countries contributes to the
balancing of the system, though it has undesirable social response. It is appropriate
to refer to decisions of longer sustainability effect, which correspond to the 217 conditions of the market economy. This is the implementation of alternative forms
of insurance protection like the second and the third pillars into our insurance
system, namely the additional mandatory and additional voluntary pensioning
insurance.
According to the third pillar, voluntary fees based on certain income could increase
the size of their pensions and simultaneously make a significant input to form the
insurance fund. Legal basis on regulating the voluntary and the private insurance
was found in the legislation of countries which have long history of functioning
market economy. The additional voluntary and the mandatory pensioning insurance
are considered to be an alternative of the increasing expenditures on the voluntary
common regime of pensioning insurance. During the last few years mandatory
schemes in most of the European countries were oriented to lower insurance
instalments and the related lower rates of the compensations. Increase of the latter
is achieved through participation in the second and third pillars.
The first practical steps towards pensioning reform in Bulgaria were made in
1994-1995 when the first 5-6 voluntary pensioning funds were established, some of
them still operational. By the end of 1999 more than 15 companies were
implementing real activities in voluntary pension insurance. The development of the
activities in additional voluntary pension insurance can be assessed through the real
achievements during the last 5 years. At this stage these achievements concern only
the additional pension insurance because the activities under pillar II has not started
yet. The real challenge standing before the pensioning system is its full functioning,
operation of all its elements despite the complicated social-economic situation in the
country. Licensed pension insurance companies entered their role of leading
institutions, called upon to practically turn in reality the main part of the pensioning
reform in the country and activate their funds under the second and third pillar of the
system. Activity under pillar III is realized by the companies acting also under pillar
II. The approve scheme under pillar III defines two types of voluntary pensioning
funds:
− Voluntary pensioning fund. Pensioning insurance in these funds can be made
only through monthly monetary instalments whose rate is determined by the
insurance contracts, but no less than 10% of the minimal labour salary for the
country;
− Voluntary pensioning fund with investment bonds. Through these funds a
special and very specific for Bulgaria voluntary pensioning insurance is carried
out. Funds are created for a period of activity limited up to 7 years. All citizens,
owing received by the state bonds for mass privatization can participate.
Participants in insurance with bonds have almost the same rights, provided for the
citizens who make monetary insurance, but yet not earlier than five years from the
date of their individual lot’s certification. (3,9).
The new legislation related to pensioning reform applies a very strict
conservative regime of the investment activities of pensioning insurance companies
and insurance finds. The assets of the additional pensioning funds can be invested in:
− securities, issued and guaranteed by the state;
− securities, issued for the trade at the regulated jobbing markets;
− municipal securities;
− takings on bank deposits; 218 − real estate and mortgages.
No less than 50% of the pensioning funds assets have to be invested in
securities, issued and/or guaranteed by the state and/or takings on bank deposits. Only
5% of the funds’ assets can be invested in securities, issued by one commercial
company. No more than 10% of the funds’ assets can be invested abroad in gilts,
municipal bonds and securities, which are allowed for trade by Bulgarian National
Bank’s decision. Pensioning insurance company cannot land or be a guarantor to third
persons using the managed assets of the additional pensioning insurance fund. It shall
be mentioned that due to the poorly developed and almost missing capital market in
Bulgaria, and because of the limited opportunities to use other financial instruments,
the main part of the investment portfolio of currently active pensioning funds consists
of stocks, where about 90-92 % of their assets are invested (5,9).
Maintaining long-term investments for longer time period is a specific
principle for Bulgarian conditions. Following the limited requirements for liquidity
and necessity to maintain insignificant financial resources for current payments of
pensioning funds, long-term investment instruments remain in the portfolio until the
redemption date. This is the way to minimize the risk and only market risk remains to
the diversified securities portfolio.
We could mark several advantages of the opportunity to be insured in
additional pensioning fund:
− Insure person’s money are separate from the shareholders’ moneys through
distribution of money flows;
− State Agency on Insurance Control was established and became operational,
already controlling the entire activity of the pensioning insurance companies;
− Transparency and mandatory accounting are guaranteed trough the right of the
insured to be informed. Participation in professional or universal pensioning
fund can be changed by the willingness of the insured 1 year after the
beginning of the insurance period. The insured person has the right to transfer
the accumulated amounts of his/her individual account from one universal or
professional pensioning fund to another universal or professional pensioning
fund, established and managed by another pensioning insurance company, but
only once per calendar year;
− The interest of the insured persons are protected and represented by
representatives of the national professional organizations, members of the trust
councils. Such trust councils shall be established to each universal or
professional pensioning fund and they will monitor the activities of the funds
and make recommendations to protect the interests of the insured individuals;
− Each person, due to ensuring of additional mandatory pension make his/her
choice about the universal or professional pensioning fund through an
individual statement submitted to the pensioning insurance company. The
social partners (national representative syndical organizations) are authorized
to perform consultative functions for the choice of an appropriate pensioning
fund.
The problems of the new insurance system represent the dualistic role of the
advantages. During the last years additional pensioning funds have significant
problems with the investments. Currently about 90-95 % of the resource are invested 219 in VS, which means security but with low gains. MPIC states that up to 5%, in special
cases by decision of the State Agency of Insurance Control up to 10% of the assets
can be invested in corporate bonds of one company. The argument is that this is the
way to prevent money flow out. This is not a proper motivation. To each such a thesis
could be opposed the other one – that one shall create such conditions which will
make the business to prefer Bulgaria instead of other countries. Ageing and employment policies
The number of people aged over 65 years is growing up (1740000 - 2006) as it was
mentioned. Their incomes are very low to assure their health and social well-being.
So they have to work additionally or to expect some assistance from the society. This
is one of the most important challenges in Bulgaria.
Ageing also has a "women's face" as in most countries women live much
longer than men. Gender differences in terms of numbers are most evident in older
age groups, which means, that women will be more concerned by ageing. Women are
more likely to be found in parallel labour markets such as family businesses,
especially in developing countries. However, according to official statistics about 25
per cent of the economically active older population is women. So, as in the majority
of countries life expectancy at birth is higher among women than among men, and in
most countries women aged 60 and over are expected to live longer than men, a
considerable gender imbalance is developing among elderly workers. The upper age
limit for population of working age gradually increases, having reached already 63
years of age (in 2005) and for women this age will increase to 60 years in 2009. The
consequences of this process concern the whole society. Working people aged 18-65
years (62.8% of the population) has to support 2860000 people (0-17 and 65+ years
old). According to prognosis of the UN this burden will increase in future years
(2050): 13,8% (-15); 47,6% (15-59); 38,6% (60+). An ageing population means an
ageing workforce, which could lead to a conflict of interest between young people
and older workers. Pessimists believe that by 2030 the young and the old will be in
conflict, and public finances will be in disorder as a result of ageing (1,2,3,6).
The consequences of ageing are multiple, and include both economic and
social aspects. The social results affect family structures, living arrangements,
behaviour and attitudes, relations between generations, health and other areas of life.
The economic consequences of ageing are associated with the higher cost to society
of supporting the elderly population. The implications of ageing which are considered
in the present document relate to employment and labour markets, the composition of
the workforce, changes in activity rates, gender-related effects, and some others.
As a result of the ageing the financial burden increases borne by the
economically active population. The dependency ratio is the number of people under
15 and over 60 for every 100 people in the 15-59 age brackets. The dependency ratio
is rising in European countries for persons aged 60 and over, and will have increased
to 40 by 2025 from 26 in 1985. In Europe in 1950, there were slightly more than 40
elderly persons per 100 young people. By 1970, this figure had risen to more than 50,
while by 1985 it had increased to over 65. As the cost to society of an older person
can be several times that of a child or an adolescent, this shift in the age incidence of
dependency ratios implies a potentially very substantial rise in public expenditure (6). 220 Ageing on this scale would place substantial pressures on public finances and
reduce growth in living standards. These negative consequences of ageing could be
offset by policies to encourage immigration, higher fertility or fast productivity
growth. The increase in the number and share of older people poses a number of
questions to the society, relative to the state of health, living standards, material
support, labour and public activity, social adaptation and integration of older people
into society. These topics enter into the social policy sphere, concerning the measures
taken with view to improving the state of third age people.
As it’s seen from the Table 6 in 2006 the number of insured persons is with
more than 2 millions persons smaller than the population if working age. The
governors have to resolve the complex problem how to increase the number of people
who pay their insurance for pension. Otherwise when these cohorts will achieve the
retirement age they will not have any resource in the pension fund.

loose many social contacts, their incomes decrease strongly, and the maintenance of
health status requires more resources. The aim of pension schemes is to provide
income support to workers too old to continue working. Whatever the system adopted
and whatever the method of financing, retirement pensions can be viewed as a
deduction levied on the working population. When the number of pensioners
increases more rapidly than the number of people in employment, it is logical to
expect some difficulty in financing the scheme, whatever the political or economic
system in force and whatever the pensions machinery in operation.
Older workers seek employment and are hired or fired mostly in the same
labour markets as all other worker categories. It is rare to find special labour markets
for them like those that exist for workers with disabilities. The laws of a market
economy apply to them, and they are subject to the same competition for jobs as all
others. However, older workers are often eliminated from labour markets while their
younger colleagues can expect to remain. The following factors explain the difference
in the position of older workers: the general labour market conjuncture, the level of a
country's development, the economic cycle, the availability of a social safety net, the 221 efficiency of labour market institutions, educational and health factors, the size of the
informal sector, labour law, and others. The supply side of labour markets for older
workers is affected by economic, legislative, social, health, and demographic factors.
Apart from these factors, older workers require skills needed in labour markets in
order to be employable. The demand side is also affected by economic, legislative and
social factors, but in addition, it is affected by the state of the market and the business
cycle. Early retirement, for example, has been used in some countries as a countercyclical measure. In Bulgaria since 2000 was undertook a reform in determination of
retirement age. It’s calculated as sum of the age of each person and the years of
employment and results in a number of points (for males – 100, for females – 93 2007) (9).
Unemployment could be considered as discriminatory in respect of older
workers unless measures are taken to equalize their chances in labour markets. Older
workers who are forced to retire feel excluded from society. What factors affect the
labour force participation decisions of older workers? These can be divided into three
broad categories. The first involves their eligibility for a pension and the amount of
the pension. Being eligible for a pension means a reduced probability of labour force
participation. The second factor is the mandatory retirement system. The third factor
involves working conditions. Wages, in particular, have an enormous impact on the
decision to work. The higher the wages older workers are paid the more likely they
are to participate in the labour force.
Discrimination against older workers is a long-standing problem. In fact, older
workers were the targets of discrimination already in the "golden age" of full
employment in Europe in the post-war years. Age discrimination can be found in both
the state and the private sectors, in official policies, and in employment policies
pursued at enterprise level. Some age discrimination measures are evident (direct)
while others are concealed (indirect). Direct discrimination consists of openly treating
older workers less favourably than others. Direct measures include compulsory
retirement at a fixed age, a maximum age for recruitment and age limits on access to
training (2,3,4).
An obvious manifestation of discrimination occurs in vacancy announcements
which impose an age limit of 40 or 45 years. However, age discrimination makes
itself felt some 10-15 years before the official retirement age, sometimes earlier, if
wage increments depend on length of service. Relatively older people who are still in
their prime might find themselves targeted for dismissal.
Retirement programmes and schemes have to be elaborated and the might
comprise the following measures: reduced early pensions; more generous invalidity
benefits; partial pension benefits to complement income from part-time employment;
continuous payment of unemployment benefits and relaxation of registration criteria;
enterprise- and industry-level schemes; voluntary early retirement and redundancy
arrangements. If a worker who became unemployed at the age of 56 continues to
receive unemployment benefit until the age of 60 (the official retirement age), then
this worker has been channelled into retirement through an extended period of
unemployment. This challenge has to be transform into an opportunity. Such
transformation requires the efforts of the society and also individuals for adoption and
implementation of rational employment and healthcare policy.
With population ageing, the share of the population in the working ages will
shrink and the labour force itself will grow older. This process could become a drag 222 on economic growth unless the decline in labour force growth can be controlled or
greater efforts are made to increase labour productivity. Health care system
The main target of the health policy and health reform in Bulgaria is the improvement
of population’s health and the health protection system. It includes the following
priorities:
− Decrease of infant mortality and improvement of maternal healthcare;
− Limitation of morbidity, mortality and disability resulting from socially
significant diseases by the means of designing and implementing healthcare
programs;
− Maintenance of efficient anti-epidemiological control;
− Limitations of health risks, ensuring of safe labour conditions and limiting the
risks for human health coming from the environment;
− Reduction of risk factors related to the health of aged people and people in
unfavourable and non-equivalent status;
− Improvement of the psychic health of population;
− Establishment of preconditions for- and leaving a healthy life, promotion of
health and prevention from diseases;
− Elaboration and permanent progress and improvement of the healthcare system
and its efficient functioning. Organization
By the means of the healthcare reform, which started in 1999, a major number of
good structural and functional decisions, related to healthcare systems of insurance
type combined with some elements of the national health services were applied. This
is a new model, more and more applicable in the practice of the different countries,
know as a “public-private mix”. Following this model, the state, insurance (public and
corporate) and private sectors - each of them having its own perimeter of activity,
rights and responsibility, are represented in different scale and levels. The most
typical feature of the public-private model is that all health activities with divisible
effect are in the sphere of the private production of services, with dominant public
financing combined with a smaller by size private co-financing. Excluded from this
classical market segment are only those healthcare problems, for which the user is not
able to take self dependent decisions, for example emergency, stationary psychiatric
aid and other similar decisions. At the same time any healthcare activities with an
inseparable effect, such as state health control, programs on the governance of
socially significant diseases, mandatory health treatment, anti-epidemiological
measures, etc., still remain in the sphere of the public financing and the dominantly
public and smaller scale private production of those services (13,14,15).
Reforms in the sphere of curative health protection are radical and
exceptionally serious. The rights of the patients were regulated and protected in
relation with the medical aid, rendered in the medical institutions as well as the rights
of the medical specialists, providing medical assistance and healthcare. Reforms in
the sphere of curative health protection started with the adoption from the National 223 Assembly five new structural laws on health protection system in the period before
2000 and in 2004 another one, concerning dominantly public health protection. They
are as follows:
− Law on healthy and safe labour conditions -1997;
− Law on health insurance – 1998;
− Law on physicians’ and stomatologists’ professional organizations – 1998;
− Law on medical institutions (ЗЛЗ) – 1999;
− Law on drugs and pharmacies of human medicine – 2000;
− Law on health – 2004.
Through these laws the structure, scope, organization, management and
financing of the medical, stomatological and drug activities were determined. Another
important characteristic of the changes in the medical care system is regulating the
contractual outset of the relations between medical institutions and the financing
bodies, namely the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). All Bulgarian citizens are
mandatory insured through specific set of medical aid, which is paid by the NHIF.
Medical car is provided in the medical institutions based on a contract between them
and the NHIF substructures – the Regional Health Insurance Funds (RHIF). RHIF pay
to the medical institutions the provided medical services based on specific prices.
Increasing the share of the voluntary health insurance associations will break up the
monopoly of the NHIF. Third important characteristic is ensuring the right of the
customer to choose a physician and stomatologist for primary aid, medical institution
for specialized extra-hospital aid, and since 01.01.2004 – for hospital aid. Thus the
administrative compulsion for choice and limitation of citizens’ rights to chose
specialists or medical institutions were eliminated.
The legally regulated management, juridical and economic independence of the
entities in the area of healthcare – medical institutions and financial bodies, together
with the enforcement of contractual relations and the right of free choice of the
customer, are the main preconditions for the establishment of medical services market
and competition among the healthcare institutions. Financing
National Health Insurance Fund finances the healthy care for insured citizen (health
insurance is mandatory in Bulgaria). In cases when citizen is insured also in voluntary
health insurance association, then expenses on his treatment, depending on his
contract, are paid by the concerned association as well. When the citizen is
hospitalized following his personal desire and without any direction from his general
physician or specialist, then he/she pays on his own the costs of his/her treatment.
The citizens, which are mandatory insured, except for the insurance instalment, are
paying also a fee for each primary visit to the physician or stomatologist, a customers
fee at the amount of 1% from the minimal working salary, and for each day of
treatment in medical institution (but no more than 10 days per year) the amount of 2%
from the minimal working salary. Certain categories of citizens are exempted from
customer’s fees.
Public costs for healthcare have reached 265 BGN per capita in 2006, which is
twice more than in 2000. As a percentage of GDP, the public expenses on healthcare
during the last five years are sustainable positioned in the range 4-4.3 (average). 224 Following the WHO’s expert evaluations for the same period private financing for
healthcare has approximated the size of the public one. Great part of the private
financing is unregulated by legislation and is deemed to the detriment of the good
practices (5,15). Access to heath care
Outpatient healthcare
Territorial distribution and coverage with health institutions of the country as well as
its planning is regulated by the national and regional health protection maps, which
are updated each five years. They contain the number of the different medical
institutions in the different territorial units (regions and municipalities). These
medical institutions conclude contracts with the Regional Health Insurance Funds for
providing of healthcare to the concerned population. Equality between public (state
and municipal) and private institutions is legally regulated. Main characteristic of the
reform in the healthcare system is the radically changed legal status and the full
juridical, financial and economic independence of the medical institutions:
− Individual practices for primary and specialized physicians’ and stomatological
aid can be registered from- and are property of the respective physicians and
stomatologists;
− Group practices for primary and specialized physicians’ and stomatological
aid, medical, stomatological and mixed centres, diagnostic and consultative
centres and medical-technician’s laboratories and hospices are established in
the form of commercial entities or cooperations. When necessary such
institutions can be established as associations with limited responsibility or
joint stock companies from the state or municipalities, independently or jointly
with other entities;
− Medical care institutions, medical and social care institutions and dispensaries
are established from the state and the municipalities, from legal and physical
persons in the form of commercial companies or cooperations;
− Property and responsibility of the state remain: emergency centres, centres for
transfusion, hematology, institutions for stationary psychiatric aid, institutions
for medical monitoring and specific care for children, and also some medical
institutions at different ministries (Ministry of Defense, Ministry of the internal
affairs, Ministry of transport, Ministry of justice);
− Hospital (inpatient) healthcare.
Medical institutions for hospital care are multiprofiled and specialized
hospitals and they can be: for active treatment; for restoration to health and extended
treatment; for rehabilitation, etc. Depending to the territory and the related
accreditation hospitals can be: district, regional, interregional, university and national
hospitals.
All hospitals for active treatment, rehabilitation and long-term treatment as
well as hospices were transformed in 2000 into companies with limited responsibility
or joint venture companies. They are not yet privatized but a procedure for
privatization of part of them is on the way. The payment of the inpatient care is based
on contract with the NHIF following the group of disease, defined as “clinical paths”.
Each hospital is authorized to sign a contract for financing with all twelve
associations for voluntary health insurance. 225 Hospital doctors are paid under labour agreements, which are formed within
40% of the hospital income. Though registered as corporations, hospitals receive its
financing from NHIF following the administratively established prices. Once a year
negotiations are held between the NHIF and the professional organizations of the
doctors to negotiate the specific rate of these prices. Latter are listed in the National
Framework Contract. Due to exceeded expenses of the NHIF, those prices can be
revised once at every 6 months. Each insured person pays for each day of treatment in
medical institution, but no more than 10 days per year the amount of 2% from the
minimal working salary. The improper financing of the treatment in medical
institutions led to the emerging of a serious black market. Limited number of state
hospitals is financed by the state, municipalities have no financing functions (13,16).
The status of the healthcare is one of the most synthetic indices for the levels of
the economic development and quality of life. Unfortunately in Bulgaria this is the
sector where structural reforms have failed in great extend. If we summarize what was
achieved during the period of transition main results were attained in placing the
financial relationships among the state, customers and providers of medical services
on the basis of the health insurance; entrusting the outpatient aid to the general
practitioners and specialists; increasing of their incomes; improvement of some of the
indices for hospital equipment’s utilization. However, negatives are much more.
The negative balance of the healthcare reform can be seen through the
worsened indexes of the nation’s common health status. Mortality has increased.
Reasons are mainly diseases of blood circulation system: two thirds of the lethal cases
were caused by infarcts and apoplexies. Second ranked are cancer diseases, whose
growth is rising rapidly. Disorders of respiratory system are main reasons for
hospitalization as half of the cases are with lethal outcome and are caused by
pneumonia. Another alarming tendency is the growing distribution of psychic
disorders. They rarely lead to preliminary death and thus remain out of the health
statistics focus. The number of the disabled people increased three times during the
period of transition as the newly registered cases are almost twice more than the
average for the European Union and one of the highest in world. Disorders of blood
circulation system are the most frequent causes for such harms and lethal cases.
An important index for the efficiency of the healthcare is mortality among
children below one year. In the beginning of the transitional period Bulgaria was
positioned close to the Central and Eastern European countries and better than Poland
and Hungaria. Seventeen years later Bulgaria is at the bottom of the list. Only Albania
and Romania from the Balkan Peninsula countries have higher mortality rates of the
new-born. The probability that a child die in Bulgaria before it becomes 5 years old is
three times higher than in the EC-15 and twice than in the new EC member states.
The causes for the infant high mortality are most often preliminary birth,
complications during the prenatal period, diseases of respiratory system and different
infections. The years of transition are marked with the worsening of some health
indices, which reflect problems that are specific for the low income countries:
distribution of tuberculosis and hepatitis. Besides, these evidences for ineffective
healthcare system are average statistical ones, i.e. they hide the higher values of
these rates, including mortality of the new-born in the villages and the regions of
compact ethnical population.
Worsened health indices are partially due to the negative demographic
tendencies – decreased birth rate and emigration of young people abroad sharpen the 226 problem of the ageing of population. The main reason for these bad tendencies more
and more becomes the limited access to health services. Serious obstacle for the
access to health aid is the income drop down and the increased economic vulnerability
of the population, combined with the transition to health insurance system. Low
incomes and increased health risks are bound into a wicked circle where due to the
lack of labour people remain out of the health aid scope. As a result bad peoples’
health limits their access to the labour market, increases their poverty and social
isolation.
Unemployed people and people with low incomes are not the only ones who
are facing higher health risks due to the transition to market economy. To different
extent it concerns the entire society. The reason is that liberalization of prices and
entrepreneurship were not accompanied with adequate legal and institutional
measures for protection of the employees and customers’ rights. This led to
increasing of health risks at the working place and at home. State is not yet
completely effective in applying the standards for safety at working place and safety
of foods, as well as environmental protection standards and it also has no clear policy
for protection of the customers from monopolistic or oligopolistic drug prices. High
social and economic stress combined with a weaker protection of employees and
customers resulted in worsening the health status and life quality of the population.
Bulgarians, however, pay health insurance fees and as much as this from his
pocket. Besides, in distinction from the practice in the countries with developed
health insurance systems, these private payments are not voluntary health insurance
but direct payments for health services (Tables 7 and 8).

regulated personal payments from clients. Out of it remain corruption payments
which exceed the regulated ones in time.
Therefore the weight of the health payments, made by the patients in Bulgaria is
bigger than in rest of the European countries.

GDP (not counting the informal) are not low at all when compared with international
rates. The problem is that in our country they are improperly distributed referring to
the direct personal payments. That is why the priority of the health reform shall be not
the increase of the mandatory health insurance fee, but the directing of this significant
resource of official and unofficial direct payments which, following the most
conservative evaluations, are in the range of 3-4% from the GDP, for health services
and to the currently narrowed market of additional private insurance packages.
Precisely, this is the substance of the healthcare restructuring in direction to more
competitive and customers’ oriented choice, leaving the state without an opportunity
to transfer its responsibilities to the market. Developed health systems account at
highest extent on the economical stimulators. Regulation and control are vitally
important as far as they aim at protecting the rights of the customers and the suppliers.
The quality of the health services though can be achieved through competition and
incentives (13,14,15).
In our country the reform is based on total administrative control instead of
adequate financial stimuli. Moreover, control is mainly at the entrance of the system.
Its basic tools are accreditation of medical institutions and medical standards.
Accreditation of medical institutions aims at insuring of minimal standards of 228 technical equipment and qualification, which are necessary for the relevant services,
covered by the NHIF. The funds reimbursed by the NHIF are not bound to the quality
of the services. Thus after obtaining the accreditation and covering the standards,
medical practices and hospitals have no incentives to invest in capacity building, new
technologies and direct capitals for the improvement of the healthcare quality. The
system is designed in such a way that it could cover a general minimal level of the
standards.
Taxation of hospitals is also a push back instrument. Hospital services are
VAT-free and this puts hospitals in the position of end consumer of drugs,
medications, equipment, i.e. they do not have the right to take a tax credit for these
expenses. Thus they are encouraged to increase their costs for labour instead of
investments, medications, external services, including training of the staff. State
regulations also act in this direction. Hospitals cannot reallocate for salaries less than
40% of the funds, coming from the NHIF. There is no upper limit of the salaries. Also
there is no bottom limit for drugs and medications. Having these regulations in place
and the insufficient coverage of the expensive clinical paths, it is not curious that
hospitals try to transfer expenditures for drugs and medications to the insured patients,
though they are not included in the value of their clinical paths. It is evident that
currently healthcare policy cannot find an adequate answer for the problems related to
the blocked health reform in the hospital sector, nor for the mistaken system for
financial stimuli and inadequate quality control management through the instruments
of the administrative control at the entry of the system. The society’s attention though,
is attracted by the salaries of the doctors and their appeals to the state to equip at least
some of the priority hospitals. Who will equip the others – this is not clear. The state
transfers its responsibilities to the hospital managements and tries to combat the
health insurance inefficiency with an increase of the health insurance fees (Table 9
and 10).

7,2 The concept “communication” describes concrete mechanisms of social
inclusion through direct forms of interaction. In order to overcome the isolation of
elder and aged people and provoke their activity, the programme provides for
establishment of self-support groups in the community, and depending on their
interests creation of different forms of communication leading to satisfaction of their
personal necessities. The main targets are as follows:
Target 1: development of knowledge and practical skills and directions for
healthy lifestyle and nourishing:
 Establishment of habits for active motor regime, comparable to the
personal possibilities of each individual. Necessity and meaning of activity 229 shall be explained and information concerning the existing groups, called
“For health” to be distributed. New groups to be established.
 Creation of skills for the development of individual hygiene-diet regime
by the means of health educating discussions on the importance and the
necessity of healthy nutrition and its impact on the general health-psychic
status of the individual.

achievement of better life quality
In order to support elder people with knowledge and advice of how to adapt to
age alternations in the conditions of market economy for achieving better life quality
and active old ages, a project for training of trainees (specialists and aged people)
shall be realized in different concerned regions. Programmes shall be implemented by
teams consisting of specialists-gerontologists and social experts from the municipal
centres of social care taking into account the specific structure of population, cultural
and economic specifics by regions. Conclusions:
1. 2. 3. 4. Up to now, older workers have been the losers in labour markets as a result
of official employment policies and labour market measures. All workers
may experience spells of unemployment interrupting their careers, but older
workers suffer disproportionately from non-employment. In addition, once
interrupted, their careers are much more difficult to resume. Present policies
in respect of older workers still generally consider them as a labour reserve
rather than as active labour market participants.
Some forms of employment have turned out to be the niches preferred by
workers in the upper age groups. Older workers should be provided with
opportunities to update existing skills and acquire new skills. Older workers
can also benefit from measures promoting self-employment.
Increasing the retirement age leads to growth in the economically active
population and decreases the number of pensioners. Hence, the impact on
GDP would be favourable, and a better chance to balance pension schemes
will be provided. However, increasing the retirement age requires
simultaneous employment promotion to ensure that jobs are available to all
jobseekers.
Workplace and working time adjustments can be effective tools for
promoting the employment of older workers. At the same time they are
relatively lower cost solutions. 230 5.
6. 7. Additional research is required on older workers, and new issues for such
research have to be identified.
Courses for training of elder and old people aim at acquainting the audience
with the main problems of aging and old age. Main tasks are improvement of
health competence and motivation for healthy lifestyle, application of
contemporary approaches for overcoming the stressogenic situations and
development of skills for obtaining of higher living standard in the
conditions of market economy.
The process of ageing affects all areas of human’s life. Concerning economy,
the impact affects the economic growth, savings, investments, demand,
labour market, pensions, and tax policy. The impact to the social sphere
covers health care, population’s health status, family composition and family
lifestyle, residential conditions and migration of population. Specific feature
of the ageing is its extension. Consequences of ageing discover new
challenges and also numerous problems to be solved. EXERCISES
Task 1
Make an optimistic prognosis for economic and demographic development of the
country and population. Task 2
Make a pessimistic prognosis for economic and demographic development of the
country and population. Task 3
Analyse the economic and demographic problems of your region and suggest

Generic, biosimilars, biotechnological and medicinal products,
biopharmaceuticals
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• be aware of new terminology in the EU pharmaceutical field since
2004, based on Directive 2004/27/EC;
• recognise the newly introduced product, which were for first tine
submitted via European Evaluation Agency – EMEA;
• increase knowledge of comparison of generics and biosimilars;
• differentiate the groups and the products which are included;
• identified, upon official sources the word market of the
biopharmaceuticals where the patent has already soon expired;
• improve the knowledge and understanding of the largest group of
proteins derived from biotechnology, blood-plasma medicinal
products, vaccines, cytokines, interleukins, hormones, gene - and
cell - therapeutic and in vivo diagnostic allergenic products, where
the patent and the data exclusivity is expire and biosimilar product
could be authorised.
The article presents a legislative overview of the medicinal products
from biotechnological source, which are derived from living organisms
so called biosimilars. Since 2004, based on Directive 2004/27/EC the
term “biogeneric” does not exist any more and the therapeutic proteins
including, recombinant human insulin for the treatment of diabetes,
human growth hormone for the treatment of hypo-pituitary dwarfism,
interferon, erythropoietin for the treatment of anaemia in cases of
chronic renal failure, various blotting factors referred to an original
medicinal products are called «boisimilars». All these biological
medicinal product often heterogeneous so that modern analytical 233 methodology could not always characterize them in terms of differences
in conformation, heterogeneity and impurity profiles. Since 20
November 2005 the Marketing authorization way for biosimilars is via
the Centralized Procedure pursuant Regulation (EC) 726/2004, Annex 1.
In year 2006-2007 the number of the submitted medicinal product to
EMEA is 14. The survey follows and discusses the issues which are
necessary for the marketing authorization of all these medicinal
products to prove the safety, efficacy and quality, where appropriate
pre-clinical tests or clinical trials relating to these conditions must be
provided.

AUTHORISATION OF THE BIOSIMILAR
MEDICINAL PRODUCT IN THE EU
Tatyana Benisheva-Dimitrova, Petya Trendafilova THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
Legislative Background for Marketing Authorisation of the
Biosimilar Medicinal Product
Thanks to the development of molecular biology and genetic engineering, new
medicinal products derived from biotechnology are available to healthcare markets,
thanks to the recombinant DNA (r-DNA) technology in the last 20 years used to
manufacture safe and effective therapeutic medicinal products.
Medicinal products from biological source are derived from living organisms
and they are often heterogeneous so that modern analytical methodology could not
always characterize them in terms of differences in conformation, heterogeneity and
impurity profiles. These therapeutic proteins include recombinant human insulin for
the treatment of diabetes, human growth hormone for the treatment of hypo-pituitary
dwarfism, interferon, and erythropoietin for the treatment of anaemia in cases of
chronic renal failure, various blotting factors and many other conditions.
The largest group of proteins derived from biotechnology are, blood-plasma
medicinal products, vaccines, cytokines, interleukins, hormones, gene - and cell therapeutic and in vivo diagnostic allergenic products, these represent and most of
them are heterogenic and the contemporary analyses do not provide method for full
analyses option. Often the analysis method may have product impact. In the last
decade the medicinal products from biological origin are growing extremely and, the
forecast till year 2010 will be nearly 50% of all new marketing authorized product
will be of biotechnological origin (Fig 1 and Fig 2) (1).
The different patent position for biopharmaceutical is complicated by the fact
that “biogenerics” does not exists” with the Review 2005. As the regulation stand,
therapeutically similar products must be different to the original and they cannot rely
on the original data and must submit full market authorisations via the EMEA’
centralised procedure, since 20 November 2005. Many biotech medicinal products are
in process or are already patent expiry and they presents serious part of the
pharmaceutical world market, where the top ten 10 Biopharmaceutical Companies
(Fig 3) (2).
The term „biosimilars” was introduced in March 2004, as the regulations stand,
therapeutically similar products must be different to the original. As such, they cannot
rely on the original data and must therefore submit full market authorisations via
EMEA’s Centralised procedure (the obligatory or preferred route to market for most
biopharmaceutical products). Most EMEA concept papers for biopharmaceutical
medicinal products are directed to the active substance under patent expiry (3). 235 Source: IMS Health, BioGeneriX(1)

Legislative basis of the “biosimilar” for marketing
authorisation in EU
The general requirements for generic products are not sufficient for biosimilar
products because any changes in the manufacturing process may generate significant
differences in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy. The efficacy and safety of a
biosimilar biotech molecule is not necessarily to be the same for all indications.
Therefore, according to the pharmaceutical Review 2005, the applicants for
biosimilar products will have to provide to EMEA specific preclinical and clinical
data for each therapeutic indication and also for new routes of administration (4).

Note: In all Top Company profiles, dollar amounts are in millions (2) An abridged registration procedure which allows an applicant for marketing
authorisation of a generic medicinal product to provide bioequivalence studies instead
of necessary clinical trials. The manufacturer must prove the quality of the generic
medicinal product and since the active substance is already well known for its safety
and efficacy, the generic must only demonstrate its therapeutic equivalence to the
reference product through what are known as bioequivalence studies.
No legal framework has existed for generic medicines derived from
biotechnology before 2004. This deficiency was solved during the review of EU
pharmaceutical legislation, known as the “Pharma Review 2005”. Specific provisions
were adopted in the final text under the co-decision procedure by the European
Council and the European Parliament establishing a legal base for biogenerics where
“similar biological medicinal products“ are possible to be authorised under
condition pointed in the Directive 2004/27/EC.
The Commission published a new Directive 2004/27/EC (4) went into force on
1 November 2005, introduced a legal framework for biosimilar medicines identical to 237 that for generic medicines. Article 10(i) (iii) of the Directive 2001/83/EC together
with Part II, section 4 of Annex 1 provided the guidelines for a biosimilar dossier.
Biological medicinal products are defined in Part I 3.2.1.1 b. of Directive
2003/63/EC with replace the Annex 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The definition in
Article 10 (1) in 2001/83/EC was not applicable for the biological medicinal products
and the concept for “Essential Similarity” was not possible to be used. The medicines
legislation from 2004, amending the Community code on medicinal products for
human use (Directive 2004/27/EC) Article 10, paragraph 4 introduces the
requirements for biosimilars (4,5).
The Directive 2004/27/EC which change the Community Code pointed in
Art 15 out what should be covered by the biological medicinal product similar to the
referent product. They couldn’t be taken as biogenerics because of differences in
the manufacturing processes, used substance, molecular properties and the
therapeutically efficacy. The final text of this new legislation was approved on 31
March 2004 by the Council and was transposed into national law and in effect
throughout the EU by November 2005 (4).
“Where a biological medicinal product which is similar to a reference
biological product does not meet the conditions in the definition of generic
medicinal products, owing to, in particular, differences relating to raw materials or
differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the
reference biological medicinal product, the results of appropriate pre-clinical tests
or clinical trials relating to these conditions must be provided. The type and
quantity of supplementary data to be provided must comply with the relevant
criteria stated in Annex I and the related detailed guidelines. The results of other
tests and trials from the reference medicinal product’s dossier shall not be
provided” (4).
The Directives 2001/83/EC and 2003/63/EG changed of specific marketing
authorization application requirements, additional Modules 1, 2, 3 of the CTD format;
particular the toxicological and clinic profile of Module 4 and 5 shall be provided.
The practical approach depends on the analytical possibility in order to
comply with the “biosimilarity” on the respective manufacturing process, on the
clinical and regulatory experience. The approach could be used for well
characterized biotech medicinal products, all recombinant DNA/Hybridomtechnic
and all products with derivate and conjugate. As biopharmaceuticals are defined by
their production process, any change can impact safety and efficacy and therefore
demands new approval (5).
Both the precise definition and the requirements for this therapeutic category in
Article 10 (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, have created a number of
implications. The process for marketing authorization and preparation of biosimilar
medicinal products is clearer and more precise than in the past, where even in case of
a positive opinion of CHMP like INN Somatropin – trade name Omnitrop (London,
26 June 2003, CPMP/3184/03) - no marketing authorization on Somatropin
(Omnitrop) was granted by the Commission as Omnitrop was not considered to have
well-established use and thus was not authorized till the Directive 2004/27/EC had
come into force. Omnitrop was authorized later like a first biosimilar product
authorized by the Community after Review 2005 was introduced and the Directive
was already in place. During 2006 and 2007 the number of submitted biosimilar
applications to EMEA is 4 and 10 respectively. 238 Figure 4. Biosimilar application to EMEA 2006-2007 The FDA legislation for “follow - on biologics”
The U.S. FDA concedes that it has no framework for “follow-on biologics”
for the vast majority of therapeutic proteins subject to biologic licensing under the
Public Health Service Act. The U.S. FDA concedes that it has no statutory
framework for “follow-on biologics” for the vast majority of therapeutic proteins
subject to biologic licensing under the Public Health Service Act. The U.S. agency
builds a framework for a few large molecule products (human growth hormones,
insulin etc.). An abbreviated process for limited types of biologics, types of tests to
demonstrate structural similarity and comparability, immunogenicity testing
requirements was outlined. Interchange ability for biologics represents a
fundamentally more complex issue an approach and many guidelines were
published. The FDA has pointed out concern for large comparative crossover studies
for interchange ability rating and the acceptance of biosimilars by the medical
community (6,7,8). Approaches dealt with comparability in the EMEA and ICH
guidelines
1. The comparability of biotechnical/biological products subjects to change
in the manufacturing process in the clinical studies and after the marketing
authorisation is subject of ICH guideline - ICH 5QE (10).
The terms “comparability” has two aspects, in the ICH Guidelines 5QE refers
to changes in the established manufacturing processes within the same manufacturer
of an existing biotech medicinal products. In that case the requirements for
demonstrating the comparability are not the same than for demonstrating similarity of
biological product (10).
With Commission Regulation 1085/2003/EC and 1084/2003/EC stipulating the
need for more costly lengthy and complex Type II variation, where simpler IA or IB 239 procedure would be applicable for small molecule. When manufacturer introduce
major changes and then the regulator may view the resulting protein as an entirely
new medicinal product with need to demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy.
1.1 The comparability of biotechnical/biological products subjects to change in
the manufacturing process in the clinical studies (clinical development)
Determinations of product comparability can be based on quality
considerations whether the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability
through analytical studies. Additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is
considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability.
The extent and nature of pre-clinical and clinical studies will be determined on a
case-by-case basis where various factors shall be considered.
1.2. Demonstration of Comparability during Development
During product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the
manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and
efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that preclinical and clinical data generated with pre-change product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and support the marketing
authorisation. Comparability studies conducted for products in development could be
influenced by several of factors such as the stage of product development, the
availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product knowledge,
which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has
with the process.
Comparability of biotechnological/biological products is required. The
comparability exercise should utilise available information and will generally become
more comprehensive. Process changes introduced in late stages of development and
when no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing authorisation,
the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive uses method. In that case
some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to
additional non-clinical or clinical studies.
Due to the limitations of the analytical steps in early clinical development,
physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to
determine comparability, and therefore, bridging pre-clinical and/or clinical studies,
as appropriate, might be needed. In order for a comparability exercise to occur during
development, appropriate assessment tools should be used and analytical procedures
used during development might not be validated, but should provide results that are
reliable and reproducible (10).
1.3. Preclinical and Clinical Considerations
Comparability determination can be based on quality considerations if the
manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies and
additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate
when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability. All non-clinical and
clinical studies are determined on a case-by-case basis in consideration of different
factors, which include quality findings, the nature and the level of knowledge of the
product and existing non-clinical and clinical data, relevant to the product (10,11).
2. The comparability of biotechnical/biological products subjects to
change in the manufacturing process after the marketing authorisation (12)
A determination of comparability can be based on a combination of analytical
testing, biological assays, and, in some cases, nonclinical and clinical data. If a 240 manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies alone,
nonclinical or clinical studies with the post-change product are not warranted.
Where the relationship between specific quality, safety and efficacy issues has
not been established, and differences between quality of the pre- and post-change
product are observed, it might be appropriate to include a combination of quality,
nonclinical, and/or clinical studies in the comparability exercise.
The goal of the comparability exercise is to ensure the quality, safety and
efficacy of drug product produced by a changed manufacturing process, through
collection and evaluation of the relevant data to determine whether there might be any
adverse impact on the drug product due to the manufacturing process changes.
The demonstration of comparability does not mean that the quality issues of
the pre-change and post-change product are identical, but that they are highly similar
and that the existing knowledge could ensure that any differences in quality attributes
have no adverse impact upon safety or efficacy of the product. To identify the impact
of a manufacturing process change, a careful evaluation of all foreseeable
consequences for the product should be performed.
The quality data on the pre- and post-change product are generated, and a
comparison is performed that integrates and evaluates all data collected, e.g.,
− routine batch analyses;
− in-process control;
− process validation/evaluation data;
− characterisation and stability, if appropriate.
The comparison of the results to the predefined criteria should allow an
objective assessment of whether or not the pre- and post-change products are
comparable. The manufacturer could be faced with one of several outcomes, as
follows:
− No adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles is foreseen- pre- and postchange product are highly similar and considered comparable;
− The analytical procedures used are not sufficient to discern relevant
differences that can impact the safety and efficacy of the product, additional
testing (e.g., further characterisation) or nonclinical and/or clinical studies to
reach a definitive conclusion should be performed;
− Differences in the quality attributes of the pre-change and post-change product
observed, it can be justified that no adverse impact on safety or efficacy
profiles is expected, based on the manufacturer’s accumulated experience,
relevant information, and data. In these circumstances, pre- and post-change
product can be considered comparable;
− Comparison of quality attributes and a possible adverse impact on safety and
efficacy profiles cannot be excluded and the manufacturer should consider
performing pre-clinical and/or clinical studies;
− Differences in the quality attributes are so significant that it is determined that
the products are not highly similar and are therefore not comparable.
Pre-clinical or clinical data allows extrapolation of the existing data from the
drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed
process. The products should have highly similar quality attributes biopharmaceutical
product before and after manufacturing process changes and that there is no adverse 241 impact on the safety or efficacy and immunogenicity, of the drug product occurred,
based on an analysis of product quality attributes. Comparability to reference medicinal products of similar
biological medicinal products is subject of the EMEA
guidelines
Biosimilar medicinal products are manufactured and controlled according to their
own development. An extensive comparability exercise is required to demonstrate
that the similar biological and reference products have similar attributes in terms of
quality, safety and efficacy. The quality issues relevant for comparability presenting
of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant DNA-derived
proteins are addressed in the “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products
containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substances: quality issues”
(EMEA/CHMP/49348/05) (13).
When an application for biological medicinal product is containing a
biotechnology-derived medicinal protein as active substance it refers to a reference
medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation by an independent
applicant after the expiry of the data protection period in accordance with Title III
Chapter I, Article 10 as the amended Directive 2001/83/EC (4).
The Marketing Authorisation (MA) application dossier of a biological
medicinal product claimed to be similar to a reference product already authorised
shall provide a full Module 3 (quality dossier) and equivalent efficacy and safety of
the similar biological medicinal product has to be demonstrated as well.
Biological medicines are usually complex and often heterogeneous, no modern
analytical methodology may be adequate for full characterisation following process
change. This is addressed in the released ICH and CHMP guidelines. The Directive
2003/63/EC and the guideline CHMP /BWP/49348/2005 stress that the impact of any
process change need to be considered on a case-by case basis (5,11,13).
This may involve merely testing against the finished product specification but,
in many cases, additional extensive characterisation is required which may need to
include non-clinical and clinical studies. According to the European guidelines, a
manufacturer can claim that a new product is similar to a therapeutic protein already
on the market. The claim should be substantiated concerning quality, safety and
efficacy, which are the three main parts of a new drug application. For all three parts
of the dossier - quality, safety and efficacy of the same innovator product should be
used as a reference.
Reference medicinal product is a medicinal product authorised in the EEA,
on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. The active substance of a similar biological
medicinal product must be similar, in molecular and biological characteristic, to the
active substance of the reference medicinal product.
The same reference product should be used throughout the comparability
program for quality, safety and efficacy studies during the development of a similar
biological medicinal product in order to allow the generation of coherent data and
conclusions.
The pharmaceutical form, strength and route of administration of the similar
biological medicinal product should be the same as that of the reference medicinal 242 product and in case when the pharmaceutical form or the strength or the route of
administration differ, the results of appropriate non-clinical/clinical trials must be
provided in order to demonstrate the safety/efficacy of the similar biological
medicinal product. Any differences between the similar biological medicinal product
and the reference medicinal product will have to be justified by appropriate studies on
a case-by-case basis.
Reference Active Substance - the comparison of the biosimilar active
substance to a publicly available standard as a reference (i.e. Ph.Eur, WHO, etc.) is
not sufficient to demonstrate biosimilarity of the active substance since this material
may not have known and defined safety and efficacy profiles and the manufacturer
generally does not have access to the originator active substance, and cannot directly
compare his active substance to the one used in the originator’s medicinal product.
Based on more than one analytical method the biosimilar manufacturer must
demonstrate, that the active substance used in the comparability exercise is
representative of the active substance present in the reference medicinal product.
Applicant should use various approaches to obtain representative reference
active substance derived from the reference medicinal product in order to perform the
comparative analysis at the active substance level, where this approach should be
appropriately validated. The suitability of the sample preparation process, and should
include the comparison of the biosimilar active substance with active substance
material derived from the reference and the biosimilar medicinal products (12). Comparability exercise for demonstrating biosimilarity analytical methods for biosimilar medicinal products
Characterisation studies “state-of-the-art” should be applied to the biosimilar and
reference medicinal products in parallel at both the active substance and the medicinal
product levels to demonstrate with a high level of assurance that the quality of the
biosimilar product is comparable to the reference medicinal product.
Analytical considerations - suitability of available analytical methods Given the e complexity of the molecule and its inherent heterogeneity, the set of
analytical techniques should represent the state-of-the-art and should be selected by
the manufacturer in order to detect slight differences in the characteristics of the
biotechnology-derived product and the selected methods used in the comparability
exercise would be able to detect differences in all quality aspects.
Biological activity - the comparability exercise should include an assessment
of the biological properties of the similar biological medicinal product and the
reference medicinal product. Biological assays using different approaches to measure
the biological activity should be considered as appropriate. The results of relevant
biological assay(s) should be provided and expressed in units of activity calibrated
against an international or national reference standard, when available and appropriate
and these assays should comply with appropriate European Pharmacopoeia
requirements for biological assays, if applicable (10).
Purity and impurities - the purity and impurity profiles of the active
substance and medicinal product should be assessed both qualitatively and
quantitatively by a combination of analytical procedures for both reference and
biosimilar products. Tithe manufacturer developing biosimilar products would
normally not have access to all necessary information that could allow a comparison 243 with the reference medicinal product. Information provides conclusions on the purity
and impurity profiles. The impurities in the biosimilar product should be identified
and compared to the reference product using state-of-the-art technologies and
depending on the impurity it my be necessary to conduct trials in order to prove that
there is no adverse impact of the surveyed biosimilar product.
Specifications are defined as described in ICH Q6B: Note for Guidance on
Specifications:
Test
Procedures
and
Acceptance
Criteria
for
Biotechnological/Biological. (16) The acceptance criteria should be described and
each acceptance criteria should be established and justified based on data obtained
from lots used in nonclinical and/or clinical studies, and by data from lots used for the
demonstration of manufacturing consistency, data from stability studies, relevant
development data and data obtained from the comparability exercise (quality, safety
and efficacy).
The goal of the comparability exercise is to ensure the quality, safety and
efficacy of drug product produced by a changed manufacturing process, through
collection and evaluation of the relevant data to determine whether there might be any
adverse impact on the drug product due to the manufacturing process changes. Conclusion
The demonstration of comparability does not necessarily mean that the quality
attributes of the pre-change and post-change product are identical, but that they are
highly similar and that the existing knowledge is sufficiently predictive to ensure that
any differences in quality attributes have no adverse impact upon safety or efficacy of
the drug product.
Although in Europe a regulatory path for approval of “biogenerics” was no
longer possible, before end 2005 the regulatory path of biosimilars is directed to
demonstrate considerable quality pre-clinical and clinical data.
The Regulatory authorities are breaking new grounds in regards with the
biosimilar products. The balanced approach adopted by EMEA regarding the
additionally published guidelines for biosimilars after Directive 2004/27/EC will
allow evaluation on a case by case basis and the well defined framework can be built
up on the based of the scientific knowledge.
The extent and the nature of non-clinical tests and clinical studies on biosimilar
products are determined in consideration of various factors. According to Review
2005, many guidelines specifying the “appropriate pre-clinical tests or clinical trials”
clarifying the general requirements for biological products in terms of safety and
efficacy are issued. Nonetheless, there are still many questions about the data required
to demonstrate biosimilarity with a biological reference product and how companies
will manage after having received scientific advice by EMEA and new additional
guidelines:
− Immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins
(guideline) Biosimilar medicinal products containing recombinant interferon
alpha (guideline)
− Biosimilar medicinal products containing low molecular weight heparins
(guidelines) are available (17). 244 EXERCISE

E-mail: [email protected] Keywords health policy, evidence based policy, research, health strategy Learning
objectives After completing this module students should:
• know the definition and characteristics of evidence based health policy;
• be familiar with designing phase of health strategy;
• be familiar with planning phase of health strategy.
In recent years we have seen the successful implementation of new
methods in formulating health policy, based on sound research data –
the so called evidence based policy. This new approach to health policy
helps experts formulate decisions on the basis of good information
concerning programs and projects, through presenting supporting
evidence from research, which in turn becomes the core for political
development and implementation. We decided to analyze the project
for a National health strategy 2007-2012 of Bulgaria and see how well
it corresponds to the principles of evidence based policy. Critical
evaluation of the last draft of the National health strategy 2007-2012
reveals a number of weaknesses due to the documents’ inconformity
with the basic principles of evidence based policy making. We
conclude with a discussion on possible implications for Bulgaria’s
health policy.
An introductory lecture will gives the students first insight in characteristics of
evidence based health policy. The theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a
case study. After introductory lectures students should first carefully read the
recommended readings. Afterwards they can discuss the case study with other
students.
In continuation, they need to find published materials (e.g. papers) on
evidence based health policy and present their findings to other students. Abstract Teaching methods 247 Specific

APPROACHES. THE BULGARIAN NATIONAL
HEALTH STRATEGY 2007-2012
Petko Salchev, Nikolay Hristov, Lidia Georgieva THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Policy (coming from the Greek word politike, meaning power) can be defined as the
goal-oriented activities of empowered individuals or groups in a given society. Health
policy in reality aims the distribution of a nation’s limited resources in such a manner,
so as to produce the best possible public health results. The state health policy
represents the officially accepted long-term strategy for development of the national
health system. It should be noted that a common weakness of many contemporary
healthcare reforms is the insufficient attention paid to setting priorities and their
ranking according to social significance. Possible priorities are essential public health
problems, e.g. coronary incidents; sectors of the health system requiring high priority
development, e.g. emergency care; population groups requiring guaranteed health
services provision, e.g. retired persons. The process of policy formulation is so
fundamental that any future steps become impossible until we have a clear idea what
our goals are and to what end will certain strategic tasks lead us. Political consensus
and the support of society and media are quite necessary in setting out public health
priorities (2).
In recent years we see the successful implementation of new methods in
formulating health policy, based on sound research data – the so called evidence
based policy. This is a new approach to health policy, which helps experts to take
decisions on the basis of good information concerning programs and projects, through
presenting supporting evidence from research, which in turn become the core for
political development and implementation (8).
Evidence-based policy is public policy informed by rigorously established
objective evidence. From a historical perspective, it can be thought of as an extension
of the idea of evidence-based medicine to all areas of public policy. Evidence based
policy is particularly associated with the name of the distinguished British statistician
Adrian Smith – a former president of the Royal Statistical Society. Smith is famous as
a proponent of Bayesian statistics and evidence based practice — a general extension
of the concept of evidence based medicine into all areas of public policy. In accord
with Bayesian statistics the notion of policy based evidence making also emerged –
this is a pejorative term which refers to the commissioning of research in order to
support a policy which has already been decided upon. As the name suggests, policy
based evidence making means working retrospectively from a predefined policy to
produce underpinning evidence. Working from a conclusion to provide only
supporting evidence in favour of already running policy should be distinguished from
the method of research into the effects of a policy where such research may prove
either supporting or contradicting.
The term ‘policy based evidence making’ was referred to in a report of the UK
House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology into Scientific 249 Advice, Risk and Evidence Based Policy Making issued in October 2006, but in a
somehow negative light. The committee stated that ministers should not seek
selectively to pick pieces of evidence which support an already agreed policy, or even
commission research in order to produce a justification for policy (9).
A distinguishing aspect of evidence-based policy is the use of scientifically
rigorous studies such as randomized controlled trials to identify in advance programs
and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. A very general
definition of research would be ‘any systematic effort to increase the stock of
knowledge’. According to the Oxford Concise English Dictionary ‘evidence’ means
information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. Different types
of evidence exist, like systematic reviews, single research studies, pilot studies and
case studies, experts’ opinions, information available on the Internet. While
randomized controlled trials are widely considered to provide the most reliable form
of scientific evidence in the clinical care context, the complexity of the health policy
context demands different types of evidence. Observational studies, qualitative
research and even ‘experience’, ‘know-how’, consensus and ‘local knowledge’ should
also be taken into account. It is often difficult to apply rigid hierarchies of evidence to
health policy like this is practiced in evidence-based medicine. Evidence can be used
to help improve understanding of an issue, influence policy thinking and assist in the
communication and defence of decisions. It could be used in the different stages of
the policy process: at the creation of the policy; in its development; in its
implementation; and in its defence/justification. Probably most important, is that
robust evidence gives government officials confidence in their decisions and the
ability to defend these decisions in the face of possible criticism.
There is a long tradition of evidence-based and evidence-informed policy
within the UK. Building on the thinking in the Modernizing Government White
Paper, the Cabinet Office published ‘Professional Policy Making for the 21st
Century’ in 1999 (11). This identified nine core competencies, sometimes referred to
as the ‘nine principles’ of good policy making. The distinguished features of
professional policy included “using evidence’ as well. Throughout ‘Professional
Policy Making for the 21st Century’, there is a strong emphasis that policy making
should be based on evidence of what works and that the civil service must improve
departments’ capacity to make best use of evidence. To enable this to happen, the
report called on departments to ‘improve the accessibility of the evidence available to
policy makers’. More recently, the ‘Professional Skills for Government’ initiative has
been developed as a key part of the government’s delivery and reform agenda to
ensure the whole of the civil service has the right mix of skills and expertise to enable
department or agencies to deliver effective services (12). Within this framework of
skills and experiences necessary for any civil servant to do their job well are four core
skills, one of which is ‘analysis and use of evidence’. Under this core skill, policy
makers are expected to:
− anticipate and secure appropriate evidence;
− test for deliverability of policy/practice – and evaluate;
− use evidence to challenge decision making;
− identify ways to improve policy/practice;
− champion a variety of tools to collect/use evidence;
− ensure use of evidence is consistent with wider government requirements;
− work in partnership with a wide range of experts/analysts. 250 A British report clearly identified the factors that facilitate the use of evidence
and factors that impede it. The main factors associated with ‘useful’ evidence that can
lead to better policy making were: good timing of the analysis with long-term data
collection; resource availability, in terms of research budgets and policy and
analytical staff capacity; quality of the evidence; availability of the required evidence;
presentation of the evidence; focus of reports and other forms of evidence: analytical
findings relating directly to the area of interest; trustworthiness of available evidence:
is it from a credible source (4)?
Evidence based policy is generally a discourse or set of methods which
informs the policy process, rather than one which aims directly to affect the eventual
goals of the policy. It advocates a more rational, rigorous and systematic approach.
The pursuit of such policy is based on the premise that policy decisions should be
better informed by available evidence, and should include rational analysis. Policy
and practice which are based on systematic evidence are seen to produce better
outcomes. The desired progression is a shift away from opinion based policies being
replaced by a more rigorous, rational approach that gathers, critically appraises and
uses high quality research evidence to inform policymaking and professional practice.
The issues governments should consider when trying identifying what evidence is
useful are:
− Accuracy: Is the evidence correctly describing what it purports to do?
− Objectivity: The quality of the approach taken to generate evidence and the
objectiveness of the source, as well as the extent of contestation regarding
evidence.
− Credibility: This relates to the reliability of the evidence and therefore whether
we can depend on it for monitoring, evaluation or impact assessments.
− Generalisability: Is there extensive information or are there just selective cases
or pilots?
− Relevance: Whether evidence is timely, topical and has policy implications.
− Availability: The existence of (good) evidence.
− Rootedness: Is evidence grounded in reality?
− Practicalities: Whether policymakers have access to the evidence in a useful
form and whether the policy implications of the research are feasible and
affordable (5).
According to the World Health Organization, one of the greatest challenges
facing the member states is how to ensure access to safe and effective health services
for those population groups most in need. Strengthening health systems is a core part
of this challenge. However, more evidence is needed about what works in terms of
health system strengthening, and under what conditions. WHO estimates that health
policy and systems research (HPSR) was neglected for many years, and while some
other areas, such as health financing, are nowadays much better understood than some
20 years ago, other issues, such as how to retain and motivate the health workforce or
what service delivery models work best in resource-constrained developing countries,
remain poorly understood. Unlike other types of health research, health policy and
systems research needs to be rooted in and remain responsive to national needs.
Health systems and social, economic and political contexts vary so widely that there
is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for health system strengthening. Instead, every country 251 needs sufficient capacity to analyze its own health system and, drawing on
international experience, develop and evaluate its own health system-strengthening
strategies. Developing national capacity for health policy and systems research is
critical – but may not be enough. National governments also need to ensure that
research gets synthesized, summarized and packaged in ways that policy-makers and
civil society representatives can use, and that policy-makers have sufficient capacity
to access and apply these research findings. As developing societies become
increasingly democratic, it is even more important that research evidence is widely
accessible and can be used by multiple stakeholders, both governmental and nongovernmental, to inform of their policy positions. Capacity in itself is a widely but
often superficially used term. Capacity issues mainly arise with the different aspects
of the relationship between two key groups – policy-makers and researchers. The
ability of policy-makers to draw on appropriate evidence is often restricted by its
availability. Generating appropriate, trustworthy evidence depends in turn on the
existence of good research organizations. At present, the capacity of such
organizations in low- and middle- income countries is generally inadequate.
Founders’ attention has historically focused on developing the skills of
individual researchers. True capacity-strengthening strategies for the future, in
contrast, need to focus on the comprehensive needs of academic and administrative
institutions, including overall skills and career development, development of
leadership, governance and administrative systems, and strengthening networks
among the research community, both nationally and internationally. Over recent years
there has been noted at least a proliferation of literature focusing on knowledge and
how to get it into health policy and practice. Ever since the 1990s the ‘evidence based
medicine’ movement has advocated the greater and more direct use of research
evidence in the making of clinical decisions, and this was later broadened into a call
for more evidence-based policy as opposed to policies determined through opinions or
political biases. Much of this interest arose from the perception that even when
research provides solutions, these are not necessarily translated into policy and
practice. Health policy and systems research can address any or all of the 6 ‘building
blocks’ of health systems identified in the World Health Organization’s Framework
for Action on health systems from 2007, namely: service delivery, information and
evidence, medical products and technologies, health workforce, health financing,
leadership and governance. The conceptual framework developed by WHO proposes
four main functions of evidence-informed policy-making: research priority-setting,
knowledge generation and dissemination, filtering and amplification of evidence, and
policy-making. Filtering is a function through which stakeholders determine which
research is most relevant as the evidence base for their respective arguments in the
policy-making process. Amplification is a function through which stakeholders seek
to make the evidence base of their arguments generally accepted as a means of
increasing influence on policy-making. This whole framework is supposed to help in
developing and evaluating national strategies for enhancing capacity. Some important
new considerations include: previous capacity development initiatives have tended to
focus exclusively on the production of evidence rather than on capacity to use
evidence in policy processes; greater investment is needed in assessing whether the
currently employed capacity-building strategies are effective.
Policy-making is generally a complex, non-linear, incremental and messy
process. Many factors have the potential to influence policy-making, including 252 context (e.g. election cycles, state of government’s finances, health systems
governance structures, media hype and unforeseen political crises) and the ideologies
and values of the policy-makers themselves. Indeed, although the ‘engineering’ model
of how knowledge is incorporated into policy suggests a linear progression from
identifying a problem that requires a policy solution to ranking the objectives and
weighing alternative policy options, this is rarely seen in real life. The actual steps of
the policy process depend on national features and especially on policy structures and
mechanisms. Nevertheless, stages in the policy process typically identified are:
agenda setting, policy formulation, implementation and evaluation. In fact, evidence
can be used at any of these stages.
WHO has also proposed a tool for self-assessing the effective use of research
evidence. The tool focuses on four different aspects of organizational capacity, each
having its implications for staff skills: can the organization identify the necessary
research; can the organization assess its findings in terms of reliability, relevance, and
applicability; can the organization present properly the research to decision makers;
does the organization possess the necessary skills, structures, processes and culture to
promote and use research (6)?
At the World Health Assembly held in Geneva in May 2005, debates how to
harness health research more effectively in order to achieve the United Nations’
Millennium Development Goals in low- and middle- income countries culminated in
the passage of a two-part resolution that established specific accountabilities for
developing mechanisms to support the use of research evidence in developing health
policy. The first part of the resolution called on WHO member states to “establish or
strengthen mechanisms to transfer knowledge in support of evidence-based public
health and health-care delivery systems, and evidence-based health-related policies.’
The second part of the resolution called on WHO’s Director-General to “assist in the
development of more effective mechanisms to bridge the divide between ways in
which knowledge is generated and ways in which it is used, including the
transformation of health-research findings into policy and practice.’ Organizations
have already been established in many countries and internationally to support the use
of research evidence. These include, among others, organizations that directly support
the use of research evidence in developing health policy on an international, national,
and provincial level (the so called ‘government support units’). While there are
important differences among these organizations, there are also many commonalities
and opportunities for existing and new organizations to learn from this collective
experience. A recent Norwegian study has found seven main implications for those
establishing or administering organizations to support the use of research evidence in
developing health policy:
1. Collaborate with other organizations;
2. Establish strong links with policymakers and involve stakeholders in the work;
3. Be independent and manage conflicts of interest among those involved in the
work;
4. Build capacity among those working in the organization;
5. Use good methods and be transparent in the work;
6. Start small, have a clear audience and scope, and address important questions;
7. Be attentive to implementation considerations even if implementation is not a
remit. 253 The study’s four main implications for the World Health Organization and
other international organizations include: support collaborations among organizations;
support local adaptation efforts; mobilize support; create knowledge-related global
public goods, including methods and evidence syntheses (7). CASE STUDY: THE BULGARIAN EXPERIENCE
With all this in mind we decided to analyze the project for a National health strategy
2007-2012 of Bulgaria and see how well it corresponds to the principles of an
evidence based policy. First, we would like to make several introductory comments
on Bulgaria as a country in transition and the health system of Bulgaria in particular.
Bulgaria is situated in the eastern part of the Balkans and has an approximate
population of 7.8 million, with the demographic characteristics of a rapidly aging
society. The establishment of a new constitution in 1991 set in motion the process of
introducing a democratic form of government. Despite a large decrease in mortality
since 1990, the country’s mortality rate is still high compared to old European Union
Member States. Mortality rates from heart and circulatory diseases have increased,
representing 66.1% of all deaths in 2005. The infant mortality rate in Bulgaria was
11.6 per 1000 live births in 2004, which was more than twice as high as that in the 25
European Union Member States.
Health reforms commenced in the 1990s brought about wide-ranging changes
in health care organization, financing and delivery, and a new type of relationship was
established between users, providers and payers. Reforms were aimed at making the
health system more efficient and responsive to patients’ needs, by means of
improvements in quality of service and delivery of care. The establishment of the
National Health Insurance Fund and a basic benefits package defined the services
covered by the public sector and designated the revenue collection for health care
allowing for more sustainability of the healthcare budget (Fig. 1).
However, a financing system solely based on contributions failed to provide
adequate funding for the system. Approximately one million people opting out of
universal coverage meant that there were significantly fewer contributors than
beneficiaries and this led to potential adverse effects on the financial balance of the
National Health Insurance Fund. Legalization of private practice has had a positive
impact on access to health services and the resulting competition among health care
providers proved an incentive for higher-quality of service provision (Figure 2).
However, widespread commercialization of health care and a growing focus on
market relations exerted an overall adverse impact on the social functions of
healthcare. A restructured primary care and the introduction of GPs as gatekeepers to
specialized care allowed for cost-containment but led to ardent discussions whether
such policies violate the principles of free provision and access to health care for the
population.
The restructuring of inpatient health care financing and provision was followed by the
introduction of clinical pathways as a reimbursement instrument. This created better
incentives for improving both quality and effectiveness of service provision.
However, the actual cost of implementing clinical pathways for the hospital is
higher than the price reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Fund, which causes
chronic financial instability in the inpatient sector. Insufficient funding of multiprofile hospital settings gave rise to a subsequent lack of motivation among medical 254 care providers. Public health challenges and elucidated structural defects of the health
system were supposed to be addressed by the new National health strategy of
Bulgaria. Figure 1. Overview of the health system of Bulgaria (1). Critical evaluation of the last draft of the National health strategy 2007-2012 reveals a
number of weaknesses due to the documents’ inconformity with the basic principles 255 of evidence based policy making. The document replicates to a large extent the
preceding National health strategy 2001-2010 which in turn replicates the WHO paper
“Investment in health’ from the 1990s. The project pretends to constitute a health
strategy but is, in reality, an action plan for reforming the healthcare system and is
unrelated to the actual public health status of the nation. Further, we will comment on
the major weaknesses of this paper in more detail. Figure 2. Overview of Bulgaria’s health system regulation (1). This is a typical example of a document not based on evidence, i.e. research
findings, but instead on the opinions of a group of experts or, the so called anecdotal
evidence. The document goes in great detail describing the healthcare system of
Bulgaria, its distinctive features and weak spots, but fails to pay any attention to the
state of public health and the actual health needs of the citizens of Bulgaria. Such
paper is clearly targeted inside, at solving problems of structural defects of the health
system; where it should be targeted outside, at tackling the population’s health needs.
The strategy doesn’t even demonstrate intent to deal with the health and quality of life
of Bulgarian population, instead focusing exclusively on intrinsic problems of the
healthcare system. A retrospective depiction of the healthcare system and allowed
weaknesses is provided, while it would be more useful to pinpoint essential problems
in the nation’s health state, as well as indicate ways of solving them in combination
with short- and middle-term objectives plus clear indicators for evaluation. 256 The strategy doesn’t engage with a single feasible goal related to improved
population health, a goal furthermore administratively and financially backed;
unfortunately the strategy sounds rather like the paper of an administration thinking
that public health is entirely a product of the health system’s functioning. The
proposed strategy neither protects the rights, nor defines the health-related
responsibilities of Bulgarian citizens; instead it stipulates the way in which, according
to the Ministry of Health, this system should be structured, without taking into
account the interests of these same citizens. Going into even more detail we can easily
note that: the introduction does not make reference to the health state of the nation,
but it takes several pages to describe all systemic defects of the healthcare system. A
strategy with such accent and scope should be named more properly a strategy for
restructuring the health system and not a national health strategy. A passage states
that “The result of this strategy should be a reformed, financially stable and effective
health system, capable of providing quality care in prevention, prophylaxis, treatment
and rehabilitation…,’ clearly indicating that the expected outcome is a systemic
change and not improved health and quality of life.
The section “Health state of the population’ does not provide actual data,
instead citing data ranging from 2000 to 2005 which speaks of unfamiliarity with the
real health problems of the population; this is despite the fact that the last revision of
this paper is dated September 2007. This is a good illustration of the point that the
National health strategy does not refer to actual health needs and is not founded on
scientific evidence. The section on social determinants of health sets out a very bad
example as it quotes no single result or conclusion, instead stating pointlessly that
“The relation between health and socio-economic medium in a state is direct.
Consequently, to achieve positive results we need direct actions to improve the
medium in which a man lives, works and realize his social contacts.’ Another
unfortunate example of the way a strategy is being mechanically filled with
meaningless phrases is “realizing the significance and need for timely measures’ in
the section “functioning of the healthcare system – system management.’ An example
of the lack of ability to create a coherent text and “jumping to conclusions’ is the
following text taken from the section “Financing the health system’: “In comparison
to the average parameters of the insurance contribution in the EU which ranges from
8 to 12%, the insurance contribution in Bulgaria is 6%. The combination of low
insurance contribution, lack of guarantees for complete fundraising and a high
dropout rate from the insurance system (about 1mln Bulgarian citizens) is defining.’
The authors of the draft strategy do not leave the impression of truly knowing
the Bulgarian health system and understanding its hierarchical structure. For example
they conclude that the increasing number of patients seeking specialist and hospital
care can be attributed to a deficit of financial resources in outpatient care. The
introduction of a uniform emergency number 112 is erroneously set as a goal of the
National health strategy when it is in fact an element of Bulgaria’s accession to EU
and is of little importance for public health issues in itself. Throughout the entire text
the terms “stomatology” and “dental medicine” are being mixed up. According to the
new legislation only the use of the second term is correct. This mistake may be
illustrative of the rash and incoherent manner in which such an important document
has been prepared.
It is a little surprising to find in section “Hospital care’ the comment that some
hospitals have social functions (e.g. care for terminally ill patients, long-term medical 257 care and continuous rehabilitation) as well, which depletes their financial resources.
However, these functions are their legal obligation according to Bulgarian health
legislation. The heavy usage of hollow terminology, unsupported by concrete
examples or proposed measures does not increase the credibility of the document.
This can be noted on numerous occasions, e.g. with terms used like “creating
democratic medium for population inclusion and transparencies in taking political
decisions’; “raising capacity of all stakeholders for performing political analyses
aimed at improving inter-sector dialogue’; “forming knowledge base for population
health and its determinants.’ A striking example of the National strategy’s superfluous
and emptied of essence language is the expression “a build-up of a system of criteria
for defining priorities in implementing market control, based on risk evaluation…’
Typical of the proposed strategy is the constant usage of the terms “implementation of
a national program’ and “implementation of a national plan’, meaning the strategy has
as its goals the realization of certain programs; when in reality a strategy is supposed
to serve as a basis for establishing such national strategies and action plans. High
immunization coverage is set as a goal without even specifying what communicable
diseases are meant, where immunization coverage could be deemed insufficient and
what should be achieved. In this line of thought all mentions of socially-significant
diseases go without unequivocally declaring what diseases in Bulgaria are meant and
what are the related problems for society. Without even mentioning previously
problems of children health and children risk groups in Bulgaria, the strategy jumps to
the establishment of health cabinets in schools, i.e. a structural problem of the health
system. Some technical mistakes raise doubt if the proposed texts have been
reviewed after their initial formulation. For example, the section concerning socially
significant diseases confuses program and grant principle of financing – the authors
seem unaware of the difference between program planning and participation in
financing based on the grant scheme.
The introduction of a European health insurance card is proposed in the
strategy, but in fact this card has already been introduced in Bulgaria. A very
disturbing tendency in Bulgaria is the preparation of important documents by small
groups of low-profile or completely anonymous experts, working hastily on political
errands. This is how we explain the appearance in the proposed national health
strategy of a number of new ideas, bringing radical changes to the existing health
system. It comes as no surprise that immediately after its presentation the draft
strategy gave rise to heated disputes. Several representative examples follow. The
document introduces a new type of health facilities – one for health tourism;
unforeseen by the existing Bulgarian legislation. The strategy indicates an upper limit
of 1500 patients in the list of a GP and a number of other measures which have not
been discussed with the Association of general practitioners in Bulgaria like the
introduction of stimuli to form group practices (again failing to mention any particular
and feasible measures) and increasing payments for service, as well as lowering
payments per capita for a listed patient, a measure which, by the way, is clearly going
to lead to a surge of costs.
The section “Restructuring and effective management of hospital care’
foresees the establishment of a package of outpatient services to be concluded in
hospitals and reimbursed by the health insurance fund which comes again as a
surprise since it contradicts all common to this day practice in Bulgaria. A new type
of hospital financing suddenly appears in the text – one through a global budget. The 258 explicitly mentioned regulation and limitation of new contracts of the National Health
Insurance Fund with health services providers is an outright violation of the
legislation in force and the right of a free initiative for providers. This measure, if
enacted, will most probably strip citizens of their right of choice of provider and will
exacerbate corruption problems in the Bulgarian healthcare system. The role of
professional organizations like the Bulgarian Physicians Union and the contracting
principle in relations between the National Health Insurance Fund and such
organizations is completely ignored or nullified throughout the whole text. A change
in the form of relations is stated without even bothering to mention what will change
and why should it change. A significant change in the health insurance model is the
declared introduction of complementary universal health insurance. It remains unclear
whether such a step is really necessary and where to should this additional financial
resource be directed. An interesting goal of the strategy is the creation in Bulgaria of a
uniform methodology for pricing of medical services, such methodology is supposed
to serve then as a basis for forming all financial plans in the healthcare sector. This
sounds like a worthy goal, but since such methodology doesn’t exist anywhere else
worldwide, we get the impression that many declarations in the strategy are present
there simply because they sound good.
The strategy proposes also the refinement of the existing instruments for price
formation in hospital care. In reality, such an attempt will bring forth an even greater
dissent among the medical community in Bulgaria. The currently used clinical
pathways (which were never meant as financial instruments at their creation) proved
very unsuccessful; perhaps it will be a better idea to abandon them completely and
continue with the preparation for the adoption of Diagnostic Related Groups. A wide
consensus has already been formed on that matter in Bulgaria. However critical we
have been so far, the section “Indicators for evaluation’ is clearly the weakest part of
the strategy. Curiously, the section that should have been most specific and
demonstrate the serious intentions of the state in implementing the national strategy,
contains no single fact or number. It remains a mystery how to evaluate the
implementation of this strategy when there are no milestones and final goals. The
standard for monitoring should be described in the strategy but instead we learn form
the text that the monitoring mechanism will be created at some later stage. The text is
abundant in formal phrases like ‘Standards for measuring the achieved progress will
be in conformity with the set goals. The chosen standards should be feasible. They
will be defined on the basis of concrete data…’ A set of public health indicators is
nevertheless enumerated but not a single indication from where we come and where
we will end. For example birth rate and infant mortality are among the chosen
indicators, but they are just listed, without concrete values (even at present) and the
values we desire to reach in 2013 as a result of the implementation of the national
strategy.
To summarize, in our opinion the proposed strategy is elaborated in a very
formal manner, bears the marks of wishful and bureaucratic thinking, does not
demonstrate good knowledge of the Bulgarian health system and does not live up to
the contemporary standards of policy making in developed countries. It will be hard
to find justification for the existence of this document and the proposed strategy
cannot be expected in good conscience to be ever implemented and yield any useful
results (3). 259 The fate of the proposed national health strategy is to this day unenviable.
Perhaps this should come as no surprise in view of its numerous weaknesses (13). The
currently active National health strategy is dated 2001-2010. The enactment of a new
health strategy has been the ambition of the Bulgarian government, dominated by
socialists, which came in power in 2005. This logical step has been in line with the
declared ambitious plans of socialists to restructure public sectors. The strategy itself
was written in 2006 and is a product of experts working for the Ministry of Health or
affiliated with it. An interesting fact is the unwillingness of these experts to have their
names associated with this program document consequently it remained an
anonymous creation. The Prime Minister made a public promise to have the strategy
operational since March 2007, an ambition which proved ungrounded. Ever since its
first presentation (end of 2006) in front of a wider audience, the strategy attracted
only harsh critiques. It has been consequently rejected by all stakeholders in
Bulgaria’s healthcare sector. One such example follows. The document was presented
by the Minister of Health on May 09 2006 in front of an extended National Council of
the Bulgarian Physicians Union, including also representatives of the academic
community, ministers, deputies and representatives of patients’ organizations.
Following the discussion the National Council made a statement rejecting the
proposed strategy and citing its numerous weaknesses. The Bulgarian Physicians
Union considers a main weakness the preparation of the strategy without any
participation from physicians and patients. Other cited weaknesses coincide to a great
extent with our own findings: health needs, priorities and concrete steps are omitted
form the strategy. Furthermore, the strategy speaks of essential administrative reforms
in Bulgarian healthcare without a preceding proper public discussion. Financial
parameters are missing. The national council proposed scrapping the existing project
and the preparation of new one by a workgroup, including representatives from the
Ministry of Health, the Bulgarian Physicians Union and patients’ organizations. The
final draft should contain clear responsibilities of all institutions implementing the
strategy, as well as explicitly stated terms and necessary resources (10).
In 2007 the draft of the new national health strategy has been rejected three
times by the Council of Ministers. Regardless, the strategy draft is proposed again and
again with minor corrections, a good indication of the limited capacity of the Ministry
of Health in preparing such documents. Discussion
The technology traditionally used widely in Bulgaria to prepare important political
documents is outdated and the case of the National health strategy 2007-2012 clearly
illustrates that. Institutional capacity – the ability of government experts to find and
incorporate evidence, is very weak and so is interface – the ability of these experts to
communicate with the academic community as a possible source of such evidence.
Wider adoption of the principles of evidence based policy making can do much to
advance Bulgarian health policy. REFERENCES

Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Health technology is a complex issue. It is the ground for effective health protection,
prevention and treatment of diseases, diminishing of people’s pains and sufferings,
and above all supporting human development, economic prosperity and quality of life.
In the same time it is important as powerful health industry, consuming considerable
social and economic resources of all countries.
“Technology” has different meanings: Techne (Greek word) means art, skill,
craft. The practical meanings today are: industrial science; applied science; any
practical art utilizing scientific knowledge(1). In practice it is connected with physical
objects (machines, mechanical tools, chemical agents, computers), sometimes called
hardware, equipment, instruments and gadgets. Today the term includes also
social methods and know-how (even people who work with them and organization of
work) called also software, procedures and techniques. In the working material of
the Alma-Ata Conference 1978, it was stated: ”Technology is the totality of methods,
techniques and equipment together with the people using them”.
Health technology was and is now the basis of health culture, closely related
with it. Historical development of technology is the consequence of general technical,
economic social and cultural development and circumstances, but also contributing to
understanding of human beings and supporting development of other technologies,
especially bio-technologies. Historically one may differentiate big medical schools
like Ayurvedic, Chinese, Unani, Arabic, African, South American, Cloister
Medicine… Besides there always (and today) existed traditional and popular folk
medicine. Traditional medicine and traditional healers are known as: herbalists, bonesetters, spiritual healers, traditional birth attendances. Broadly spread and more active
is popular, folk, indigenous, fringe medicine and self-care, a combination of tradition,
popular believes, interpretation of experiences of people with official health care, and
at present also marketing messages about drugs, natural products, “healthy diets” etc.
“Scientific”, biomedical, medicine and professionally trained health workers today
occupy the dominant official position, although their position is in practice shared
with folk medicine, complementary and alternative medicine and trade of different
kinds of healers. Basically contemporary health practice is based on an allopathic
approach to medicine (treating abnormalities by procedures with opposite effect than
the signs of disease are showing, aiming to reach normal balance). New big
expectations are vibrant today by new scientific successes in genetics, bio-molecular
techniques, nano-technologies and new knowledge about human genome. However,
the big expectations should not stop small steps forward in medicine in all directions.
Scientific dreams and realistic empiricism have to progress together. 265 Kinds and types of health technologies
The kind of technology one may divide according to purpose of their use: from
supporting longevity and promoting health to cure and rehabilitation, restoring of
functions. The tendency today is to speak about prevention and mostly cure of
illnesses. Notion of social determinants of health is and was suppressed long time for
political reasons, particularly in practical health activities. The same is with a dream
about longevity, asking for more years to be added to life, instead of looking for more
life to be added to years. The same is shown by orientation towards diseases
contributing to mortality, and not enough attention paid to rehabilitation and diseases
producing handicaps and poor quality of life.
The mixture of types of health technologies is of great interest for practice of
health services. Within the complex health technology one could identify three broad
types of interventions using very different approaches and run increasingly by
specialists (medical specialists and healers who a very far one of another (e.g.
psychiatrists and priests from biochemists and cytologists). However, often and even
usually, these different types of health technologies have to be combined together and
integrated, if one would try to achieve best results. The broadly defined types of
health technologies are:
1. Human care and support, including psychotherapy and spiritual medicine;
2. Drugs, biological and chemical medicaments, including biochemical
diagnostics;
3. Physical medicine and surgery, including “imaging” diagnostics.
In a way this division is following the division of traditional medicine: magicians
(spiritual healers), herbalists and bone-setter. Today the second group (particularly
pharmacological treatment) absolutely predominates in health practice, particularly
because the first type of technologies (human care and support) is diminishing in spite
of growing needs and requests. The first type of technologies is therefore increasingly
more present in all kinds of alternative medical services as well as in all kinds of
malpractices (2-6).
Another useful division of health technologies is according to objects of
application: individuals; groups; communities; general public and environment. For
instance, to solve the problem of alcoholism one may choose and combine individual
treatment, group work, familial approach, health education of community and/or
change in environment (production and prices of alcoholic beverages, new social way
of entertainment etc).
Very important division of health technologies is according to cost of
equipment per workplace. The economist EF Schumacher(7) stated in his book
“Small is beautiful: economics as if people mattered” (1973): “If we define the level
of technology in terms of “equipment cost per workplace”, we can call the indigenous
technology of a typical developing country – symbolically speaking – a one-pound
technology, while that of developed countries could be called a 1,000-pound
technology. The gap between these two technologies is so enormous that a transition
from one to the other is simply impossible. In fact a current attempt of developing
countries to infiltrate the 1,000-pound technology into their economies inevitably kills
off the one-pound technology at an alarming rate, destroying traditional workplaces
much faster than modern workplaces can be created, and thus leaves the poor in a
more desperate and helpless position than ever before. If the effective help is to be 266 brought to those who need it most, a technology is required, which would range in
some intermediate position between the one-pound technology and 1,000-pound
technology. Let us call it – again symbolically speaking – 100-pound technology”.
This statement written many years ago is still valid, and not only for very poor
countries, than also for middle developed countries. The technology used at the
primary level (in primary health care), both in developed and developing countries,
should be an intermediate cost technology, 100-pound technology.
There are three additional questions important for appropriate use of
technologies in practice: AT (Appropriate technology for actual needs), TA
(Technology Assessment and monitoring its use), TT (Technology transfer and its
influence). Appropriate technology (AT)
Appropriate technology is technology that is designed or chosen with special
consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social and economical aspects of
the community it is intended for. Such technology usually requires fewer resources, is
easier to maintain, and has a lower overall cost and less of an impact on the
environment compared to industrialized practices. Appropriate technology usually
prefers in developing countries labour-intensive solutions over capital-intensive ones,
and it is quite opposite in developed countries. (Labour-saving devices should be used
when this does not mean high capital or maintenance cost.) In industrialized nations,
the term appropriate technology often refers to engineering that takes special
consideration of its social and environmental ramifications. In practice, it is often
solution that might be described as using the simplest level of technology that can
effectively achieve the intended purpose in a particular location.
In deciding about appropriateness seven main dimensions have to be observed:
safety, efficiency, efficacy, technical properties, organizational impact, social
consequences and ethical implications.
Observations and experiences in practice as well as research have shown that
appropriate technology will have the following characteristics:
• Should be scientifically verified;
• Adaptive to local needs;
• Acceptable to those who apply it;
• Acceptable to those who use it;
• Easy maintenance;
• It must be economically affordable. Technology assessment (TA)
In order to evaluate the level of appropriateness of applied or a new technology, it has
to be reviewed by a process known as technology assessment. The term "technology
assessment" was introduced in 1965 during deliberations of the Committee on
Science and Astronautics of the US House of Representatives and it was emphasized
that the purpose of TA is to serve policymaking. In case of health technologies the
first (“old”) approach that it has to serve professionals in health practice, and only
later when the problem of rising costs became unavoidable the “new” assessment
went into hands of health politicians and financial authorities. The tension about for 267 whom technology should be assessed is present even know as a well-known struggle
of clinicians and administrators about professional autonomy. The third player started
to be visible in shape of powerful industries producing equipment, biological products
and drugs. As a judge, finally, public and users have been asked to join, but even now,
although “need-based” principles have been established they remain weak partner.

is appropriate for existing health needs and other in accordance with other
circumstance, includes the following pertinent questions and ways how to answer
them:
• Is it necessary? Answer by estimating prevalence and priority of needs.
• Is it effective? Consider efficacy (potentials under optimal circumstances),
coverage and compliance (acting of patients in accordance with the rules) in
practice.
• Is it efficient? Answer by estimating cost in relation with effects (is it
affordable and sustainable?)
• Is it safe? Answer by measuring adversary reactions and consequences.
There are also experienced suggestions what are the main issues in assessment
(see more by Eisenberg JM, 1999) (12):
1. Health practitioners should give a lead what and how might be implemented.
The assessment has to be done in circumstances in which it will be applied
2. The assessment has to be performed repeatedly, once is not enough
3. The last and most important goal of assessment should be improvement of
existing health practice.
The technology assessment is an activity ensuring quality of care and progress
of services. It is under strong pressure of economic constraints, producers,
professionals and public opinion. A balance has to be found between conservative
tendencies toward standardization, restrictions and de-stimulation, and innovative
policies stimulating and propagating new technologies. The abbreviation STI means:
science + technology + innovation.
The new technology has to be connected with new training of people and also
often with reorganization of work itself. It is important not to forget that the 268 management itself has its own technologies which can also be judged as appropriate
or inappropriate for the given circumstances. Transfer of health technology (TT)
Globalization is increasing the processes of technology transfer. Many producers of
medical equipment and drugs are now big multi-national health companies. However,
the system is biased so that technology, as well as science, are oriented towards needs
of more developed and more powerful part of the World. It can be illustrated by a
quotation from WHO document (2004):
Gaps in pharmaceutical research and innovation
The World Health Organization released a groundbreaking report, which
recommends ways in which pharmaceutical research and innovation can
best address health needs and emerging threats in Europe and the world.
The 17 priority conditions identified by the report are:
Future public health threats: 1. infections due to antibacterial resistance,
2. pandemic influenza;
Diseases for which better formulations are required: 3. cardiovascular
disease (secondary prevention), 4. diabetes, 5. postpartum hemorrhages,
6. paediatric HIV/AIDS, 7. depression in the elderly and adolescents;
Diseases for which biomarkers are absent: 8. Alzheimer disease,
9. osteoarthritis;
Diseases for which basic and applied research is required: 10. cancer,
11. acute stroke;
Neglected diseases or areas: 12. tuberculosis, 13. malaria and other,
14. tropical infectious diseases such as trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis and
Buruli ulcer, 15. HIV vaccine;
Diseases for which prevention is particularly effective: 16. chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease including smoking cessation, 17. alcohol use
disorders (alcoholic liver diseases and alcohol dependency).
The successful technology transfer by itself presents problems for which the
solutions are not always easy. The UN Millenium Project on Science, Technology and
Innovation, Background Paper (2003) reviewed literature concluding that messages
are pessimistic, but in the same time full of hope. The important problems in
technology transfer are:
• intrusive influence of political and economic relations with domination of powerful;
• impossible transfer if local capacities to whom technology is transferred are not
developed;
• conflicts of interest between and inside countries, inside and between professional
groups;
• local policies such as protecting autarchy of countries, autonomies of experts, and
control of outs of transfer by powerful groups, criminal organizations and corrupted
administration. 269 CASE STUDY
The estimates of use of technologies in Europe and problems of
drugs management in Croatia
There are estimates that in Europe might be spent 30-50% of health expenditures for
performed health procedures and applied technologies without evidence of their
effectiveness and only 15-20 % interventions in daily use were proven by controlled
experiments. Poly-pragmatic use of drugs, misuse of antibiotics, overuse of painkillers and all kinds of sedatives, are convincing examples. There is also evidence that
there are socially determined differences, what is particularly evident in diagnostic
and high-tech technologies. Some studies indicate that eve 40-60 % of technologies is
irrelevant or applied and used in inappropriate way. The poor compliance with drug
prescriptions is documented in many cases. The symbolic use of technologies is
described in cases when results of expensive laboratory tests and diagnostic
examinations were never used for medical decisions. Misuse of technologies is also
seen in the opposite situations when many useless tests, screening procedures and
diagnostic procedures are ordered unnecessary. In routine health services the
ineffective technologies are applied and systematically protected (see Banta HD.
Eurohealth 1996).(13)
The health care expenditure is yearly in Croatia less than 500 € per capita out
of which about 100 € for pharmaceuticals. Since it is not probable that health care
resources will raise faster than BNP (about 7 500 € per capita) some measure to
decrease deficit of the state, i.e. Croatian Institute for Health Insurance (CIHI) are
inevitable.
Comparison of health care utilization in I-VI 2006 and I-VI 2007 shows the
following: In case of same amounts the presented index would be 100, but in specific
services it was:
Primary health care consultations
Specialist consultations
Number of prescriptions
Hospitalized patients
Days in hospitals 100.37
95.84
110.45
99.49
98.56 Decreasing rights of patients and citizens covered at present by the insurance
might increase their out of pocket participation payment for health care. The Basic
drug list (completely covered by Insurance) must be reduced. Education of health
workers and general public should increase awareness of the need to rationalize the
use of pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests and referral to specialist examination. Family
medicine should take place if 75 % of their patients’ health needs and not only of
estimated 50%, what is now the case. Finally the studies on functioning of various
parts of health service are of utmost importance. (Quotations and extracts form
Vrhovac B, 2008).(14) 270 EXERCISES
Exercise 1: Mixture of medical technologies at present in primary
health care practice
Task 1
Your task is to estimate by observation and by interviews with primary health care
teams the share of types of technologies in their daily routine practice
Consider comparison of time taken to speaking with patient and total duration
of consultation. Differentiate administrative part, diagnostic part and treatment part of
consultation separately. Trace interesting combinations of various types of
technologies and concentrate on treatment part. In case of the first type (human care)
try to differentiate (timing is tentative): one-minute short advice (recommendation), 515 minutes supporting interview, structured counselling (several meetings of 15-30
minutes) and “small psychotherapy”(a lasting procedure). How much is therapist
concentrated on patient himself and how much on his family, colleagues at work,
neighbours, friends, or community at large? In case of second type of technology look
what is prescribed and what is applied in clinic, was it recorded how drugs were used,
how was the prescription explained etc.
It is not expected to make a complete survey but to get an impression with as
many qualitative (narrative) observations as it is possible.
You are expected to prepare notes about your observations and reflections and
than report them to the group and discuss findings. Is it necessary to change
something in observed practice?
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Exercise 2: Reflection on causes of present situation and
possibilities to change them
Task 2
Your task: Using previous experiences (Exercise 1) and additional sources (articles,
statistics, consultation with teachers and experts) in a group discussion discuss the
following questions:
Is it true that some types of techniques are in practice over presented and some
not used enough. Hypothesis might be: to many drugs and not enough physiotherapy
and psychological support.
What might be the reason: is it poor education of health workers, wrong
expectation of patients, influence of public media (what and how?), commercial
marketing by industries? How could you explain the front page of BMJ published in
2003 with the title: “Time to untangle doctors from drug companies”?
Why it appeared when apparently both sides are having benefits: most of
postgraduate training and almost all professional congresses and other meetings are
sponsored by drug companies?
Other causes influencing the structure of technologies- Hypothesis might be:
one could find causes in management and organization of health services, or general 271 health policy? How are performed supervisions in-service instructions? Do “quality
circles” (QC) exist?
What should and what could be done to improve the situation, if it is at all
necessary? Present essentials of your findings in a short written statement.
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Exercise 3: Technology assessment
The technological development essentially contributes to correct diagnosis and
treatment, savings and quality of care. However, technology is useful only if it is
applied in a relevant, reliable and accurate way. In many places it is used less than it
would be necessary, but in others in the same country it can be over-used leading to
unnecessary costs and inconveniences to people. Technology should be appropriate to
local priority problems and to local conditions; adequate to personnel and to existing
resource, acceptable to people. Permanent maintenance and logistic support,
supervision and quality control are necessary. Task 3
Your task: Select examples of technologies: chose as the first option an often used
technology in health practice and as the second option a possible substitute which
could replace the first one. Choose two example of “human care technologies” (e.g.
history taking, consultation, motivational interview, psychological support,
counselling, “small psychotherapy”) and two examples of technical equipment
(diagnostic, therapeutic, surgical). Assess the following:
Position in the health care system (P): decide whether and where it should be
placed in the health care system, e.g. primary health care, hospital, open to public etc.
Relevance (R): frequency of diseases and problems, severity and urgency,
priority, relation to other problems, demand of people, contribution to common
health.
Effectiveness, efficacy (E): diagnostic validity and reliability, acceptability
and compliance, fringe benefit (how much is added to other existing technologies).
Safety (S): adversary reactions and discomfort for patients, safety for health
professionals who work and servicing them.
Maintenance (M): possibility and cost for maintenance, local self reliance.
Acceptability (A): acceptance by people and professionals.
Cost and efficiency): direct and indirect cost, intangible (non-material) costs,
maintenance, cost/benefit ratio.

After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• understand meaning of community structure and dynamics for public
health practice
• increase knowledge on community structures, dynamics and research
models in public health
• recognize basic approaches for community based (and participatory)
public health intervention
• differentiate various approaches for applied community studies
• identified relations between community research and practice
• improve capability to work with and inside the community
For few decades the value of a community, empowerment, community-based
care, population-based needs assessment was discussed, but not so much of
the evidence of this commitment was found in the public health
interventions. Potential contributions from the social sciences tend to be
overwhelmed by the appeal of the biomedical and behavioural sciences.
Three concepts and notions notion of community in public health were
dominated: First, community- a lots and lots of people or community as the
population; second could be described as community as “giant reinforcement
schedule” or community as setting, with aspects of that setting being used as
levers to support and maintain individual behaviour change.
The third, newest, approach sees community as “eco-system with capacity to
work towards solutions to its own community identified problems” or to see
it as a social system. This notion of community focused on strengths instead
merely on deficits. Two groups of research activities (systematic study of
communities and inequality research) supported with evidence from many
applied researches done through development of European Healthy Cities
Project contributed to this shift in perception of the value of the community.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PRACTICE
Selma Šogorić, Aleksandar Džakula THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Community and public health
Throughout the sixties, seventies and eighties much of the rhetoric in public health paid
lip service to the value of a community, empowerment, community-based care,
population-based needs assessment and so on, but we could not see much of the evidence
of this commitment in the day-to-day service provision of practitioners or in design
applied in public health interventions. Potential contributions from the social sciences
tend to be overwhelmed by the appeal of the biomedical and behavioural sciences. The
most common notion of community in public health was the most simple – a lots and lots
of people or community as the population. This notion is illustrated in large-scale
community interventions propelled by the concern to reach as many people as possible
and make best use of scarce program resources. The outcome evaluation of these
interventions usually amounts to summing up changes made by individuals in relation to
the problem of interest. The greater the number of people who change, the more
successful is the intervention (1). The second approach to community borne out of the
first could be described as community as “giant reinforcement schedule” or community
as setting, with aspects of that setting being used as levers to support and maintain
individual behaviour change. In this approach, organizations, groups and key individuals
in the community are valued because of their capacity to translate the health messages of
the campaign into the local culture. The evaluation of this model rests principally on
aggregating changes made by individuals in the population (1,2,3,4). The third, newest,
approach developed throughout the nineties sees community as “eco-system with
capacity to work towards solutions to its own community identified problems” or to see it
as a social system. This notion of community focused on strengths instead merely on
deficits. The evaluation in these case attempts to capture changes in community
processes and structures, as outcomes (1).
Two groups of research activities (systematic study of communities and
inequality research) supported with evidence from many applied researches done
through development of European Healthy Cities Project contributed to this shift in
perception of the value of the community. Inequality research
Firstly, we acknowledge that people do not live in vacuum. The notion that behaviour is
greatly influenced by social context in which people lead their lives has finally get
through to public health practitioners. Many sociologists have argued that the lives of
individuals are affected not only by their personal characteristics but also by
characteristics of the social group their belong (5,6) They say that “lifestyle” and
“behaviours” were regarded as matters of free individual choice and dissociated from the
social context that shape and constrain them (7,8,9). With their work they confronted 277 prevalent the “web of causation” model and blame it for progressive “individualization”
of risk (i.e. attributing risk to characteristics of individuals rather than to environmental or
social influences affecting populations). Simultaneously, tremendous shift in value
position, from victim blaming, through relative status in social milieu, to density of links
and caring in a social structure, has been done through the evolution of causal
explanations of inequalities (6).
The traditional explanation of inequalities in health is that they are caused by the
behaviour of those from the lower socio-economic classes who drink, smoke and
generally engage in too many “risk behaviours” leading to their early demise from heart
disease, lung cancer and so on. The solution is therefore, to modify their risky behaviours
and so anti-smoking campaigns and other health promotion programs were launched.
Unfortunately, historical data shows that such inequalities are independent of the causes
of death and they are as prevalent now as they were when the main causes of death were
entirely different at the run of the past century.
The next level of explanation is that the inequality is caused by the material
deprivation suffered by those in the lower socio-economic groups – poor housing, poor
nutrition, inadequate heating, air pollution, inadequate access to care and so on. The
solution, therefore, is to provide income or other resource support to the poor in society,
enough to raise them above some declared level of deprivation. Although there is
undoubtedly some truth to this proposed causal model, Marmot’s data from the British
civil service study tells us that it is far from the whole story (10). Across five classes of
civil servants all of whom are “well-off”, there are marked inequalities in health; none
suffer what could be called “deprivation”. So, aside from the evidence on absolute
deprivation, there is growing evidence that the relative distribution of income in a society
matters in its own right for population health.
This next level of explanation was given by Wilkinson (11). In his research he
found strong negative association between the degree of income inequality in a country
and its health as measured by mortality statistics. Here the model proposed is that the
feelings of relative deprivation among those in the lower half of the income distribution
express themselves through neuro-immunological systems as disease and death. The
larger the differences the more likely and the more severe are the negative health
consequences. Low control, insecurity and loss of self-esteem are among the
psychosocial risk factors known to mediate between health and socioeconomic
circumstances. Exposure to chronic mental and emotional stress (associated with social
position) will increase probability of acquiring risky behaviours - stress related smoking,
drinking, eating “for comfort”, etc. The implied solution in this case would be
development of more egalitarian society e.g. the reduction in income inequalities by
better distribution of wealth in society.
This level of explanation has been pushed one step further by work of Kennedy
and Kawachi (12,13,14). In the American study by Kennedy income inequality at the
state level was strongly correlated with total mortality. Income inequality was measured
in that study by the Robin Hood index, which is the proportion of aggregate income that
needs to be redistributed from the rich to the poor so as to achieve equality of income. A
1% rise in the Robin Hood index was associated with an excess mortality of 21.7 deaths
per 100 000, suggesting that even a modest reduction in inequality could have an
important impact on populations health. The maldistribution of income was related not
only to total mortality but also to infant mortality, homicides, and deaths from
cardiovascular diseases and neoplasm. In an independent study, Kaplan (15) examined 278 the association between income inequality – as measured by the share of aggregated
income earned by the bottom 50% of households – and state level variations in total
mortality. A strong association was found between their measure of income inequality
and age-adjusted total mortality rates in 1990. Moreover, the degree of income inequality
in each state in 1980 was a powerful predictor of levels of total mortality 10 years later.
The repeated corroboration of the hypothesis that income inequality is harmful to health
has spurred the search for the pathways and mechanisms underlying this relation. One
hypothesis was that rising income inequality results in increased level of frustration,
which may have deleterious behavioural and health consequences. Societies that permit
large disparities in income to develop also tend to be the ones that under invest in human
capital (e.g. education), health care, and other factors that promote health. The growing
gap between the rich and the poor has led to declining levels of social cohesion and trust,
or disinvestments in “social capital”. Social capital has been defined as the features of
social organization, such as civic participation, norms of reciprocity, and trust in others
that facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit. Social capital is thus a community- level
variable whose counterpart at the individual level is measured by person’s social
networks. The core concept of social capital, according to its principal theorists (Putnam)
consists of civic engagement and levels of mutual trust among community members. So,
by connecting levels of civic trust (perceived levels of fairness and helpfulness) and
density of associational membership with degree of income inequity on one side and
mortality on other Kawachi isolated social capital, as a mediating mechanism.
The work of Kaplan, Kennedy, and Kawachi is telling us that the growing gap
between the rich and the poor affects the social organization of communities and that the
resulting damage to the social fabric may have profound implications for public’s health.
Although the role of economic characteristics in relationship between social capital and
health has not been thoroughly elucidated (Veenstra 16) contemporary public health tend
to focus less on the individual and more on the social system’s influence on health
accepting that “the way we organize our society, the extent to which we encourage
interaction among the citizenry and the degree to which we trust and associate with each
other in caring communities is probably the most important determinant of our health”
(6). “System” study of communities
During the last few decades’ significant work has been done by social scientists engaged
in the systematic study of communities. From this work, at least two important principles
can be identified (17). The first relates to definitions of community, and the second
applies a “system” perspective to communities. The first approach to community is based
on notion that communities form a whole greater than the assemblage of individuals
within them. The community components include locality, an interdependent social
group, interpersonal relationship, and a culture that includes values, norms, and
attachments to the community as a whole as well to its parts. The second, system view
sees communities, simply as a system, which includes individuals, subsystems, and the
interrelationship among the subsystems. Anthropologists have identified important
subsystems of any community system: political sector, religious sector, recreational
sector, and social welfare sector. In addition, community organization studies have
identified two additional sectors being important for achieving changes in the community
system: voluntary and civic groups, such as health-related agencies, political action 279 groups, and other grass-roots groups, and other groups that may be specific to particular
community. From a system perspective, a change in one sector usually implies that
adjustment or response will eventually occur in other parts of the system. Change that
begins with one sector, however, may take a long time to affect the entire system. In
addition, many factors may interrupt of divert the change effort. From a community
organization perspective, the target of change is generally the entire system – the
community itself. From this perspective, it is not enough to change only a sector or part
of the community, although changes in the sectors or subsystems, especially the political
or economic spheres, may contribute to overall system change. Sanders (17) delineate the
following community components: economic institutions, local government, health,
education, social welfare, religion, recreation, social networks, the family and social
groupings. Each component could be subdivided and number of community units may be
expanded endlessly. Rothman (18) defines social participation as a core element of social
health and for him socially healthy community is the one sufficiently endowed with a
matrix of social units that allow participation. In his opinion policy-making unit
(decision-making bodies) are critical components of the entire community system,
because improving the social or physical health of any population group may require
health promotion policies. Those policies could (1) help individuals change their own
personal health related behaviours, (2) reduce environmental obstacles to healthpromoting behaviour and/ or (3) reduce or eliminate factors in the physical or social
environment that are detrimental to health. Conscious individual action can be facilitated
by “micro-strategies” like for example teaching low income people to prepare nutritious
meals using inexpensive food. Often, such individual behaviours are discouraged by
environmental conditions such are high prices for more nutritious foods. Introducing
food stamps was kind of policy designed, for example, to reduce economic
(environmental) barriers to nutritious diet. Finally, environmental hazards may be
eliminated by “macro-strategies” e.g. “technological bypass” – by changing potentially
detrimental experience of individuals without their direct involvement, like for example
legislative action that could lower pricing of more nutritious as compared to less
nutritious food. Decision-making units may be favourable, neutral, or unfavourable to
establishing relevant policies on the issue. If unfavourable, considerable community
effort may be required, a wide scope of community units may need to be mobilized and
political pressure tactics may be necessary. Even if the decision-making body is
favourable, substantial community organization may be required as resources are always
scarce and competing claims inundate those with decision-making power and
responsibility. The source of initiation of the policy change (for example relatively
powerless citizens, elite group, or established health professionals or organization) may
shape the form of community action.
Rothman (18) described three general forms of community intervention: locality
development, social planning, and social action. The first one maximizes local
participation (ownership); the second emphasizes rational planning and problem solving
and the third uses mobilization and activation of disadvanced groups.
As a part of the effort to influence local public policy community has to get
organized. Brown’s model of community organization for action (19) comprises four
phases – pre-organizational conditions, community organization, policy influence and
policy decision. First phase, a pre-organizational condition includes: needs,
predisposition to organize and enabling resources (factors) for organizing. Second phase,
community organization includes: process of organized action, technical support and 280 expanded (outside the constituency) support and opposition. Third phase, policy
influence identifies and described the target of community action: receptivity of policymaking body and noncommunity (external) factors. And fourth phase, policy decision
represents the culmination of the whole process, the extend to which policies have been
changed according to objectives of the initial action. By offering nine categories of
indicators to describe community organization’s efforts to influence local public policy
Brown’s model is helping us to develop better understanding of mechanisms of
community action, enables monitoring of process of change and teach us what forms and
strategies of community action may be most effective in promoting health.
Another very useful concept for public health practitioners is the one
developed by Partick and Wickizer (17). They explained that the social system in a
community relevant to health consists of at least three elements: physical structure,
social structure and social cohesion. A community’s physical structure (urban
planning, the design of suburban housing developments, parks and green areas,
industry) has both direct influences on health through exposure to risk and indirect
influences on health through the creation or neglect of health-inducing environments.
Social structure in a community is reflected in such things as its meeting places,
mechanisms for income redistribution, sports leagues, clubs, associations and all the
elements of a community that allow for the exchange of views and values and
engender mutual trust. This, too, has both, direct effects on health, and indirect
through facilitating collective problem solving or collective identity. Finally, social
cohesion is very much the product of the adequacy of physical and social structure in
a community. Along with such things as the cultural or social homogeneity of a
community, physical and social structure can either encourage or discourage mutual
support and caring, self-esteem and sense of belonging, and enriched social
relationship. All of these have been shown, largely by social scientists, to have an
influence on the health of a community’s members. CASE STUDY
Community applied research in Croatia - “triggered” by
Healthy Cities
During the eighteen years of the Healthy Cities project existence in Europe much of the
earlier mentioned “theory” has been learned experientially. The Healthy Cities (HC)
Project, initiated by the WHO European Office in 1986, is a long-term international
development project that seeks to put health on the agenda of decision-makers in cities
and to build a strong lobby for public health at the local level. The crucial notion that
stimulates HC project development was the recognition of importance of the political
will. The Healthy Cities Project challenges cities to take seriously the process of
developing health–enhancing public policies that create physical and social environments
that support health and strengthen community action for health. Initiating the Healthy
Cities Project process requires explicit political commitment and consensus across party
political lines, leading to sound project infrastructure, clear strategy, participation
mechanisms and broadly-based ownership (20,21). Healthy Cities is about change,
openness to participation, innovation and formal system reorientation. It is changing the
ways in which individuals, communities, private and voluntary organizations and local
governments think about, understand and make decisions about health. 281 European cities in general are challenged with complex public health issues
like poverty, violence, social exclusion, pollution, substandard housing, the unmet
needs of elderly and young people, homeless people and migrants, unhealthy spatial
planning, the lack of participatory practices, and unsustainable development (21). Due
to the war and post-war transition, Croatian cities are faced with many others, like, for
example, mental health, posttraumatic disorders, quality of life of disabled, family
health, community regeneration and community capacity building, unemployment,
especially among young and mid career workers, stress, alcohol, tobacco and
substance misuse, etc (22). The Healthy Cities Project framework provided the testing
ground for applying new strategies and methods for addressing these issues in
Croatia.
In the early 1990s, migrations caused by war undermined the credibility of the
dominant positivist perspective of demographic analyses, statistical studies and
quantitative health indicators (23,24,25). All health indicators obtained at that time
were based on estimates of a key factor – population. Quantitative data collected by
national health institutions: Croatian Institute of Public Health, Croatian Health
Insurance Institute and Ministry of Health, mainly produced mortality and morbidity
statistics, which was of some use only for national health policy makers (26,27,28). In
addition to its dubious credibility, national health statistics had other shortcomings:
poor accessibility of indicators at the local level and non-inclusion of the opinion of
the community (22).
Due to post-war conditions, scarce assets, and the need to determine the state
of affairs and launch the action as soon as possible, the method of rapid appraisal
(29,30) was chosen for the community health needs assessment and development of
the strategic city health documents: the City Health Profile and City Action Plan for
Health (31). The most popular and most used method in the Croatian cities is the
method of Rapid Appraisal to Assess Community Health Needs (29,30). It was used
in 9 cities between 1996 and 2004 (Pula, Metkovic, Rijeka, Karlovac, Varazdin,
Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Crikvenica). The advantages of this method in comparison
with classical approaches to health assessment are as follows: it can be done quickly
(in two months from the start), it does not take too much expert time and financial
resources (approximately 6.500 EUR per city), it is participatory (representatives of
different groups of citizens participate in the process, from needs identification to
solution finding; includes representatives of city authorities, institutions and
organizations as well as those from non-governmental and non-for-profit sector),
sensitive (ability to reflect local particularities), valid (scientifically sound), actionoriented (as a product it gives short-term and long-term plan activity plan), and its
achievements are sustainable (it establishes and facilitates co-operation among key
stake-holders in the project via priority thematic groups).
Academic credibility of described needs assessment method was strengthened
by the establishment of strict selection rules of participants and panellists and by the
process of triangulation of both information sources (essays, observations and
collected objective indicators from the system) and researchers (experts of three
different backgrounds: public health, epidemiology and medical information science).
Qualitative analytical approach also was used in development of the model of
rapid appraisal of effectiveness of public health interventions (32). A retrospective
study of 44 successfully performed interventions in five cities – Liverpool (UK),
Sandwell (UK), Vienna (Austria), Pula (Croatia) and Rijeka (Croatia) – identified the 282 indicators of intervention effectiveness that could be used to asses the effect of an
intervention in a short period of time (within a time frame of 1-5 years from the
beginning of the intervention) by measuring several aspects of success. These are as
follows:
1. Effect on political environment (macro-environment) – assessment of the
achieved degree of change in political environment;
2. Effect on a project user – an individual, a group, a community, within the
meaning of empowering users and influencing health;
3. Effect on a project manager – an organization or institution, i.e., an association
or group (microenvironment); and
4. Monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation process of an intervention.
The instrument happened to be more applicable for measuring the success of
individual (population- or topic-targeted) interventions. In the evaluation of
effectiveness of comprehensive years-long interventions, such as Healthy City or
Healthy County, it is applied together with other evaluation instruments. Concluding remarks
The job of public health professionals, including those in academic setting, is not only
to investigate and understand the world; it is also to change it. This is why we, in
Croatia put the emphasis on the development of applied (action) research by which
the academic knowledge may be used for intensifying activities and development of
local communities.
The introduction of participatory methods and consensus building techniques
in the process of public health policy formulation in Croatia has brought much better
understanding and improved collaboration among “policy stakeholders” - politicians,
administration, public health professionals and community. Public health
professionals are more responsive and committed to work with communities to support
them to (re)generate local social capital. At the moment, Croatian Healthy Cities and
Counties greatest achievement is that community participation is assured in all stages
of planning and management of the resources for health at the local level. REFERENCES

Mateja Krajc THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Basic definitions and explanations of terms
Screening
According to the National Screening Committee of the United Kingdom Health
Departments Second Report (1, 2), screening is a public health service in which
members of a defined population, who do not necessarily perceive they are at risk of,
or are already affected by a disease or its complications, are asked a question or
offered a test, to identify those individuals who are more likely to be helped than
harmed by further tests or treatment to reduce the risk of a disease or its
complications.
There have been various definitions of screening over the years (1,3-5) but put
simply what we are talking about in screening is seeking to identify a disease or predisease condition in apparently healthy individuals. This concept is now widely
accepted in most of the developed word. When used wisely, it can be a powerful tool
in the prevention of a disease.
Screening has important ethical differences from clinical practice. The health
service is targeting apparently healthy people, offering to help individuals to make
better informed decisions about their health. Irrespective that screening has the
potential to save lives or improve quality of life through early diagnosis of serious
conditions it is not a fool-proof process. Screening can reduce the risk of developing a
condition or its complications but it cannot offer a guarantee of protection. In any
screening programme, there is an irreducible minimum of false positive results
(wrongly reported as having the condition) and false negative results (wrongly
reported as not having the condition). Screening programmes
Screening programmes are public health services that are organized at the level of a large
population and must be effectively monitored. Programmes must use research evidence to
identify that they do more good than harm at a reasonable cost. Proposed new screening
programmes should be assessed against a set of internationally recognised criteria. These
criteria include the epidemiology of the condition, the screening test, any treatment
options, and the acceptability of the screening programme.
The benefits of screening for disease prevention were first demonstrated in
the 1940s, by the use of mass miniature radiography (MMR) for the identification
of individuals with tuberculosis (TB). After the end of the Second World War,
when effective treatment for TB was introduced, the use of MMR became
widespread in many western countries. In 1968, WHO issued monograph
Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease (5), which remains a landmark
contribution to the screening literature. 287 Types of screening
It is important to distinguish between two main types of screening, being organized
screening, and opportunistic screening. Their main characteristics are as follows (1, 68):
• organized screening is a process in which people thought to be at risk are
invited for screening inside organized screening programme, as in the national
programmes for cancer of the breast and cervix for example. It takes place in a
community setting .It could be checked and monitored;
• in contrast, opportunistic screening is screening offered by a medical doctor or
other health professional outside an organized screening programme. Unlike
an organised screening programme, opportunistic screening may not be
checked or monitored.
Screening need to be distinguished from case-finding, where individuals have
sought medical advice for a specific symptom or complaint and opportunity is taken
to suggest various other tests, such as the measurement of blood pressure or
cholesterol, appropriate to their age and sex (3, 8). It takes place in a clinical setting. Criteria for screening
Before screening for any condition is introduced, the basic criteria have to be fulfilled
(Table 1) (5). They are fundamental to the integrity of the screening process in any
country.
Table 1. Summary of criteria for screening (5).
Category Criteria Condition The condition sought should be an important health problem whose
natural history, including development from latent to declared
disease, is adequately understood. The condition should have a
detectable preclinical phase.
There should be a defined target population. Target
population
Diagnosis Treatment Cost Screening test There should be a suitable diagnostic test that is available, safe and
acceptable to the population concerned. There should be an agreed
policy, based on respectable test findings and national standards, as
to whom to regard as patients, and the whole process should be a
continuing one.
There should be an accepted and established treatment or
intervention for individuals identified as having the disease or predisease condition and facilities for treatment should be available.
The cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment) should
be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on
medical care as a whole.
Should be acceptable and safe. 288 The validity of screening test and the evaluation of screening
Validity
Validity of screening tests is an expression of a degree to which a test measures what
it intends to measure (3). There are two measures to describe the validity of screening
test – sensitivity and specificity. Both measures are conditional probabilities, and both
are easy to understand using a decision matrix (Figure 1) (6). TRUE DISEASE STATUS
TEST
RESULTS Present Absent Positive a b a+b Negative c d c+d a+c b+d Figure 1. Decision matrix for derivation of the validity analysis of a screening test. 1. Sensitivity.
Sensitivity (nosological) is defined as the ability of a test to detect all those with the
disease in the screened population. This is expressed as the proportion of those
with the disease in whom a screening test gives a positive result. Technically, it is a
proportion of people with condition with positive test: a/(a+c) (Table 2).
2. Specificity.
Specificity is defined as the ability of a test to identify correctly those free of the
disease in the screened population. This is expressed as a proportion of people free
of the disease in whom the screening test gives a negative result. Technically, it is a
proportion of people without condition with negative test: a/(a+c) (Table 2).
But one should be aware interpreting these measures since there are two kinds of
sensitivity and specificity - nozological and diagnostic (9,10). So far we were
speaking of nosological conditional probabilities. Other two important conditional
probabilities are positive and negative predictive values (9,11).
3. Positive predictive value.
Positive predictive value is the probability that a person with a negative test
does not have the condition under screening. Technically, it is a proportion of
people with positive test who have condition: a/(a+b) (Table 2). This measure
is also known as diagnostic specificity.
4. Negative predictive value.
Negative predictive value is the probability that a person with a negative test
does not have the condition under screening. Technically, it is a proportion of
people with negative test who do not have condition: d/(c+d) (Table 2). This
measure is also known as diagnostic sensitivity.
All screening tests should aim to have high sensitivity and high specificity. 289 Evaluation
Evaluation must also be an integral part of any screening procedure. In 1971,
Cochrane and Holland suggested seven criteria for evaluation and these remain as
valid today as they were then (12) (Table 2).
Table 2. Summary of criteria for evaluation of screening (12).
Factor Criteria Simplicity The test should be simple to perform, easy to interpret and, where
possible, capable of use by paramedics and other personnel.
Since participation in screening is voluntary, the test must be acceptable
to those undergoing it.
The test must give a true measurement of the condition or symptom
under investigation.
The expense of the test must be considered in relation to the benefits of
early detection of the disease.
The test should give consistent results in repeated trials.
The test should be capable of giving a positive finding when the
individual being screened has the condition being sought.
The test should be capable of giving a negative finding when the
individual being screened does not have the condition being sought. Acceptability

The benefits and disadvantages of screening have been fully described over the years
and have been summarized by Chamberlain (13) (Table 3).
Table 3. Benefits and disadvantages of screening (13).
Benefits Disadvantages Improved prognosis for cases detected Longer morbidity in cases where prognosis is
unaltered
Overtreatment of questionable abnormalities Less radical treatment which cures some
early cases
Resource savings
Reassurance for those with negative test
results Resource costs
False reassurance for those with false-negative
results
Anxiety and sometimes morbidity for those with
false positive results
Hazard of screening test itself 1. Benefits.
The benefits are very clear. Early and accurate diagnosis and intervention will
lead to an improved prognosis in some patients. At this stage treatment may
need to be less invasive.
2. Disadvantages. 290 The disadvantages are more complex. There will be longer periods of morbidity
for patients whose prognosis is unchanged and there may be overtreatment of nonserious conditions or abnormalities identified. There are also resource costs in
finding more illness both in terms of the tests themselves, the personnel costs and
the subsequent management of whatever is found. There is the unpalatable
certainty that some individuals with false-negative results will be given unfounded
reassurance and that some with false positive results will experience, at the very
least, unnecessary anxiety and, at the worst, inappropriate treatment.
Finally, there is the possibility, however remote, of hazard from the screening test
itself. One point is particularly relevant here - there may be public demand (fuelled by
vested interests) for the introduction of a screening test that does not meet the
established criteria; an example of this is in screening for cancer of the prostate where
the current screening test – prostate-specific antigen (PSA) – does not meet the
criteria for accuracy or specificity. Key issues in screening There are a number of issues that are relevant at all stages and in every type of
screening programme in any country, and are closely interrelated. There are five
key issues in screening, being genetics, information, economics, ethics, and audit,
evaluation and quality control (Figure 2).

components of an effectively organized screening programme. The components as
described by Hakama (14) are as follows:
• the target population should be identified;
• individuals in the population who are to be screened need to be identified;
• all those eligible for screening should be encouraged to attend – for example,
by issuing a personal invitation, and offering suitable timing of screening
examinations to suit the needs of those involved; 291 • there should be adequate premises, equipment and staff to ensure that the
screening examination is done under pleasant circumstances and is
acceptable to those attending;
• there should be an appropriate, satisfactory method of ensuring the
maintenance of the best standards of the test(s) by:
− initial and continuing training of the personnel conducting the test(s);
− demonstration (by appropriate records) of the maintenance standards
of equipment used in the examination – for example, calibration of Xray machines in mammography;
− routine checks of the validity of the tests performed – for example,
random duplicate measurements for biochemistry, cytology, and
reading of X-rays;
• there should be adequate and appropriate facilities for the diagnosis and
treatment of any individual found to require this. There should be as little
delay as possible between the screening attendance, advice that the screening
test was negative, advice that the screening test result required further
investigation, and referral to the appropriate centre for further investigation
or treatment. A timetable should be established for these different procedures
and there should be continuous monitoring to ensure that the time intervals
between the various stages are complied with;
• there should be regular checks to ascertain the satisfaction level of those who
have undergone the screening process – those investigated, the screennegatives and those invited who have not participated;
• finally, regular periodic checks should be made of the records of the
screened individuals to ascertain their adequacy. Genetics
In the last decade, genetic screening has developed very rapidly with the mapping
of the human genome. Many see it as opening up a new era in the prevention, early
diagnosis and identification of disease. However, caution is essential (4).
There are two objectives of screening for a recessive carrier state. One is to
reduce the prevalence of the disorder and the other is to inform the reproductive
choices of individuals and couples at risk. Information is thus regarded as
worthwhile in itself, regardless of the possibility of prevention or treatment. While
this type of screening can certainly help to evaluate risk and may be appropriate in
certain high-risk groups. It should be carefully considered when to screen, if
nothing can be done after the results of the screening test (4).
The main purpose of genetic screening at present is to prevent. In this it
differs from much current screening practice and it must not be allowed to overlook
the basic principles and criteria of screening (4). Information
Information is another central concept in modern health care in general and also in
screening. It must be provided in a correct way, so that possible participant may
decide upon proper information, with the end-point being truly informed consent
(or refusal) to participate (4). 292 Economics
As economic theory has entered the field, it has been recognized that screening may
also do harm. All screening procedures involve the examination and testing of large
numbers of individuals in order to find the few with an abnormality. There are two
main consequences of this (4).
First, those who undergo screening are often understandably anxious while
waiting for the result and become even more anxious if they have to undergo further
investigation. Second, although most screening tests are simple, relatively cheap
procedures in themselves, the actual costs are by no means trivial because of the
large numbers involved (4). Ethics
Any abnormality identified, whether in a national screening programme or in
primary care, must be treatable and the investigation itself must not cause harm.
Many believe that early diagnosis, particularly of cancer and heart disease, will lead
to the possibility of treatment and improvement in prognosis. This is an attractive
concept and can lead to a demand for a screening procedure to be introduced,
irrespective of whether it has been shown that diagnosis guarantees an improved
outcome (4). Audit, evaluation and quality control
In any screening programme, as with any other service programme, adequate steps
must be taken to ensure that the original objectives are being met and that the
methodology meets appropriate standards (4).
The ideal method for evaluating a screening programme is the randomized
controlled trial in which individuals in a population are allocated, at random, either to a
group that is screened or to a group that receives only its normal medical care (4).
The components of an effectively organized screening programme have been
described by Hakama (14), and have been already presented earlier in this module.
The importance of maintaining the quality of screening programmes should
never be underestimated. Evaluation, audit and quality control should be an integral
part of any screening programme to ensure that it is achieving what it has set out to
do in a way that is acceptable to those involved. The recommended screenings in Europe There are several recommended screenings in Europe (4). They may be presented
through different age groups, being:
• antenatal period;
• neonatal period;
• screening in childhood;
• screening in adolescence and early adulthood; 293 • screening in adults, and
• screening in elderly. Recommended screenings by age groups
1. Antenatal period.
There are many routine screenings for the total population, and some
screenings for high risk groups (Table 5). There are also some screenings
under research review (Table 4) (4, 14).

• National programme should be continued with
review of alternative types of tests and of age
range of those eligible and frequency of

• Good information to be a priority
• National screening programme by faecal occult
blood testing for adults aged 50–74 years
• Ultrasound screening of men aged 65 and over
Aneurysm seems a reasonable proposition
provided the necessary resources are in place
• National programme of screening for all
diabetics aged over 12. It is essential to be quite
clear about how, when and where screening
should happen to ensure effective
implementation

Smoking cessation Screening in adults is potentially big business. Media interest in health is
insatiable, and anyone who reads the newspapers, watches television or
listens to radio can hardly fail to be aware of the various diseases that
may be lying in wait for them. Of course, it is of benefit if potential 296 health problems can be identified early and treated. But society must
beware of turning health into an obsession and must resist both the
increasing medicalization of life and the growing politicization of
medicine.
The national programmes for breast and cervical cancer should be
continued but kept under review with an emphasis on quality control and
on providing balanced and understandable information to enable women
to make a truly informed choice without pressure from health
professionals on whether or not to participate.
A national programme of screening for colorectal cancer by faecal
occult blood testing in adults aged from 50 to 74 years has been agreed in
the United Kingdom and on some other European countries but it is
essential that adequate diagnostic, treatment and follow-up facilities are
in place before it is introduced.
Screening for risk factors of coronary heart disease and stroke
should be carried out in the primary care setting with advice, treatment
and follow-up as appropriate. In the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm,
it now seems clear that ultrasound screening in men aged 65 years and
over would reduce mortality from this condition, although the benefit for
those aged over 75 years has been questioned. As with colorectal cancer,
however, national implementation should await the certainty that
adequate facilities and resources are available. In the case of screening
for diabetic retinopathy, close attention must be paid to audit and the
need to be absolutely clear about how, when and where to screen. 6. Elderly.
Society is facing a major challenge in how best to maintain health and
quality of life in populations where the proportion of people aged over 60
years now outnumbers those aged under 16 and the number of individuals
aged over 85 is rising.
A system of regular surveillance and case-finding in primary care
would seem to be the most appropriate form of screening, particularly in
those aged 75 and over, but the resource implications of this must be
confronted. Several simple tests, such as identifying difficulties with
sight or hearing or problems with feet, can make a huge difference to the
comfort and quality of life. Depression is another area where
identification and treatment could improve well-being. Social and
community support are also vital in enabling older people to enjoy as
independent and contented a life as possible. The emphasis in screening
at this stage of life should be on improving quality of life and preserving
function and independence, rather than on providing “heroic” treatments
to prevent mortality.

are presented. 297 Table 9. Recommended screenings in elderly in Europe (4)

Screening programmes and practices vary widely across the countries of the European
Union (EU). This is inevitable given the differing structures and financing of health
services, and differing demographic features of the population. There are, however,
key objectives to strive for.
These include having one national body per country responsible for practice
and policy, scrupulous adherence to the long-established screening criteria, accurate
population registers, greater uniformity of access across different mare as of a given
country and across different socioeconomic groups, and sound research evidence on
which to base practice. The wide variation in practice in Europe illustrates the
complexity of screening. Some lessons, however, stand out. Key points of screening
in the EU are (4):
• antenatal screening programmes for Down syndrome and spina bifida are
performed only in a few countries and are mainly optional. They are often only
recommended to women at high risk.
• neonatal screening for phenylketonuria is systematically recommended in all
countries belonging to the EU before May 2004, except Finland.
• breast cancer screening and cervical cancer screening programmes are
recommended in some European countries.
• HIV screening is more common among the new Member States and three
Candidate Countries and covers specific vulnerable groups, such as pregnant
women and blood donors.
• TB screening is performed in a few European countries, especially central and
eastern European countries, such as Hungary, Romania and Turkey. 298 • not all the countries follow the basic criteria for screening. A population
register to allow recall and follow-up of patients is often missing. A single
national body for reviewing tests and practice is rare. CASE STUDY: BREAST CANCER SCREENING
Cancer screenings
At present the following screening tests meet requirements for organized screening
programmes (Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening
(2003/878/EC) OJ L 327/34-38) (15):
• pap smear screening for cervical abnormalities starting at the latest by the age
of 30 and definitely not before the age of 20,
• mammography screening for breast cancer in women aged 50-69 in
accordance with European guidelines on quality assurance in mammography,
• faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer in men and women age
50-74.
Decisions on implementation of cancer screening programmes must be made as part
of a general priority-setting exercise on the use of healthcare resources (16-18).
Other cancer screening tests are not yet recommended for EU-wide
population-based cancer screening, although they already may be used in individual
screening on demand. Such tests may provide individual benefits but at the same time
may also lead to adverse effects for individuals (e.g. unfounded anxiety) and the
public (e.g. additional financial burden). Recommendations for such tests cannot be
made until they have shown to have benefits such as reducing disease-specific
mortality or improving survival (19-21).
Potentially promising screening tests currently being evaluated in randomised
controlled trials, include:
• prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer,
• mammography screening for women aged 40-49 for breast cancer,
• immunological Faecal Occult Blood Testing (FOBT) for colorectal cancer,
• flexible colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.
Once the effectiveness of a new screening test has been demonstrated,
evaluation of modified testing methods may be possible using intermediate/surrogate
endpoints, if the positive predictive value of such endpoints is sufficiently established.
Some examples of screening methods which fall into this category are listed below:
• any novel alternative tests for faecal occult blood,
• liquid-based cervical cytology,
• testing for high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection,
• other novel methods for the preparation or interpretation of cervical specimens.
Any screening test which has been demonstrated to be effective should be offered on
a population basis only in organised screening programmes, with quality assurance at
all levels and full information about the benefits and risks (22, 23). 299 Breast cancer screening
Breast cancer is currently the most frequent cancer and the most frequent cause of
cancer induced deaths in women in Europe. Demographic trends indicate a continuing
increase in this substantial public health problem. Systematic early detection through
screening, effective diagnostic pathways and optimal treatment have the ability to
substantially lower current breast cancer mortality rates and reduce the burden of this
disease in the population.
In order that these benefits may be obtained, high quality services are essential.
These may be achieved through the underlying basic principles of training,
specialisation, volume levels, multidisciplinary team working, the use of set targets
and performance indicators and audit. Ethically these principles should be regarded as
applying equally to symptomatic diagnostic services and screening.
The primary aim of a breast screening programme is to reduce mortality from
breast cancer through early detection. Unnecessary workup of lesions which show
clearly benign features should be avoided in order to minimise anxiety and maintain a
streamlined cost-effective service. Women attending a symptomatic breast service
have different needs and anxieties and therefore mixing of screening and symptomatic
women in clinics should be avoided.
Fundamental points and principles of the European guidelines for
quality assurance of breast cancer screening programmes
Fundamental points and principles of the 4th edition of the European guidelines for
quality assurance of breast cancer screening programmes are (24):
• breast cancer screening is a complex multidisciplinary undertaking, the
objective of which is to reduce mortality and morbidity from the disease
without adversely affecting the health status of participants. It requires trained
and experienced professionals using up-to-date and specialised equipment;
• screening usually involves a healthy and asymptomatic population which
requires adequate information presented in an appropriate and unbiased
manner in order to allow a fully informed choice as to whether to attend.
Information provided must be balanced, honest, adequate, truthful, evidencebased, accessible, respectful and tailored to individual needs where possible
(24-26);
• mammography remains the cornerstone of population-based breast cancer
screening. Due attention must be paid to the requisite quality required for its
performance and interpretation, in order to optimise benefits, lower mortality
and provide an adequate balance of sensitivity and specificity;
• physico-technical quality control must ascertain that the equipment used
performs at a constant high quality level providing sufficient diagnostic
information to be able to detect breast cancer using as low a radiation dose as
is reasonably achievable. Routine performance of basic test procedures and
dose measurements is essential for assuring high quality mammography and
comparison between centres;
• full-field digital mammography can achieve high image quality and is likely to
become established due to multiple advantages such as image manipulation
and transmission, data display and future technological developments.
Extensive clinical, comparative and logistical evaluations are underway; 300 • the role of the radiographer is central to producing high quality mammograms
which, in turn, are crucial for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Correct
positioning of the breast on the standard lateral oblique and cranio-caudal
views is necessary to allow maximum visualisation of the breast tissue, reduce
recalls for technical inadequacies and maximise the cancer detection rate;
• radiologists take prime responsibility for mammographic image quality and
diagnostic interpretation. They must understand the risks and benefits of breast
cancer screening and the dangers of inadequately trained staff and sub-optimal
equipment. For quality loop purposes the radiologist performing the screen
reading should also be involved at assessment of screen detected
abnormalities;
• all units carrying out screening, diagnosis or assessment must work to agreed
protocols forming part of a local quality assurance (QA) manual, based on
national or European documents containing accepted clinical standards and
published values. They should work within a specialist framework, adhering to
set performance indicators and targets. Variations of practices and healthcare
environments throughout the member states must not interfere with the
achievement of these;
• a robust and reliable system of accreditation is required for screening and
symptomatic units, so that women, purchasers and planners of healthcare
services can identify those breast clinics and units which are operating to a
satisfactory standard. Any accreditation system should only recognise centres
that employ sufficiently skilled and trained personnel;
• the provision of rapid diagnostic clinics where skilled multidisciplinary advice
and investigation can be provided is advantageous for women with significant
breast problems in order to avoid unnecessary delay in outline of management
planning or to permit immediate discharge of women with normal/benign
disease;
• population breast screening programmes should ideally be based within or
closely associated with a specialised breast unit and share the services of
trained expert personnel. Key performance indicators for monitoring in population
based breast cancer screening programme
Key performance indicators to be monitored in any population based breast cancer screening
programme are presented in Table 10. 301 Table 10. Summary table of key performance indicators to be monitored in any

Ivan Eržen THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Challenges and expectations facing contemporary
health sectors
Healthcare systems around the globe face major challenges5, even if their nature and
scale varies significantly between industrialised and developing countries. These
challenges include (1,2,3):
• rising demand for health and social services, due to an ageing population and
higher income and educational levels. In particular, by 2051, close to 40% of
the Union’s population will be older than 65 years old;
• the increasing expectations of citizens who want the best care available, and at
the same time to experience a reduction in inequalities in access to good health
care;
• increasing mobility of patients and health professionals within a better
functioning internal market;
• the need to reduce the so-called “disease burden”, and to respond to emerging
disease risks (for example, new communicable diseases like SARS);
• the difficulties experienced by public authorities in matching investment in
technology with investment in the complex organisational changes needed to
exploit its potential;
• the need to limit occupational accidents and diseases, to reinforce well-being at
work and to address new forms of work-related diseases;
• management of huge amounts of health information that need to be available
securely, accessibly, and in a timely manner at the point of need, processed
efficiently for administrative purposes, and
• the need to provide the best possible health care under limited budgetary
conditions.
Facing theses challenges and looking at the possibilities it was found that one
of the key tools that would be effective is the proper usage of information and
communication technology in health sector. Like in other sectors this approach got a
special name: e-Health. The role of e-Health
e-Health describes the application of information and communications technologies
across the whole range of functions that affect the health sector (1,2). e-Health tools
or solutions include products, systems and services that go beyond simply internetbased applications. They include tools for both, tools for health authorities and health
professionals, as well as tools for personalised health systems for patients and
citizens. It can improve access to healthcare and boost the quality and effectiveness of 310 the services offered. Examples include health information networks, electronic health
records, telemedicine services, personal wearable and portable communicable
systems, health portals, and many other information and communication technologybased tools assisting prevention, diagnosis, treatment, health monitoring, and lifestyle
management. When combined with organisational changes and the development of
new skills, e-Health can help to deliver better care for less money within citizencentred health delivery systems. e-Health: systems and services that benefit the health sector
e-Health can deliver significant improvements in access to care, quality of care, and
the efficiency and productivity of the health sector. e-Health can become key drivers
for change, and productivity gains, in such areas as infrastructure and skills
development, internal business processes, procurement procedures and supply chain
management, marketing and sales, and functions of the extended business (4).
The amount and complexity of health-related information and knowledge has
increased to such a degree that a major component of any health organisation is
information processing. The health sector is clearly an information intensive sector
which increasingly depends on information and communication technologies. These
technologies are supporting progress in medical research, better management and
diffusion of medical knowledge, and a shift towards evidence-based medicine. eHealth tools support the aggregation, analysis and storage of clinical data in all its
forms; information tools provide access to the latest findings; while communication
tools enable collaboration among many different organisations and health
professionals (1). Empowering health consumers: patients and healthy citizens
Both as patients and as healthy citizens, people can benefit from better personal health
education and disease prevention. They need support in managing their own diseases,
risks – including work-related diseases - and lifestyles. A growing number of people
are looking proactively for information on their medical conditions. They want to be
involved actively in decisions related to their own health, rather than simply accepting
the considerable discrepancy (“asymmetry”) in knowledge between themselves and
health professionals. e-Health services provide timely information tailored to
individuals in need. Specialised online resources are available for health education,
safety and security at work and lifestyle management.
Examples of personalised systems for monitoring and supporting patients
include wearable or implantable communication systems for continuous monitoring
patients’ heart conditions. These systems can help shorten or completely avoid the
stay of patients in hospitals, while ensuring monitoring of their health status. Having
access to comprehensive and secure electronic health records has been shown to
improve quality of care and patient safety. This will facilitate appropriate treatment of
patients in providing health professionals with a better knowledge of the patient’s
history and of previous interventions by other colleagues. Assisting health professionals
The priority of medical professionals is to offer best quality care within available
resources and, above all, according to the Hippocratic oath, doing no harm to the 311 patient (primum non nocere). However, unfortunately, medical errors still occur.
Some of these might be avoided21 by making good use of e-Health systems that can
provide vital information, alerts, and make best practices, expert advice and results of
clinical treatment more widely available.
e-Health tools and applications can provide fast and easy access to electronic
health records at the point of need. They can support diagnosis by non-invasive
imaging-based systems. They support surgeons in planning clinical interventions
using digital patient specific data, provide access to specialised resources for
education and training, and allow radiologists the possibility to access images
anywhere. Thus, the workplace is being redefined and extended. Digital data transfer
enables more effective networking among clinical institutions, and the creation of
virtual network of centres of reference. Electronic health records also enable the
extraction of information for research, management, public health or other related
statistics of benefit to health professionals.
e-Health can benefit not only health professionals but all the staff employed in
the health sector including nursing, care, and administrative staff (for example: in
2002, this was 17.5 million persons in the European Union of 25 Member States or
9.3% of total workforce). Furthermore, e-Health can contribute to achieving a safer
working environment for health practitioners. Safer working environment is a very
important issue. In the European Union, health and social services have an accident
rate which is 30% above the average by sector of accidents recorded23. Most
accidents relate to infectious diseases and dangers, back injuries, and shocks and
hazards associated with electrical equipment or compressed gases (5). Supporting health authorities and health managers
Health authorities and managers are responsible for the proper organisation and
running of health systems (6). They do this against the background of increasing
budgetary pressures and rising patient expectations. e-Health systems can play a
major part in meeting those pressures by making the health sector more productive,
and delivering better results with fewer resources. Unfortunately, the currently
available paper-based information aggregation and processing has major limitations.
A proper management of public health and clinical health can be undertaken
only on the basis of comprehensive and high-quality administrative and clinical data.
Health authorities would benefit from better access to more comparable data on health
issues. There is a need for data, and an underlying infrastructure, that help health
authorities to collaborate - for example, on how to tackle communicable diseases.
Integrated and comprehensive data can be provided in good time using eHealth tools, such as electronic health records and support for care flow
management. Automatic data extraction from electronic health systems that meet
legal requirements on data protection and privacy could provide missing data that
facilitates proper evaluation of much needed resources and eradicates the huge
administrative burden of filling in separate forms for reimbursement - a clear
example of a productivity gain to be achieved through e-Health systems and
services. These initiatives form a definite trend in the aim to modernise healthcare
systems (7).
Increased networking, exchange of experiences and data, and benchmarking, is
also necessary at the national but also at the international level. Drivers for this 312 include the need for improvements in efficiency, and the increased mobility of
patients and health professionals under an emerging internal market in services. The
situation requires the integration of clinical, organisational, and economic information
across health care facilities, so as to facilitate virtual enterprises at the level of
jurisdictions and beyond.
e-Health systems can empower managers by spreading best practices and
helping to limit inefficient and inappropriate treatment. This is the single most
important step in releasing resources and ensuring broad access for everyone to
quality care. In addition, e-Health opens new opportunities for people who live in
remote areas with only limited healthcare services, as well as marginalised groups
(such as persons with different degrees of disability, whether minor or more severe).
e-Health is already proving in Europe and in the developing world that it can provide
a platform for telemedicine services such as tele-consultations (second medical
opinion), telemonitoring, and telecare, either in the home or the hospital. Major challenges for wider implementation
Despite the availability and proven benefits, e-Health systems and services are
still not yet widely used in real-life medical or health situations. In many places,
development is still at a pilot phase, often financed through research grants. The
speed of organisational change is often slow, and it can take many years to
achieve full implementation. A broad range of challenges remain to wider
implementation (1).
1. Commitment and leadership of health authorities.
Commitment and leadership of health authorities, in particular related to
financial and organisation issues, are essential elements for the successful
deployment of e-Health. For e-Health to improve the way healthcare is
provided, it must be combined with organisational changes and the
development of new skills in users. e-Health was often traditionally perceived
by health authorities as a low spending priority. However, it is now seen as a
matter of substantial importance within public health policies;
2. Organisational and cultural approaches
Moreover, organisational and cultural approaches relating to the way health
care is delivered varies between countries and between organisations.
Typically, in the health area, the introduction of new applications, techniques,
and medicines has been slow, yet – in organisational terms – the introduction
of information and communication technologies has developed relatively fast.
Hospitals too will be important players in the evolution towards e-Health, and
their involvement in adoption will be central to new forms of healthcare
delivery (8);
3. Interoperability of e-Health systems.
Interoperability should enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous
systems. This will allow secure and fast access to comparable public health
data and to patient information located in different places over a wide variety
of wired and wireless devices. However, this depends on standardisation of
system components and services such as health information systems, health
messages, electronic health record architecture, and patient identifying
services; 313 4. User friendliness of e-Health systems and services.
A top priority for health providers in using an e-Health system is speed in
getting the desired, high-quality results. There is an absolute need for fast
connection, connectivity, and high speed. This highlights the importance of
ensuring broadband connection for online health services and infrastructure for
regional health information networks;
5. Confidentiality and security issues.
Firstly, the confidentiality and protection of patient data is governed by the
general European Union rules of data protection, as well as by the
requirements of e-Privacy legislation regarding communications infrastructure.
The requirement for confidentiality makes health information systems security
critical. Another important legal issue is liability in the event of problems such as technical malfunctions of the system, network, or provision of the
service itself - that result in serious harm to a patient (9);
6. Issues relating to the mobility of patients.
Another challenge is issues relating to the mobility of patients, including the
cross border circulation of goods and services, among which e-Health services
are of growing importance. Stronger cooperation among health providers
across Europe is needed to enable wider implementation;
7. Needs and interests of users.
The take-up of e-Health systems and services would take place more rapidly
were the needs and interests of the user communities (health professionals,
patients, and citizens) to be taken on board. In general, these should be better
integrated into the development and promotion of e-Health;
8. Access for all to e-Health.
The equal access of all groups of society to health services is an important goal
in the public health policy field (10). There is a risk that certain parts of society
- such as lone parents of families, isolated communities, inner city
communities, individuals with literacy and numeracy challenges, groups of
immigrants, homeless persons, elderly persons and disabled persons – could
remain excluded from the possibilities offered by e-Health (including Internetbased health services) if special efforts are not made to counterbalance such
trends. On the other hand, e-Health can offer considerable possibilities for the
provision of health services to such individuals, groups, and communities;
9. Common understanding and concerted efforts by all stakeholders.
No single stakeholder can carry through implementation successfully on its
own without the active co-operation of all the others. Each of the stakeholders,
health authorities, professionals, consumers, industry, has the power to veto an
implementation, if it is not perceived as beneficial. Only through concerted
efforts by all stakeholders, can we ensure a successful implementation where
all partners benefit, thereby creating a win-win situation. Concluding remarks E-Health offers important opportunities for improved access to better health systems
to the citizens. It can empower both patients and healthcare professionals. It offers
governments and tax payers a means - through substantial productivity gains - to cope 314 with increasing demand on healthcare services. It can also help to reshape the future
of health care delivery, making it more citizen-centred.
This e-Health Area will provide a framework for exchanging best practices and
experience in the country and between them. It will allow common approaches to
shared problems to be developed over time. Through e-Health a better access and
better, more efficient, services as well as on the overall productivity of the healthcare
sector is expected. Besides e-Health will become common place for health
professionals, patients and citizens. An important prerequisite is that e-Health will be
adequately resourced within healthcare budgets. EXERCISE

• To increase awareness of the fact that some healthcare services can
be provided remotely
• To demonstrate the merits of an existing telecare solution intended
to help older people live independent lives at home environment
rather being institutionalised
Telecare is a new means of providing healthcare and social support at
home where telecommunication technologies are the medium for
service provision. It uses a public telephone network and provides a
means of getting help, notably for people who are at risk of falling,
sudden illness, fits or seizures. Sensors added to a carephone are
introduced monitor the user’s environment and health condition and
alert a response centre when there is a threat to their health or wellbeing.
Personal response systems operate in all western European
countries and also, more recently, in Slovenia. Experiences gathered
when establishing a pilot network of carephones and a response centre
in the capital city of Ljubljana are presented along with a discussion of
the efforts made to create a national network. A personal response
system as a telecare application used primarily by vulnerable older

TECHNOLOGIES POTENTIAL IN THE
HEALTHCARE SERVICE FRAMEWORKS
Drago Rudel, Malcolm Fisk THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The potential for new telecommunication technologies
to introduce changes to healthcare
Because of the reducing cost of information and communication technologies
(ICT), they are increasingly available to a wide range of people, including many
with lower incomes and limited disposable wealth. The configuration of such
technologies means that they can be particularly useful to people with physical and
sensory impairments or health related problems. The technologies are media
through which health and support services can be provided. Importantly, as such
technologies penetrate into ordinary homes; the scope for such services to embrace
everyone from the city to the remote village is enhanced.
Technologies have, along with white coats and ranks of beds, been a defining
feature of hospitals and clinics. They have, in many ways, symbolised the power,
authority and expert knowledge that is accorded to doctors, surgeons, clinicians and
other medical staff. They have been instrumental in re-enforcing hospital and
clinical settings as the locus for medical care (rather than our homes and
communities).
The communications revolution, however, begins to change this since at least
some of those technologies that were to be found in the hospital or clinic can now
be offered within people’s own homes. And together with the use (where needed) of
healthcare auxiliary staff, the technologies in question can facilitate healthcare
treatment in ways that would, in the past, have required hospital admission.
Underpinning this potential for change is the capacity of communications
technologies to permit (with great speed) the transmission and exchange of visual
images, data and speech. To date, much of such transmission and exchange has
been between doctors, consultants and clinicians. It generally took place within
hospitals and clinics, often excluding the patient. Now such transmission and
exchange can begin to include the patient, whether in a hospital or “at home”.
Lengthy, expensive and often repeated trips to hospitals and clinics might be
obviated through the use of such technologies in assisting diagnoses and monitoring
the effects of courses of treatment.
A 2006 European Commission report (1) has suggested that:
“...the way healthcare is presently delivered has to be deeply reformed… The
situation is becoming unsustainable and will only worsen in the future as
chronic diseases and the demographic change place additional strains on
healthcare systems around Europe.” 318 They call for a:
“… new healthcare delivery model based on preventative and person-centred
health systems. This new model can only be achieved through proper use of
ICT, in combination with appropriate organisational changes and skills.” Nowadays there are a growing number of technological approaches to
support predominantly people with long term conditions for instance vital sign
monitoring technologies, lifestyle monitoring, reminder systems, telephone based
care management programmes, kiosks for health and well-being, and others. Telemedicine and telecare
The practice of health and medical care at a distance using ICT is known as
“telemedicine”. Some speculation is taking place as to whether the term
‘telemedicine’ may be usurped by “telehealth” as more holistic approaches to
patient care are taken.
The home environment is very important to health. It can present a threat to
health or it can be a context within which independent living and participation is
facilitated. The advantages for healthcare and medical services at home may be
summarised as offering:
1. the ability for the patient to remain in his/her preferred environment;
2. the ability for the patient to benefit from the informal support provided by
family members and others;
3. a reduction in the risk of cross-infections (that is often present in hospitals);
and
4. the possibility of obtaining better physiological measures (notably
cardiogram and blood pressure measures) to assist in his/her treatment.
Added to these is the fact that (with patients being in what will usually be
their preferred environment) recovery can be quicker, and the revenue costs of
medical and nursing care reduced.
Exploitation of the potential to support independent living needs, however,
to be considered alongside a new means of providing healthcare and social support
in the home. That new means is called “telecare”. Telecare
There already are support services that use established communications
technologies in the homes of some people. These use the telephone network and
provide a means of getting help, notably for people who are at risk of falling,
sudden illness, fits or seizures. The technologies in question are known by
different names in different countries, viz. social alarms, safety alarms or
“personal response systems” (PRS).
The changing capabilities of PRS are such that there is increasing
recognition of their potential in relation to healthcare. When it comes to the
potential role of communications technologies in healthcare within people’s own
homes a convergence between PRS and telemedicine can be observed (Figure 1). 319 Together, and when relating to their role in people’s own homes, these
communications technologies comprise telecare. PRS can be considered as a good
example of telecare application. Personal response
systems Telemedicine TELECARE Figure 1. Telecare combines telemedicine and personal response systems. Personal response systems
PRS operate in all western European countries. They are primarily used by vulnerable
older people (2).
The systems are designed to enable people to call for help even if they cannot
reach the call unit - the carephone. Carephones have, therefore, become a rather
common technical device among older people living at home.
Personal response systems:
1. enable people to stay at home;
2. enable people to maintain their social and support networks;
3. provide a means of obtaining help when needed; and
4. provide reassurance to the user, their relatives and carers.
Unfortunately, such systems, and the services of which they are part, are
poorly developed in South Eastern Europe. They may, however, have the potential to
form the basis of new community based service frameworks that could bring both
healthcare and practical support to people in their own homes. This is because they:
1. are less costly than support alternatives; and
2. can be a useful way to complement or underpin other services.
Long-term experiences in several developed European countries (3) show that
a care network supported by a PRS can significantly improve home-based care
efficiency in terms of quality, quantity and co-ordination (4,5,6,7,8). Facilitating
independent living and greater levels of participation can mean a reduction in the cost
(to state institutions) of health care, especially of those costs arising from the
provision of institutional forms of accommodation (nursing and/or care homes). PRS
could, in other words, reduce the necessity for additional capital and revenue
investment in institutions (such as hospitals and clinics) that provide environments for
the intensive provision of medical or nursing care. How do Personal Response Systems Operate?
The typical PRS comprises a carephone (Figure 2) which links to (or replaces) the
telephone in a person’s home. He/she may wear or carry a personal trigger pendant
device that, when pressed, activates the carephone. A staffed monitoring and response 320 centre is contacted (Figure 3). The call-receiving unit automatically identifies the
caller and displays his/her personal data record on a computer screen. A two-way
speech path is opened. The person in need is then able to tell the operator of the
nature of his/her problem and the operator is then able to give advice or reassurance
and, depending on the circumstances, contact relatives, neighbours or the relevant
emergency services (9). Figure 2. An alarm unit with a neck worn triggering pendant (Tunstall Group, United
Kingdom) is a basic element of a personal response system. The unit is installed
in the home of an elderly person together with an ordinary telephone. The response centre can be a resource centre for home-based care in a
community. It is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The operator who
responds to the calls must be experienced in communication and skilled to help in
case of an emergency. The operator’s main tasks are to:
1. be there if and when help is needed;
2. organise appropriate help by contacting informal or formal care providers;
and
3. co-ordinate care providers’ services.
A model of how community help providers are engaged is shown in Figure
4. If a call for help comes from a client in a community where a response centre
exists (community 1) and help is needed at the caller’s home, the operator in the
PRS centre asks informal or local formal carers to go and help. Where a response
centre has its own mobile staff, the operator may, depending on the circumstances,
send one of them to help. If a call comes from outside the community where the
response centre is located (e.g. from the community 4), an external care provider is
engaged (with help is co-ordinated from the response centre). 321 Figure 3. Block diagram of a personal response system based on a public telephone
network. The system serves clients with carephones as well as others calling the
centre using ordinary telephones. A control centre operator processes a call and
arranges suitable help. COMMUNITY 1

Personal Response System. 322 Telecare in the future
The majority of PRSs currently operating around the world are of the first and the
second generation. They are limited by the need for the user to take some action
(normally pushing a button) in order to call for assistance. Only by this means can
contact with a response centre be established.
A common phenomenon, however, is one where the user is unwilling to take
such action for a complex range of reasons (5,6). These include the user thinking
that the condition (such as pain, breathlessness, dizziness or bleeding) will cease or
the user being unwilling to disturb others (whether staff at the response centre or
someone who would, as a consequence of the call, visit their home).
New systems are, however, being developed which can automatically
monitor an older person’s well-being (8). This means that, for many situations, the
response centre can be alerted automatically if problems arise (such as the older
person falling or becoming inactive). Such systems, in incorporating greater interactivity, are being described as ‘second generation’. Insofar as they increasingly
permit the provision of care at home the services associated with them can be
embraced by the broader term “telecare”.
The use of different sensor devices alongside carephones now means,
however, that such they can offer what has been described as a “dynamic method of
monitoring and detecting medical, social and environmental problems” (16,17). Figure 5. A general model of a telecare system through which carers could respond to the
user's wellbeing needs. 323 But sensors alone are not enough if the needs of growing numbers of frail
older people are to be met. The systems within which they operate must be able to
both respond to certain conditions or circumstances (the user falling, low dwelling
temperature, etc.) and to recognise and remember the user’s normal pattern of
living. Any significant deviation from that normal pattern can then be recognised
and the response centre can contact the user to establish if there is a problem. Such
intelligent systems (Figure 5) mean speedier interventions in the event of medical or
other emergencies, a reduction in care costs, and significant psycho-social benefits
for users. CASE STUDY: THE SLOVENE EXPERIENCE - THE
“LIFELINE” TELECARE SERVICE FOR OLDER PEOPLE
Slovenia and the older population
Slovenia, as a new independent state with 2 million inhabitants, has a moderate
living standard. The population is getting older. About 13% (220.000) are aged 65
years and over. Projections show that there will be another 100.000 people joining
them within the next 20 years. The increasing number of older people presents a
challenge to the system of social and health care. Only 3.8% of older people live in
care homes or other institutions, but a disproportionately high amount of money is
spent for their social and medical care. Institutions are owned by the government.
This means that there are considerable costs to the government as residents cover
only 41% of them. Government policy, however tends to restrict spending on social
and medical benefits and reduced investment in institutional care is planned. As a
consequence investment in new care homes is insufficient to cover growing needs.
This is resulting in long waiting lists (and over 2 years waiting time). Government
plans to 2005 are to provide only 1000 new beds in homes while over 3.000 are
currently required.
The situation suggests that the predominant model of institutional care
currently in place should be complemented by alternative solutions such as homebased care. However, while there is some effort being given to keeping people in
their own home by providing a range of domiciliary services, the level of home
based care differs from region to region. The services in question are organised and
co-ordinated by local social welfare and medical staff. Personal response systems in Slovenia
A telecare system called Lifeline network already exists in Slovenia (9,10,11,12).
There are currently two response centres based at and administered by homes for
older people. The first centre was established in Ljubljana in 1992. Lifeline
equipment manufactured in United Kingdom was installed. Clients were recruited
randomly and equipped with Lifeline carephones. Currently the system is used by
100 older and disabled persons on a revolving system. The response centre recruits
formal or informal carers.
Over a period of 6 years users have made 20.000 calls using the Lifeline
carephones. Of those calls, 1.8% was emergency calls for a medical assistance. In
the same period almost the same number of calls to the centre was made by people 324 using ordinary telephones. All carephone users reported positive psychological
effects, this having been confirmed in an evaluation (13).
All response centre clients pay a monthly monitoring fee. Carephones can be
leased from the response centres for what the clients are charged additionally.
Service charges vary. The amount charged depends on the financial resources of the
older person and the particular range of services he/she receives. Services charges
vary from nothing to over 18 Euros a month. A carephone purchased from a local
distributor costs up to 650 Euros. Two health insurance companies offer carephones
through their health insurance plans. Lifeline programme – Personal response system implementation
Based on the Ljubljana Lifeline network experience a national plan for the
dissemination of the system was prepared. A part of it was adopted also in the
government programmes on social care of older people in Slovenia (14,15). A
concept of a network consisting of several regional response centres was accepted
to meet needs of 30.000 potential users. The reasons for a decentralised system
were:
1. the traditional regional distribution of Slovenia’s population;
2. the national preference for decentralised systems;
3. organisational reasons that suggest that help organised and co-ordinated very
locally improved co-ordination among service providers; and
4. positive experiences of similar provision in other countries.
Some regions have already prepared their local programmes in collaboration
with their initiative group and local initiative boards. The most important issues
studied in the programmes have been the:
1. potential management and administration of a response centre;
2. needs for domiciliary care in the region;
3. availability of carer services in the region; and
4. attitude of local politicians and professionals towards the initiative
It is believed that the implementation of the programme would have
manifold positive effects in the communities. These include:
1. frail people living alone in their own homes being provided with sufficient
support to stay there instead of being institutionalised;
2. extended and improved exchange of information between those being cared
and those who care in a region;
3. better co-ordination of care provided by professional workers and/or volunteers;
and
4. more economical spending of government funds to achieve agreed social
welfare and medical standards.
At the current stage support for the introduction of a Lifeline programme at a
national level is mostly moral and verbal. Most politicians being responsible for
advances in health and social care sectors agree that the proposed programme has
substantial merits and is therefore important for Slovenia. Nevertheless the
programme has not, as yet, been systematically supported. However, some end-users 325 would accept the programme if it is paid for by social and health insurance. Two
health insurance agencies have included the service into their optional insurance
schemes.
Obstacles to a dissemination process
Technology transfer related problems
The Lifeline community response system is a new technology in Slovene society.
Having a different system of social welfare and health care from that in United
Kingdom there has been a problem of technology transfer. Consequently, Lifeline
as a technical innovation has not yet fully been accepted (11).
Lack of cooperation
Successful implementation of the Lifeline system demands co-operation,
communication and interaction between politicians, professional bodies and
individuals. Waiting for the other party to make the first move has characterised
behaviour in many regions. There has been, furthermore, a historical legacy of non
co-operation between professionals. Additionally, the reorganisation of
municipalities into tiny local communities has almost precluded regional initiatives.
At all levels, however, there has been moral support for the implementation of the
system. Lack of funds
Although an initial capital investment in any new care network is required, the
resulting service would be expected to enable considerable savings on national
residential care costs. To introduce services Slovenia would need a system that
would enable potential providers to develop their services and potential user to get
services through different insurance systems or through a welfare system. The law
on compulsory long-term care assurance is a hope for all interested, but it has been
preparation since 2004 without a promise to be ready in few years. So providers of
telecare and potential users in Slovenia have to use other means and take other ways.
The government is willing to cover 30% of the response centre infrastructure costs.
Some local communities subsidize telecare services for their locals and give some
funds for purchasing of carephones, workforce costs and the response centre
facilities. Conclusion
The question now is not whether the telecare system will be implemented in
Slovenia nationally, but rather, how long will it take to disseminate the programme
throughout the country? EXERCISES
Task 1
Demonstration of telecare system operation
1. Organize demonstration (a telecare centre could be outside your country!) 326 2. Demonstrate how system operates making calls to a telecare centres initiated
by different trigger devices.
3. Each student should imitate a telecare user making a call to the telecare
centre. Task 2
Discuss in the group the experiences you learnt. Task 3
Answer the following questions:
1. Do similar applications and services exist in your country?
2. If YES, how are they accepted by politicians, professionals, users?
3. If YES, how do they fit within frameworks of healthcare and/or social
welfare?
4. If NO, is there a need for such systems? Why do you consider that there is or
is not a need?
5. If NO, are such solutions known to professionals who may facilitate their
introduction to your country? REFERENCES

students After completing this module students should:
• be familiar with terminology and terminological problems related to
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM);
• be able to distinguish between medicine (as conventional medicine) and
CAM;
• be familiar with public health views of CAM.
CAM is, from the point of view of public health, a phenomenon that should
be followed, analysed and controlled. Noxious as well as protective factors
which accompany the implementation of CAM methods should be
recognised so as to be able to inform the public of the results in a timely
and accurate manner.
The case study analyses the viewpoints of medical doctors, patients and
the state of the phenomenon of CAM in Slovenia. A declinatory attitude of
conventional medicine to CAM is present. In contrast, population express a
favourable opinion on alternative methods of treatment, and more than a
third of them actually make use of them.
An introductory lecture gives the students first insight in definitions of
CAM. The theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a case study of CAM in
Slovenia.
After introductory lectures students first carefully read the
recommended readings. Afterwards they discuss the characteristics of CAM
in relation to TM, and both of them in relation to conventional medicine
with other students.
In continuation, they need to find published materials (e.g. papers) on
CAM/TM and present their findings to other students.

Multiple choice questionnaire and essay. 329 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE
MEDICINE: SOME PUBLIC-HEALTH VIEWS
Marjan Premik, Lijana Zaletel-Kragelj THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Public health is concerned with the reciprocal influences between the state of health of
the inhabitants and the social and environmental factors that impact on it. It is based on
a number of scientific disciplines and takes into account the findings of natural, social,
political, organisational and other sciences. Public health also deals with various
phenomena associated with the implementation of medicine.
Speaking of medicine, we are usually thinking of scientific medicine, which is
founded on natural and biomedical science, but along this kind of medicine there exist
also, known frequently also as “alternative medicine”. There exist several public health
aspects of this kind of medicine, and only few of them could be discussed in such an
introductory teaching module. The focus of this module will be on introductory issues
of this kind of medicine like definitions and brief description, epidemiology, and some
aspects of regulation, and it will not deal with its efficacy. Basic definitions and explanation of terms
Before starting to discuss the phenomenon of “the other medicine”, it is necessary first
of all to clarify terminological issues concerning it. Medicine
Before trying to explain the meaning of terms “alternative medicine”, “complementary
medicine” or related terms, we need first to define what the term “medicine” means.
1. Medicine as a discipline.
Among others, following definitions and explanations could be found:
• according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, medicine is the science
and art dealing with the maintenance of health and the prevention,
alleviation, or cure of disease (1);
• in TheFreeDictionary online dictionary, two definitions could be found
being medicine is the art and science of preventing, diagnosing, treating,
and managing illness (2), and the diagnosis and treatment of disease and
the maintenance of health (2).
But also following more specific definitions and explanations could be found:
• according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, medicine means also
the branch of medicine concerned with the nonsurgical treatment of
disease (1);
• according toTheFreeDictionary online dictionary, medicine means also
the treatment of disease by nonsurgical means (2). 330 Since this term is used in rather different context it should be supplemented with
an adjective, designating more specifically what medicine discipline we are
talking about (e.g. conventional).
2. Medicine as mean/agent used for treating diseased people.
Among others, following definitions and explanations could be found:
• in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, three definitions could be found
being medicine is a substance or preparation used in treating disease or
something that affects well-being (1), a substance (as a drug or potion) used
to treat something other than disease (1), and an object held in traditional
American Indian belief to give control over natural or magical forces; also
magical power or a magical rite (1);
• according toTheFreeDictionary online dictionary, medicine is any drug or
remedy (2). Conventional versus unconventional medicine
When we (in Europe, North America, and Australia) speak of medicine as a discipline
we are usually thinking of scientific medicine, which is founded on natural and
biomedical science, which is also known as “conventional medicine”.
1. Conventional medicine.
The term “conventional” according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary
means something what is formed by agreement (1). In this context, among
others, following definitions and explanations of conventional medicine could
be found:
• according toTheFreeDictionary online dictionary, conventional medicine
is the model of currently established Western medicine. This paradigm
was designated as conventional because of its prevalence. What is
considered conventional is always in flux (2);
• according to Medicine.Net Online Dictionary, conventional medicine is
medicine as practiced by holders of M.D. (medical doctor) or D.O.
(doctor of osteopathy) degrees and by their allied health professionals,
such as physical therapists, psychologists, and registered nurses. Other
terms for conventional medicine include allopathy and allopathic
medicine; synonyms are Western medicine, mainstream medicine,
orthodox medicine, and regular medicine; and biomedicine (3); The same
definition is adopted by the US National Institutes of Health, National
Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (4).
The other term for conventional medicine is, among others, allopathic medicine.
According to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary “allopathic” means relating to or
being a system of medicine that aims to combat disease by using remedies (as
drugs or surgery) which produce effects that are different from or incompatible
with those of the disease being treated (1). The term “allopathy” was coined in
1842 by C.F.S. Hahnemann to designate the usual practice of medicine (allopathy)
as opposed to homeopathy, the system of therapy that he founded based on the
concept that disease can be treated with drugs (in minute doses) thought capable of
producing the same symptoms in healthy people as the disease itself (3). Following
explanations of what allopathic medicine is could be found: 331 • according to Medicine.Net Online Dictionary, allopathic medicine is the
system of medical practice which treats disease by the use of remedies which
produce effects different from those produced by the disease under treatment.
MDs practice allopathic medicine (3);
• according toTheFreeDictionary online dictionary, allopathic medicine is
method of medical treatment in which drugs are administered to counter
symptoms of the disease (2);
Conventional medicine is sometimes denoted also as “standard medicine”,
or “official medicine”. The last term could be misleading since in different
countries of the world some methods classified in western countries as
“unconventional” are officially recognized as well.
2. Unconventional medicine.
Along conventional medicine there exist also the “other medicine” - the
“unconventional medicine”, in western countries frequently denoted also as
“alternative medicine”. The word “alter” in Latin means “'other”. Accordingly
the word “alternative medicine” means a “different medicine”. Other terms like
“complementary medicine” or “traditional medicine” are used. Basic unconventional medicine terminology
1. Alternative medicine.
• according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, alternative medicine is
any of various systems of healing or treating disease (as chiropractic,
homeopathy, or faith healing) not included in the traditional medical
curricula taught in the United States and Britain (1);
• in TheFreeDictionary online dictionary, two definitions could be found being
alternative medicine are therapeutic practices not considered integral to
conventional medicine; used instead of conventional therapies, and alternative
medicine is a variety of therapeutic or preventive health care practices, such as
homeopathy, naturopathy, and herbal medicine, that are not typically taught or
practiced in traditional medical communities and offer treatments that differ
from standard medical practice (2);
• according to Medicine.Net Online Dictionary, alternative medicine is healing
arts not taught in traditional Western medical schools that promote options to
conventional medicine that is taught in these schools... An example of an
alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of
undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended
by a Western physician. Complementary medicine is different from
alternative medicine. Whereas complementary medicine is used together with
conventional medicine, alternative medicine is used in place of conventional
medicine (3);
• according to Mayo Clinic, alternative medicine is medicine which is
generally thought of as being used instead of conventional methods. For
example, this might mean seeing a homeopath or naturopath instead of
regular doctor (5);
2. Complementary medicine. 332 • according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, complementary medicine
is any of the practices (as acupuncture) of alternative medicine accepted and
utilized by mainstream medical practitioners (1);
• in TheFreeDictionary online dictionary, two definitions could be found first of
them being complementary medicine are therapeutic practices not considered
integral to conventional medicine. Used in conjunction with conventional
therapies. Often used interchangeably with the term “alternative medicine”;
encompasses the wide array of therapies not generally offered by MDs and not
usually covered by health insurance. Complementary is considered a more
accurate term because in practice, patients do not replace allopathic treatment but
instead supplement it with complementary medicine (2). The second definition
states that complementary medicine is a method of health care that combines the
therapies and philosophies of conventional medicine with those of alternative
medicines, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, and biofeedback (2);
• according to Medicine.Net Online Dictionary, complementary medicine a
group of diagnostic and therapeutic disciplines that are used together with
conventional medicine. An example of a complementary therapy is using
aromatherapy to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. (2).
• complementary medicine is usually not taught or used in Western medical
schools or hospitals. Complementary medicine includes a large number of
practices and systems of health care that, for a variety of cultural, social,
economic, or scientific reasons have not been adopted by mainstream
Western medicine.
• complementary medicine is different from alternative medicine. Whereas
complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine,
alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example
of an alternative therapy is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of
undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy that has been recommended
by a physician.
• according to Mayo Clinic, complementary medicine is medicine which is
thought of as treatments used in addition to the conventional therapies your
doctor may prescribe, such as using tai chi or massage in addition to
prescription medicine for anxiety (5);
• according to Zollman and Vickers, complementary medicine refers to a group
of therapeutic and diagnostic disciplines that exist largely outside the
institutions where conventional health care is taught and provided. In the 1970s
and 1980s these disciplines were mainly provided as an alternative to
conventional health care and hence became known collectively as “alternative
medicine.” The name “complementary medicine” developed as the two
systems began to be used alongside (to “complement”) each other. Over the
years, “complementary” has changed from describing this relation between
unconventional healthcare disciplines and conventional care to defining the
group of disciplines itself (6);
3. Traditional medicine (TM).
• according to WHO definition adopted in 2000, traditional medicine is “the
sum total of the knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs
and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not,
used in the maintenance of health, as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, 333 improvement or treatment of physical and mental illnesses. The terms
complementary/alternative/non-conventional
medicine
are
used
interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries.” (7);
• according to WHO definition adopted in 2003, traditional medicine refers to
health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant,
animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques
and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and
prevent illnesses or maintain well-being (8,9);
• there are many TM systems, including traditional Chinese medicine, Indian
ayurveda and Arabic unani medicine. A variety of indigenous TM systems
have also been developed throughout history by Asian, African, Arabic,
Native American, Oceanic, Central and South American and other cultures.
Influenced by factors such as history, personal attitudes and philosophy,
their practice may vary greatly from country to country and from region to
region. Their theory and application often differ significantly from those of
allopathic medicine (9).
• according to the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005 document,
“traditional medicine” term is used when referring to a broad set of health
care practices used in Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia, and/or the
Western Pacific (9).
4. Integrated or integrative medicine.
• according to TheFreeDictionary online dictionary, integrative medicine is
holistic system of medicine that combines the best treatments and
approaches from various disciplines, including traditional medicine, natural
healing, phytotherapy, and Eastern modalities, so that treatments
complement one another resulting in safer and effective care (2);
• according to Mayo Clinic, conventional doctors are learning more about
complementary and alternative medicine because they recognize that more
than half of people try some kind of alternative treatment. Many health care
institutions have begun integrating therapies that aren't part of mainstream
medicine into their treatment programs. A number of medical schools now
include education on untraditional techniques in their curriculum. As
complementary and alternative therapies prove effective, they're being
combined more often with conventional care. This is known as integrative
medicine (5);
• according to Osher Center for Integrative Medicine of School of Medicine,
University of San Francisco, California, Integrative medicine is a new
term that emphasizes the combination of both conventional and alternative
approaches to address the biological, psychological, social and spiritual
aspects of health and illness. It emphasizes respect for the human capacity
for healing, the importance of the relationship between the practitioner and
the patient, a collaborative approach to patient care among practitioners, and
the practice of conventional, complementary, and alternative health care that
is evidence-based. (10);
The term “integrated medicine is used in the UK, while in the US, the term
“integrative medicine” is used.
5. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). 334 In some parts of the world, being Europe, North America and Australia, the
terms “complementary” and “alternative” are used to refer to health care
practices that are not part of a country’s own tradition, or not integrated into its
dominant health care system. The distinction between these two terms has been
already described. To avoid using one or another term, recently the
comprehensive term being “complementary and alternative medicine” or in short
CAM was adopted. It is a widely used term. The definition of CAM has been
developed at a 1997 conference of the United States Office for Alternative
Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, now NCCAM, and subsequently
adopted by the Cochrane Collaboration, the Ministerial Advisory Committee on
Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and WHO (2,6,9,11,12). There exist
several different but very similar, definitions:
• as cited by Roberti di Sarsina, and Zollman and Vickers (6,11), the
definition, according to NCCAM, which was later adopted by Cochrane
Collaboration, CAM is a “broad domain of healing resources that
encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their
accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the
politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a
given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self
defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health
and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and
that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.”;
• the WHO, as cited by Roberti di Sarsina (11), defines CAM slightly
different - “CAM refers to a broad set of health care practices that are not
part of a country’s own tradition and not integrated into the dominant health
care system. Other terms sometimes used to describe these health care
practices include ‘‘natural medicine’’, ‘‘non-conventional medicine’’ and
‘‘holistic medicine”;
• according to TheFreeDictionary online dictionary, CAM is a “large and
diverse set of systems of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention based on
philosophies and techniques other than those used in conventional Western
medicine. Such practices may be described as alternative, existing as a body
separate from and as a replacement for conventional Western medicine, or
complementary, used in addition to conventional Western practice. CAM is
characterized by its focus on the whole person as a unique individual, on the
energy of the body and its influence on health and disease, on the healing
power of nature and the mobilization of the body's own resources to heal itself,
and on the treatment of the underlying causes, not symptoms, of disease.
Many of the techniques used are controversial and have not been validated by
controlled studies.” (2);
• also another definitions could be found. According to Ernst, CAM is defined
as “diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention which complements mainstream
medicine by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not
met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of
medicine.” (12);
6. TM/CAM.
When discussing about health care practices that are not part of a country’s own
tradition, or not integrated into its dominant health care system referring in a 335 general sense to all of different regions of the world, the comprehensive
TM/CAM term should be used (9). Methods and systems of complementary and alternative
medicine
Like conventional medicine, also CAM is divided into narrower fields, being methods
or medical systems. Some of them are listed alphabetically, supplemented with brief
description, in Table 1.
Table 1. Some of common methods/systems of complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM), supplemented with brief description (4, 6, 13-16).

using pressure applied by the hands
A method, characterized by the stimulation of specific points on the
body by a variety of techniques, including the insertion of thin, solid,
metallic needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical
stimulation, through the skin. It is intended to remove blockages in
the flow of qi (in traditional Chinese medicine, the vital energy or life
force proposed to regulate a person's spiritual, emotional, mental, and
physical health and to be influenced by the opposing forces of yin
and yang)and restore and maintain health)
The use of essential oils from plants to support and balance the mind,

A CAM method, characterized by use of dietary supplements. A
dietary supplement is a product that is intended to supplement the
diet. A dietary supplement contains one or more dietary ingredients
(including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids,
and other substances) or their components; is intended to be taken by
mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid; and is identified on the front
label of the product as being a dietary supplement. 336 Table 1. Cont.

Energy medicine Herbal medicine
(herbalism,
phytotherapy) Homeopathy
(Homoeopathic
medicine)
Hypnotherapy Joint manipulation Magnetotherapy Description
A group of CAM interventions that deals with energy fields of two
types: veritable (energy fields, which can be measured: mechanical
vibrations such as sound and electromagnetic forces, including
visible light, magnetism, monochromatic radiation, such as laser
beams, and rays from other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum),
and putative (energy fields, which have not been measured by
conventional instruments yet, also called biofields).
Therapies involving putative energy fields are based on the
concept that human beings are infused with a subtle form of vital
energy, known under different names in different cultures (qi in
Traditional Chinese medicine, ki in the Japanese Kampo system,
doshas in Ayurveda, and in others as prana, etheric energy, fohat,
orgone, odic force, mana, and homeopathic resonance). Reiki and qi
gong are examples of therapies that involve biofields. Herbal
medicine, acupuncture, acupressure, and moxibustion, are all
believed to act by correcting imbalances in the internal biofield, such
as by restoring the flow of qi through meridians to reinstate health.
Some therapists are believed to emit or transmit the vital energy
(external qi) to a recipient to restore health.
A system of medicine which uses various remedies derived from
plants and plant extracts (herbal products; a herb, also a botanical, is
a plant or part of a plant - flowers, leaves, bark, fruit, seeds, stems, or
roots - used for its flavour, scent, or potential therapeutic properties)
to treat disorders and maintain good health
A whole medical system that originated in Europe, in Germany;
seeks to stimulate the body's ability to heal itself by giving very small
doses of highly diluted substances that in larger doses would produce
illness or symptoms (an approach called "like cures like")
The use of hypnosis in treating behavioural disease and dysfunction,
principally mental disorders. Hypnotic techniques induce states of
selective intentional focusing or diffusion combined with enhanced
imagery. They are often used to induce relaxation and also may be a
part of cognitive-behavioural therapy. The techniques have three
phases: the presuggestion (involves intentional focusing through the
use of imagery, distraction, or relaxation; subjects focus on relaxation
and passively disregard intrusive thoughts), the suggestion
(characterized by introduction of specific goals; for example,
analgesia may be specifically suggested), and the postsuggestion
phase (involves continued use of the new behaviour following
termination of hypnosis)
A manual procedure involving directed thrust to move a joint past the
physiological range of motion, without exceeding the anatomical
limit
An energy medicine therapy in which practitioners use magnets, which
produce a measurable force called a magnetic field. Static magnets have
magnetic fields that do not change, unlike electromagnets, which
generate magnetic fields only when electrical current flows through them.
Magnets are usually made from metals (such as iron) or alloys (mixtures
of metals, or of a metal and a nonmetal). Static, or permanent, magnets
are widely marketed for pain control 337 Table 1. Cont.

Manipulative and
Body-Based Practices Massage therapy Meditation Mind-Body Medicine Moxibustion Naturopathy
(Naturopathic
medicine) Nutritional medicine Description
A heterogeneous group of CAM interventions and therapies, which
include chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation (an example is
spinal manipulation), massage therapy, reflexology, Alexander
technique, Feldenkrais method, and many others
A group of practices and techniques, which uses pressing, rubbing,
and moving muscles and other soft tissues of the body, primarily by
using the hands and fingers. The intent is to relax the soft tissues,
increase delivery of blood and oxygen to the massaged areas, warm
them, and decrease pain. A few popular examples of this therapy are
Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, trigger point massage, and
shiatsu massage. In some instances, massage therapy is sometimes
part of conventional medicine (for example, in reducing a type of
swelling called lymphedema), in others, it is part of CAM (for
example, in enhancing immune system functioning)
A conscious mental process using certain, such as focusing attention
or maintaining a specific posture, to suspend the stream of thoughts
and relax the body and mind. It can be practiced for various reasons,
for example to increase physical relaxation, mental calmness, and
psychological balance, to cope with one or more diseases and
conditions, and for overall wellness
Practices that focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body,
and behaviour, with the intent to use the mind to affect physical
functioning and promote health. It typically focuses on intervention
strategies that are thought to promote health, such as relaxation,
hypnosis, visual imagery, meditation, yoga, biofeedback, tai chi, qi
gong, cognitive-behavioural therapies, group support, autogenic
training, and spirituality
In traditional Chinese medicine, the use of heat from burning the herb
moxa on or near the skin at an acupuncture point. Intended to
stimulate the flow of qi and restore health
A whole medical system, rooted in health care approaches that were
popular in Europe, especially in Germany, in the 19th century, but it
also includes therapies (both ancient and modern) from other
traditions. It aims to support the body's ability to heal itself through
the use of dietary and lifestyle changes together with CAM therapies
such as herbs, massage, and joint manipulation. The emphasis is on
supporting health rather than combating disease.
Use of nutritional methods to address and prevent disease. Uses diets
and nutritional supplements. Often used to address allergies and
chronic digestive problems. The difference between nutritional
medicine and dietetics is that nutritional therapists work independently
in accordance with naturopathic principles and focus on disorders
which they believe can be attributed to nutritional deficiency, food
intolerance or toxic overload. They believe these three factors are
involved in a wide range of health problems. Dieticians usually work
under medical supervision, using diets to encourage healthy eating and
tackle a narrower range of diseases. Nutritional therapists often use
exclusion diets and herbal remedies to tackle patients' problems. 338 Table 1. Cont.

A paranormal or parapsychological ability to detect "radiation"
within the human body. According to the theory, all human bodies
give off unique or characteristic "radiations" as do all other physical
bodies or objects. Such radiations are often termed an "aura".

person doing tai chi moves his body slowly and gently, while
breathing deeply and meditating (tai chi is sometimes called "moving
meditation"). It is believed that tai chi helps the flow throughout the
body of a proposed vital energy qi
A whole medical system that originated in China. It is based on the
concept that disease results from disruption in the flow of qi and
imbalance in the forces of yin and yang. Practices such as herbs,
meditation, massage, and acupuncture seek to aid healing by
restoring the yin-yang balance and the flow of qi
A therapy in which practitioners pass their hands over another
person's body with the intent to use their own perceived healing
energy to identify energy imbalances and promote health
A mind-body practice from Ayurvedic medicine that combines
breathing exercises, physical postures, and meditation. It is intended
to calm the nervous system and balance the body, mind, and spirit.
The various styles of yoga that people use for health purposes
typically combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditation or relaxation 339 Detailed description of many of them could be found at web pages of NCCAM (14)
and UK Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (17). Also,
many of them are described in a series of papers published in British Medical Journal
in 1999 (18-24). Categorization of complementary and alternative medicine
methods/systems
TM/CAM methods are very heterogeneous but could be classified in some major
areas. Two categorizations are presented.
NCCAM, US, categorization
In the US, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)
of the National Institutes of Health uses following classification (4):
1. Whole medical systems (25).
TM/CAM systems are complete sets of theories and practices. A system isn't
just a single practice or remedy, such as massage, but many different practices
that all centre on a philosophy or lifestyle, such as the power of nature or the
presence of energy in your body. Many healing systems developed long before
the conventional Western medicine. Examples of complementary and
alternative medicine treatment/healing systems are ayurveda, homeopathy,
naturopathy, and ancient medicines (traditional Chinese medicine, traditional
Asian medicine, traditional Pacific Islander medicine, traditional American
Indian, and traditional Tibetan practices).
2. Mind-body medicine (26).
Mind-body techniques strengthen the communication between mind and body.
It is believed that these two systems must be in harmony for you to stay
healthy. Examples of mind-body medicine techniques are meditation, yoga,
biofeedback, hypnosis, and relaxation therapies, as well as art therapies, such
as poetry, music and dance.
3. Biologically based practices (27).
These practices use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and
vitamins. Examples of biologically based practices are herbal medicine, and
diet/nutritional therapies.
4. Manipulative and body based practices (28).
These methods use human touch to move or manipulate a specific part of your
body. Examples of manipulative and body based practices are chiropractic or
osteopathic manipulation, massage, and acupressure.
5. Energy medicine (29).
Energy medicine practices use energy fields. Unblocking or re-balancing
energy force is the goal of these therapies. Examples of energy therapies are
acupuncture, Reiki, qi gong, therapeutic touch, magnet therapy, polarity
therapy, and light therapy
The distinctions between therapies aren't clear-cut. Some techniques may fit in more
than one category. For example, acupressure could fit either in the category of
manipulation and touch or in the category of energy therapies. Also, there exist 340 TM/CAM treatment/healing systems which use techniques from more than one
category.
House of Lords, UK, categorization
In the UK, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology report
on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (15) took a different line by
categorising specific approaches and therapies into 3 groups:
1. Professionally organised alternative therapies.
This group includes what may be called the principal disciplines: osteopathy,
chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal medicine and homeopathy. Two of them,
osteopathy and chiropractic, were in 2002 already regulated in their
professional activity and education in UK by Acts of Parliament. These
methods are seen as the principal methods by most of the CAM world.
2. Complementary therapies.
This group includes therapies which are most often used to complement
conventional medicine and do not include diagnostic skills: Alexander
technique, aromatherapy, Bach and other flower remedies, body work
therapies, including massage, counselling stress therapy, hypnotherapy,
meditation, reflexology, shiatsu, healing, Maharishi ayurvedic medicine,
nutritional medicine, and yoga.
3. Alternative disciplines.
This group includes those other disciplines which purport to offer diagnostic
information as well as treatment and which, in general, favour a philosophical
approach and are indifferent to the scientific principles of conventional
medicine, and through which various and disparate frameworks of disease
causation and its management are proposed. These therapies can be split into
two sub-groups:
• long-established and traditional systems of healthcare: anthroposophical
medicine, ayurvedic medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, Eastern
medicine, naturopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine, and
• other alternative disciplines which lack any credible evidence base:
crystal therapy, dowsing, iridology, kinesiology, and radionics. Health philosophy differences between conventional and
unconventional medicine
From the public health perspective, we would like to emphasize the philosophical and
conceptual differences between conventional medicine and TM/CAM.
There exist two fundamentally different modern models of health: the
biomedical and the bio-eco-psycho-social models. The knowledge on of these two
models is important for understanding differences between conventional medicine and
TC/CAM, as well as for understanding the processes related to the supply, demand
and evaluation of conventional and unconventional medicine health services:
1. Biomedicine is a dominant paradigm in the modern conventional medicine
health care systems (Figure 1). 341 biomedical model of health CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE biobio-ecoeco-psychopsycho-social model of health Figure 1. Health philosophy differences between conventional medicine, and complementary
and alternative medicine. It is based on natural sciences/scientific medical theory and practice focused
on the internal operation of the body. Biomedicine verifies its theories which
are accepted as fact by using scientifically methods. Accepted facts are not
suspicions or deductions but discoveries revealed with the assistance of
specific, universally accepted, strict procedures, focused on the integral
functioning of the body, including mental processes. Biomedical certainty is
founded on the supposition that people can be understood and reconstructed in
all their physical, mental and social integrity through the collection of facts
about various parts of their body.
Biomedical monitoring has in the last decades of this century been
exposed to serious criticism both by medical and non-medical circles due to
some of its deficiencies (30-34). Although critics of the existing biomedical
paradigm proceed from divergent standpoints and different levels of analyses
(which consequently has different implications), they share the conclusion that
what are needed are broader and stricter scientific research methods, the
promotion of the significance of public health, the strengthening of spiritual
values, the recognition of social stratification and differences in communities,
and consideration of the personal beliefs of patients. Critics offer a series of
different social scientific outlooks and theories which cast doubt on whether
biomedicine is the “one and only” medical science and demand a scientific
evaluation of the meaning of quality and freedom. The biomedical model is
also criticised because of the monopoly of doctors on “medical knowledge”
and because of the predominantly unacceptable standpoint regarding
everything which could be denoted as a different view of an illness, a health
problem or health. The common denominator of all the more important critics
is the awareness that healthcare and treatment can end using biomedical
technology.
2. The biomedical model of understanding illness and health problems is placed
side by side with the bio-eco-psycho-social model of understanding diseases
and health. The bio-eco-psycho-social model does not agree with universality,
neutrality and the all-round usefulness of the biomedical model and it
questions such a principle. 342 The bio-eco-psycho-social model is based on searching for the cause
for disease outside the body, presupposing that disease is a product of life style
and specific social circumstances. It is a synthesis of various
conceptualizations. It allows us to develop more comprehensive and efficient
approach also to health promotion and disease prevention and it is thus of
crucial importance also for public health. CAM and international integrations/organizations
Several international integrations/organizations are dealing with the problem of
dialogue between conventional medicine and CAM, as well as different aspects of
CAM (e.g. quality, effectiveness, and safety of CAM procedures, education of CAM
practitioners, etc.). For European region, response on CAM phenomenon of following
international integrations/organizations is important:
1. WHO made a number of policy recommendations and documents concerning
TM/CAM, among them:
• in 2000 the General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and
Evaluation of Traditional Medicine (35) were published;
• in 2001the Legal Status of Traditional medicine and Complementary/
Alternative Medicine: a Worldwide Review (36) was published;
• in 2002 the Traditional Medicines Strategy: 2002-2005 (9) was published;
• in 2004 the Guidelines on Developing Consumer Information on Proper
use of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (37) were
published;
• in 2005 the Global Atlas of Traditional, Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (38) was published.
The WHO is prepared to help evaluate and study the safety and effectiveness
of the TM/CAM methods used (by research), to supplement knowledge in
traditional and modern health practitioners (an approach to health in a way
which, in individual environments, is passed on from generation to
generation), as well as to notify the public regarding the confirmed discoveries
associated with the use of unconventional methods. For this purpose the WHO
has at the beginning of this millennium already founded several collaboration
centres for traditional medicine. Among developed countries which have such
centres are for example Belgium, Italy, Japan and the US (8).
2. In European Union a growing demand on CAM among the European citizens
also dictated some steps dealing with CAM sphere, but the process is much
slower than at the global level (e.g. WHO). Among important steps are:
• in 1993 COST, European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and
Technical Research Action, B-4 project: Unconventional medicine was
launched. The main objective of this project was to foster international
collaboration in research into the therapeutic significance of CAM, its
cost-benefit ratio and its sociocultural importance as a basis for
evaluation of its possible usefulness or risks in the public health. In this
project 13 parties participated (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, and UK) (39); 343 • in 1997 - European Parliament has promulgated on 29/5/97 a resolution
(A4-0075/97) on the "Status of non-conventional medicine" (40),
• in 1998 the final report on COST Action B-4 project: Unconventional
medicine 1993-98 (EUR 18420 EN) was published (41).
• in 1999, the Supplement to this final report was published (42);
• in 2001, the Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council on the Community Code Relating to Medicinal Products for
Human Use. Official Journal of the European Communities L 311/67-128
was adopted (43). This directive among other medicinal products
regulates also homeopathic medicinal products.
From the public health point of view seems clear, that a tendency towards the
integration of different CAM therapeutic procedures in health care systems is
inevitable, but there are too many different points of view in EU to adopt
common legal base (44);
3. Council of Europe.
• 1999 – Resolution No. 1206 entitled “A European approach to nonconventional medicines” (45) was promulgated. In it the Assembly of
the Council stated that it believes that the best guarantee for patients
lies in a properly trained profession, which is aware of its limitations,
has a system of ethics and self-regulation, and is also subject to outside
control. Incorporation of TM/CAM into national health care
systems
WHO has defined three types of health system to describe the degree to which
TM/CAM is an officially recognized element of health care, being integrative,
inclusive, and tolerant systems (Figure 2) (9).
integrative HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
RELATION TO CAM inclusive tolerant Figure 2. Health care systems classification according to the incorporation of TM/CAM (9) within the system. LEGEND: TM=traditional medicine, CAM=complementary and
alternative medicine. 344 1. Integrative health care systems
In an integrative system, TM/CAM is officially recognized and incorporated
into all areas of health care provision. This means that: TM/CAM is included in
the relevant country’s national drug policy; providers and products are
registered and regulated; TM/CAM therapies are available at hospitals and
clinics (both public and private); treatment with TM/CAM is reimbursed under
health insurance; relevant research is undertaken; and education in TM/CAM is
available (9).
In 2002, only China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the
Republic of Korea and Viet Nam were considered to have attained an
integrative system (9).
2. Inclusive health care systems
An inclusive system recognizes TM/CAM, but has not yet fully integrated it
into all aspects of health care: health care delivery, education and training, or
regulation. TM/CAM might not be available at all health care levels, health
insurance might not cover treatment with TM/CAM, official education in
TM/CAM might not be available at university level, and regulation of
TM/CAM providers and products might be lacking or only partial. Work on
policy, regulation, practice, health insurance coverage, research and education,
are in process or will be prepared (9).
Countries with an inclusive system in 2002 included developing
countries (Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Mali) which had a national TM/CAM
policy, but little or no regulation of TM/CAM products, and developed
countries (Canada, the USA, the UK, Germany, Norway) which in 2002 did
not offer significant university-level education in TM/CAM, but which were
making efforts to ensure the quality and safety of TM/CAM (9).
3. Tolerant health care systems
In countries with a tolerant system, the national health care system is based
entirely on allopathic medicine, but some TM/CAM practices are tolerated by
law (9).
Here authors need to stress that beside listed types of systems, also exist or existed in
the near past, the intolerant systems. In these systems, CAM methods were legally not
allowed. Slovenia could be classified in this group until 2008. Users of CAM
How many people use CAM and which methods?
Only partial answer to this question could be attained since in different countries
CAM methods are differently treated, and different methods are included under the
term CAM.
1. For the US, the most comprehensive and recent data on use of CAM were
presented in 2004 by experts from National Center for Health Statistics,
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and NCCAM (46). They came
from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey, an annual cross-sectional
study in 31,044 adults aged 18 years or older responded. It included detailed
questions on CAM. 345 The results of this survey showed that 35.1% of adults used some form
of CAM therapy (excluding megavitamin therapy and prayer) during the past
12 months. The 10 most commonly used CAM therapies, excluding use of
prayer, natural products (18.9%), deep breathing exercises (11.6%), meditation
(7.6%), chiropractic care (7.5%), yoga (5.1%), massage (5.0%), and diet-based
therapies (3.5%).
If megavitamin therapy and prayer are included, according to this survey,
62.1% of adults used some form of CAM therapy during the past 12 months.
2. The UK Science and Technology Sixth Report (15) is summarizing results of
two surveys in the UK, and England which give us a rough impression about
how many people use CAM methods in developed countries:
• in a telephone survey of 1204 randomly selected UK adults, conducted
for the BBC in 1999, 20% of respondents declared that they used any of
CAM methods in past 12 months (herbal medicine 34%, aromatherapy
21%, homeopathy 17%, acupuncture/acupressure 14%, massage 6%,
reflexology 6%, osteopathy 4%, and chiropractic 3%; some individuals
used more than one therapy);
• in a postal survey of 5010 randomly selected adults (response rate of
53%), conducted about the same time in England, 13.6% of respondents
had visited a CAM practitioner in the preceding 12 months (osteopathy
4.3%, chiropractic 3.6%, aromatherapy 3.5%, a reflexology 2.4%, and
acupuncture: 1.6%; some individuals used more than one therapy), and
overall 28.3% of respondents had either visited a CAM therapist or had
purchased an over-the-counter remedy;
3. For some other countries in Europe, following data could be found:
• in 1994, Fisher and Ward in their review article reported that
percentages of public reporting use of complementary medicine (any
form of it) was (47): Belgium 31%, Denmark 23.2%, France 49%,
Germany 46%, Netherlands 20%, Sweden 25%, United Kingdom 26%;
• in 2001, Nilsson and co-workers reported that in 1999 MONICA survey
in Sweden 30.5% of 5794 respondents reported that they had taken a
CAM product (vitamins, minerals or biological CAM remedy) in the
preceding 2 weeks. Vitamins/minerals only had been taken by 11.7%
and other CAM remedies (dominated by fish oil, ginseng and Q10) with
or without vitamins/minerals by 18.8% (48);
• in 2003, Biocca et al. reported that in Italy in general, the percentage of
people who turned to at least one non-conventional medicine therapy in
the period 1997-1999 was 15.6% (from 6.5% in southern Italy to 24.1
in northeastern Italy) (49);
• in 2007, Rössler and co-workers reported results of their longitudinal
community Zurich Study in Switzerland (50). They showed that CAM
use in the last 12 months was reported by 21.9% of the participants in
1993 and by 29.5% in 1999. Why people use CAM and who are the users?
People who use CAM methods usually have chronic conditions for which
conventional medicine has not provided a satisfactory solution, either because it is 346 insufficiently effective or because it causes adverse effects. On general, they have
already consulted a conventional healthcare practitioner for the problem, and many
continue to use the two systems concurrently:
1. In US, according to the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (46), CAM
was most often used to: treat back pain or back problems 16.8%, head or chest
colds 9.5%, neck pain or neck problems 6.6%, joint pain or stiffness 4.9%,
arthritis, gout, lupus or fibromyalgia 4.9&, and anxiety or depression 4.5%.
The same survey showed that Cam is more frequently used by females
(females: 39.7%, males 30.2%), middle-aged participants (18-29 years: 32.9%,
30-39 years: 37.8%, 40-49 years: 39.4%, 50-59 years 39.6%, 60-69 years:
32.6%, 70-84 years: 25.1%, 85 years or more 14.9%), and participants with
highest education (less than high school 20.8%, high school graduate/GED12
recipient 29.5%, some college-no degree 38.8%, associate of arts degree
39.8%, bachelor of arts or science degree 45.9%, masters, doctorate,
professional degree 48.8%).
2. The UK Science and Technology Sixth Report (15) is also summarizing results
about the main reasons for accessing CAM medicines or therapies of the BBC
survey of CAM use in the United Kingdom in 1999 being: helps or relieves
injury/condition 25%, just like it 21%, find it relaxing 19%, good health/wellbeing generally 14%, preventative measure 12%, do not believe conventional
medicine works 11%, doctor's recommendations/referral 11%, to find out
about other ways of life/new things 11%, way of life/part of lifestyle 8%,
cannot get treatment on NHS/under conventional medicine 7%.
Zollman and Vickers in their series of “ABC of complementary
medicine” reported that about 55-65% of those who consulted complementary
practitioners were female, what was a similar proportion to users of
conventional healthcare (51). They also reported that highest users were those
aged 35-60. On the contrary, users of conventional healthcare services tended
to be the very old and the very young. Also, users of complementary medicine
tended to be in higher socioeconomic groups and had higher levels of
education than users of conventional care.
3. For Sweden, in 2001, Nilsson and co-workers reported that among 1999
MONICA survey in Sweden use of CAM remedies was more frequent in
women than in men and more frequent in people with high than with low level
of education. The prevalence was unrelated to a history of severe
cardiovascular disease or diabetes but significantly more common in subjects
with poor self-perceived health, particularly so in women.
In all environments people use different CAM methods for the preventive purposes. CAM practitioners
The data on structure of CAM practitioners are scarce, what is the reflection of
situation of CAM. Nevertheless, there exist some of them. We have found some data
on CAM practitioners in UK:
• Zollman and Vickers in their series of “ABC of complementary medicine”
report that the number and profile of complementary practitioners is changing 347 rapidly - in 1981 about 13,500 registered practitioners were working in the
UK, and by 1997 this figure had increased to about 40,000 (51).
• few years later, the UK Science and Technology Sixth Report (15) reports the
results of the Centre for Complementary Health Studies at Exeter University
which was commissioned by the Department of Health to conduct a study of
the professional organisation of CAM bodies in the UK. The results of this
study suggested that there in 1997 there were approximately 50,000 CAM
practitioners in the UK, and that there were approximately 10,000 statutory
registered health professionals who practise some form of CAM. Some perspectives on and attitudes towards CAM
It is typical for all socio-cultural groups of people to form standpoints, relations,
convictions, behaviour and standards for conventional as well as CAM. Two groups
are interesting from the public health point of view, being medical doctors, and lay
people as users of conventional medicine and CAM.
1. Medical doctors.
Medical doctors as dominant representative and implementators of conventional
medicine gain most of their discoveries from the biomedical field of science and
have their relations formally defined in the codes of practice of their medical
organisations. Thus, it is not surprising that their attitude towards alternative
medicine is in many countries negative. Their attitude towards CAM is a
reflection of attitude of the country towards CAM, and their education.
For UK, for example, Zollman and Vickers reported in 1999 that
surveys of doctors' attitudes to complementary medicine showed at that time
that physicians in UK believed CAM is moderately effective, but low response
rates make some studies unreliable. Although hospital doctors and older
general practitioners tended to be more sceptical than younger doctors and
medical students, most respondents believed that some of the more established
forms were of benefit and should be available on the National Health System.
Younger doctors and medical students were also more likely to perceive their
knowledge of complementary medicine as inadequate and wanted be more
educated in the subject (52). Qualitative research showed also that many
doctors wanted to be supportive of patients' choices and would welcome
further information, although they generally regard CAM therapies as
scientifically unproved (52). Their main concerns were that the patients (52):
• may see unqualified complementary practitioners,
• may risk missed or delayed diagnosis,
• may stop or refuse effective conventional treatment,
• may waste money on ineffective treatments,
• may experience dangerous adverse effects from treatment,
• the mechanisms of some complementary treatments are so implausible
that they cannot possibly work.
2. Lay people.
In contrast, many lay people express a favourable opinion on alternative
methods of treatment, and a lot of them actually make use of them. We
have already discussed the possible reasons - contemporary user of health 348 care services wants to be treated in more holistic way, and wants to be
more actively involved in the process. This is well known more than a
decade. For example, Zollman and Vickers in their series of “ABC of
complementary medicine” reported that According to the surveys of users
of complementary medicine in UK, about 80% of them were satisfied with
the treatment they received (53). This was not always dependent on an
improvement in their presenting complaint. For example, in one UK survey
of cancer patients, changes attributed to CAM included being emotionally
stronger, less anxious, and more hopeful about the future even if the cancer
remained unchanged (53). Furthermore, a Community Health Council
survey found that over two thirds of CAM users returned for further
courses of treatment and that over 90% thought that they might use
complementary medicine in the future (53). This indicated high level of
satisfaction of CAM users. Zollman and Vickers claim that the specific
effects of particular therapies obviously account for a proportion of patient
satisfaction, but surveys and qualitative research show that many patients
also value some of the general attributes of CAM (53). They discuss in
details several aspects of satisfaction of users of CAM with CAM methods
and practitioners, being (53):
• amount of time available for consultation and continuity,
• attention to personality and personal experience,
• user involvement and choice,
• hope,
• touch,
• dealing with ill defined symptoms,
• making sense of illness, and
• spiritual and existential concerns.
From the public health perspective we should stress that, for the lay people's
good, in the triangle lay people - medical doctor - CAM practitioner should exist
a communication, but Zollman and Vickers report that there exist evidence that
most people who have used complementary medicine did not tell their doctors
about it (52). Medical doctors can have and should have an important role in
identifying their patients who use CAM, to minimize as much as possible the risk
of harm of using CAM treatments, and, as far as possible, ensuring that their
choice of treatment is in their best interests. To achieve such a situation, medical
doctors should first be well informed about different aspects of CAM, and to
establish appropriate communication with patients about using CAM, and
sometimes with CAM practitioners as well. Public health and its role in building bridges between
conventional medicine and CAM
From the public health perspective, in countries with predominant conventional
medicine, CAM cannot be overlooked any more. It is more and more clear, that
conventional medicine has become dependent on medical equipment and
pharmaceutical industry which provides expensive technological solutions to health
problems, even when they are not particularly effective. But this is only one problem. 349 The other is, that under the umbrella of scientific evidence based practices, it has
turned its back on holism and simple methods of intervention, and much more, it
treats the common user of health care services as an object. On the contrary,
contemporary user of health care services wants to be more actively involved in the
process. On account of its comprehensive philosophical perspective on health, which
covers several dimensions of population health need, and not almost exclusively
physical dimension, what is a dominant characteristic of conventional medicine
CAM, is widely accepted by the lay people. We could even speculate that the
consultation process and holistic approach adopted by practitioners of CAM make
patients feel in more control of their illness.
All this does not mean that the bio-eco-psycho-social model wishes to or
should be replace the biomedical model of health. The concern is more that the stress
on the need for biomedical scientific facts is only one special method of
understanding illness and health. To depend only on biomedical facts denies historical
and cultural depth. Conflicts between specialists from various professions have to be
understood in the context, and here public health has the role of building a bridge
between them, to contribute to the mastering of the bio-eco-psycho-social model of
health, which is the standpoint of various projects for the promotion of health
throughout the world as well as in Slovenia (54, 55).
What is relevant for the patient does not necessarily have to be relevant for the
medical doctor and vice versa. Models of health beliefs (56) help us to understand to
what degree a certain person is prepared to undertake medical activities with respect
to his own understanding of health and disease and with respect to the consequences
of not taking any medical action when being ill. The way and the time an individual
will attempt to satisfy his needs for health care/treatment also depends to a large
extent on his/her integration into the social network surrounding him/her (57).
Amateur reference systems (meaning the social network through which individuals
pass before they turn to professional counselling) in essence adopt the social cultural
standpoints, knowledge and standards of the patient's contemporaries regarding
healthcare, so it is often the patient's social network which influences his/her choice
of what, where and when the patient begins to seek conventional or unconventional
medical help. Those seeking help from unconventional medicine practitioners in
Slovenia were not protected by law or medicine. There is the possibility of abuse of
the searcher's trust through the exploitation of his health problems and illness to make
a profit, and even worse, through the intentional or unintentional waylaying from
professional help which could have been successful, and through direct threats to
health with the use of harmful methods.
CAM is a phenomenon which has to be monitored, analysed and influenced
through the prism of the biomedical and bio-eco-psycho-social theoretical models, in
order to be able to recognise both the dangers and the safety factors involved in its
practice. Potential user should be informed about potential dangers in order to make
an informed decision. They also need reliable information on standards to be expected
in relation to good CAM practice, as well as to know where they can find a competent
and qualified therapist; how they can check that this therapist is currently registered in
the register of CAM therapists. But how this could be reached, if not regulated? Even
in countries with inclusive health care system like UK, there exist enormous problems
in reaching these goals (58). 350 CASE STUDY: COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE
MEDICINE IN SLOVENIA
CAM in Slovenia has officially more than 200 years long tradition (59), but its way
towards recognition was and still it is thorny. This case study reviews some important
public health issues concerning alternative medicine in Slovenia and then, in the
discussion, with the assistance of various theoretical models, comments upon the
present situation and the possible steps to be taken. Basic unconventional medicine terminology in Slovenia
According to the new Alternative Medicine Act (in Slovene language Zakon o
zdravilstvu) (60), the official term for CAM in Slovene language is “zdravilstvo”
what could be translated into English as “healing”. In Slovenia, avoiding of the term
“medicine” to designate other methods than conventional medicine is very strongly
present. The practitioners of unconvential medicine in Slovenia are designated as
“zdravilci” what in English language means “healers”. But, one could note that in the
English translation of the title of the act the term “alternative medicine” is used. Thus,
we nevertheless could conclude that official term for CAM used in Slovenia when
referring in English language is “alternative medicine”.
However, there are many other terms used like “unofficial medicine”,
“unconventional medicine”, “holistic medicine”, “additional medicine”, and
“complementary medicine”. In certain spheres, also some contemptuous terms like
“quackery”, “dabbling”, and “bungling” are used. Some perspectives on and attitudes towards CAM in
Slovenia
Attitude of the State
Prior 2007
Prior the adoption of the Alternative Medicine Act in 2007, there was a legal
confusion in the filed of CAM in Slovenia. Some of laws and which are still in force
deal also with CAM issue in the period after independency of Slovenia (44):
• the Health Services Act, adopted in 1992, states in Article 58 that “healthcare
workers are permitted to use only verified and professional undisputed
supplementary traditional and alternative forms of diagnostics, treatment and
rehabilitation which do not harm the health of people and which are approved by
the ministry responsible for health with the agreement of the medical ethics
committee.” (44,61-63). According to Planinsec (44), from the legal point of view,
it was important that legislator classified “supplementary traditional and alternative
forms of diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation” in the Chapter VI, Health Care
Practice, of the Health Services Act, what automatically mean that CAM was
classified as health care service. But According to Article 45, health care could be
practiced only by health care workers (among them medical doctors) “according to
the adopted health care doctrine and Medical Deontology Code or other
professional and ethical codes”. Permission to medical doctor to perform CAM 351 from the article is issued and revoked by the Ministry of Health, which also
prescribes the procedures for approving such activities;
• the General Practitioners Services Act, adopted in 1999, in its Article 3 lays medical
doctors an obligation that “they should by their otherwise independent work follow
methods which are professionally and scientifically recognized and verified (44,64).
Medical doctors are obligated to do so also by Medical Deontology Code (Article 3)
(44,62,63,65), which will be discussed in details later on. Additionally, Rules on
medical licences, adopted in 1999, in its Article 9 lays medical doctor an obligation
that if he/she wants to have a licence, he/she “must subscribe a statement that he/she
would not practise healing and quackery” (44,66);
• in the Medicinal Devices Act (67), adopted in 1999 (later replaced with the
Medicinal Products Act, adopted in 2006), homeopathic medicines/products are
included. According to this law, homeopathic product could be produced and
sold (only in pharmacies), but only after adoption of appropriate executive
regulation. According to the EU Directive 2001/83/ES this regulation, being
Rules on homeopathic products (44, 68), was adopted in 2004 (first version was
adopted in 2001). But this sphere was regulated only on principle, and legally
could not be practised, since homeopathy was not legally recognized as health
activity.
It is obvious, that prior 2007 CAM was regulated only on principle (for medical
professionals only), but legally could not be practised, since there was on one side a
lack of executive regulations dealing with “supplementary traditional and alternative
forms of diagnostics, treatment and rehabilitation” in details, and on the other side
there were other legal regulations, being acts or executive regulations, which
contained articles which were incompatible. All this resulted in a magic circle of
admissibility/non-admissibility of CAM practice in Slovenia (44).
Present situation
At the present, characteristics of attitude of the Republic of Slovenia towards CAM are:
• in early autumn 2007, the new Alternative Medicine Act (60) was adopted;
• for Slovenia we could say, that after adoption of the Alternative Medicine Act,
it could be classified in the group of countries with tolerant system;
• the national health care system is still based entirely on allopathic medicine,
but some CAM practices are now tolerated by the law;
• the classification of CAM methods/systems is basing on NCCAM
classification, and according to the Alternative Medicine Act (Article 4) (60)
methods/systems of CAM (healing activities) presented in Table 2 are allowed
to be practised in Slovenia;
• According to the Act, detailed definition of healing systems and healing
methods is to be regulated by the Minister of health.
• the Healers Chamber is authorized for recognition and acknowledgement of
healing systems and healing methods, as well as for control/inspection (Article
5 of the Alternative Medicine Act) (60);
• CAM could be practised only by healers which are according to the
Alternative Medicine Act (Article 6) (60) adult physical subjects with at least
secondary health education and passed exam, regulated by the Minister of
health, with valid licence of healer, prescribed by the Alternative Medicine Act 352 (Article 35). Irrespective to this, homeopathy, chiropractic and osteopathy
could be practised only by physical subjects with diploma of medical faculty,
and supplemented by corresponding knowledge on CAM methods, with valid
licence of healer.

information problems – there is informational asymmetry – and lay people, in
shortage of conventional medicine health care, are »buying almost everything« what
CAM is offering them to restore or preserve/maintain their good health. Attitude of health professionals
Medical doctors
The attitude of Medical Chamber of Slovenia, the highest professional association of
medical doctors in Slovenia, is strictly negative towards CAM. In the Code of
Medical Deontology of Slovenia (65) there are several articles which express this
negative attitude:
• the Code lays medical doctors in Slovenia an obligation to refuse to cooperate
with people who are “illegally or unprofessionally concerned with the practice
of medicine” (Article 2), and
• “to practise only those therapeutic methods that have a scientific basis and
have been accepted by the profession“ (Article 3);
• according to Code, medical doctors are free to select their methods and ways
of patient treatment, but they are obliged to consistently follow the
achievements of medical science (Article 14);
• according to Code, medical doctor “can practise medical service only if hi/she is
registered in the Register of medical doctors, has licence for certain professional
sphere and has appropriate education and qualification” (Article 10);
Also a lot of medical doctors themselves have negative attitude towards CAM.
At its annual meeting in 1989 the Slovene Medical Society devoted all its professional
debates to alternative medicine (the meeting was entitled “Alternative Medicine is not
Medicine”'). At this meeting the doctors distanced themselves from non-standard
methods of work, demanded suitable measures to be taken against members of the
Medical Society who ignore ethical provisions and are using unverified methods, and
also addressed a warning to responsible people that suitable action must be taken
when “healing” has bogus effects and when people are duped (69). 353 However, despite the formally negative attitude of the medical profession,
greater and greater interest is being shown by medical doctors and pharmacists,
especially in primary health care, in some forms of treating patients that could be
called alternative (70). Interest is not only being shown in acupuncture (71) and
acupressure, which official medicine has already placed into the list of permitted
health services (72), but also in methods which are being introduced into practice in
some parts of the developed world, such as meditation, homeopathy (73) and
chiropractics. Acupuncture was, for example, introduced in Slovene health care
services at the end of seventies and early eighties (72). Proof that medical doctors in
Slovenia are constantly showing increasing interest is shown by the founding of
professional medical associations such as the Acupuncture Association (developed
from the previously formed Section of the Slovenian Medical Society for
Acupuncture and Traditional Medicine) (74), the Society of Homeopathy (founded in
1991), and INTA - Initiative Committee for Open Dialogue of Medical Doctors on
Integrative Medicine INTA, founded in 2002, as well as various professional
meetings discussing alternative medicine (75).
The attitude of medical doctors towards CAM has an interesting characteristics
- it seems that they tolerate alternative methods more readily if they are used for
prevention (e.g. healthy diets, sufficient exercise, care for mental health, etc.), while
stronger conflicts arise when a very sick patient desires alternative treatment and the
doctors themselves do not believe in such treatment. For instance, Debevc
recommends (76): “Everything which a doctor knows which might be harmful must
be unequivocally and decisively rejected. If the patient's dilemma is strong and the
hope for successful treatment (of cancer) is questionable to such a degree that the
patient wants to try one of the alternative methods of treatment, then the doctor should
tolerate this in order to be humane, but on condition that the patient does not relent
from, postpone or neglect his standard treatment, and that the patient does not pay too
high a price for alternative treatment with respect to his means”.
In conclusion we need to stress that Slovenia is beside Sweden, still only EU
country in which there is a risk for medical doctors of being struck off the Register of
medical doctors if practicing CAM (11). On the contrary, in almost all EU countries
medical doctors are allowed to practise any CAM method, even without any
substantial training (11). However, in Slovenia medical doctors that are benevolent to
CAM methods are expressing their attitude searching for an open dialogue about this
issue for several years now (75,77,78).
Other health professionals
The other large group of health professionals which are searching for an open
dialogue about CAM methods being group of nurses (79). Some research work on
attitude of nurses to CAM methods was done as well (80-82). The latest study results
showed that in Slovenia 89% of nurses that responded to the survey defined properly
what CAM methods are (82). Among them 45% declared that they already used CAM
methods. This percent is rather low in comparison to the attitude of nurses in other
countries, but the fact is, that a major part of herbal medicines, used in 60% of nurses,
is perceived as “traditional Slovene art of healing” rather than CAM (82). Attitude of lay people/patients
354 Although the prevailing attitude of medical doctors regarding alternative medicine is
sceptical, this does not hold for most of the inhabitants of Slovenia. This claim is
supported by some studies which will be discussed later. Users of CAM in Slovenia
There exist only scarce data on users of CAM in Slovenia what is a clear reflection of
the attitude of the state institutions towards CAM. Nevertheless, there exist some data
on this issue.
1. Reliable data on the characteristics of alternative medicine in Slovenia can be
gained from surveys in the frame of Slovene Public Opinion surveys (83, 84).
In period 1900-2004, four surveys (in 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2001
respectively) included the question about using alternative forms of
support/care for one's own health. The results are presented in Table 3.

1.8 2. In 1996 Frankic (85) discussed on the basis of a representative sample of 870
adult Slovenes, that 57.3% use alternative methods for self-medication and that
the share of women (57%) was typically greater than the share of men. Among
the products used two-fifths are medications and three-fifths are bought
products: When searching for symptoms that people most frequently treat
themselves, high temperature, coughs and Sore throats are first; second are
feeling rundown, stress, anxiety, insomnia, and tiredness; third are preventive
measures; and fourth are aches in the back, feet and rheumatism.
3. An anonymous survey on alternative medicine (86) was conducted in 1996 on
an arbitrary sample of 1650 patients registered with the general practitioners of
the Celje Health Centre. The most important results of the survey show that:
83% of those surveyed know of alternative medicine but their understanding of
this was varied (for 37% this is a method of healing which is not recognised by
official medicine, for 30% this is traditional medicine from a different cultural
area, 29% are of the opinion that this is treatment with natural healing
substances, and for 4% this is something else). 49% were in favour of the use
of alternative methods of treatment and 37% used alternative methods of
treatment. 355 When searching for influences on the use of alternative methods of
treatment it was discovered that an important role was played by sex (more
women than men), age (older more than younger), education (the educated
more than the less educated) and purpose (preventive more than curative,
especially with people who have completed higher education). Younger (up to
49 years of age) patients frequently opt for alternative methods without
consulting their doctor, while 50% of older patients consult their doctor before
commencing such treatment or during such treatment. Among those using
alternative methods, 37% received recommendations and instructions for its
use from literature, 25% from the mass media, 21% at courses and seminars
and 17% from other sources.
Alternative treatment is implemented by the patients themselves in 34%
of cases, 25% under the guidance of their doctor, 22% with other family
members and 19% with friends and colleagues. 60% of the respondents could
not say whether their chosen doctor was for or against alternative methods of
treatment, 31% were of the opinion that their doctor was in favour of using
alternative methods, while 9% responded that their doctor rejected alternative
methods. Only 5% of the 604 people surveyed who used alternative methods
were of the opinion that treatment was unsuccessful, while 49% assessed their
treatment as being successful and 46% as partly successful. Among those
surveyed who used alternative methods, 96 (16%) of them abandoned the
treatment prescribed to them by their personal physician. 32% of the users of
alternative methods of treatment are in favour of these methods being included
in a combination of voluntary and compulsory health insurance; nearly the
same share (31%) are of the opinion that alternative medicine should be
included in compulsory health insurance. For voluntary insurance in this field,
18% are in favour, 9% are for self-payment and only 10% of the users of
alternative methods could not make a decision regarding such financing
possibilities.
The results of the survey show that people know of various methods of
alternative treatment, that they are in favour of such methods of prevention and
treatment, and that they also use such methods.
We should also stress in this place, that Slovenia was the member of COST Action B4 project (39, 70), represented by a BION – Institute for Bioelectromagnetics and
New Biology (87). CAM practitioners
Institutions and societies of CAM practitioners in Slovenia
In the first place BION – Institute for Bioelectromagnetics and New Biology, should
be mentioned (87). This institute was founded in 1999. It was acknowledged as a
research organisation by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology.
In 2004 it transformed into the limited liability private company. In its first years the
aim was to investigate the, as yet not very well understood, phenomenon of the
influence of various electromagnetic fields on organisms. On the one hand, this
research area covered the influence of weak non-ionizing electromagnetic fields on
various living beings and, on the other, the still controversial question of endogenous 356 coherent electromagnetic fields in organisms and their role in the living process.
Research in such areas inevitably brought the Bion Institute close to CAM. This was
the reason that this institution obtained the status of a COST Action B-4 project
national coordinator (from 1993 to 2000).
In the second place we need to mention the Section of Natural Treatment
Therapeuts in the frame of Association of Small Business at Chamber of Commerce
and Industry of Slovenia (88). It was founded in autumn 2002 to incorporate business
and other legal subjects practising CAM in Slovenia.
Beside above mentioned institute and integration, there exist several other
integrations of CAM practitioners in Slovenia, among them being (listed by date of
foundation) (62, 89):
• Slovene Acupuncture Association in the frame of Slovenian Medical
Association (90),
• Slovene Society of Homeopathy, SHD, founded in 1991 (91);
• Association of bioenergetics of Slovenia, ZBIOS, founded in 1994 (92);
• Slovene Society for Alternative Medicine, D.A.M. founded in 1998 (93);
• Slovene Society for Complementary and Natural Healing, KONAZ, founded in
2000 (94);
There exist also special integrations, aimed at education of CAM practitioners, among
them:
• Professional organization for basic and permanent education and qualification
on the field of CAM, HIGEA, founded in 2002 (95), and
• Center for Development of Alternative Methods of Treatment, ENOST, with
its School of Integrative Biorgonomics (96);
Very interesting is an integration which could not be classified only among
CAM practitioners integrations since it is an integration of medical doctors (licensed
and those practising CAM) (75). This integration is the Initiative Committee for Open
Dialogue of Medical Doctors on Integrative Medicine INTA, founded in 2002, and it
is aimed at establishing open dialogue between conventional medicine and CAM. Number of practitioners and their registration
Owing to the recent legal vacuum in our country, the real number of healers in
Slovenia is unknown, as are the types of “health” activities they practise. But as cited
by Cerar (89), according to KONAZ estimation, there are about 1500 of them. As
cited by Cerar, according to Verdel (89), between 200-300 out of them are qualified,
all others are probably seeking good earnings in this CAM chaos in Slovenia, on
account of desperate, uninformed and helpless lay population.
Some kind of insight in structure of CAM supply in Slovenia give the results
of survey on state of affairs in the field of CAM, which was sponsored by the Section
of Natural Treatment Therapeuts in the frame of Association of Small Business at
Business Chamber of Slovenia. The methodology was as follows (89, 97):
• time frame: autumn/winter 2005/2006;
• target population: healers (CAM practitioners) in Slovenia (about 1500);
• respondents: 118
The results of this survey are as follows (97): 357 1. Business status of CAM practitioners.
The results showed that 29% CAM practitioners were practising CAM
methods as self-dependent entrepreneurs, 15% as legal subjects, 49% as
amateurs, and 7% something else or without answer.
2. CAM methods.
The respondents reported practice of following methods/systems according to
NCCAM classification of CAM methods:
• mind-body interaction methods and energy medicine practices: in total
58%; by method within this group following well known methods:
bioenergotechnology 26%, Reiki 20%, radiesthetics 14%,
psychotherapy 9%, meditation 6%, yoga 4%, regression 3%, hypnosis
3%. In this group also counselling for better quality of life is classified
in this survey, with 7% of responders claimed to practise;
• biologically based practices: in total 15%; by method within this group
following well known methods: diets 33%, herbalism 14%,
bathotherapy 9%, fasting 9%, aromatherapy 6%, Bach flower therapy
6%;
• manipulative and body based practices: in total 21%; by method within
this group following well known methods: massage therapy 28%,
Shiatsu 10%, acupressure 8%, osteophaty 6%, reflexotherapy 6%,
physiotherapy 6%, chiropractice 4%, lymph dreinage 2%;
• CAM systems: in total 6%; by system within this group following well
known systems: homeopathy 54%, ayurveda 33%, and traditional
Chinese medicine 13%.
The limitation of this study is clear – owing to unregulated CAM sphere in the time of
survey, it was not possible to establish actual study population and consecutively the
results are hardly representative. Nevertheless, they give first insight in this problem
grounded on the scientific methods. On future perspectives of CAM in Slovenia
From the public health perspective, we welcome, that our country finally adopted
clearer stand towards CAM, but certainly this is rather a beginning than the end of a
legal CAM story in Slovenia. Due to the undesirable and sometimes even dangerous
phenomena associated with CAM, and due to relatively stable use of these methods
(Table 2), it is strongly needed to regulate this field much clearer as it is today. Also,
CAM is a phenomenon which has to be seriously monitored in a representative
manner, on general and in details, and analysed, and influenced through the prism of
both, the biomedical and bio-eco-psycho-social theoretical model, in order to be able
to recognise both the negative and protective risk factors involved in its practice. This
are the reasons that in the near future very important organizational as well as
conceptual steps need to be done, comprising many compromises and understanding
among actors. Among the reasons that all this need to be done as soon as possible is
the standpoint of the WHO (8), which supports and encourages member states to form
their own health policies.
Among organizational in the first place, those steps, which the Alternative
Medicine Act lays on responsible people, are to be done: 358 • to found the Healers Chamber and the Register of healers,
• to establish a system for recognition and acknowledgement of healing systems
and healing methods, as well as
• to issue licences for practising CAM, and
• to establish competent bodies to control the market of healers in Slovenia.
We believe that these steps will be realized in the near future. When these steps will
be accomplished it will be possible to evaluate CAM in Slovenia properly, from more
comprehensive and evidence based point of view.
Conceptual compromises will be much harder to attain, and we are well aware
that it will take a lot of time to put the CAM field and it’s dynamic somehow in order.
But all actors should become aware that it is the user of one or another health care
practice who is the most important, and for the lay people's good, in the triangle lay
people – medical doctor – CAM practitioner a communication should be established.
Conventional medicine is responsible for evidence based approach to health problems
(including diagnosis and treatment of diseases), but could be in certain situations
complemented by other safe and from lay people appreciated approaches. In this
frame, public health is among others responsible for clear and understandable
terminology. A priori opposition in intolerance to unconventional methods by
conventional medicine causes more medical damage and social pathology than if it
were offered on an opened scientific basis. Opinion and behaviour change is possible
only in the long term via broadly founded health promotion programmes based on a
science which not only takes into account biology but also the social, economic and
cultural characteristics of populations.
Now, when CAM in Slovenia is regulated, we sincerely hope that our country
will proceed: alternative methods have to be studied, clarified and joined with the
measures of modern medicine, when it is not harmful and where there is evidence that
healing contributed to the improved feeling and satisfaction of people.
In health promotion and disease prevention, especially in the frame of primary
health care, certain already proven CAM methods could be very beneficent, and
effective in reducing burden of certain major public health problems. In Slovenia, for
example certain body-mind techniques like psychotherapy as an intervention tool for
primary prevention could be perspective in reducing mental disorders burden of the
population. Howsoever, we could understand that also the International Classification
of Primary Care (ICPC) used in primary health care since 1987 (98), is recognizing
the long-standing observation that patients’ problems, concerns, complaints,
symptoms, and other conditions a wide variety of social and psychosocial states that
are not strictly biomedical.
There is another problem which is certainly not present only in Slovenia.
Speaking for developed countries, the demand for health care has changed
dramatically over the last 40 years due to changes in demographic structure,
increasing of real incomes, improvements in medical technology, and globalization of
the world as the main reasons. This is understandable since everybody wants to be
healthy. Yet conventional medicine health care systems seem to be in almost
permanent crisis and different kinds of waiting lists are longer and longer. We are
facing the infinite nature of human wants and the finite nature of resources available
to produce health in these systems. One way in which the problem of scarcity can be
overcome is to let people buy the health care they want at the free market. This 359 approach on the first sight seems to be like »a magic stick« - all treatments could be
available if you want to buy them and have the money to pay for them. This could and
it is the case for example in cosmetic surgery. But, what would happen if all health
care were bought and sold in the free market? The common sense tells us that there
would be an enormous inequity between people in attaining health care. Thus, from
the public health perspective, health and health care are special goods, as well as they
are goods of especial importance for every country, since good health of the
population is its biggest capital, and cannot be treated like other goods. Health and
health care cannot be sold and bought like other goods and services on a free market.
But where is CAM in Slovenia in this story? The health care system of Slovenia is
facing similar situation as the other systems in developed countries. There is a
shortage of health care system resources of all kind. People are not treated as they
expect to be treated, and here CAM is coming in the position. But, since CAM is
constantly rejected by official medicine, it is not treated as being a health care service.
CAM response is anticipated, and the direction towards CAM being a »perspective
business branch« could be traced (99). This is certainly an extra alarm for public
health in Slovenia that CAM must come on the top of the agenda. Yes, it is »a
business« but this business should be strictly regulated and inspected since it is
dealing with a health of a population, and there need to be a dialogue between
conventional medicine and CAM practitioners.
In conclusion, we would like to refer to a remark written just above, being that
in shortage of health care system resources, people try to find the best solution for
them in searching to fulfill their health needs. This population potential should be, on
the basis of integration of old and new cognitions, transformed to a process of health
promotion, which has by its activities big potential to suppress harmful and dangerous
types of CAM. As stated by Eckenfels (100), building on classic conceptual schemes
in social medicine in conjunction with the health care ecology model, effective and
efficient health promotion programmes in the context of “health for all” concept,
health for all population structures on all levels could be prepared. In context of this
concept especially striving for comprehensive primary health care is important.
Active participation of people in comprehensive primary care will be the guarantor
that they will take over responsibility, care and behaviours for their health, which
corresponds with their specific health needs, and on scientifically recognized
cognitions. In the process of re-orientation to comprehensive primary care, big
political and managerial engagement is required in all sectors, and on all levels of
societal organization. In another words, we need healthy public policy (101). Without
changes in this direction, unplanned and partial bumping into CAM is like struggling
against windmills. EXERCISES
Task 1
Carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module. If necessary, read
recommended readings as well. Critically discuss with your colleagues:
• the terminology in CAM field, and
• characteristics of CAM. 360 Task 2
From domestic (e.g. Biomedicina Slovenica, and COBISS-Cooperative Online
Bibliographic System of Slovenia in Slovenia), and/or international bibliographic
data-bases (e.g. Medline, PubMed) find out if anything is published from the field of
CAM in your country. If yes, then try to find out its characteristics and how CAM is
treated in your country (e.g. what kind of health care system do you have in relation
to CAM, the attitude of conventional medicine doctors to the CAM, etc.). Task 3
If not, try to find an example from other countries in Europe (except for the UK). Task 4
Critically discuss with your colleagues how different European countries treat CAM. REFERENCES

Alternative medicine, holographic paradigm
After completing this module students and public health
professionals should have accepted pluralism in health care
approaches.
Alternative medicine is becoming the important factor in health
care in most countries of developed world. Generally, that
development was enabled by spreading of postmodern
comprehension within the Western Weltanschauung. Postmodern
comprehension both, enabled deconstruction of dominant health
paradigm, and stimulated acceptance of pluralistic attitudes in
matters of health care. So, alternative medicine is travelling now
on a rather fast track through medical institutions and even
through most solemn medical campuses of developed world. Of
course, there is no doubt who is holding the reins there. So, in
order to cut through power plays of powers that be it is crucial to
be aware of distinctions between alternative and official medicine.
The differentia specifica of alternative medicine could be
understood by dropping out of Cartesian paradigm and by turning
to the basic postulates of holographic paradigm.
After introductory lectures students will participate in discussion.
It might be helpful to put an emphasis on personal experiences
and/or personal engagement of students.
It might be advisable to stick to the concept of
integrative/integrated medicine (Rees L., Weil A., Integrated
medicine, British Medical Journal, 2001; 322: 119-120 (20
January)

TRANSITION
Vuk Stambolović THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Alternative medicine is the common name for an array of therapeutic systems and
technologies that have originated from the tradition of vitalism, i.e., from the tradition
based on the assumption that the man, nature and the Universe are all permeated with
the life force - vis vitalis1.
Due to that origin, in the countries of the First world, during the former
millennial transition (between XIX and XX century), alternative medical systems and
technologies were pushed into the background (1). The mechanistic medicine took
over and, established as a science, practiced monopolistic control for almost one
century.
However, the ongoing millennial transition brought a significant change in the
status of alternative medicine. Alternative medicine (sometimes under the name
complementary medicine) started to acquire a significant role in developed countries,
especially in Western Europe and in Northern America, where until recently it was
not only marginalized but ostracized as well.
Regarding that “surge” of alternative medicine within the developed world
indicative is the example of United Kingdom. In 1986, British Medical Association
published the report in which alternative medicine was discarded as something that
was “not in accordance with natural laws” (2). Seven years later though, in the new
report, British Medical Association informs that more and more physicians are
looking for the information about “nonconventional” therapies and recommends both
teaching of “nonconventional” therapies at medical school, and establishment of
postgraduate programs in order to inform physicians with techniques used by
alternative practitioners and with possible benefits for patients (3).
One of the reasons for this turn-about was probably the decision of the
Department of Health that, in 1991, acknowledged consumer demand for National
Health Service access to alternative medicine and gave the go-ahead for family
doctors to employ alternative practitioners as ancillary staff. At that time quite a few
general practitioners were already funding alternative treatments through their health
promotion clinics and, according to one survey, 25% of general practitioners
expressed their wish to provide alternative medicine through their practice (4). More
recent surveys suggest as many as 60% of general practitioners either practice
1 Vis vitalis is known in many cultures. In China and Japan, it is known as chi, in
Tibet as srog-dzin, in India as prana, in old Iran as ga-llama, among Dakota Indians
as wakam, among Sioux as oren. Alchemists called it vital fluid and Paracelsus munia. Stambolović V., Medicina - nadležnost i alternative (Medicine Responsibility and Alternatives), Prosveta, Beograd, 1986. 369 alternative therapies themselves, employ nurses who provide them or delegate
treatment to alternative therapists working in the practice elsewhere (5). According to
the more recent study of primary care workers (general practitioners, nurses and other
primary care team members), 83% respondents had previously referred (or influenced
referral) for CAM treatments, the main reasons cited were: patients request (68%),
and conventional treatments failed (58%) (6).
The number of alternative therapists in UK is also growing rapidly, from 1981
to 1997 the number of registered practitioners trebled from about 13.500 to about
40.000. New data indicate that this number amounts to 90.000 (7). And a BBC poll of
1200 people in August 1999 estimated that 20% of the public are using alternative
therapies each year which contrasts with a figure of 11% in a similar survey six years
earlier (8). In addition, it was estimated that 46% of the UK population can be
expected to use one or more CAM therapies in their lifetime (9).
In other Western European countries 10 to 25% of the adult population report
using one or another form of alternative health care during the year (10), and
regarding surveys of the use in general, i.e. some time or other during the course of
several years, percent of use reaches 70% (in Germany) (11).
In Israel, in 2000, in a survey of adult population, 10.2% stated that they had
used the service of an alternative health care provider (12). In Australia, the
government estimates are that each year 57% of Australians use alternative medicine
(13) (Editorial, 1999). In 1999, 24% Canadians reported consulting one or more
alternative health practitioner in the past six months (14).
In USA, the use of alternatives to official medicine has steadily increased over
the past decade with reported use from 34% in 1990 (15), to 42% in 1997. (16).
Regarding position of alternative medicine, a turn-about similar to one in United
Kingdom happened as well. Namely, in 1993, American Medical Association
guidebook for consumers called alternative methods “unproven, disproven,
controversial, fraudulent, quack and/or otherwise questionable approaches to solving
health problems” (17). Also, as recently as in 1998, The New England Journal of
Medicine published a number of articles, case reports and letters about specific
alternative treatments. All were found useless and/or harmful. The editors defined
alternative medicine as medicine “that has not been scientifically tested and (whose)
advocates largely deny the need for such testing” (18). However, in 1995, American
Medical Association stopped to refer to alternative medicine as “quackery” and has an
official position calling its members to learn more about it (19). In addition, in 1997,
the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association ranked alternative
medicine as the third most important topic out of 86 for the Journal to cover. Their
readership survey found alternative medicine ranked seventh most important on a list
of 73 topics the journal should be addressing (20). According to the recent California
study, sixty-one percent of physicians do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable about
CAM safety or efficacy, and 81% would like to receive more education on CAM
modalities (21).
Along with these data regarding use of alternative medicine, the most
significant indicator of its growing acceptance is its transformation from a marginal
entrepreneurial activity into a part of the corporate economy. Simply stated,
alternative medicine is becoming big business. In United Kingdom, for example, the
figure for private spending on alternative therapies is in the region of a billion pounds,
compared with the overall National Health System expenditure of 40 billion pounds 370 (22). In Australia, in 1996, the total expenditure on alternative therapies or remedies
by private individuals was over a billion Australian dollars (23). In 2000, the
expenditure on alternative therapies rose to 2.3 billion (24). In Canada, it is estimated
that in 1996/97 a total of $3.8 billion was spent on complementary and alternative
health care: $1.8 billion on alternative therapies, $937 million on herbs and vitamins,
$104 million on special diet programs, and more than $998 million on books (14). In
USA, the total expenditure on alternative therapies or remedies by private individuals
doubled between 1990 and 1997 from 14 to 28 billion dollars (16).
Market has become so large that both, major drug companies and media
conglomerates found that alternative medicine is a highly sought after and profitable
commodity. That example of the alternative medicine’s acceptability to corporate
world is both, a reflection of its acceptance in the larger community and a harbinger
of still-greater acceptance to come as the forces of corporate advertising, marketing
and distribution are brought into play.
Why?
In the developed countries during millennial transition the alternative medicine has
begun to take on the quality of a distinct entity with its own institutions and
recognized by governments, media and the public (25).
There were several reasons for this public, political and economic acceptance.
The first reason was the simultaneous existence of high prevalence of chronic
diseases on one side, and an obsessive preoccupation with health on the other side,
leading to the paradox of a healthy but sicker society. That paradox leads to the everhigher expectations of health care and to the development of the awareness that
spectacular high-tech rescue is not enough (26).
Along with that, the transition from industrial to post-industrial society, with
the shift from manufacturing to service industries, offered those in advantaged
positions greater opportunities to build rewarding employment and careers, and to
develop lifestyles which promote health (27). So, a specific population developed:
highly educated, identifying with the values of feminism, environmentalism, holistic
philosophy and spiritual or personal growth, and with increased interest in lifestyle
change. They were the first to embrace alternative medicine, i.e. its offers of health
promotion and low-technology treatments (28).
The second large group of faithful alternative medicine users was coming from
three specific patient groups. In the first were patients with long-time treated chronic
conditions. In the second were patients with aversion to the reliance of conventional
medicine on highly invasive or high risk treatments. And in the third one were
patients with mild to moderate, long term, functional and stress related,
undifferentiated conditions (29,30,31,32,33).
The number of users further increased due to the belief of alternative medicine
users that alternative medicine is more efficient then conventional one (30,34).
Further interest for alternative therapies was raised by patients who were
satisfied with provider conduct, i.e. with alternative therapist/patient relations,
characterized by more holistic, open and partnership based approach, comparing to
the communication difficulties and perceived lack of concern for their well-being
perceived in relations with practitioners of official medicine (35,36,37). 371 The popularity of alternative medicine has been attributed to consumerism, as
well (38). It seemed that people extrapolated to medicine a “pick and mix” approach
and felt free to use the ideas and treatments they found relevant to their own particular
needs.
Due to several reasons alternative medicine was increasingly accepted by
physicians and other practitioners of official medicine. At first their patients were
asking for alternatives. A major factor was also a shared dissatisfaction with
consumers about the biomedical model and mainstream health care system. Some
practitioners were looking for modalities that might help when they did not see their
patients getting better with official approaches. Some were interested in continuing
education and some in economic opportunity and a lucrative market (39).
In the time of rationing of health care the important reason for increased
acceptance of alternative medicine was possibility to use alternative therapies to
reduce costs. In the Glastonbury study between 1994 and 1997 around 600 patients
were referred to specially establish alternative medicine service. Following their
initial alternative medical treatment there was, for most, a marked reduction in the use
of other health services for the problem referred, the largest reduction occurring in
those who had been the heaviest users of other services prior to referral. Visits to
general practitioners dropped by around a third. The reduction in the number of
prescriptions was even more marked, and again it was the high-user group that the
largest reduction took place. A similar reduction was seen in the numbers of further
referrals, tests and other treatments required for the group for the condition referred.
Analysis also revealed that 85% of patients have reported some or much improvement
in their condition after treatment (22). Similar results were reported when alternative
medicine was included in treatment of separate nosological entities like
cardiovascular diseases (40), lower back pain (41), pain relief (42) and rheumatoid
arthritis (43).
The position of alternative medicine was further promoted by its
institutionalization, i e. by development of the same kind of institutions that were
developed by conventional medicine. International peer-reviewed specialist journals
in alternative medicine are emerging, studies of alternative medical practice already
appear in established conventional publications, quite a few universities have
developed degree programs in alternative therapies while quite a few of medical
schools have begun to include material dealing with these approaches in the
undergraduate curriculum (in United Kingdom, for example, in 1997, more then 40%
medical schools were offering courses on alternative medicine as part of the
curriculum) (8).
Of course, alternative medicine would never have this kind of acceptance
without “informational highway”. The Internet and the World Wide Web have
become important sources for information about alternative medicine, with sites
providing abundant information and hundreds of relevant links.
What?
During many years of confrontation between alternative and official medicine, a
relational identity was permanently imposed on alternative medicine. Namely, the
permanent condition was to define alternative medicine by measures regulations, and
patterns of official medicine. 372 At first, that relational identity was promoted by alternative practitioners
themselves (supported sometimes by friendly official therapists), out of wish to secure
legitimacy to their therapeutic engagement.
Later, relational identity was being permanently imposed by physicians and
medical officials who were treating alternative medicine from the position of power
and control.
Both of these orientations were, in fact, putting alternative medicine on the
Procrustean bed. Namely, the result of both orientations (of aspiration to become
accepted and of practicing of power), was either mutilation of alternative medicine, or
construction of nonexistent extrapolations. Alternative medicine just could not be
decoded in that way because of its immersion into a different narrative, narrative
emanating from holographic paradigm2.
Holographic paradigm could be defined by four postulates (44). According to
the first postulate, there is no entity that could be defined as pure matter, or pure
energy. “Every aspect of the Universe exists as a kind of vibrational expression”. By
that postulate, the Cartesian split into material and non-material is overcome. All
aspects of universe are characterized as “interference patterns” whose identity, nature,
style or consistency depend on “external” and “internal” context. According to the
second postulate, “every aspect of the Universe is itself a whole, a comprehensive
system containing within it a complete store of information about itself”. As this
information must not necessarily be coded in a specialized system like central nervous
system, by that postulate the split into living and non-living is transcended. It is
actually implied that every aspect of the Universe is in some fundamental way alive
because, besides vibrational expressing, it contains some kind of knowledge about
itself. According to the third postulate, “every aspect of the Universe seems to be part
2 The concept of paradigm was introduced by Thomas Kuhn. Kuhn defined paradigm as
“constellation of beliefs, values, techniques and so on, shared by the members of a given
community”. As an expression of the specific Weltanschauung paradigm plays an important
normative function. So much so that it governs its followers. Namely, paradigm is supplying
the conceptual “box” which is restricting all followers. Scientists working within the frame of
a certain paradigm behave like they have been programmed. Paradigm provides them the
criterion for selecting the problems to be solved, it provides an assurance that those problems
have the solution, it sets out the rules by which those solutions are to be sought, and often it
provides a prediction of what those solutions will be. Phenomena that will not fit the conceptual
“box” are often not seen at all. That is why, normally, “scientists do not aim to invent new
theories and tend to be intolerant of those invented by others. Instead, normal scientific
research is directed to the articulation of those phenomena and theories that the paradigm
already supplies.” It could be concluded that proponents of competing paradigms practice their
trades in different worlds. They see different things when they look from the same point in the
same direction. Of course, they are looking at the same world and what they look at has not
changed. But, in some areas, they see different things, and they see them in a different relations
one to the other. That is why “when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them”.
See: Kuhn TS. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Second Edition, Enlarged, International
Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Vol I and II, Foundations of Unity of Science, Vol II No 2,
The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1970. 373 of some larger whole, some more comprehensive system” and each of these larger
wholes is “an expression of the dynamic of its parts”. As various systems, or
entities, are intertwined through their common subsystems, this postulate indicates the
indivisible wholeness of the Universe. The second important implication is that each
constitutive element, even the smallest one, participates in expressing of larger
systems of whish it is a part.
According to the fourth postulate, “since each aspect of the Universe expresses
itself vibrationally, and all vibrational expressions intermingle, every aspect of the
Universe contains knowledge about the whole(s) within which it exists and about
every other (belonging) aspect”. And that means that each aspect of the Universe
carries the seal of its context, i.e., some basic knowledge about its “outer” world.
Holographic paradigm and alternative medicine open a possibility of a new
health narrative. Namely, Modern narrative is less and less seen as The Final Truth, in
medicine as well. Moreover, various deconstructive tendencies are taking place of, up
to recently, domineering technological optimism. These tendencies have brought with
the new concepts and even the new institutional culture leading toward significant
role change of both patients and physicians. Physicians are being deprofessionalized,
and instead of former patients, subordinate, compliant, passive, respectful and in awe
of physician - (co)creators of personal health are emerging.
At this stage of transition, of course, it is not easy to speak about the new
medical narrative. Still, there are patterns that are emerging (45).
The first one is wholeness. It appears that human being, as active and turbulent
aggregation of vibrational probabilities is indivisible, that human suffering can not be
understood by analysis of isolated organs and symptoms, that the full meaning of
local disturbances could become comprehensible only through their inclusion in
wholes of which they are a part.
The second pattern is individualized approach. Namely, transformations of
human vibrational expressions can not fit into the nosological compartments. Neither
could they be successfully confronted by a standardized treatment. The principle of
wholeness is directing towards principle of idiography. Treatment develops into
some kind of relational art.
The third emerging pattern is self-acting. Namely, the belief in technology is replaced
by the belief in human being, i.e. the belief in human self healing capacities. In that
way, the goal of therapy seizes to be imposing one’s rule over human being. The main
therapeutic function becomes stimulation and support of the inherent abilities of the
patient as the (co)creator of health.
The fourth emerging pattern is connectedness with physical, cultural and social
environment. Namely, the principle of self-acting does not imply isolation. Although
independent, human being is not self-sufficient. Being inseparable part of its
environment, human being is incomplete. That is why there is no healing of human
being without healing of his/her physical, cultural and social environment.
The fifth emerging pattern is personalized relationship. And for developing of
that kind of relationship both, deepening of relation between (co)creators of his/her
own health and his/her supporter, and the creation of intersubjective space by them
are indispensable. That is important for better understanding of human suffering. That
is also important in order to evade now frequent situation in which health provider
produces disease by his/her professional attitude. 374 The sixth emerging pattern is non-aggressiveness. The point is that the
dominant therapeutic mind is obsessed with control. It has vertical penetrability
tending to grab and destroy symptoms. The principle of support is horizontal; it
is aiming for the human being as a whole. It is pro-, not anti-biotic. It is acting in
accordance with the “wisdom of the body”, so it builds, restructures, helps
overcoming and integration.
And the seventh emerging pattern is principle of accessible knowledge. That
principle primarily means the development of the knowledge of support instead of the
knowledge of power. Namely, instead of knowledge seized by specialized
professional elites, and confined to closed institutional orbits, principle of accessible
knowledge is opening possibility for knowledge enabling self-help and mutual help.
That principle also leads toward further deprofessionalization of therapeutic activity,
transforming it into a simple and sometimes spontaneous human behaviour.
All seven patterns are operational within alternative medicine. That does not
mean that alternative medicine must be the basis of the new medical narrative. It
means only that it is up to each of us to decide what each of us is going to support.
Because, according to the holographic paradigm, “each system (on all levels
and sublevels) is an expression of the dynamic of its parts” (44).
And that means that every one of us is making a difference. REFERENCES

After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
•
Increase their knowledge related to the concept of Disease
management programmes (DMPs);
•
Know some examples of different DMPs;
•
Recognize the basic principles in the implementation of a DMP;
•
Understand the basic features of a DMP; and
•
Identify different approaches and technologies in DMP
implementation.
At present almost all health care systems are concerned mainly with
ensuring equity, access, high quality and efficiency of health care. A
very important aspect of quality, especially in public health, is its
relation to scientific knowledge about effective interventions. The
concept of Disease management programmes (DMPs) has been
introduced to implement evidence-based clinical practice through
guidelines, care protocols etc, to improve coordination among
healthcare providers and assure continuity and comprehensiveness of
care. DMPs organize health care in multidisciplinary, multicomponent,
proactive approach focusing on the whole course of a disease, using
evidence-based standards of care. There is no single definition of a
Disease management programme, because of their diversity and
heterogeneity. They are characterized by three main features: a
knowledge base, a delivery system with coordinated care components,
and a continuous improvement process. The basic advantages and
uncertainties about DMPs are discussed in the module, as well as the
ways and results of their implementation. A case study is presented,
discussing a proposed model for Cardiovascular disease management
programme in Bulgaria.

OF CVD MANAGEMENT IN BULGARIA
Mariana Dyakova, Emilia Karaslavova, Dobriana Sidjimova THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Disease Management Programs (DMPs)
In the last decade health care systems across the world are concerned mainly with few
questions: continuity of care, especially for chronic diseases; avoidance of medical
errors and patient safety; effective and efficient delivery of health services; and
avoiding excessive variations in practice (1). Most of the countries in the World
Health Organization European Region have implemented national strategies for
quality assurance, such as accreditation systems, hospital quality management or
external assessments such as league tables or audits (2,3). A very important aspect of
quality, especially in public health, is its relation to scientific knowledge about
effective interventions. High quality care can be achieved only when interventions
that work are applied to the right patients at the right time (4). Improving quality of
medical care and health services is thus a matter of defining and promoting best
clinical practice, translating evidence from research into practical work, namely
developing evidence-based guidelines, or recommendations, and performing health
technology assessment. Quality of health care delivery is not, however, only a matter
of evidence-based practice. Organizational and structural aspects of the health system
and delivery also have important implications. A lack of continuity of care may delay
appropriate measures, duplicate services, and lead to uncoordinated interventions (5).
The concept of Disease management programs (DMPs) has been introduced to
implement evidence-based clinical practice through guidelines, care protocols, and
formulary lists, improve coordination among healthcare providers and assure
continuity and comprehensiveness of care (6). DMPs organize health care in
multidisciplinary, multicomponent programs, in a proactive approach focusing on the
whole course of a disease, using evidence-based standards of care (5). There is no
single definition of a disease management programme, however, it is characterized by
three main features: a knowledge base, a delivery system with coordinated care
components, and a continuous improvement process (7).
The key elements of disease management are (6):
− Comprehensive care: multiprofessional, multidisciplinary, combining acute
and long-term care, disease prevention and health promotion;
− Integrated care – “continuum of care”, coordination of the different
components of the health services delivery;
− Population orientation - defined by a specific condition;
− Active client-patient management tools - health education, empowerment, selfcare;
− Evidence-based guidelines, protocols, care pathways / DRGs;
− Information technology & system solutions;
− Continuous quality improvement. 380 DMP represents a total management of disease and health services, as a
method for development of active consensus in the State, mobilizing different
stakeholders and responsible institutions in order to fulfil the health priorities set. It is
not a legal act or administrative document, but rather a comprehensive National
Strategy, requiring professionalism, systematic and integral approach, characterized
by (8):
− Solidarity and justice in the health system;
− Universal access to medical services;
− High quality and continuity of health care;
− Effectiveness and efficiency of health services;
− Horizontal and vertical management of the planned interventions;
− Decentralization and multi-sectoral partnership.
Following these basic principles of the New Public Health (9) is a
governmental responsibility on the way to reach the final goal and priority of any
health system – promotion and protection of population health and strengthening the
human capital of the country.
In this context, the management of any disease is realized through coordinated
and integrated care, focused on the entire pre-clinical and clinical development of the
disease: early diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation, as well as towards health
promotion and disease prevention through reduction of risk factors levels in the living
environment, introduction of healthy behaviours and lifestyle, and increasing the
quality and effectiveness of medical services.
The DMP is a broad term, comprising of various methods, forms of
interventions, organizational approaches and technologies. They are very
heterogeneous, consisting of diverse, sometimes unique components, developed for
specific demographic, health, social, economic, political, or cultural settings.
Considering this, it is completely impossible to create a unified model of a DMP or to
translate it to another national context. The basis for the development of a nationally
specific and effective DMP is the correlation “population necessities – available
resources”. This is a difficult and responsible analysis, requiring a multidisciplinary
team, which should consider (8):
− The health needs and necessities of certain (entire / target) population and the
society;
− The specific methodology of programme development (goal, stages, control
etc);
− The provision of recourses for the programme – mainly financial, human,
information;
− The effective management of the resources;
− The coordination of all participants in the programme – individuals and
institutions;
− The monitoring, control and evaluation of the DMP; and
− The capacity for sustainability and improvement of the programme for a longterm period.
Critical factors in the design of a successful DMP (5):
− suitable target condition (target population);
− evidence base (relevant scientific research); 381 −
−
−
−
− consideration of barriers to implementation;
strategies to change attitudes of stakeholders;
balance of economic and quality of care goals;
strategies for continuous quality improvement; and
strategies for evaluation of cost-effectiveness. Implementation of DMPs for total management of chronic
diseases
Chronic diseases and especially cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for most of
the burden of disease in the European Region (10). Recent evidence shows that there
is a strong need to improve the quality of care for people with chronic diseases.
Although a number of effective interventions for management of various chronic
conditions are promoted by the international health organization, there are still wide
variations in the delivery of care and clinical practice. DMPs are one of the measures
intended to address this situation. Most of the evaluated DMPs for chronic conditions
have been shown to improve the management and control of the disease, namely
diabetes, depression, chronic heart failure and cardiovascular diseases (5). The
evidence from the implemented till now DMPs in different countries and settings can
be summarized in the following conclusions (11):
− DMPs seem to be suitable for conditions for which there are wide practice
variations and poor outcomes, due to problems in continuity of care and
finding evidence of interventions’ effectiveness;
− DMPs reach a better control of the underlying condition, mostly for CVD,
shown by reducing the risk of hospitalization among heart disease patients;
− Improved rates of medical performance suggest that DMPs succeed in shifting
care from a reactive approach (reacting to manifest complications) to a
proactive one (anticipating potential complications);
− DMPs enhance the adherence of providers to evidence-based standards, as well
as enhance continuity of care and improve patients’ knowledge of their
condition/illness;
− In defining the goal(s) of a DMP it is important to achieve a balance between
quality of care, satisfaction of providers and patients, and cost;
− Disease management requires behavioural changes in both providers and
patients;
− A system of performance and outcomes indicators is considered an essential
component of a DMP to ensure its continuous quality improvement;
− The disease management approach needs to have a long-term perspective;
− No evidence is available for any recommendation about the ideal mix of
interventions;
− No evidence is available about which components of a DMP are most
important for improving quality of care;
− There is no evidence of a direct link between DMPs and significant reduction
in mortality or of improvement in quality of life;
− There is no evidence available about long-term health outcomes;
− There is no evidence on cost-effectiveness of DMPs. 382 However, the absence of evidence does not mean absence of the effect; it
means it has not been studied. The strong focus on a particular disease, risk factor or
symptom has also been claimed to be one of the possible negative effects of DMPs,
however there is no evidence for this. The long-term impact of DMPs on health and
health care systems still needs to be evaluated. The impact of DMPs on patients’ and
providers’ satisfaction also remains to be assessed (5). Cost and cost-effectiveness of DMPs for chronic conditions
When DMPs were introduced for the first time in the United States, their primary goal
was to achieve cost savings (12). The implementation of DMPs requires substantial
investments. The cost of developing and establishing a program, including training
and information technologies (especially hardware and software), needs to be
considered in evaluations of disease management (6). The available evidence about
reduced episodes of hospitalization and reduced rates of complications from chronic
disease have been claimed to be potentially cost-saving. However, there is not enough
evidence to conclude that DMPs are more cost-effective than standard care. Another
important gap relates to the ideal allocation of resources to the different components
of a programme. Therefore it is important to study extensively the cost-effectiveness
of any specific DMP and its components before it is introduced on a large-scale. Potential ethical considerations
Concerns have been raised about the ethical and social implications of DMPs (6).
Patient autonomy might be threatened by the reduction of freedom of choice resulting
from standardization. It is also necessary to identify who should play the coordinating
role in a DMP, and what implications this may have for the responsibilities of others
(6). Many DMPs have been developed with the assistance of commercial interests,
notably the pharmaceutical industry. Concerns have been expressed about potential
conflicts of interest in the health care system (13,14). Conclusions (5)
The organization of care in multidisciplinary, multicomponent programmes, with a
proactive approach focusing on the whole course of a chronic disease, applying the
ideas of evidence-based medicine for the formulation of standards of care, can be
considered the core of DMPs.
The heterogeneity of DMPs and their dependence on context, complicate the
transferability of findings to other settings other than those of their evaluation. There
is no single DM model to be applied everywhere. It is not possible to identify an ideal
mix of components for a DMP to be effective.
DMPs improve the quality of care of people with chronic diseases, as
measured by performance indicators. However, there is no evidence available on
DMPs’ impact on survival, quality of life or on their relative cost-effectiveness.
There is a need to evaluate the economic, social and ethical implications of
disease management programmes. 383 Examples of ongoing DMPs in Europe
Maastricht Project (15): In January 2000 a DMP for patients with diabetes was
implemented in the Maastricht region in The Netherlands. The explicit aim is to
improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes. The programme’s elements are:
a core team of general practitioners, nurse specialists and endocrinologists;
cooperation with other caregivers (e.g. ophthalmologists, dieticians); protocols stating
routes of care, responsibilities and tasks; provision of care according to clinical
practice guidelines; and systematic collection of data about patient contacts in order to
monitor each patient and assess practice variations among providers.
National Service Frameworks in the United Kingdom (16): the 1997
Government White Paper set out the plan for the modernization of the British NHS.
As a result, National Service Frameworks (NSFs) have been established by the NHS
to enhance the quality and efficiency of the system. Strictly speaking, the NSFs are
not DMPs; however, they represent a systematic effort to improve care for particular
conditions or groups of patients, and share some elements of disease management.
They approach the whole course of a condition and the state’s comprehensive
strategies to organize care with the aim of improving outcomes. The NSFs set
national evidence-based standards of care, including organizational interventions,
formulate service delivery strategies and establish performance measures to evaluate
progress.
German Disease Management Programmes (5): the health care reform act
from 2001 provided the basis for the implementation of DMPs in Germany. The
programmes are offered by the health funds must be accredited by the Federal
Insurance Office, a governmental agency charged with the supervision of social
insurances. Implementation of DMPs is linked to financial incentives for the health
funds, as enrolled patients are calculated separately in the inter-sickness fund risk
compensation mechanism. Evidence-based minimum standards and criteria for
enrolment are proposed by the Coordinating Committee (a self-governing body
including sickness funds and providers representatives) and subsequently passed by
the Ministry of Health and Social Security. CASE STUDY
Cardiovascular disease management programme – the case of
Bulgaria
Introduction and background
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality – present situation and trends
Bulgaria takes one of the leading positions in total and CVD mortality in the
European Region and the negative tendencies are continuing in the last 15 years.
Cardiovascular diseases are causing 971.0 per 100000 deaths for 2007 or more than
66% of the total mortality (17). The CVD indicators, as hospital discharges of
ischemic heart disease per 100000 – 857.48 for 2006 and of cerebrovascular diseases
per 100000 – 617.94 for 2006 are also disturbing (18). The results from the largest
national epidemiological studies, conducted in the last 20 years “Sofia Heart Study
1994 - 1999”, “Bulgaria Heart Study 1998” as well as the results from the CINDI
programme show evidence of higher levels of preventable risk factors and higher
individual and population absolute risk, compared to other European countries (19). 384 These negative trends are considered mostly a result from recently developed
unhealthy lifestyles and behaviours, related to the transition period, but also from the
continuing and unsuccessful health care reform (started in 2000), leading to
insufficient disease prevention, late diagnoses, ineffective treatment, low compliance
of physicians to international guidelines and of patients to recommended therapy and
lifestyle changes (20). At the same time, hospital mortality from Acute Myocardial
Infarction is close and even lower than some European hospitals, which indicates that
the qualification of specialists, especially in hospital care are still on a good level
(21). The pointed facts as well as evidence from other relevant studies, allow for the
following assumptions (22):
− Low quality and effectiveness of the Primary care (GPs), especially when
concerning the level of qualification, organization, motivation for
improvement, compliance to contemporary best practices and implementation
of health promotion and disease prevention activities;
− Ineffective Emergency care, related to lack of financial, material and human
resources;
− Insufficient personal responsibility, information and motivation for self-control
and self-management of the health status;
− Insufficient state and public responsibility for introduction of evidence-based,
equitable and effective health care;
− Continuing organizational problems and chaotic reforms in the health care
system, characterized by:
• Lack of managerial and governance capacity;
• Lack of integrated information system and chronic disease registries;
• Lack of working system for quality assessment and control;
• Inefficient allocation of financial resources;
• Insufficient official standards and guidelines for good medical practice;
• Lack of incentives for the health providers; and
• Lack of trust in the population.
Activities, undertaken to address the problem
Bulgaria is still waiting for its new National Health Strategy (last one adopted in
2001) and for a National strategy for prevention and control of chronic (including
CVD) diseases. In 2001, the Government adopted a programme, called “Bulgaria
2001”, where a “National programme for control of cardiovascular diseases” was
announced (23). No specific action plan, activities or any results have been published
under it till the present moment. However, there are single legal orders and risk factor
control programmes adopted (for example, against smoking, diabetes control etc).
Bulgaria is also participating in the International intervention programme for
integrated chronic noncommunicable diseases prevention - CINDI programme (24).
The National Centre for Public Health Protection has recently published the “WHO
CVD-risk management package for low- and medium-resource settings, 2002”,
translated in Bulgarian (25).
Prevention activities and published guidelines:
1. Establishment of a National Committee for development of guidelines for
clinical practice of general practitioners (GPs), 2006 with members from
Bulgarian scientific society for general practice, the National association of the
GPs in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Hypertension League; 385 2. Start of a permanent CME course for high blood pressure and cardiovascular
risk education - "Educational Master Course on Hypertension and
Cardiovascular Risk”, European Society of Hypertension (ESH) / Bulgarian
Hypertension League (BHL) - 2006, 2007, 2008;
3. Translation / development and publishing of:
− ESH / ESC guidelines, 2003, 2007 – full and pocket versions are
translated, adopted and published by the BHL / BSC;
− Consensus for mono- and combination therapy of high blood pressure,
BSC, 2005;
− Guidelines for assessment and control of high blood pressure, 2006;
− Practical recommendations for management of high blood pressure,
according to the ESH/ESC guidelines, 2007;
− Guidelines (handbook) for general practitioners in the case of high
blood pressure, 2007;
− Information and education materials – leaflets, brochures, books for the
patient.
Nevertheless, there are no officially adopted Medical Standards for
cardiovascular prevention and treatment; there are no effective mechanisms and
incentives to motivate the health care providers to follow the published
recommendations and not enough public educational programmes.
Based on the analysis of the available European and national epidemiologic
and other studies, a comprehensive, evidence-based national cardiovascular disease
management programme has been developed. Here its basic components are
presented without any detailed explanations or activities. Strategic (long-term) goal:
Decrease the CVD incidence and mortality, increase the quality of life of CVD
patients and the healthy life expectancy (HALEs) in the Bulgarian population. Operational (short-term) goal: Successful implementation of a
cardiovascular disease management programme and development of a national
evidence-based, long-term Strategy for chronic disease control and prevention in
Bulgaria.
Programme objectives:
−
−
−
− Health promotion and CVD risk factor prevention;
Early detection and treatment of underlying risk factors;
Early diagnosis and treatment of CVD; and
Secondary and tertiary prevention of CVD. Leading principles of the programme:
− Chronic noncommunicable diseases and especially CVD should become a
priority for the national health policy; 386 − The main responsibility should be taken by the government, but decisions and
activities should be multi-sectoral, multi-level, including all policies and
spheres;
− Strong state control and regulation of health determinants and threats;
− Strict prioritization and control in financing and subsidizing;
− Specific capacity building in health care, focused on long-term care of chronic
conditions;
− Continuous adaptation and improvement of the health system and increasing
quality and effectiveness of care,
− Consistent policy for making healthy choices - easier choices;
− Implementation of evidence-based interventions, related to population
necessities and national specificity;
− Early, continuous and life-long risk factor and disease prevention and health
promotion;
− Increasing personal responsibility for health – “personal empowerment”;
− Strong public participation, social commitment and support for health – “social
empowerment”; and
− Development and setting up of “healthy public policy” – health in all policies. Intervention spheres (groups):
− Surrounding environment (political, social, economic and ecological) –
environmental protection, social inequalities etc;
− Individual (personal health protection) – behaviour, knowledge, skills,
motivation, lifestyle;
− Population free of disease (risk management) – detection and control of risk
factors;
− Patients:
• with acute CVD (clinical management) – emergency care, treatment
and rehabilitation;
• with chronic CVD (clinical management and social integration) – longterm care, disability rehabilitation, social support etc.;
• high risk groups (potential patients). Intervention approaches:
Political interventions and lobbying for health;
Intensive health information and education;
State regulation and increased priority financing;
Capacity building in public health;
Improvement of health services delivery - integrated and patient-cantered care;
and
− Public participation and partnership.
−
−
−
−
− 387 Structural elements of the programme, according to health
system levels −

− Macro-level: development of positive political setting:
Leadership and political will for healthy public policy;
Integration and partnership between different policies;
Provision of sustainable financing;
Priority distribution of human resources – introduction of a health map;
Legal changes and regulations; and
Intensive multi-sectoral approach.
Intermediate level:
Health system organization:

I stage – preparation (~ 1 year): activities for planning, coordination and
organization of the programme implementation and setting up an Action plan;
II stage – implementation (~ 3 years): realization of the particular activities
and interventions, according to the Action plan and monitoring of their effectiveness;
III stage – final (~ 1 year): analysis and evaluation of the results, achieved and
development of Action plan for the next period. Monitoring and performance indicators
In order to improve dynamically the programme and its interventions periodic
analyses should be performed and feedback received. Some of the possible indicators
are: total risk assessment of representative sample of the population, CVD incidence
trends during the period, level of patients’ compliance and adherence, patients’
satisfaction, behavioural or attitude change, etc. Expected results
Some of the specific results to be expected from the proposed programme
are:
− Better coordination, continuity and effectiveness in the health sector:
• Better risk assessment and detection of high risk groups for CVD;
• Better control and prevention of risk factors;
• Better treatment and rehabilitation of CVD patients;
• Implementation of evidence-based standard protocols, guidelines and
recommendation for good clinical practice;
• Increased motivation and compliance of health specialists.

−
−
−
−
− Decrease in the CVD incidence;
Increased economic effectiveness and efficiency;
Development of a National register for CVD diseases;
Increased health awareness and culture of the population;
Increased social participation and commitment;
Decreasing inequalities in health etc. 389 Financial sources for the programme:
−
−
−
− The Government and Ministry of health, NCPHP;
Municipalities;
NGOs (foundations, associations etc);
The Industry and other business etc. Conclusion
The problem of cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria can be only addressed by means
of complex, long-term and comprehensive approach, including short-term and longterm interventions in the framework of a National Programme (Strategy) for
management of CVD (26). It cannot be solved through temporary one-sided activities.
All interested stakeholders and institution should participate in the programme
implementation and analysis. Discussion and possible restrictions of the model
The proposed programme does not claim to be cost-effective or cost-saving, as clear
evidence for this is lacking. It is also important to point out that this DMP of CVD
does not include all possible approaches, interventions and activities for reaching the
final goal of the programme. This is only a model, an example of a comprehensive
evidence-based DMP for CVD. EXERCISES
Task 1
The students are asked to figure out significant public health problems for their
country (individual work). Then, in an open discussion, together priorities are set up,
according to the specific national settings. Task 2
The students are dividing into groups of 3 to 5. every group chooses a priority
problem and develops a design of a DMP. The models are presented before all
students and a discussion about their strengths and weaknesses is initiated. REFERENCES

research, qualitative methods, public health,
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• understand qualitative naturalistic approach in public health
• differentiate use and results of quantitative and qualitative approaches
• identified main use and importance of naturalistic approach
• recognize possibilities for naturalistic approach use in public health
practice
The use of qualitative and consensus building techniques enables better
understanding and improved collaboration among “policy stakeholders”
(politicians, administration, public health professionals and community)
involved in needs assessment and health policy formulation. War, migration,
and transition in South East Europe hardened most of public health activities
but especially made the process of health needs assessment and formulation
of health policy very difficult. Qualitative analytical methods have been
introduced in Croatia over the last 10 years. Nine Croatian cities and 15
Croatian counties created City/County Health Profiles and City/County
Health Plans by using qualitative methods. The greatest gain from
introducing the qualitative analytical approach is wider participation in
planning and managing of the resources for health at all levels, from
community and regional to national level. Qualitative analytical approach
was conducted through an intense and prolonged contact with a field, and
real community life, enabling gaining of a 'holistic' overview of the local
community.

HEALTH PRACTICES
Selma Šogorić, Tea Vukušić Rukavina, Aleksandar Džakula,
Ognjen Brborović THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Importance of introducing new paradigms – qualitativenaturalistic approach
Ideological similarity between the philosophy and practice of health promotion and
the assumptions and procedures of naturalistic approach has facilitated the
introduction of qualitative methods into the public health practice. Health promotion
believes in the ability of individuals (non-professionals) to generate useful knowledge
and insights, whereas qualitative methods grant a research value (scientific
legitimacy) to individual, subjective experience. Both tend to be inductive (as
opposed to classical, deductive approach) and derive general principles from
particular facts. Health promotion holds that a solution to a problem can come from
the bottom-up (community) rather than the top-down (national level and professional
experts). The same is believed in qualitative research, which starts from the idea that
concepts and explanations are best generated from the bottom-up, from particular
empirical data, rather than the top-down, i.e., from a general theory (1,2,3).
As a result of the transition, war and post-war experiences citizens in South
East Europe (SEE) are faced with a lack of social security and limited possibilities to
influence changes in the society. Most of these problems were caused by rapid
changes from socialist government with centrally planned economies to democratic
governments and more market-based economies. Variations in socio-economic factors
have had strong impact on the health systems of the countries and the health of their
citizens (4,5).
Appropriate public health approaches and methods can make significant
contribution to the enhancement of social justice. More than ever, public health is
being viewed as a catalyst for peace and an important factor in the socio-economic
development equation. During the last fifteen years, public health became insufficient
due to wars, economic and political changes. There is a recognized lack of
competence in public health, particularly in health management and strategy
development, but also in health surveillance, policy analysis and prevention. Apart
from rapid changes and changed context, public health is faced and with many limits
and shortcomings of “official”, institutionalized practice (6,7,8,9,10,11).
War, migration and transition in the region hardened most of public health
activities, but especially made the process of health needs assessment and formulation
of health policy very difficult. All health indicators obtained at that time were based
on estimates of a key factor – population. Yet today, 15 years after the transition has
began and 10 years after the war has finished, Croatia still has two crucial public
health problems: poor accessibility of health indicators at a local level and non- 395 inclusion of the community opinion. These reasons led to an initiative to implement a
different, corrective mechanism in public health practice – qualitative analytic
approach, enabling formulation of health policy from non-standard sources.
Three detailed examples will show how results of qualitative analytic approach
can be grounds for needs assessment, priority rating and health policy creation. CASE STUDY
Croatian experience in utilization of qualitative-naturalistic
methods
The establishment of the idea of health promotion in the late 1980s, and especially the
practical experience in its implementation through the “Healthy cities” project during
the 1990s has changed public health approach and research practice in Croatia.
Participatory methods of community health needs assessment needs have been
implemented in the mid-1990s, but a practice of establishing local databases (such as
the development of Local Area Indicators in the UK) is yet to be developed. We
believe that conventional and positivist approach, as used so far, does not reach local
communities. Over the last ten years, qualitative analytical methodology has been
introduced in the different areas of public health activities (needs assessment, priority
setting, planning, decision making and strategy development) in Croatia.
Methodology was used on three different levels:
1. City level - assessment of community health needs and, based on these
findings, production of the City Health Profile and the Plan for Health;
2. County level - assessment of community health needs and, based on this
findings, production of the County Health Profile and the Plan for Health,
studies of complex human health-related behaviour in their natural
environment -Healthy Counties program;
3. Regional level - strategy development for inter-county regional level. City Level: Rapid Appraisal to Assess Community Health
Needs
The most popular and most used method in the Croatian cities is the method of Rapid
Appraisal to Assess Community Health Needs. It was used in 9 cities between 1996
and 2004 (Pula, Metković, Rijeka, Karlovac, Varaždin, Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik,
Crikvenica). The advantages of this method in comparison with classical approaches
to health assessment are as follows: it can be done quickly (in two months from the
start), it does not take too much expert time and financial resources (approximately
6.500 EUR per city), it is participatory (representatives of different groups of citizens
participate in the process, from needs identification to solution finding; includes
representatives of city authorities, institutions and organizations as well as those from
non-governmental and non-for-profit sector), sensitive (ability to reflect local
particularities), valid (scientifically sound), action-oriented (as a product it gives
short-term and long-term activity plan), and its achievements are sustainable (it
establishes and facilitates co-operation among key stake-holders in the project via
priority thematic groups). 396 Academic credibility of this method is strengthened by the establishment of
strict selection rules of participants and panellists and by the process of triangulation
of both information sources (essays, observations and collected objective indicators
from the system) and researchers (experts of three different backgrounds: public
health, epidemiology and medical information science). By use of this qualitative
method (combined with available quantitative indicators), health needs assessment
was carried out in 1996 in Rijeka, which was used to devise a city health profile and a
city health plan The outcomes of ‘Rijeka – Healthy City’ project were evaluated in
2003.
Rijeka – Healthy City
Healthy City has been active in Rijeka since 1990. Till 1995, its activities were
mostly determined by the aftermaths of war and economic slump Croatia was
suffering, and focused on caring for the refugees and the displaced people, as well as
helping the socially disadvantaged. In 1995, the City Department for Health and
Social Welfare of Rijeka started devising the city health profile and the city health
plan.
Rapid assessment of the population health needs was used to devise these documents.
Following the suggestion of the project team, about seventy panellists were selected,
comprising representatives of the city administration, important city institutions and
the citizens, who were all asked to write an essay on health in Rijeka. In the working
meeting, held at the end of June 1996, the participants were presented the most
interesting and the most common answers from their essays, as well as statistical
health indicators in the city, and the photographs taken based on their reply to the
question what it was that diminished and added to the beauty of living in Rijeka.
The participants then chose three most important problems, first individually and then
in small groups. Taking into consideration the choice made by the groups, a joint list
of five priority areas was made, to be used in future 'Rijeka – Healthy City’ project:
- sustainable development;
- advances in environment protection;
- support for disabled people;
- quality of elderly life;
- improvements in children and youth’s health.
In 2003, due to the need to evaluate the outcomes of the ‘Rijeka – Healthy City’
project, an analysis of the changes was carried out for the period between 1996 and
2003. Three sources of information were used for the evaluation:
(a) 14 quantitative health indicators defined by RAP
(b) observations made by the project participants (both “veterans” and “fresh
forces” from 2003), gathered through work in focus groups
(c) analysis of program documents and resolutions passed by the city
administration.
The evaluation results showed the following: 397 - - quantitative indicators of health and quality of life in Rijeka more reflect
demographic, economic and epidemiological transition that other urban areas
in Croatia are undergoing as well, than they speak about outcomes of the
healthy city project
analysis of participants’ observations pinned down the key areas in which
change is evident:
• community participation in decision-making, inter-sector co-operation
“The project has met all its basic goals: its direct users in the local
community created and participated in it, RAP stressed the specific needs of
this local community; the actions were taken in logical order, according to
set priority list – and were complementary; resources were mobilised in the
local community, joint planning and activities facilitated co-operation
between interest groups, whose activities are complementary…”
• upgrading people’s awareness
“The project’s value lies in giving individuals responsibility, and realising
that everything they do have some kind of effect they as individuals are
responsible for... People become aware that what we do today is good for
their children… Healthy city project helps us do the most we can, given the
circumstances we live in… Work on the project results in the awareness of
the pride that it is our city and that I am responsible for my city… The
people’s awareness has been upgraded in a satisfactory manner (relation
toward the disabled and the elderly), we succeeded in fostering intergeneration socialising in local community, i.e. in connecting our oldest and
youngest citizens, the people became aware of the need to preserve the
environment (water, air, dangerous waste management)…The outcomes of
the theme groups’ work, and the project itself, show resistance to the sign of
our times, to do only what pays, no matter what happens.
• undertaken activities (exceed the expectations)
Undertaken activities range from removing architectural barriers, labelling
parking places for disabled people, lowering public telephones… the biggest
achievement was done in the area of help provided to elderly and disabled
people, The Healthy City Youth Council was founded, the youth became
more interested in active participation in the project as well as in civil
society, making use of the space the project has opened for them…the media
coverage was very good, many social programs in Rijeka were encompassed
in the project, new associations were founded and started work, attracting
many volunteers, environment situation was improved – gas, sewerage,
water, waste management…The presentation of every bigger project is a
chance to discuss modes of avoiding possible pollution and taking measures
for protection… Additional value of the project lies in the continuing
‘Generation Bridge’ activity, which was exceptionally well accepted, and has
the greatest value in connecting, socialising and decreasing isolation of
elderly people, through activities with primary students and children from
various associations… The prominence of Rijeka was proved by its
advanced solutions in health promotion of various segments of the 398 population.
- analysis of the program documents showed the following:
• Evident positive approach to health by the city administration
(Guidelines of Rijeka City Council).The 2004 Guidelines of Rijeka City
Council in its introductory part pay much attention to the analysis and
evaluation of economic and social environment, and the city’s social
profile. According the resolution by the City of Rijeka (therefore not as
provided by the legislation, but as their own, additional obligation),
resource allocation provides for “minimum 5% of total revenues for the
social program”; • Broad grounds of the ‘Rijeka – Healthy City’ project - over 80
organizations have been involved (departments of the city
administration, institutions, public associations, companies), through
programs for priority areas, 310 associations are financially supported; • A large number of ‘Rijeka – Healthy City’ project “products”: 24
publications (two books), 26 action groups that have continually been
carried out, 28 program projects in accordance with selected priorities,
and 22 researches. Qualitative methods used in evaluation process were more precise (than quantitative
methods) in detecting changes, their outcome and importance for Rijeka. Gathered
change indicators were presented to the public at the Consensus Conference, held on
18 June 2003, at the premises of Rijeka City Council. Around fifty conference
participants, politicians, professionals and members of citizen’s initiative, came to a
conclusion that “the first phase of the project – focusing – has been completed.”
Priorities were identified and remain the same. “And the main challenge of the project
is to continue bringing efficiently together all parties interested in solving the
identified problems, and developing mutual trust and co-operation.” It is necessary “to
maintain the existing achievements, and to further upgrade them, providing vision for
future in urban planning, economic and human development of the city.” Outcomes of
‘Rijeka – Healthy City’ project have been highly rated on both national and
international levels. These recognised outcomes were the grounds for accepting
Rijeka as a designated project city in the fourth phase of the ‘Healthy City’ project of
the European WHO office. County level: County public health capacity building: “Healthy
Counties” program
It is the “County public health capacity building: Healthy Counties” program that has
used primarily naturalistic and participatory approach in the counties health needs
assessment. Program started in March 2003. By the September 2004, 15 Croatian
counties successfully finished education. It has resulted in County Health Profiles and
Plans for Health in 15 out of 20 Croatian counties, with 5 clearly defined public
health problems as priorities in each county. All the three key elements of the 399 participants in the project were included in the health needs assessment at priority
setting: the politics, the profession, and the community, with emphasis on inter-sector
co-operation. Each Plan for Health, confirmed by the top political bodies in each
county (Councils), represents the starting point for introducing a change in public
health practice at local level. At the same time, it also allows for formulation of a
complete national health policy that would include the community (Cities and
Counties) opinion.
One of the most frequently recognized priorities among counties was high
alcohol consumption among adolescents. It was selected as a priority in 15 counties.
Studies of complex, health-related behaviour, such as drinking patterns in young
people in Virovitičko-Podravska county linked to the “County public health capacity
building: Healthy Counties” program, represents a more novel way of using
qualitative analytical methodology in Croatia. They are still in the initial phase of
research. It is in this area that the phenomenological approach, used to understand
human behaviour through experience of the participants, has been shown most
efficacious. By using qualitative methods (interviews) and by observing, listening and
investigating the participants of the process at every level (waiters, school
psychologist, ER physicians and teenagers), local researchers from VirovitičkoPodravska County have gradually started to understand the investigated phenomenon
in the context of their own social environment. The aim of this study is to recognise
particular behavioural patterns associated with excessive drinking, and to develop
effective interventions specific in the given social context. Regional Level: Change of public health practices using
qualitative naturalistic approach
It was the ‘Healthy Counties’ project that showed that some priorities, such as care for
the elderly, are the problem shared by all parts of Croatia. The information that the
elderly have been selected a priority in eleven, out of the fifteen counties included in
the ‘Healthy Counties’ program (based on the health needs assessment by use of
quantitative and qualitative methods), provides the grounds for designing inter-county
action plan In order to design action plans for the elderly, further use of qualitative
research methods is needed.
Elderly care
Due to the demographic transition in Croatia, the elderly (people older then 65) are
the fastest growing subgroup in the general population. Due to the Census data (2001)
there is 15,6% of elderly in the Croatian general population. Comparing 1991 and
2001 census data in some counties we registered increase in elderly population of
more than 20%. Unequal, in-county distribution of elderly, i.e. much higher
percentage of the elderly in rural, low-density populated areas and islands (up to
33.3%) makes situation even more alarming. Despite the problems, evident from the
statistical data, local authorities failed to respond to them, and offer intervention. Such
a state was due to lack of adequate methods for evaluation of specific needs and
analysis of details of the problem, required for the intervention.
The first step toward the solution was taken through the ‘Healthy Counties 20022004’ program, which used qualitative and quantitative methods (interviews, focus 400 groups, semi-structured questionnaires) to design county health profiles and priority
setting. Analyzing the problems of the elderly, research was carried out in several
elderly groups and their family members, including the professionals engaged in the
work with the elderly. As a result, 10 counties and the City of Zagreb, described the
problems of the elderly even through local specific needs, and included them in their
action plans. (www.zdravi-gradovi.com.hr).
In the second step, representatives of all participating counties and the City of Zagreb
were brought together for a special conference of all project teams, to discuss the
problem of the elderly. The conference was aimed at deepening the problem analysis,
and comparing and analyzing joint and specific difficulties the counties are facing.
The conference goal was to devise joint guidelines that would serve as basis for
design and implementation of the inter-county (regional) elderly care plan.
Participants worked in small groups and plenary sessions, which led them to the
conclusion that the system lacked:
- sufficient knowledge of elderly peoples' needs (what we usually have are more
providers' estimates than users' concerns);
- a good overview of existing resources (institutional, non-institutional) that
provide for the elderly (since everybody is providing for the elderly, no one is
really responsible);
- mechanisms in place to support collaboration between users, providers and
county policy making bodies; and
- Comprehensive ELDERLY CARE policy and a plan for action at the county
level.
The following separate problems were identified:
- lack of political interest among county officials;
- lack of interest in collaboration between providers, between providers and
county policy making bodies, and between users and providers;
- lack of funding for enlarging existing or introducing new services;
- misunderstanding and confusion about “who is doing what” because of the
absence of comprehensive ELDERLY CARE policy and a plan for action at all
levels (municipality, county, country);
- lack of knowledge of “what should be done”, and by whom.
The obtained results will form the grounds for designing action plan on the problems
of the elderly in Croatia. Activities related to more detailed needs analysis will start in
April 2005, with emphasis on identification of specific groups.
Without findings of qualitative analyses, it is not possible to focus activities on
problem causes, on identifying specific subgroups and their needs, or adjusting the
intervention programs to specific needs of the social environment. Participation of
political structures in the planning process will ensure political framework necessary
for long-term “healthy” policy. Conclusion
The job of public health professionals, including those in academic setting, is not only
to investigate and understand the world; it is also to change it. This is why in post- 401 war, transitional Croatia the emphasis has been put on the development of applied
(action) research by which the academic knowledge may be used for intensifying
activities and development of local communities.
The basic principle of qualitative analysis – to explain the causes and build the
theory on the basis of fieldwork – describes the best the difference between the
empirical and naturalistic approach in research. Qualitative data provide a rich and
detailed description, emphasizing the context in which the experience occurs and
allowing us to gain insight into and deep understanding of a process, which is not
possible by use of other methods.
Post-war situation, migrations, and the process of transition were the reasons
why it was not possible to generate credible demographic analyses, statistical studies
and quantitative health indicators. Therefore, use qualitative analysis was chosen as a
corrective mechanism in the formulation of health policy. The system was so
weakened by aforementioned objective reasons that the application of these very
methods, which could empower and strengthen the community, was an imperative.
In all described cases, qualitative and quantitative methods were combined.
Inter- sectoral and inter-disciplinary collaboration was used in all stages of the
processes, emphasizing crucial role of the involvement of all three key parties
(politicians, administration, public health professionals and community). By this
triangulation of different approaches to the same problem, we increased the validity of
our findings.
The introduction of qualitative and consensus building techniques in the policy
formulation process in Croatia has brought much better understanding and improved
collaboration among “policy stakeholders” (politicians, administration, public health
professionals and community).
At the moment, the greatest gain from the introduction of qualitative analytical
approach and participatory methods into the practice of Croatian public health is the
achievement of a higher degree of participation in planning and managing of the
resources for health at all levels, from community and county to national level. REFERENCES

Learning objectives Abstract The health reforms went diverse ways in different countries, but
everywhere under powerful influence of political, economic and
social changes. The market principles were proposed (and not
very successfully applied) to a situation of poor and apparently
egalitarian systems. The importance of primary care was
underlined, but it was often disintegrated, overspecialized and
inadequately supported.
Facing a burden of social problems the centralized state
solutions as well as participatory social movements had only
momentary effects, so that strengthening of local and family
capacities, supported by a team of generalist professionals
emerged as the best choice. It was advocated by empirical
results in most of developed countries.
Based on experience from Croatia and other countries the
strategies were identified for implementing the generalist
professional approach as a basis of PHC services. Firm political
decision, vocational training and development of professional
identity of general practice/family medicine (physicians and
nurses) were essential starting points. Organizational
arrangements, academic/scientific support, and international
relations have to stabilize further development. 406 Independent contractual relation of professionals with financing
institutions and group practice in form of integrated small health
centres, appear to be the best nucleus of primary health care.

STRENGHTENING OF GENERAL
PRACTICE/FAMILY MEDICINE AS PART OF
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE
Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Recent health care reforms and primary health care
The rapid changes in type of health needs, visible ageing of populations, social
problems such as migrations, unemployment, growing social divisions and insecurity,
more knowledgeable patients with higher expectations, hopes in technological
panacea, mounting costs of health services, all of them together, triggered the new
wave of health reforms in all countries. It is under strong influence of deep turn from
egalitarian to libertarian views. High expectations are associated with market
principles and free enterprises in economics, what is reflected in social, health and
other public services (1).
The effectiveness, efficiency and equity in health care, quality and satisfaction
of people with services are the essential goals of reforms. As an important factor
emerged the general/family practice which according to experiences may influence
radically the health system in the desired direction.
The evaluation studies in most developed countries showed that both rational use of
resources and satisfaction of people may be influence by services in which a
considerable role is plays general/family practice (2-4).
According to circumstances and traditions the countries have diverse positions
and stress different expectations. The economic and cost-containment concerns where
at the top in most countries, followed by equitable distribution of services. Many
others follow, like implementation of subsidiary principle, involving families and
local communities, substitution of institutionalized care by home care etc. Essential intentions in developing primary health care for 21st
century
The great change from egalitarian to libertarian paradigms in economics, social and
health policies is still influencing tensions inside health sectors. The big
international organizations from the same UN family have conflicting views
(e.g. WHO and World Bank) stressing different approaches to further
development. The World Health Report “Life in the 21st century - A vision for
all” (5) and the new global policy “Health for all in the 21st century”(6) stress
social problems and poverty as main contribution to ill health, still follow the
predominantly egalitarian approach and build on successful experiences of
growing acceptance of primary health care strategy.
“Building on primary health care, health systems should be: community
based and comprehensive, including promotive, preventive, curative and
rehabilitative components; available continuously; closely linked at all 408 levels to social and environmental services; and integrated into a wider
referral system”.
“Maximum freedom should be sought for local services…Long-term care
should be primarily provided in the community through non-hospital
institutional care and home-based services”.
However, no specific organizational form of care is envisaged and less stress is
given to participation and economics, now popular in health reforms. Contrary, the
social aspect is stressed: a decentralized, sustainable and scientific evidence based
care, meeting the social, cultural and spiritual needs of different groups, is
recommended. Fostering innovation and human resources for health are among
essential health system functions.
In the proposed new European WHO policy document (7) the targets are
more specific, as e.g. Target 19: “Primary health care with a family-oriented health
services at its core”:
“By the year 2010, at least xx% of people in Member States should have
access to a physician and a nurse of their choice, both specialized in family
health, as a first level of care and to other specialist services when required.
This target aims at:
• By the year 2005, all countries having adopted the basic concepts of
integrated primary health care services, based on professional team
work and adequately supported by secondary and tertiary hospital
services;
• By the year 2005, the principle of family health physicians and family
health nurses working at the core of this integrated primary care service
having been accepted by all countries; …”
For better understanding it is also important to quote a WHO document,
named “Framework for professional and administrative development of General
Practice/Family Medicine in Europe” (8a). It comes as a result of a contribution of
several WHO collaborating centres for primary health care in Europe, first as a draft
of a “Charter for General Practice/Family Medicine in Europe” in 1992. After wide
discussions in over 200 international and national associations and professional
organizations of physicians and of general practitioners, as well as other health
professionals contributing to primary health care in Europe, the revision of the draft
Charter was produced in a consultation meeting in Copenhagen 1998. In the section
on purpose of the document one of conclusions is:
“General practice can thus contribute to an effective and efficient primary
health care service of high quality, which should positively affect the workload and
quality of specialized and hospital care”.
In the following section the characteristics of General Practice are described,
and as the main titled “general” one can read:
“General practice addresses the unselected health problems of the whole
population; it does not exclude certain categories of the population because of age,
gender, social class, race or religion, or any category of complaint or health-related
problem. It must be easily accessible with a minimum of delay; access to it is not
limited to geographical, cultural, administrative or financial barriers”.
Under section on conditions for the development of GP/FM the structural
conditions (discrete general population, working environment close to patients and 409 referral system), organizational improvements and professional development are
mentioned.
Very important issues are described under professional development, such as:
• specific education and vocational training required for all those to become a
family physician;
• quality development through audit carried out in peer groups;
• role and function of academic departments of general practice;
• research;
• development of effective professional organization.
The essentially same political statement was repeated 10 years later (8b).
Summing-up, one may conclude that the experiences gained from health
reforms are becoming a realistic input for health policies on turn of centuries. The
simplified traditional libertarian solutions of individualism and free enterprise,
introduction of health market corrected by high moral standards and charity, are not a
guarantee against growing social problems and weakening of social networks. As
answers are offered two traditional lines of understanding what is most important for
primary health care:
• the first, technical, stressing evidence based medicine, high standards of quality,
efficiency and professionalism (a line closer to libertarian philosophy and to
traditional public health);
• another line stressing the need of equity in health as basic right of people,
subsidiary, community participation and empowerment, strengthening of primary
groups, like neighbourhoods and families (a line closer to egalitarian philosophy
and to so called “new public health”).
Both separately are a try against dominant social currents and practices,
appealing to human rationality, tolerance, social concern and solidarity, an important
hope, but without final proof.
The new pragmatic policy, as presented in quoted documents are recognizing
need of unifying both approaches, as it is presented in a new attitude towards
generalist professionals (GP/FM) at roots of the health system. Facing this orientation,
practically all countries have to revise their practices, developed, developing or new
established states. Many different ways could be envisaged, increasing diversity of
practical solutions in different circumstances. Reflection on experiences
A new approach to general/family practice
A new approach to GP/FM was considered in all European countries CCEE (4,9,10).
The situation was different: in some countries even the clear notion was not present
about what is and what should be the GP/FM; in others the long tradition petrified
some approaches inappropriate to new tasks. The different strategies were necessary,
but essentially they may be defined in several groups of elementary strategies. Their
relative importance might vary according to different phases of development. The
particular elements were installing or reforming training (vocational training, different
forms of continuous education and participation of practitioners in undergraduate
training), changing the financing of health care (“privatization”, contractual relations
of professionals with the financing agencies, self-contribution by patients), the 410 reorganization of services (individual and group practices, changes in division of
work at the primary level, different types of managed care), raising the social and
professional status of GP/FM (9).
Unfortunately the feeling of urgency has influenced some mechanical
shortcuts and contra-productive impositions of health administrations: the destruction
of entrepreneurial self-confidence instead of flexible supporting of its development.
The transitional phase is far more complex than it was expected. Models are
less transferable among countries. Propositions and perspectives are not quite
understood and seemingly undesirable. Population is conservative and threatened by
changes. The new challenges are not welcomed by the “silent majority”.
The enthusiastic minority might be confronted with many difficulties, needs
support and the strategies have to be specified and thoroughly carefully thought about. The major strategies are similar, but their form and timing will
differ
Although many experiences already exist, simplification and schematization may lead
to errors. This general consideration should primarily serve as a frame for
consideration of every individual strategy and a way to exchange experiences and not
as a proposed prototype. However, the moves triggering change are similar.

empowerment The table 1 is combining a choice of elementary strategies, of which the first
five are predominantly based on “external” activities originated by governments,
health administration etc., while the second group of five are predominantly
"intrinsic", i.e. initiative is expected by profession itself.
The most important long-range strategy is reliable provision of personal high
quality cars and patient satisfaction.
The triggers pushing the change are usually political recognition of GP/FM as
important and unavoidable element of health system and vocational training leading
to technical self-confidence and entrepreneurship.
After these first steps the “intrinsic” strategies were usually essential for
further development: professional empowerment, taking over academic positions and
tasks, and gaining managerial skills.
These strategies could hardly be successful without open communication and
close collaboration with partners and finally institutionalization of integrated primary
care services. Described strategies depend on circumstances, but to become successful
have to be based on a proactive, flexible and open-minded behavior of the GP/FM
profession. Beyond correction of poor practices
The greatest gap between intentions and real achievements of PHC and GP/FM was
the wider outlook on care in community and collaboration with all partners, sectors
and services. The major role in choosing proper solutions has to be given to people
them, but a technically informed advice is necessary. An important strategy in
developing GP/FM is to continue and further develop the traditional role of general
practice to be advocate and consultant to people, even to protect them in case of
insulting marketing of health and medicine.
However, it cannot be achieved if regarded only as a superficial correction of
accustomed behavior learned during administratively lead system. It also depends of a
deep rooted insecurity and ambiguity learned by vague overall definition of primary
care. There is poor understanding and differentiation of certain “kinds” of primary
health care, using similar and familiar terms, but with opposite meaning, i.e.:
comprehensive, selective, community or family oriented primary health care. The
comprehensive or integrated primary health care is the choice, because it has growing
role confronting the contemporary problems in developed countries: elderly, poor,
and chronically ill and those with psychical problems. It is more complex and difficult
than selective approach, it stresses the need for team work, consultations and
collaboration, all what is making troubles and regularly hated and avoided by
independent practitioners. How to combine the personal care with that broader openmindedness is a real challenge (3,4).
Building up awareness of the new role, independent thinking based on
practical experience, establishing a self-confident professional organization will
certainly in most new-comers be a sign of mature achievements. Obstacles and what one can do about them
Unfortunately in many of older and quite a few younger professional organizations
the internal tensions are inevitable and common. This tensions and conflicts may 412 considerably weaken development. Majority of obstacles to development are
“imported” obstacles actually reflecting conflicts of the wider system. These may be
grouped in two clusters:
(a) One predominantly reflecting general social and political situation, e.g.
• Double face of health politics (verbal support and financial deprivation);
• Remaining concepts of “selective primary care” and “primary medical care”;
• Demanding patients and aggressive bureaucrats in health administration.
(b) Another reflecting the relations within the wider medical profession, e.g.:
• Power structure inside health services and among medical professions;
• “Closest neighbours, worst enemies” (generalist versus specialists, like
internists, public health specialist, nurses, paramedical);
• Traditional approach to training in medicine and vocational training.
A hidden conflict is more difficult to solve between the group of “pioneers”
and the group for which is GP/FM only a “second job” (some successful “managers”,
overloaded women and similar groups).
The one of most important resistance are related to stimulation of the “silent
majority”. The leading group should not loose the touch with the far larger group
proclaiming “Do not shake the boat”.
Many different reasons and in some
countries the learned obedience, discipline in front of authorities, fear and insecurity
might be explanation for choosing waiting as the best solution, because “GPs will
always somehow survive”. Training, concrete joint activities, technical project proper
information and networking should be the uneasy but important solution.
Fragmentation inside profession among generations, rural/city groups,
academic and others GPs, different market coalitions, because of small issues among
neighbours, etc. is usually not dangerous, but needs timely deliberation. Strengthening professionalism
The building of professional consciousness, understanding of needs for professional
solidarity and long-range thinking about far reaching common interests with patients,
other professionals and community, development of own dignity, self-confidence and
adequate social position is a long process (11).
Successful strategies for development and strengthening the profession may
be summarized as follows:
• Networking, professional solidarity and organization of activities;
• Outspoken technical and ethical standards;
• Patient mobilization and support;
• Clever tactics inside professional and political circles;
• Relying on own strengths. Forwarding “own” technical and administrative
support;
• Development of own academic basis and influence on training programs;
• International relations: world wide perspectives.
The time has been nearly forgotten when views related to primary health care
were against medical establishment. Opinion existed that it would be possible to 413 implement ideas of PHC without participation of professional practitioners. Similarly,
at the other end, a belief dominated that general practice is responsible only for
personal care on request of individuals, not necessarily taking into account the
community in which they work and live. It was a history of love and hate, trust and
mistrust, but better understandings are now prevalent. It may look as a rather long
search for obvious, although it may be even now a reason for dispute.
General practice/Family Medicine (GP/FM) is developing as an interface
between clinical medicine and public health (community medicine), an example of
people oriented integrated medicine. It is a potent bridge between science and human
care, prevention and treatment, biological, psychological and social understandings,
individuals, families and communities, a science and an art of living (12).
The process has not yet been settled. A realistic approach to participation of
people and of different other sectors in PHC has to overcome tempting ideas that free
market will automatically empower people to participate and influence health care.
The awareness is maturing of growing costs and limitations of free medical practice in
a society divided by richness and opportunities. The right behavior has to be accepted
by practitioners of all kinds, to secure long range mutual interests, beyond their
particular immediate interest.
However, we may accept with satisfaction that the basic mutual
understanding is present and collaboration accepted by all sides. This should be the
starting point in discussing strategies for strengthening general/family practice. A
“win/win” solution was rediscovered by professionals and all other participants. The game is not finished: the main influences are coming
from socio-political issues
Nevertheless, the gap between intentions and realities seems to be as great as ever.
The main support to primary health care policy was “for all” strategy in development,
declared in Alma-Ata 1978. However, after economic recession in early 1980, and
downfall of “egalitarian” (“socialist”) political systems in 1990, the neoliberal and
free market philosophy as the main engine of global development.
The confrontation of those powerful and wealthy with those suppressed and
poor become evident not only in terrorist attacks and military revenges, but also in
diminished solidarity among and between countries. Under emerging socio-political
condition heal care was one of offers in structural adjustment policies imposed by
World Trade Organization, World Bank and particularly International Monetary Fund
(13-15). Although some international organizations such as World Health
Organization, UNICEF, and UNESCO further supported “for All” policies in health
and education, they were weakened and the situation in the field started to alarm
United Nations. At the turn of centuries (and millenniums) United Nations developed
Millennium Declaration and later through Millennium Project and Global Fund tried
to reach targets in 2015 (“(1) eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, (2) achieve
universal primary education, (3) promote gender equality and empowerment of
women, (4) reduce child mortality, (5) improve maternal health, (6) combat
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, (7) ensure environmental sustainability, and
(8) global partnership for development”) (14).
However, it is already clear that Millennium targets will not be achieved, and
some of the issues are understood in different ways (16,17). The old fight between 414 promoters of genuine comprehensive (horizontal) primary health care and selective
(vertical) programs of primary care become visible particularly in conflicts about
funding. How it is in a destructive way attacking General/Family Practice in Europe is
well seen from an address of the Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and a
number of other international organizations called Strengthening primary health care
“15 by 2015” (18):
“…we propose that by 2015, 15% of the budgets of vertical disease-oriented
programs be invested in strengthening well-coordinated, integrated local
primary healthcare systems and that this percentage would increase over
time. Such an investment would improve developing nations’ capacity to
address the majority of health problems through a generic, well-structured,
primary health care system.” Summary
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The GP/FM in the context of primary health care has an important role, next to
people, complementary to other services and often as a conductor of the
orchestra. The existing experiences show movements in all countries. Most of
them are in good direction to improve relevance, efficiency, equity of services
and satisfaction of people, but still needs time to evolve or reform themselves.
There is a gap between general solutions and real practices. The type of
organization of PHC is not successfully recognized so that further evaluation of
practices and experiments are needed. The problem of “privatization” as a tool
for change and the old problem of health centres and integration of primary
services are presented, based on experience in Croatia.
Essential elementary strategies for development of general/family medicine are
identified as:
• long-range: relevance and quality of personal services and satisfaction of
people;
• starting: vocational training, development of identity and political support;
• strengthening: professional organization and academic developments;
• institutionalizing: reorganization of service management;
• sustaining: national and international networking, evaluating experiences.
Diversity and different dynamics in combination of elementary strategies and
different ways of development should be expected. Proactive approach and
flexibility are most important. Possible internal and external obstacles are
identified. Among them the passive expectant majority from inside and the vague
governmental support and aggressive health administration from outside are
considered as most threatening.
The role of the recently issued WHO document "Framework for professional and
administrative development of general practice/family medicine in Europe" is
important to present the intentions of GP/FM and introduce them to other
partners, as well as to strengthen their internal homogeneity. 415 CASE STUDY
Experiences from Croatia
Croatia shared many of the worst experiences of violence, power struggle and
unsolved economic, social and political problems during the last years. It can be
illustrated by quantitative data. The social problems (19) of war victims,
unemployment, elderly and poor are described in Table 2.

24% A comparison with Macedonia and Slovenia in Tables 3 and 4 shows some
similarities but also striking differences. Some of indicators in comparison with those
before 1990 show the widening gap between Croatia and Slovenia, and some of closer
formal similarities with data from Macedonia.
The situation is described as a "Croatian paradox" that with worsening of
general conditions the usual health indicators have shown so far a tolerable degree of
health indicators (20). However, one of the overlooked reasons explaining beneficial
outcome might be the tradition of a decentralized system, strong and independent
primary health care and great personal contribution of professionals during the war.
Until now the decisive contribution of primary health care, and especially general 416 practitioners, is not well recognized, because more attention was given (as it is usual)
to specialized and hospital services.
As it is well known and documented, the importance of generalists and
primary care was well conceived in Croatia rather early in comparison with other
countries. The significance of integrated (preventive/curative) health centres was
important, in spite of lately over-managed or bureaucratic organization of fat-headed
"Health homes" or policlinics (21,22).

Hm.Dev Index - Human Development The reform started with changes in financing and some reorganization (23).
The health fund was centralized and organized as the Croatian institute of health
insurance in the closest possible way collaborating with Ministry of health. The
resources have in one period diminished to one third of those immediately before the
new Croatia started to exist. Public health was re-organized as a centrally
administered separate service, including institutes of public health but also peripheral
units previously working as part of health centres. Medical centres were “dissolved”
into original parts: hospitals, health centres and institutes of public health. 417 The case of “privatization”
The “privatization” of primary care physicians was proclaimed as a major health
policy, but continued with hot/cold tactics in support of “free” private practices and of
strict administrative and financial control of services. The positive move was insisting
on free choice of physicians by people, although the actual implementation was
limited protecting existing services and some powerful groups of professionals. The
important next step was introduction of contractual relations between primary care
physicians and the health insurance. Under condition of restricted resources and threat
of loosing job, the contracts have been largely dictated by health insurance
administration. The resources have been limited, but the proclaimed rights of people
further covering complete care as before. The “rationing” of prescriptions given to
individual practitioners was standardized to the averages (by definition half of people
having less than it was usual, mostly in urban areas, and half more than enough). If
some demands of patients have not been fulfilled, professionals were regularly found
responsible. Administrative measures and material punishments were implemented
for those who exceeded the standardized rate of patients on sick leave. This has put
majority of professionals in an insecure position, derogating their technical
competence and humiliating them publicly.
On the other side, many short-sighted tactics and “children diseases” of
privatization were common among most ambitious 5-10% of “completely private
practitioners”: advertisements promising impossible, unnecessary additional medical
interventions, complementary and alternative procedures, misuse of technology etc.
For all physicians in primary health care, from 1997, the planned, mandatory
leasing of premises from health centres was introduced, as a kind of limited fundholding and semiprivate position.
To co-ordinate and protect interest of physicians the Chamber of physicians
started to exist, but still has many problems and tensions defending political
independence and accommodating very different interests inside profession.
Tables 5 and 6 may illustrate forms and quantities of health services' staff
and institutions, especially regarding the most important element - manpower.

Zagreb, 1997. 418 Until the end of 1996 about 92% of health workers were employed in
institutions owned by state or counties. Regarding physicians in primary health care
the ratio of number of public teams and registered private practitioners was the
highest among stomatologists (~1:0,63%), followed by gynecologists (~1:0,61), and
in general/family practitioners just above 10% (ratio ~1:0,13).
One should be careful in interpretation because different sources of data vary
in definition of different forms of private practices. Therefore, based on data one may
just conclude that number of primary care professionals in two years were growing
rather fast, mostly in form of contractual relations with premises on lease among
general/family practitioners, while among specialists there prevailed units based on
own premises.

The main objectives regarding the individual practitioners, quality of their work and
their position in the health system is described as having mixed, positive and negative
traits. It is estimated that most of positive traits are in stimulation of professionals, not
yet clear final impact in technical aspects of work, and a changing situation regarding
the position in the health system.
Unfortunately even the most positive aspects are not fully developed by giving chance
to technical, economic and human initiatives, because the liberty is limited by strong
centralization in management and control. In Table 7 the so far gained qualitative
estimates are summarized.
There are good prospects of conflicts in the system built on tensions between
central authorities and accumulated interests in the primary level, but also dangerous
developments when the common goals are submitted to immediate political needs.
The essential unity, namely, has to grow up through an independent, democratic,
ethically and technically safe process, and not by authoritarian central guidance.

practitioners and their teachers is published in a book: Jakšić Ž, ur. Ogledi o razvoju

Team building, formal/informal groups, team roles, group
development, teamworking Learning objectives After completing this module students and public health
professionals should:
• Differentiate between group and team;
• Recognise different types of groups
• Be aware of and identify possible roles within a team
• Understand the group development process
• Be aware of both advantages and disadvantages of
teamworking Abstract Because there are no pure formal or informal organisations in
real world, one may conclude that an organisation is a mix of
formal and informal groups. Thus, its performance depends on
the management ability to recognise the existence of these
groups, to transform them from groups into working teams, to
motivate and stimulate them to achieve organisation’s goals.
We must differentiate the concept of group versus the concept of
team. A simple definition of the group can be: two or more
persons who come into contact for a purpose and who consider
the contact meaningful. A team has to accomplish bigger goals
than any individual group. The purpose of a team is to perform,
achieve results and be successful in the organisation or
marketplace.
The literature describes several types of groups according to a
set of criteria.
Formal groups (work team) is created by an organisation in
order to achieve a certain goal, being recognised and receiving
full support from the organisation. Informal groups arise from
natural attractions among individuals for social reinforcement or
other benefits.
They seldom share the organisational objectives and have a
temporary basis.
The roles within a team actually represent tasks and functions in 423 the self-management of the team's activities. Belbin developed a
test to identify individual team roles.
Many teams go through a life-cycle of stages, firstly identified by
Bruce Tuckman in 1965 as: forming, storming, norming and
performing. This model has become the basis for further models of
group development, principally adding the 5th phase of adjourning.
If there are many advantages of the teamworking, there are also
disadvantages that should be considered by a manager when
building a team.
Teaching methods Specific
recommendations
for teachers
Assessment of
Students Teaching methods include: lectures, group discussions, group
assignments (2). First assignment consists in self-evaluation of
the roles played in a team by each student, based on Belbin
questionnaire. For the second assignment, the students will be split
in groups of 4-5 persons and asked to solve the “Survival”
exercise. Each group should evaluate the performance of the team
in the process of decision-making versus the individual
performance.
60% work under teacher supervision / 40% individual students’
work
No special facilities or equipment, Belbin questionnaire and
Survival game should be distributed during the course.
Assessment could be based on multiple choice questionnaire
(MCQ), structured essay, seminar paper, case problem
presentations, oral exam, etc. 424 TEAM BUILDING
Adriana Galan, Silvia Gabriela Scîntee THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Generally, either formal or informal organizations constitute together the
organizational setting where work is performed. As described by Organization
Design theory, a formal organization is characterized by approved authorityresponsibility relationships, clear division of work and separate departments and,
usually, a hierarchical structure. The formal organization is the planned
interrelationship of people, material resources and activities (1).
By contrast, the informal organization is characterized by dynamic behaviour
and activity patterns taking place within formal structures due to human
interrelationship and interaction.
Because there are no pure formal or informal organizations in real world, one
may conclude that an organization is a mix of formal and informal groups. Thus, its
performance depends on the management ability to recognize the existence of these
groups, to transform them from groups into working teams, to motivate and
stimulate them to achieve organization’s goals.
Nevertheless, to build an effective team is a resource consuming process and
requires a complex activity. Group versus team
We must differentiate from the very beginning the concept of group versus the
concept of team. Thus, a simple definition of the group can be: two or more persons
who come into contact for a purpose and who consider the contact meaningful (2).
The purpose of a group may be implicit rather than stated. Another definition
of a group is: two or more persons who communicate and share common values,
norms and needs (3). To conclude, there are three minimal requirements to form a
group:
1. group members are sharing common needs or objectives
2. there is a strong interpersonal communication component within the group
3. there is a minimal or even absent hierarchy within the group.
A team represents a small number of people with complementary skills who
are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they
are mutually accountable (4).
A team has to accomplish bigger goals than any individual group. The purpose
of a team is to perform, achieve results and be successful in the organization or
marketplace. A good manager is those who can assemble a group of individuals and
transform them into a team. There were described ten key differentials to help a
manager to shape a group of people into a pro-active and productive team (5).
1. Understandings. In a group (usually in formal groups), members think they
are put together for administrative purposes only. Individuals sometimes cross 425 purpose with others. In a team, members recognize their independence and
understand that both personal and team goals are best accomplished with
mutual support. Time is not wasted attempting personal gain at the expense of
others.
2. Ownership. In a group, members rather tend to focus on themselves because
they are not sufficiently involved in planning the organizational objectives. In
a team, members feel a sense of ownership for their jobs and unit, because they
are committed to values-based common goals that they previously established.
3. Creativity and contribution. In a group, members are told what to do rather
than being asked what the best approach would be. Suggestions and creativity
are not encouraged. In a team, members contribute to the organization’s
success by applying their skills, knowledge and creativity to team objectives
setting.
4. Trust. In a group, members distrust the motives of colleagues because they do
not fully understand the role of other members. Expressions of opinion or
disagreement are considered troublesome or non-supportive. In a team,
members work in a climate of trust and are encouraged to openly express
ideas, opinions, disagreements and feelings.
5. Common understandings. In a group, members are so cautious about what
they say, that real understanding is not possible. Game playing may occur and
communication traps be set to catch the innocent. In a team, members practice
open and honest communication. They make an effort to understand each
other's point of view.
6. Personal development. In a group, members receive good training but are
somehow limited in applying it to the job either by the manager or other group
members. In a team, members are encouraged to continually develop skills
and apply what they learn on the job.
7. Conflict resolution. In a group, if members find themselves in conflict
situations they do not know how to deal with it. Their supervisor/leader may
postpone intervention until serious damage is done, i.e. a crisis situation. In a
team, members realize that conflict is a normal aspect of human interaction but
they view such situations as an opportunity for new ideas and creativity. They
try to manage conflict quickly and constructively.
8. Participative decision making. In a group, members may or may not
participate in decisions affecting the team. Conformity often appears more
important than positive results. In a team, members participate in decisions
affecting the team but understand their leader must make a final verdict
whenever the team cannot decide, or an emergency exists. Positive win/win
results are the goal at all times.
9. Clear leadership. In a group, members tend to work in an unstructured
environment with undetermined standards of performance. In a team,
members work in a structured environment, they know what boundaries exist
and who has final authority. The leader sets agreed high standards of
performance and he/she is respected via active, willing participation.
10. Commitment. In a group, members are uncommitted towards excellence and
personal pride. Performance levels tend to be average. Staff turnover is high
because talented individuals quickly recognize that:
(a) personal expectations are not being fulfilled; 426 (b) they are not learning and growing from others; and
(c) they are not working with the best people.
In a team, only those committed to excellence are hired. Everyone works
together in a harmonious environment. Why people join groups or work teams
People naturally tend to join groups, being usually surrounded by others with
comparable values, this fact reinforce their own value system.
Another reason to join groups might be that groups give people an informal
status, which can be the feeling of belonging to a distinct unit. Group membership
also provides a level of individual security; members feel that they are equal with
the others. Individuals are better listened within a group. Recognition, participation
and communication needs are higher satisfied in a group.
To conclude, specific needs of group members are better met in a group than
in the whole organization.
The literature describes several types of groups according to a set of criteria.
Formal groups (work team) is created by an organization in order to achieve
a certain goal, being recognized and receiving full support from the organization.
Under this category, several forms of groups may exist:
 Functional group – consisting of a manager and all its subordinates.
In a formal organization, each department may be considered a functional group.
 Operational or task-dedicated group – specially created to achieve a
clear task, has a temporary basis and the group is suspended once the task is
finished.
 Permanent Committee – it is actually an operational committee
having the responsibility to solve problems that appear periodically in a certain field
of activity. A committee is not specific only to an organization; there are also interorganizational committees (for instance inter-ministerial committees).
 Consultative Group – a temporary group having as main task to make
recommendations for a certain topic. Usually includes persons from different
sectors.
 Self-managed group – it represents the group that has to achieve a
certain task without being regularly monitored. Its members have full responsibility,
being governed by a spirit of solidarity. They make their own decision on the
distribution of tasks inside the group, they establish the working hours, and they are
doing the performance self-evaluation.
 Project teams – nowadays, projects often require that people work
together in order to accomplish the project goal. Members of these teams might
belong to different groups, but receive clear assignment to activities for the same
project; thereby outsiders may view them as a single unit.
Informal groups arise from natural attractions among individuals for social
reinforcement or other benefits. They seldom share the organizational objectives
and have a temporary basis. This type of group is created by people and not by
organizations. Informal groups are not formally recognized by the organization and
do not represent a unit in the organizational chart. 427 There are several types of informal groups:
 Group of interests – created usually to facilitate the achievement of
group goals
 Group of friends – created most frequently to satisfy the social needs
of its members
 Group of support – members are supporting each other to meet
common needs
 Virtual group – it’s the most modern type, facilitated by the computer
and INTERNET connection. This is a group of people who work interdependently
and with shared purpose across space, time, and organization boundaries using
technology to communicate and collaborate. Virtual team members can be located
across a country or across the world, rarely meet face-to-face, and include members
from different cultures (6).
When a group in an organizational context embarks upon a process of selfassessment in order to estimate its own effectiveness and thereby improve
performance, it can be argued that it is engaging in team building process.
The process of team building includes:
• clarifying the goal, and building ownership across the team; and
• identifying the inhibitors to teamwork and removing or overcoming them.
To self-assessment meant that a team is trying to find out both:
• its current strengths as a team;
• its current weakness. Roles within a team
Belbin's book Management Teams (7) presents the conclusions from his work,
studying how the members of teams interacted during business games run at Henley
Management College. One of his key conclusions was that an effective team should
have members that cover nine key roles in managing the team.
Based on Belbin's model of nine team roles, managers of organizations that are
building working teams would be advised to ensure that each of the roles can be
performed by a team member. Some roles are compatible and can be more easily
carried out by the same person; some are less compatible and are more likely to be
done well by people with different skills.
The roles actually represent tasks and functions in the self-management of the
team's activities. Belbin developed a test to identify individual team roles. This test is
presented as Exercise 1, in this way the students can evaluate their own skills in
fulfilling Belbin’s roles.
The nine roles described by Belbin are:
1. Co-coordinator
The Co-coordinator ensures that all members of the team are able to contribute
to discussions and decisions of the team. Their concern is for fairness and equity
among team members. Those who want to make decisions quickly, or unilaterally,
may feel frustrated by their insistence on consulting with all members, but this can
often improve the quality of decisions made by the team. 428 2. Shaper
The shaper is full of drive to make things happen and get things going; a
dynamic team-member who loves a challenge and thrives on pressure. In doing this,
they are quite happy to push their own views forward, do not mind being challenged
and are always ready to challenge others. The shaper looks for the pattern in
discussions and tries to pull things together into something feasible, which the team
can then get to work on. This member possesses the drive and courage required to
overcome obstacles.
3. Plant
This member is the one who is most likely to come out with original ideas and
challenge the traditional way of thinking about things. Sometimes they become so
imaginative and creative that the team cannot see the relevance of what they are
saying. However, without the plant to scatter the seeds of new ideas the team will
often find it difficult to make any progress. The plant’s strength resides in providing
major new insights and ideas for changes in direction and not in contributing to the
detail of what needs to be done. Although they sometimes situate themselves far from
the other team members, they always come back to present their 'brilliant' idea.
4. Resource investigator
The resource investigator is the group member with the strongest contacts and
networks, and is excellent at bringing in information and support from the outside.
Whatever the team needs, the Resource Investigator is likely to have someone in their
address book that can either provide it or know someone else who can provide it. This
member can be very enthusiastic in pursuit of the team’s goals, but cannot always
sustain this enthusiasm. Being highly driven to make connections with people, the
Resource Investigator may appear to be flighty and inconstant, but their ability to call
on their connections is highly useful to the team.
5. Implementer
The individual who is a company worker is well organized and effective at
turning big ideas into manageable tasks and plans that can be achieved. The
Implementer is the practical thinker who can create systems and processes that will
produce what the team wants. Such individuals are both logical and disciplined in
their approach. They are hardworking and methodical but may have some difficulty in
being flexible. Being strongly rooted in the real world, they may frustrate other team
members by their perceived lack of enthusiasm for inspiring visions and radical
thinking, but their ability to turn those radical ideas into workable solutions is
important.
6. Team worker
The team worker is the one who is most aware of the others in the team, their
needs and their concerns. He is concerned to ensure that interpersonal relationships
within the team are maintained. They are sensitive and supportive of other people’s
efforts, and try to promote harmony and reduce conflict. They may be the first to
approach another team member who feels slighted, excluded or otherwise attacked
but has not expressed their discomfort. Team workers are particularly important when
the team is experiencing a stressful or difficult period. The Team Worker's concern
with people factors can frustrate those who are keen to move quickly, but their skills
ensure long-term cohesion within the team.
7. Completer Finisher 429 As the name suggests, the completer finisher is the one who drives the
deadlines and makes sure they are achieved. They usually communicate a sense of
urgency, which push other team members into action. They are conscientious and
effective at checking the details. Completer finisher has a great eye for spotting flaws
and gaps and for knowing exactly where the team is in relation to its schedule. Team
members who have less preference for detail work may be frustrated by their
analytical and meticulous approach, but the work of the Completer Finisher ensures
the quality and timeliness of the output of the team.
8. Monitor evaluator
A sober, a strategic and discerning member, tries to see all options and judge
them accurately. They have a strategic perspective and can judge situations
accurately. The monitor evaluator can be overcritical and is not usually good at
inspiring and encouraging others. However, this member contributes a measured and
dispassionate analysis and, through objectivity, stops the team committing itself to a
misguided task.
9. Specialist
This person provides specialist skills and knowledge and has a dedicated and
single-minded approach. They can adopt a very narrow perspective and sometimes
fail to see the whole picture. Group development process
Many teams go through a life-cycle of stages, firstly identified by Bruce Tuckman in
1965 as: forming, storming, norming and performing. This model has become the
basis for further models of group development, principally adding the 5th phase of
adjourning. Forming
The process of team formation calls for the individuals to come together. During this
phase, group members are exploring new relationships and receiving new
responsibilities. The team meets and learns about the opportunity and challenges, and
then agrees on goals and begins to tackle the tasks. Team members tend to behave
quite independently. They may be motivated but are usually relatively uninformed of
the issues and objectives of the team. Team members are more likely to be
characterized by formality, politeness, silence and tentative interactions. Mature team
members begin to model appropriate behaviour even at this early phase. Sharing the
knowledge of the concept of "Teams - Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing" is
extremely helpful to the team. Supervisors of the team tend to need to be directive
during this phase.
The forming stage is important because in this stage the members get to know
each other and make new friends. This is also a good opportunity to see how each
member of the team works as an individual and how they respond to pressure. Storming
Due to the fact that the group members become more and more comfortable with
the idea of belonging to a certain group, they start to identify their own place within
the group. They want to start influencing the group norms, roles (e.g. leadership)
and procedures. 430 In this stage different ideas compete for consideration. The team addresses
issues such as what problems they are really supposed to solve, how they will
function independently and together and what leadership model they will accept.
Team members open up to each other and confront each other's ideas and
perspectives.
In most of the cases storming can be resolved rather quickly. However, there
are cases when the team never leaves this stage. The wisdom of some team members
usually determines the end of this stage. Immature team members will begin the
“show” to demonstrate how much they know and convince others that their ideas are
the best.
The storming stage is necessary to the growth of the team. It can be
controversial, unpleasant and even painful to members of the team who are against
the conflict. Without tolerance and patience the team will fail. This phase can become
destructive to the team and will lower motivation if allowed to get out of control.
During this phase supervisors of the team may be more accessible, but tend to
still need to be directive in their guidance of decision-making and professional
behaviour. Norming
The group becomes more cohesive during this phase because they begin to
recognize and respect each other contribution. Team members start to adjust their
behaviour to the others as they develop work habits that make teamwork seem more
natural. Team members often work by agreeing on rules, values, professional
behaviour, shared methods and working tools. During this phase, team members
begin to trust each other. Motivation increases as the team gets more acquainted with
the project.
Two categories of norms develop within the team: behavioural and
performance. Behavioural ones establish how a person is expected to act and relate to
the others. These norms are developed by the group in order to allow conflict
resolution, to determine expectations for group-think or to allow divergent thinking
and to identify conformity expectations (e.g. be on time, talk in turn etc.).
Performance norms are those expectations that are requested by the group from each
individual and may include expected contributions to the work. Both types of norms
are set to facilitate group process, problem solving and decision making.
Teams in this phase may lose their creativity if the norming behaviours
become too strong. Supervisors of the team during this phase tend to be participative
more than in the earlier stages. The team members can be expected to take more
responsibility for making decisions and for their professional behaviour. Performing
Once the rules were established and recognized, the group can concentrate on the
tasks. The high-performing teams are able to function as a unit as they find ways to
get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need
for external supervision. Team members have become interdependent. By this time
they are motivated and knowledgeable. The team members are now competent,
autonomous and able to handle the decision-making process without supervision. The 431 focus of the group should be now on results rather than on process, even if work plan
revisions might be necessary.
Supervisors of the team during this phase are almost always participative. The
team will make most of the necessary decisions. Nevertheless, a change in leadership
may cause the team to revert to storming as the new people challenge the existing
norms and dynamics of the team. Adjourning
Once the task(s) for which the group was formed is accomplished, the group can
adjourn. It is important to arrange during this phase a formal recognition of the task
completed. This might motivate people to embark other tasks and/or groups. Advantages versus disadvantages of the teamworking
If there are many advantages of the teamworking, there are also disadvantages that
should be considered by a manager when building a team.
Generally, a team can better find the best solutions for a complex task than
an individual or even a small group of people. Grouping the individual judgments
increases the chance of success in solving a problem due to a higher degree of
objectivity and to elimination of individual errors.
A definite benefit of working in teams is the positive synergy, meaning that
the results achieved by the team are better than the sum of individual results.
However, there are also obstacles that might be encountered during the
process of teamworking. Some of the most common are: different organizational
practice (when members are coming from different organizations); socio-economic
inequalities between the members (age, gender, statute), team objective unclear
stated, etc.
The literature is describing the main dysfunctions of a team (9):
1. Absence of Trust
This dysfunction stems from teams unwillingness to be vulnerable. Team members
who are not genuinely open with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses
make it impossible to build a foundation for trust.
2. Fear of Conflict
This failure to build trust is dangerous because it sets a brick for the second
dysfunction: fear of conflict. Teams that lack trust are not able to engage in vivid
debate of ideas. Instead, they resort to roundabout discussions and guarded comments.
3. Lack of Commitment
A lack of healthy conflict might be a problem because it induces the third dysfunction
of a team: lack of commitment. Without having expressed their opinions in the course
of passionate and open debate, team members rarely, if ever, commit to decisions,
though they may simulate agreement during meetings. Avoidance of Accountability
Because of this lack of real commitment, team members develop an avoidance of
accountability, the fourth dysfunction. Without committing to a clear plan of action, 432 even the most focused and driven people often hesitate to call their peers on actions
and behaviours that seem counterproductive to the good of the team. Inattention to Results
Failure to hold one another accountable creates an environment where the fifth
dysfunction can thrive. Inattention results occurs when team members put their
individual needs (such as ego, career development, or recognition) or even the needs
of their divisions above the collective goals of the team.
There are several factors that can influence the effectiveness of a team.
Among them, some are worthy to be mentioned:
− Organizational environment – may shape the way of interacting both
between team members themselves and between the team and the rest of the
organization;
− The nature of the task – may influence the way of action, as well as the focus
of team efforts. The more complex the task is, the interactions with external
environment are more intense and focused;
− Team size – there is not a magic number for a team to be effective. It was
noticed that increasing the number of members may lead in the first stage to
a higher performance. Nevertheless, a continuous increasing of the number
of members may lead to the limitation of the team performance or even to a
decreased performance. Examples of successful teams
Sports offer some of the best examples of teamwork. For example a football running
back and quarterback’s ability are totally dependent on the strength of their offensive
line. A basketball player’s ability in scoring is mainly dependent on his team’s
willingness to pass.
Students that succeed in group efforts understand that they must do team
projects rather than group projects. There are subtle but very important differences
between group and team projects. A team project is when members of the teamwork
work interdependently towards the same goal. It is also a team project, when every
member in the group feels a sense of ownership of their role. In a group project,
members work independently and are often not working towards the same goal. The
members in the group also focus a lot on themselves because they are not involved in
the planning of their goals.
Teamwork has also become increasingly acknowledged as an essential skill for
employees in companies either small or large. Nowadays increasingly global
economy places a premium on teamwork in the work setting. Teamwork has become
so valued that many large corporations have developed specific tests to measure
potential employees’ teamwork abilities. Many companies are even acknowledging
this in their job titles by changing the designation of supervisors or managers to “team
leader.” 433 EXERCISE
Task 1
Distribute Belbin questionnaire together with the instructions sheet to the students
for the self-assessment of the roles they may have in a team. Instruction sheet: How to fill-in the questionnaire
1. The purpose of this questionnaire is to assist you in analyzing the role you
may play when you work in a team. Be honest with yourself! Without
spending too much time on the task, mark the answers to that situation which
are true for you at present.
2. Seven situations appear below: sections A-G. After each of them, eight
answers are given. You are asked to tick the answer(s) that better describe your
behaviour under the circumstances provided at the beginning of the section.
You can tick maximum 3 answers in each section (you can tick only one if this
one is the only one describing your behaviour). Repeat this step for each of the
seven sections A-G.
3. Come back to section A, and evaluate the relative importance (weight) of each
of the ticked answers. You should distribute 10 points (no more than 10!) for
the answers that you ticked in a section.
4. For example, if you have ticked answers 1, 7 and 8 in section A, but you
consider that answer 1 is your predominant behaviour you can give 5 points for
answer 1, another 2 points for answer 7 and finally 3 points for answer 8 (in
total: 10 points). If you have ticked only one answer in a section, it
automatically receives 10 points.
5. Allocate 10 points for each of the seven sections A-G.
6. When you finished step 4, go to the page containing a summary table.
7. Transfer all the points you allocated under each section in the summary
table. Identify your points in the summary table, item by item. The first row
is dedicated for section A: considering the example above, you should write
5 in the cell 1___, then 2 in the cell 7___ and 3 in the cell 8____. In this step
don’t pay attention to the abbreviations from each column. Each line should
have a total of 10.
8. After completing step 6, make the total for each of the columns. The highest
score in the columns represents the role that better describes your behaviour
in a team. Belbin questionnaire

after 1 year when they can be involved in another group or project. Results may be
different. Task 2: Group Survival Scenario Exercise “Lost at Sea”
With your private yacht slowly sinking after a fire of unknown origin, you are adrift
in the South Pacific, “Lost at Sea,” approximately 1000 miles south-southwest from
the nearest land. You have a serviceable rubber life raft with oars large enough for
yourself and crew. You and crew together have 1 package of cigarettes, several books
of matches and 5 one dollar bills. You all also have 15 additional items. The exercise
problem to be solved is to rank these 15 additional items by considering their survival
value.
Survival items to be ranked:
1. a sextant
2. a shaving mirror
3. a quantity of mosquito netting
4. a 5 gallon can of water
5. a case of army rations
6. maps of the Pacific Ocean
7. a floating seat cushion
8. a 2 gallon can of oil/petrol mixture
9. a small transistor radio
10. 20 square feet of Opaque plastic sheeting
11. shark repellent
12. one quart of 160 per cent proof rum
13. 15ft nylon rope
14. 2 boxes of chocolate bars
15. a fishing kit
Student’s tasks:
The class of students should be divided into groups of 4 and then given 10 minutes to
individually score the items.
After this time, the team members should discuss and decide on the team’s
priority list. A maximum of 20 minutes should be allocated for the section.
When the second phase is complete a pre-prepared answer sheet should be revealed
and they should score their individual and teams answers.
A discussion should then take place where individuals should compare their
individual score against the team looking at why the scores are different; what
changed their minds, how where they influenced etc.
Then, the score of experts should be exposed and see if individual scores were
closer to the experts opinion or the team scores were better.
The list of priority items given by the experts was the following:
− According to the experts (US Coastguard), the basic supplies needed when a
person is stranded mid-ocean are articles to attract attention and articles to aid
survival until rescue arrives. Articles for navigation are of little importance
since even if a small life raft were capable of reaching land, it would be 437 impossible to store enough food and water to survive for the requisite amount
of time.
− Without signalling devices, there is almost no chance of being spotted and
ultimately rescued. Furthermore, most rescues occur within the first 36 hours
and a person can survive with only a minimum of food and water during that
period.
The following table is the order of ranking the items in their importance to
your survival:

AND PERSPECTIVE
Marija Zaletel THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Good health is a fundamental resource for social and economic development.
Higher levels of human development mean that people live longer and enjoy more
healthy years of life.
While the health of the 879 million people in the European Region
(Region) of the World Health Organization (WHO) has in general improved over
time, inequalities between the 52 Member States in this region, and between
groups within countries, have widened. In addition to the east–west gap in health,
differences in health between socioeconomic groups have increased in many
countries (1).
The global burden of disease is shifting from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Over the next 20 years, global deaths
from cancer, heart disease and traffic crashes will increase as low and middleincome economies grow, according to the new WHO "World Health Statistics
2008" (2).
Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory
diseases and diabetes, are by far the leading cause of mortality in the world,
representing 60% of all deaths. Out of the 35 million people who died from
chronic disease in 2005, half were under 70 and half were women (3).
Nurses and midwives constitute the majority of the health care workforce
in most countries of WHO's European Region, and make a significant
contribution to health care in a wide range of settings in hospitals and within the
primary health care field. Nurses and midwives have made some – albeit limited –
progress in influencing national health policies or in achieving real recognition as
members of the health care team. It is timely to reflect on past achievements and
to develop strategies to ensure that nurses and midwives in the future will be in
the positions that enable them to influence health care policy and delivery
throughout the Region (4).
There is a question how to motivate nurses, midwives and nursing students
to accept the growth of the Public Health, Health Promotion, the Principles of the
Health for all and to recognize that health for all and health promotion is
something essential for nurses.
There are some useful documents such as The Vienna Declaration and
some others that can help to convince them that nurses should play a key role in
achieving health for all.
The targets Health for all give framework in which nurses can achieve their
traditional aims in new, more independent ways, in close collaboration with other
health professionals, their clients and communities (5). 443 Be more freely and more independent, be the part of the successful team
are the wishes of everyone so they could be motivators to accept new knowledge
and challenges to become a good health promoter. Historical background of “Health for All” strategy
In 1978, in Alma Ata was a Conference on Primary Health Care. WHO Member
States had advocated the development of Primary Health Care as the key strategy for
the attainment of health for all.
Primary health care (PHC) is the first level of contact with the national health
system for individuals, families and the community, bringing health care as close as
possible to where people live and work (14).
PHC includes all services that play a part in health, such as income, housing,
education, and environment. It also includes primary care, i.e. the diagnosis and
treatment of illness and injury. And it includes the critical elements of health
promotion and prevention of illness and injury. One of its greatest strengths is citizen
participation in needs identification and service delivery and in bringing these
services as close to people as possible (14).
The Conference in Alma Ata strongly reaffirms that health, which is a state of
complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease
or infirmity, is a fundamental human right and that the attainment of the highest
possible level of health is a most important world-wide social goal whose realisation
requires the action of many other social and economic sectors in addition to the health
sector.
For health professionals it is important that PHC relies, at local and referral
levels, on health workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and
community, workers as applicable, suitably trained socially and technically to work as
a health team and to respond to the expressed health needs of the community (6). Strategy “Health for All” and important documents
concerning nursing
“Health for All 2000”
Thirty-two Member States of the WHO European Region created in 1984 when they
adopted the first set of European targets for health, an unprecedented act of solidarity
and unity in the health field. The policy's broad health agenda covers lifestyles, the
environment and health services, addressing all levels of society and reaching out all
partners and sectors that can influence health. It offers not only a vision of where to
go for better health and quality of life but also a map showing how to get there. The
health policy brought a new philosophy to the health development process in the
countries of the Region (7).
The strategy focused on four areas of concern:
• lifestyles and health
• risk factors affecting health and the environment
• the reorientation of the health care system
• the mobilization of political, managerial and technological support to bring
about these changes (7). 444 Health for all 2000 includes 38 targets, organized in three groups.
• The first 12 targets fall into three categories: the basic health for all goals, the
health of vulnerable populations and specific health problems.
• Targets 13 to 31 address the changes in lifestyles, the improvements in the
environment, and the developments in prevention, treatment and care that will
make their achievement possible.
• Targets 33 – 38 address the basic needs that must be met to sound health for all
development: the development of knowledge and information support for
policy and action; the creation of the requisite managerial infrastructures; the
development of human resources for health; the mobilization of resources for
health; the mobilization of resources and broad social support; and the
advocacy and practice of ethical values (7). “Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion”
The first International Conference on Health promotion in 1986 in Ottawa gave to
world Ottawa charter for Health Promotion, which was adopted as a consensus
statement. It set a new direction for health promotion action. The Ottawa charter
outlines the five overlapping and interactive means of action that constitute a
comprehensive strategy for health promotion: building healthy public policy, creating
supportive environments, strengthening community action, developing personal skills
and reorienting health services (8). “Vienna Declaration”
In Vienna was in 1988 the first WHO European Conference on nursing. There were
represented all Member States of the European region.
The Vienna recommendations underline the importance of primary health care,
and urge that nursing practice has to be based on the principles underpinning health
for all. The recommendations suggest that nursing practice should focus on:
• promoting and maintaining health, and preventing disease;
• involving individuals, families and communities in care and making it possible
for them to take more responsibility for their health;
• working actively to reduce inequities in access to health care services and to
satisfy the needs of whole populations, especially the underserved;
• extending cooperation between disciplines and sectors of society; and
• ensuring the quality of care and appropriate use of technology (9).
The Vienna Declaration highlights the importance of promoting the active
involvement of the community in setting health goals. The focus is shifting away
from treating individuals towards building relationships with families and
communities, and this is reflected in the targets for health for all. The targets give
framework in which nurses can achieve their traditional aims in new, more
independent ways, in close collaboration with other health professionals, their clients
and communities (5). “Nursing in Europe”
445 In 1995 was the meeting of WHO Expert Committee on Nursing Practice. It stressed
that the activities undertaken by nurses in all cultures and societies according to the
six categories (9).
1. Managing physical and mental health illness status.
2. Monitoring and ensuring the quality of health care practices.
Monitoring and ensuring the quality of health care practices involve such
responsibilities as self-monitoring, monitoring the effects of interventions,
supervising the work of less skilled personal and consulting with others as
appropriate.
3. Organizing and managing the health care system.
This category includes setting priorities with individuals and communities to
ensure that multiple needs are met, obtaining specialist services as necessary,
coping with staff shortages and maintaining a therapeutic team. It also involves
promoting intersectoral work in settings (community clinics, schools).
4. Caring and helping.
Caring and helping involve establishing a climate for healing. Nurses provide
comfort to people in distress, support in managing symptoms and help in
ensuring the maximum participation of individuals, families and communities
in health care planning, treatment and care giving.
5. Teaching about health
Teaching about health is an important function of nursing. Nurses should teach
self-care, and guide people in caring for their family members.
6. Nurses must be able to deal with emergencies and crises through the
appropriate allocation of resources to meet rapidly changing demands.
The key concept for the future development of nursing is the need to create a
nursing role that is appropriate to people's health needs, rather the needs of the health
system (10). “Health 21” The new strategy, Health 21 – health for all in the 21st century, was accepted in 1998.
It has the following main elements:
1. The constant goal is to achieve full health potential for all. There are two main
aims:
• to promote and protect people's health throughout their lives and
• to reduce the incidence of the main diseases and injuries, and alleviate
the suffering they cause;
2. Three basic values form the ethical foundation of Health 21:
• health as a fundamental human right,
• equity in health and solidarity between and within all countries and
their inhabitants, and
• participation and accountability of individuals, groups, institutions and
communities for continued health development.
3. Four main strategies for action have been chosen to ensure that scientific,
economic, social and political sustainability drive the implementation of Health
21 (multisectoral strategies; health-outcome-driven programmes and investments
for health development and clinical care; integrated family– and community- 446 oriented primary health care, supported by a flexible and responsive hospital
system; and a participatory health development process) (11).
Since the first WHO ministerial conference, held in Vienna over ten years
before, little progress had been made towards enabling nurses and midwives to
contribute more forcefully to meeting people's needs for health care and public
health (13). “Munich Declaration”
The second WHO Ministerial Conference on Nursing and Midwifery was held in
Munich in June 2000. There was universal agreement on the need for strengthening
nursing and midwifery at all levels of policy development and implementation, and a
Declaration was drafted.
The Munich declaration on Nursing and Midwifery: a Force for Health
underlines the key and increasingly important roles of nurses and midwives; urges all
relevant authorities to step up actions to strengthen nursing and midwifery; and urges
acceptance of the need for supportive steps such as workforce planning, legislative
frameworks and development of professional practice (13). Other important events and documents
The 61st World Health Assembly set WHO on a course to tackle longstanding, new
and looming threats to global public health. Among its achievements, the Health
Assembly endorsed a six-year action plan to tackle what are the leading threats to
human health: non-communicable diseases. Delegates also requested WHO - through
a resolution - to intensify its work to curb harmful use of alcohol, which is the fifth
leading risk factor for death and disability in the world (2).
In 2008 WHO marks 60 years of service to humanity and 60 years of
affiliation with ICN (International Council of Nursing). It also marks 30 years since
the goal of universal access to health services through primary health care was
enshrined by WHO and member states in the Declaration of Alma Ata, which
highlighted the “gross inequality in the health status of the people particularly
between developed and developing countries as well as within countries,” To address
this, WHO focused on PHC as the key to attaining the goals of its 1977 strategy
Health for All by the Year 2000.
In 2008 primary health care is again high on the global health agenda. ICN is
celebrating nursing’s leadership and advocating for greater nursing involvement in
PHC, the key strategy to achieving universal access and better health for the world’s
people (14). “Health for All” strategy and nursing role today
Today a number of key forces - poverty, increased globalization, climate change,
political unrest - affect health and contribute to challenges in service planning and
delivery. These challenges shape the environments in which nurses are delivering
PHC and include:
• the rising costs of health care;
• increasing consumer expectations and demands;
• changing demographics and ageing populations; 447 •
•
•
•
•
•
• nursing and other health worker shortages;
legislation and/or political will to fully utilise nursing’s potential;
social conflict and unrest which destabilise services and constrain resources;
natural and manmade disasters;
endemic and pandemic disease, as well as new and re-emerging ones;
the surge in chronic diseases;
making the shift to community based care (14). Nursing practice is the very essence of primary health care. Their education,
experience and the settings where they work make it so. Nurses deliver services
wherever people are found: in homes, schools, workplaces, prisons, health and
wellness clinics, and other community settings, as well as in hospitals and research
centres. In virtually all countries, nurses constitute the largest health care provider
group. Nurses are also critical to the training and supervision of other personnel, and
to the planning, organisation, monitoring and evaluation of PHC services (14). Conclusion
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to
improve their health.
Health promotion strategies are not limited to a specific health problem, nor to
a specific set of behaviours. WHO as a whole applies the principles of, and strategies
for, health promotion to a variety of population groups, risk factors, diseases, and in
various settings. Health promotion and the associated efforts put into education,
community development, policy, legislation and regulation, are equally valid for
prevention of communicable diseases, injury and violence, and mental problems, as
they are for prevention of non communicable diseases (1).
While health promotion is basically activity in the health and social fields, and
not a medical service, health professionals – particularly in primary health care – have
an important role in nurturing and enabling health promotion (12).
Are the health professionals able to promote health? Do they have knowledge
and skills? Are they motivated to do health education and to advocate the promotion
of health?
And what about nurses? Are they educated enough to be equal to other health
professionals on this field?
Nurses are the principal group of health personnel providing PHC. They foster
and maintain links between individuals, families, communities and the rest of the
health care system, working both autonomously and collaboratively to prevent disease
and disability, and to promote, improve, maintain and restore health. Their work
encompasses population health, health promotion, disease prevention, wellness care,
first point of contact care and disease management across the lifespan (14).
WHO and some nursing organizations have produced statements that describe
a vision for nursing - an ideal picture of how it should be. For example, that WHO
Director - General (9) has provided a view of the role of nurses »not just as active
providers of care, meeting the professionally defined needs of passive patients, but as
facilitators who help people to take charge of their own health«. 448 This topic is an attempt to give nurses, and other health professionals,
information and new knowledge, and to motivate and prepare them to accept the new
role with all challenges. EXERCISES

After completing this module students should:
•
know the definition and characteristics of the quality of nursing,
standards and criteria, clinical pathways
•
be familiar with quality, quality in healthcare, quality in nursing,
quality assurance,
•
be familiar with quality assurance according to the Norma Lang
model, and standards and criteria in nursing.
•
know how to design nursing standard and clinical pathway.
The word quality is used every day everywhere in our lives and also in
health care professionals work field. There are very general definitions
which state that quality is a characteristic of things and phenomena and
also more precise general and narrow professional definitions.
With regard to nursing quality many authors cite Donabedian, who
asserts that quality is the harmony between actual nursing and the
criteria prescribed beforehand.
The quality of nursing is the level of excellence.
Quality assurance is merely a process that incorporates the
systematic description, measurement, evaluation and, when necessary,
implementation of measures to improve quality.
Every organization that assumes responsibility for monitoring and
promoting the quality of its work chooses a quality assurance
programme.
It is not possible to measure quality of care unless it has been
accurately described in measurable terms. One of the ways to do this is
by setting standards and clinical pathways.
An introductory lecture gives the students first insight in the quality in
nursing and health care. The theoretical knowledge is illustrated by a
case study.
After introductory lectures students first carefully read the
recommended readings. Afterwards they discuss the importance of
thinking and doing in excellent way.
In continuation, they need to find published materials (e.g. papers)
on quality in nursing and health care, and present their findings to other
students.
Finally they need to prepare nursing standard and clinical pathway
on their choice. Address for

Marija Zaletel THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
About quality
Definition and description
The word quality is used every day everywhere in our lives and also in our field of
work.
The concept of quality is always expressed subjectively. We must accept the
fact that someone is very satisfied with an individual product or service performed,
while at the same time someone else may be very dissatisfied. Judging quality
depends on an individual's knowledge and awareness, experiences, expectations and
recognisable standards of quality (1).
More and more nurses in their work with patients often ask whether they are
doing enough for them or performing quality nursing. Several find a positive response
quite fast.
Yet such a flat and subjective evaluation is insufficient. If nurses want to
perform their work truly in a professional manner, they must keep raising this
question again and again in an endeavour to continually improve the quality of their
work and thus contribute to the best of their ability to preserving and improving the
health of their patients. What is required is also a more professional and organised
approach.
Quality is attributed to material production, people and characteristics. The
quality of a product or service can be defined as the relative perfection of all the
components of the product or service features with respect to meeting the
requirements and justified expectations of buyers or users who use a product during
its respective life span. From this definition we can see that those who offer a product
or service do not have the final word concerning quality; the buyer or user of the
product or service is the final judge on its quality (1).
While assuring quality of the products' material production and quality of
service which originates from service activities (to which health also belongs), certain
laws apply to determine the quality of the latter:
• the service activity does not produce tangible products;
• the service cannot be made for stockpiling;
• the service user is usually present in the process of performing services, which
is a further aspect from the standpoint of quality;
• in performing a service punctuality, speed and correct procedure is even more
important;
• the client's wishes and his standards of quality are harder to specify than in
material production. The user's standards with regard to the quality of services
performed are a reflection of the individual's personal criteria (1).
Performing a service more or less always includes the behaviour of the person who
performs the service and person who uses the service. For different services the length 453 of time when the user and service provider are in contact varies greatly.
To assess the quality of work many possibilities are available to nurses.
Frequently the satisfaction of patients is mentioned as a standard to determine the
quality of nursing. Although at times the patient and nurse are in touch for a very
short time, the service user or patient quickly forms his or her opinion on the quality
of the service performed.
People are dissatisfied with the treatment of the nurse not only because of a
lack of professionalism (of which they are simply incapable of assessing), but also
because of the attitude and attention which she devotes to an individual patient (1).
The patient evaluates quality primarily according to how the service providers
treat him, what attitude they had to him, how much they fulfilled his expectations, or
whether the service providers are worthy of trust or he could receive the care he
required (2). Quality in nursing
Quality is very hard to define (3), which is why we find very general definitions
which state that quality is a characteristic of things and phenomena (irrespective of
quantity), and also more precise general and narrow professional definitions.
The dictionary of the Slovene written language defines quality as something
that describes things with regard to a large degree of positive characteristics.
With respect to quality in healthcare, Ovretveit (4) created the definition of
quality that states that the quality of health activities is the complete satisfaction of the
needs of those who are in most need of health services, for the lowest organisational
costs, within the given limit and guidelines of higher administrative bodies and those
paying. It also mentions the components of quality healthcare:
• a high level of professionalism,
• efficient use of resources (human, financial and material),
• the lowest possible risk for the patient,
• patient satisfaction, and
• a (positive) influence on his state of health.
The quality of healthcare attains these demands and, in accordance with existing
knowledge, meets the expectations of the greatest possible utilization with the least
possible risk to the patient's health and well-being (5).
With regard to nursing quality, many authors (3,6,7) cite Donabedian (1970),
who asserts that quality is the harmony between actual nursing and the criteria
prescribed beforehand.
The Dictionary of the Slovene Written Language defines criteria as "something
that serves as the basis for evaluating, comparing and judging - a standard (12).
Kitson and Gienbing (3) quote William's (1974) definition of quality: "Quality
with efficient nursing improves the state of health and satisfaction of inhabitants
within the resources that society and individuals are prepared to spend on nursing."
The quality of nursing is the level of excellence achieved (6).
The quality of nursing can be seen in three dimensions:
• the quality of working methodology and technology which are labelled with:
efficiency, professionalism, expertise, safety, care and suitability;
• the quality of employees - mutual relations: professionalism that is revealed in 454 the abilities of employees to respect the patient's personality, trust,
independence and equal status, passing on appropriate information; and
• the quality of organisation which is labelled with: safety, comfort, continuity,
efficiency and the level of equipment (3).
Nursing quality takes into account three fundamental dimensions: the profession,
management and users of health services who should be mutually co-dependent. In
doing so, they establish patient satisfaction as a prime indicator of quality (8).
Research performed till now in Slovenia was focused chiefly on measuring
quality of the medical professions; less on measuring the quality of nursing, the work
of nurses and developing a method to measure patient satisfaction. To master these
changes in healthcare in the modern way, of exceptional importance is an orientation
towards the person, efficient use of human resources, motivation and the development
of values for quality with modern leadership and efficient measurement of the work
results (performance) from the aspect of nursing in all healthcare systems (9). Assuring and improving nursing quality
Quality assurance is merely a process that incorporates the systematic description,
measurement, evaluation and, when necessary, implementation of measures to
improve quality. This means the systematic and planned implementation of measures
in order to achieve the prescribed requirements for quality (10).
A distinction must be made from among three concepts: quality assessment,
quality assurance, and quality improvement.
1. Quality assessment.
Quality assessment is a process which, by employing comparative methods
and selected criteria, we can use to compare healthcare services among
themselves that have been performed and agreed upon. In nursing this means a
comparison between the nursing services actually offered and selected and
established criteria and standards. Not until quality has been assessed can a
system of quality assurance be formed, which assists in improving and
attaining the desired goals (1).
2. Quality assurance.
Quality assurance is not a unique, final action, but a lasting process that
demands a constant improvement of the features of products and services (1).
3. Quality improvement.
Quality improvement is a process that follows the phases of quality assessment
and quality assurance, removes discovered obstacles or problems and raises
quality to a higher level (1).
Improving quality is a dynamic process with the following principles:
• discovering and using the best results to achieve excellence,
• explicitly defining the goals of quality,
• supervision within the profession,
• a benevolent leadership, and
• the inclusion of patients.
Every organisation that assumes responsibility for monitoring and promoting the quality 455 of its work chooses a quality assurance programme. In doing so, it is necessary to make
a radical change from determining or assessing quality to assuring it. The goal of quality assurance in nursing
Once we choose a quality assurance programme, we are endeavouring to achieve the
best efficiency and best results with a rational use of available resources. In doing so,
we seek to achieve the following goals:
• improve and maintain the patient's state of health;
• improve and maintain the patient's functional abilities;
• develop the patient's psychophysical condition or well-being; and
• gain the patient's satisfaction after nursing has been performed.
We see the person or patient as a whole (holistically) which is why these goals must
accompany all of the activities that we perform to the benefit of our users. Among the
activities of a nurse one could mention setting standards and criteria of quality in
nursing (3).
Among the most important conditions for quality nursing is taking into
consideration and developing elements of modern nursing.
For quality assurance in nursing one can use external and internal methods.
The basic difference is that in the case of external quality assurance the
assurance comes from outside (from external professionals and institutions). Quality
assurance within health institutions is the task of those who perform nursing, which
they plan and implement independently and for which they are also responsible (11).
Internal quality assurance of nursing can be performed, whether centralised or
decentralised.
The characteristics of central quality assurance are:
• the precise analysis of all nursing activities;
• use of instruments that are scientifically based and practical for nursing;
• quality assurance executed by a group of experts trained for that purpose; and
• nursing teams that perform nursing have no insight into it.
The characteristics of decentralised quality assurance are the following:
• observation of the nursing performed;
• the instrument of observation is not firmly specified, being selected with
regard to which nursing emergency is observed;
• it is performed at the level of the hospital unit - department;
• it is performed by members of the nursing team who work in the unit; and
• members of the nursing team have a direct insight into nursing quality
assurance (11).
According to Ishikawa (1987) the quality assurance programme includes the
following sequential phases (3):
• planning (goals and methods to achieve them)
• performing (education and improvement)
• verifying (determining mistakes and their causes)
• taking measures and removing mistakes. 456 Quality assurance in nursing according to the Norma Lang model
In literature one can trace many models to evaluate the quality of nursing. Most
models use as their basis Norma Lang's model from 1976, which has seven levels.
World-wide many model modifications have originated, e.g. the model of the
American Nurses’ Association, which has eight levels, or the Royal Australian
Nursing Federation with eleven models.
The Norma Lang model has seven levels that run through three phases

T Possible Routes of

Practice Analysis of
Results Figure 1. The Norma Lang model of quality assurance 1. Description.
In the first phase - Description - we identify the values and attitudes that lead
us to nursing. Then we select criteria for excellent nursing in standards
covering the structure, process and outcome.
2. Measurement.
In the second phase - Measurement - we choose the methodology that is used
to determine what our practice is like in comparison with standards and criteria
of excellent (very good) nursing, which we have set internally or were set
externally. The results obtained are analysed and then we decide if and why we
need changes. The authoress of this model recommends the inclusion of socalled SWOT factors (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats - or
hazards and traps) in the analysis.
3. Action.
In the third phase - Action - we choose the changes and paths along which the 457 changes will run in our environment and finally introduce the changes in our
routine work (3).
The circle then runs further through all phases because quality assurance is a
continuous process.
The first step in this circle of introducing changes is made when nurses decide
to inscribe the philosophy of nursing (departments, clinics and hospitals). In order to
be successful in doing so, they must speak about personal values, common values, the
basic values of our profession, attitudes in connection with nursing patients, ethical
issues, the holistic and the individual approach to the patient, uniqueness and
singularity of the individual, and basic human rights. These views and attitudes can be
written in brief.
The next action is to define the purpose - what we are seeking to achieve with
quality assurance in nursing.
In order to assess quality, we must be able to describe and present what we are
doing. To this standards and criteria have to be produced.
To measure or assess quality, besides SWOT analyses we can use many other
tools or methods that can be found in literature. Here we perform a comparison
between "what is done" with "what must be done". We determine what needs to be
done (changed) in order to achieve what is desired and introduce certain changes.
Once we find a low level of quality - maybe standards are not observed or are
unsuitable - then we plan specific activities to alter practice, and the circle begins
again. Nursing standards
Standards are important elements of quality assurance and at the same time elements
of contemporary nursing.
According to Donabedian (3) standards are professionally designed specific
quantitative requirements that define something "good".
With respect to nursing standards in the nursing profession itself, one often
uses Elizabeth Mason's definition (15) which states that a nursing standard is a valid
definition of nursing quality and includes criteria which can be used to assess
efficiency (3).
Quality is assured only by those standards that are valid. A standard is invalid
if it does not contain criteria to assess nursing.
The definition of criteria can be taken from the Dictionary of the Slovene
Written Language (1994) as something that serves as the basis for evaluation,
comparison or judgement - a standard.
Standards are established at the level of:
• the profession - these are general standards vital for the nursing profession in
the broadest sense;
• field of work (hospital, homes for the elderly, health centre); and
• specialist - local level (clinic, hospital wing, health centre service). Aim and applicability of standards
Nursing standards specify nursing practice and represent the content of excellent 458 (very good) nursing. They show what kind of resources are necessary (structure),
what should be done (procedure), and what benefits the patient has (result) from good
nursing.
The purpose of standardisation in nursing is:
• to provide a standard term of the profession in an institution in the broader
social environment,
• assistance in evaluating nursing,
• higher quality of nursing,
• a standard basis for teaching and practical work with pupils and students,
• aid in planning, implementing and evaluating nursing and seeking
improvements,
• assist in determining staffing requirements, work allocation and raise job
satisfaction, and
• give an insight into the process, quality and results of nursing (13). Characteristics of standards
These must reflect the aspects of modern nursing, the latest research findings
supported by practical experience, professional training and powers and
responsibilities of members of the nursing team. At the same time they must express
the specific nature of an individual field of nursing. Standards also define the
conditions to perform nursing and the anticipated results (11).
Standards contain criteria that permit us to evaluate them. The criteria must be
measurable, specific, comparable, comprehensible, clear and up-to-date.
Standards of the structure refer to circumstances in which nursing is to be
performed. This is revealed in organisation, education and the qualification structure,
aids and equipment. These are sources (input) to perform good (excellent) nursing.
Standards of the process define the quality of performing nursing. We specify
WHAT has to be done for the good of the patient, and WHEN and HOW OFTEN
with the aim of achieving the greatest impact on changing or maintaining the patient's
state of health, functional abilities and psychophysical condition. In this process
sources are used for the purpose of achieving the best effects - excellent nursing.
Within process standards we can form content standard (3) for health education and
therapeutic communication. We specify WHAT to teach or WHAT to advice.
Standards of the outcome define the anticipated changes in the patient and his
environment after performing nursing.
The quality of nursing is seen both in the positive results and in the absence of
possible negative results.
In the outcome we see the actual achievements (output). Types of standards
Standards are classified in four groups, being structure standards, process standards,
outcome standards, and content standards.
1. Structure standards.
• Structure standards answer a questions;
• WHERE it will be done
• WITH WHAT materials and aids
• WHICH organisational model is the most suitable 459 2. Process standards.
Process standards answer questions:
• WHAT will be done (which action or intervention)
• WHEN and
• HOW OFTEN it is necessary to perform an individual action or
intervention
3. Outcome standards
Outcome standards answer questions:
• WHAT KIND OF RESULT to expect as the achievement of the nursing
performed
• WHEN we can expect the result
• HOW this result is recognised
4. Content standards
Content standard answer a question:
• WHAT will be taught.
The answers to these questions give the CRITERIA of structure, process and result
standards. Levels of quality in nursing care
Standards are means for quality assurance in nursing. Despite the standards already
made, in every case of nursing they have not been produced to the highest level of
quality. We are familiar with the three-tier system of quality in nursing:
1. Level 1: ACCEPTABLE NURSING - MINIMUM standards
All patients are cared for according to a routine plan.
2. Level 2: COMPARATIVELY GOOD - OPTIMUM standards
Nursing is planned but the patient is not directly involved in planning and
assessment.
3. Level 3 - EXCELLENT - VERY GOOD NURSING - MAXIMUM standards
Nursing is planned and assessed together with the patient and his relatives. The
patient is an equal partner in the nursing process.
Nursing that cannot be placed at any level is unacceptable - poor nursing - level 0 (3). Characteristics of good standards
The features that are characteristic for good standards are shown with the aid of the
acronym RUMBA, which means:
• R - RELEVANT - real and appropriate with regard to:
− universal standards,
− the unit which is being standardised,
− intervention which is being standardised,
− the group of patients, and
− abilities and responsibilities of the nurse.
• U - UNDERSTANDABLE for:
− nurses who perform and evaluate nursing, and
− students and pupils. 460 • M - MEASURABLE - which is achieved by designing clear criteria in:
− structures,
− a procedure oriented to the nurse, and
− the result oriented to the patient.
• B - BEHAVIOURAL - objective:
− which must be designed on objective and scientific bases.
• A - ATTAINABLE - achievable and feasible with regard to:
− the group of patients for whom the standard is intended,
− capacity of the department, clinic and profession in the country, and
− abilities of the performers and assessors (14). CASE STUDY: QUALITY STANDARDS IN NURSING CARE

Olga Šušteršič THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Healthcare comprises measures and activities that are performed according to medical
doctrine and employing medical technology by medical staff and colleagues in
protecting health, preventing disease, discovering diseases and curing/healing
diseased and injured people. This is performed at the primary, secondary and tertiary
level.
Primary healthcare is the comprehensive action of all elements of the
community for the health of its inhabitants. The common goal of all these endeavours
is to achieve a level of health of people that would permit them to live a socially and
economically productive life.
Even in the transition to a new millennium health remains the highest value
and is an important factor in the strategy of the World Health Organisation's "Health
21", the health for all for the 21st century for the European region strategy (1). In
realising this new strategy for Europe, nursing staff play an important role,
predominantly in the field of primary healthcare. An integral part of this involves
basic health activities where, besides other tasks prescribed by legislation governing
these, they perform nursing care and health education in healthcare services for
individual groups of inhabitants as well as community visits, nursing care, and the
treatment and rehabilitation of patients at home. Nursing care
Nursing care is a fundamental component of healthcare as a comprehensive system. It
is a professional discipline that is enhanced by other health disciplines. It can be
broadly defined as care for the health of the whole population; an activity whose task
is to assist the individual, family and community in all states of health and disease.
The nurse assists both, healthy and diseased people in those tasks that
contribute to preserving and returning health, or a peaceful death, and perform them
independently, if they have the will, strength and knowledge to do so. In this field the
nurse is an expert and has the right to take the initiative and gain supervision. The
nurse takes part in implementing the plan involving diagnosis and therapy initiated by
the physician. She is a member of a broader health team in which she collaborates in
planning and implementing the whole healthcare process. Nursing care definition
According to the definition of the World Health Organisation, nursing care is a
comprehensive activity that is involved with the individual, family and social
community and with their extensive functions in a time of health and sickness (2,3). 466 Nursing care goal and mission
The goal of nursing care is to enable the patient to be independent if he or she has the
necessary strength, will and knowledge for this. Its tasks must be set so that the
patient is given back independence in the shortest possible time.
The mission of nursing care is defined as assistance for the individual,
family and group in order to fulfil their physical, mental, psychological, spiritual
and social potential in the environment where they live and work.
Nursing care also includes planning and implementing nursing activities
between illness and rehabilitation and comprises physical, mental, psychological
and social aspects of life as factors of health, disease, disablement and death. It
provides care in all periods of the life cycle - from conception to death. Conventional and contemporary nursing
The essential difference between conventional and contemporary nursing is to be
sought in its elements: philosophy, education, a nursing process, nursing diagnoses,
theoretical models of nursing care, pertaining standards and documentation,
organisation, management, staffing, professional terminology, research, legislation,
etc.
The philosophy of nursing care cannot be transferred from other social and
cultural spheres, but must develop in a given environment. Knowledge is a
prerequisite for the development of the profession, which is acquired in the process
of formal and informal education and conveyed in practice. Nursing process
The nursing process, which dictates the working method of nurses in the modern
nursing profession, contributes to the high level of organisation and a systematic,
comprehensive and individual approach. This is a progressive method of
ascertaining the nursing requirements of subjects, i.e. the patient, family and
community. It actively integrates all nursing subjects and members of welfare and
health teams. Systematic work leads to critical judgement and sensible and planned
nursing care. It operates in four phases, which in practice can run in parallel or
simultaneously: assessment, planning, performance and evaluation.
1. Theoretical nursing models permit nurses to develop nursing components in
all areas of its operation. They represent the elements of independent and
separate action by the nurse.
2. Creating nursing standards and nursing diagnosis together with prescribed
nursing documentation contributes to the establishment of procedural
working methods and, consequently, the prominent position of nursing care
in society.
3. Documentation ensures continuity, gives the basis for assessing nursing
emergencies that have already been performed and is an integral part of safe
and efficient nursing care. Without modern organisation, independent
management and staffing in nursing care one cannot speak of a modern and
independent profession.
4. Developing professional terminology allows a uniform understanding of
expert terminology that is used in professional literature as in the everyday
consensus between members of the nursing and medical teams. Research into
nursing is essential for the development of the profession and to raise it from 467 the occupational to the professional level. Duties, responsibilities and
competence must be defined by legislation (4-6). Community healthcare
Community healthcare is defined as a special form of healthcare that deals with
active health and social security of the individual, family and community. Due to
their biological characteristics, specific ailments or being unaccustomed to a new
environment they are sensitive to its harmful influences (3,7). Community
healthcare is organised as an independent service or organisational units of primary
healthcare in health centres. Community nursing care
Community nursing care forms an integral part of primary nursing care and
therefore primary healthcare. It is performed in the patient's home, health centre,
local community and in-the-field. The community nurse, who is a member of the
nursing and health team, operates at all levels of health education: primary,
secondary and tertiary, and promotes the health of the individual, family and whole
population.
Health education and health promotion
Health education is a permanent process that accompanies a person from
conception, through pregnancy, birth, the period of childhood and adolescence to
adulthood and old age. For each period there is a specific need for knowledge. The
community nurse must monitor and adapt to the needs and circumstances or state of
the individual, family, group or community and satisfactorily meet their needs while
working together with them.
1. Health education at the primary level refers to the treatment that strengthens
health, thereby preventing illness. It is intended for a healthy population, the
healthy individual and his family and seeks to achieve a higher level of
health awareness and interest or motivation in this field as well as
responsibility to one's own health.
2. Health education at the secondary level is intended for threatened groups and
individuals. It delineates risk, signs of illness, disease and treatment.
Participants are trained in self-observation and self-help as well as providing
assistance to others with advice or alternative action. Threatened groups or
individuals are therefore ready to take appropriate action, discover early
signs of anomalies and thus contribute towards an early diagnosis, which
results in swifter and more successful treatment and the earliest possible
return to one's original state of health.
3. Health education at the tertiary level is connected with the prevention of the
return of illness and a reduction of possible consequential ailments. It is
intended for patients, invalids and their relatives and involves measures to
reduce or abolish long-term injuries or incapacity, reduce suffering and
improve the patient's adaptability (8,9).
Under the term of health promotion one comprehends the preservation and
strengthening of health, which has a much broader objective than primary 468 preventive care. This is a process that involves training people to monitor and
improve their own health by themselves. It embraces all inhabitants, is directed
towards an active lifestyle and includes imparting a certain way of life. Moreover, it
also involves designing a social and economic environment and personality factors
that are useful to health (10). By promoting health the community nurse encourages
people to place health in the highest position on the scale of human values, actively
provide for it and have the greatest influence on the economic and social impact on
it. It includes all areas of health promotion: preventive care, work in the local
community, organisation, environmental protection, public health policy, and areas
of the economy, legislation and education.
Goals of community nursing care
The community nurse with her colleagues endeavours to achieve and increase
positive health of the individual, family and community and reduce or prevent
negative health.
The goals of community nursing care are:
• physical, mental, spiritual and social health and well-being in the social and
environmental context,
• preserved and improved health,
• a healthy lifestyle,
• a healthy, improved environment,
• increased human potential for self-help and neighbourly assistance,
• decreased burden of illness,
• prevented or reduced consequences of illness and risk factors, and
• recognisable human physical, mental, spiritual, cultural, and social needs
during a time of health and illness, human incapacity and dying.
Fields of work in community nursing care
In the entire process of community nursing care the individual, his or her family
and community is the subject of treatment. The individual and members of the
narrower and broader community are informed about everything, ready for active
co-operation and have faith in the work of the community nurse. The fields of work
in community healthcare are:
• the health and social treatment of the individual, family and community,
• nursing care of woman in childbed and new-borns at home, and
• nursing care of patients at home.
Subjects in community nursing care
In practice, community healthcare is of paramount importance for a healthy or
sick/injured individual, his or her family and community. They are treated in an
environment where they live, learn, play and work. Nevertheless, whether the
beneficiary of nursing care is an individual, family or community, a uniform
methodological approach or a procedural working method is employed.
1. The individual.
The community nurse treats individuals from the following groups of
inhabitants: women (woman in childbed, women in labour, women in the 469 fertile period and in menopause), children (new-borns, infants, young and
pre-school children, elementary and high school children), adult patients
(employees, patients who have chronic incurable diseases, inhabitants of
large cities and industrial centres), invalids, senior citizens and socially
deprived groups (refugees, romas, the homeless).
The community nurse uses an individual and comprehensive approach
that includes physical, mental, spiritual and social aspects. Together with the
individual (whether healthy or ill) the community nurse determines what the
individual and important others can do for each other by themselves. The
activities of the community nurse are directed to studying and seeking ways
to establish up-to-date knowledge on health within the context of efforts to
lead a healthy life and strengthen and improve health.
A good state of health of the individual is a prerequisite for social,
economic and personal development and a decisive component for a quality
life. The most common concept employed is that of the working elements,
philosophy of community nursing care, scope and working method in the
nursing models of Virginia Henderson and Dorothee E. Orem (11,12). They
are both oriented to developing responsibility for one's own health and to
supporting risk groups of inhabitants. The Henderson model of nursing
defines fourteen basic living activities; Orem's model is based on the level of
self-care (self-help) of the individual, family and members of the
community. The community nurse must assess in an individual each basic
living activity and on the basis of the determined condition plan, implement
and evaluate the achieved state. She must also assess the level of self-care
and health education. The individual himself, as well as the broader social
community, is responsible for preserving and enhancing his health.
2. The family.
The family plays a vital role to ensure the health and quality of life of the
individual and society. The family comes into being once the partners begin
to discuss having a common life together. With their network of relatives the
family represents a specific social and cultural institution in which social
bonds and individual freedom are connected in a special way. With regard to
the definition of this concept, the family can be considered as:
• a primary group - the cradle of human nature in which as the result of
intimate association and personal contacts one acquires the first social
and personal experiences,
• a social group in which relations between individuals are deep and
continuously linked. Individuals in this relationship experience
fullness and contentment. Relationships of "communities by blood"
are labelled as original and natural, and
• a social institution that fulfils important social goals: sexual
satisfaction, reproduction, educating children and maintaining
emotional ties. Like each social institution, the family has material
wealth, cultural symbols and recognisable values.
The community nurse encounters different forms of family: core, extended
and single-parent as well as families in various periods of development. Thus
one can distinguish between the periods of newly-marrieds, birth of the first 470 child, a family with schoolchildren and adolescents, creation of a new
family, empty home once the children have left, and an old family. The
community nurse must be acquainted with:
• the characteristics of individual periods of development, the most
common health problems, and social and material conditions, as well as
• Maslov's hierarchical scale of needs adapted to the family:
− basics needs for survival and physiological ones (state of
health and health education of family members as well as
conditions of hygiene),
− safety and protection (living conditions and economic standard),
− love, disposition and sense of belonging (communication in the
family and with the broader environment),
− respect (relations between family members and with the
broader environment), and
− self-fulfilment (education and employment of family members).
Using this data, the community nurse determines together with the family
members the position in the family, plans and implements nursing care and
establishes values. This is important to maintain the dynamic equilibrium in
the family and ensure a high quality of life for it.
Many people live in communities that are not ranked among the
above-mentioned families, yet the functions they perform are the same. In
these groups the problems which they meet and ways of solving them are
similar to those in conventional families. That is why the community nurse
treats as a family all those groups who think they are indeed a family.
3. The community.
Nurses have long treated the community as a subject or customer. Despite
the relatively large emphasis, the concept of "community as customer" is not
suitably defined. For this reason it neglects nursing care in the field of the
community as customer.
Nursing care is intended to assist a community in determining,
expressing and successfully solving problems associated with health.
The health of a community means meeting common needs by
determining problems and managing reciprocal effects within the community
as well as between the community and broader society. This demands
devotion, efficient communication, a presence and settlement of conflicts,
collaboration, solving relations with the broader society and mechanisms to
ensure interaction among the participants and adopt decisions. The health of
a community means the joint achievement at the highest level of physical,
mental and social health, which corresponds to the knowledge and resources
attainable (3,7,10).
The activities of a community nurse in a community are preventive at
the primary, secondary and tertiary level. The first two incorporate the
promotion, preservation and strengthening of the community's health,
disease prevention and risk factors, extending life and raising the quality of
life. The working characteristics of a community nurse in the community are:
• orientation to the group,
• promotion of health, 471 • preventive care before curative,
• inter-disciplinary and inter-sector operation,
• support for an active role of the individual, and important others in the
nursing process,
• a holistic approach,
• continuous nursing and observation of the principle of organisation, and
• management while respecting ethical principles. Team-work in community healthcare
In community healthcare team-work is indispensable. The community nurse works
together with the nursing and health team.
Team-work is defined as the work of a group of people in which each
individual contributes his or her professional knowledge and is responsible for his or
her work, which is directed towards a common goal.
An important role is played by the team leader who plans, organises and coordinates work. The behaviour of the team members, their motivation and level of
association depend on the method of leadership.
The team members communicate among themselves and work interactively.
The team in basic healthcare consists of health staff and other professionals with
whom they first join together.
Members of the nursing team in community healthcare are nurses with college
and higher level professional qualifications, specialists in community nursing care and
health technicians who are integrated in performing nursing care of the patient at
home. The health team includes specialist physicians, nurses from healthcare services
covering various individual groups of citizens (dispensaries) as well as the community
nurse and health technician. On the basis of the assessed health and social
circumstances, condition or problems of an individual, family, group or community
other experts are involved: physiotherapists, occupation therapists, hospital
psychologists, social workers and others.
The aim of team-work is to provide nursing care or healthcare for the
individual, family, group or community, whose goal is to achieve optimum health.
The paths and directions of communication of nursing team members are many as the
nursing team must collaborate with: members among themselves, patients and their
family members or relatives, members of the health team, important others
(neighbours and friends), and other services in health centres, clinics and outside of
these institutions.
Nursing team members solve complex, unique and unrepeatable problems of
the individual, family, group or community. The model of primary nursing care,
which is developing in community healthcare, permits an ongoing and co-ordinated
process. It provides a holistic team approach while respecting the needs, benefits and
will of subjects and their active role. A prerequisite for this is an efficient information
communications system, which is also computer supported, and the good operation of
all services. 472 CASE STUDY: COMMUNITY AND DISPENSARY NURSING
CARE IN SLOVENIA
Regulation of nursing care
In Slovenia, community and dispensary nursing is relatively well regulated. As such,
it is regulated by several legal documents, two of the being of utmost importance.
1. Health Care and Health Insurance Act.
We should start by one of the most important legal acts – the Health Care and
Health Insurance Act (in Slovene “Zakon o zdravstvenem varstvu in
zdravstvenem zavarovanju”) (13), which was adopted in 1992. According to
this Act, the task of health workers in primary healthcare activities is also to
unite and work together with other health and social welfare, educational and
training institutions, companies, organisations and individuals in order to
design and implement programmes that strengthen, preserve and give back
health (13), in cluding nursing care.
2. Instructions for the implementation of preventive health protection at the
primary level.
The most important legal regulation that regulates the implementation and
schedule of preventive activities, including preventive community nursing
care, is a special regulation entitled Instructions for the implementation of
preventive health protection at the primary level (in Slovene: “Navodilo za
izvajanje preventivnega zdravstvenega varstva na primarni ravni”) (Official
Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, 1998) (14). It was adopted in 1998, on the
basis of Health Care and Health Insurance Act (13).
The instructions to perform preventive healthcare at the primary level
provide quality preventive healthcare of individual groups of inhabitants and
patients treated in community care (14). Community nursing care
The community nurse plans, performs and evaluates nursing care of the individual,
family and community in a state of health and well-being and in a state of illness,
injury, incapacity, distress and undesirable conditions. The health and social treatment
of the individual, family and community as well as nursing care of women in childbed
and new-borns at home is ranked as preventive, whereas nursing care of the patient at
home is regarded as curative treatment. Preventive community nursing care
Preventive community healthcare comprises the following (14):
• eight community visits to a new-born or infant of up to 1 year of age and two
further visits to blind and disabled mothers;
• one community visit to a child who is 2 or 3 years old;
• two community visits per year to persons who are blind or who have poor
eyesight with other disturbances and who are 7 to 25 years old, if they are
cared for at home;
• a community visit to an pregnant woman;
• two community visits to insured persons older than 25 years of age:
− patients who have active tuberculosis , 473 − patients who have muscular and nervous-muscular diseases,
− paraplegics and tetraplegics,
− patients who have multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy,
− persons with disturbances in their development,
− invalids,
− patients who have chronic ailments, and
− persons older than 65 years of age;
• programmed health education in:
− the family,
− local community, and
− specific groups. Nursing care at home
The nursing care of a patient at home is planned and implemented on the basis of an
order which, as a rule, is made by a physician. The frequency of curative visits and
duration of nursing care depend chiefly on the patient's state of health and his social
and economic abilities. Provision of community nursing and home care
Today, in Slovenia about 850 nurses is providing community nursing care (preventive
activities) and home care (curative activities) (15). The data on visits in 2006 are
given in Table 1 (15).
Table 1. Provision of community nursing care (preventive activities) and home care (curative
activities) in Slovenia in 2006 (15)

913,089
1,384 From the Table 1 could be seen, that in Slovenia about 80% of community
nursing/home care visits is because of treatment of a disease, and about 20% because
of prevention. This ratio is not the same in the whole of Slovenia. Out of nine health
regions, the highest percent of preventive visits is in Ljubljana health region (23.6%),
while the lowest percent is in Novo mesti health region (only 15.4%). The discussion
about reasons is beyond the scope of this module. EXERCISES

Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The World is changing in traditional way of thinking by redistribution of political
power and economic development, scientific advancement and technical possibilities,
but recently it is recognized that social relations, culture and ways of communication,
human and social capital have a distinct role. Learning and use of existing knowledge
should be part of solution.
There is not a simple and safe way to solution, but we have to simplify and
first define what one would like to achieve, based on our estimate of needs and
available resources.
Development was during 1980s used to describe the process of economic
growth and changing in economic structure (e. g. division of labour, industrialization,
increase in per capita national income), and that predominant understanding may be
traced even now in utilitarian approach to relations of economics and health.
However, the adverse results of social inequities after abrupt introduction of neoliberal economies, human costs of Structural Adjustment Programmes, weakening of
social networks (“social capital”) and growth of social evils (crime, corruption,
insecurity, violence, wars) in spite of apparent economic growth, at the beginning of
1990s resulted in reviving the philosophical, political and socio-economic
expectations of the better future for humanity.
Human development concept was introduced (Mahbub ul Haq, Human
Development Report 1990) as idea of advancement of the richness of human life.
Human Development Index (HDI) was designed as a measure combining life
expectancy, education and income. The broader approach to human development was
underlined importance of human capabilities and freedoms, “enabling them to: live a
longer and health life, have access to knowledge and a decent standard of living, and
participate in the life of their communities and decision affecting their lives” (A. Sen.
Development as freedom, Oxford University Press, 2001). In this way human
development shares common vision with human rights, because in both of them
freedom is essential and the basis of self-respect and dignity of all people. The
importance on economic inequity, poverty, deprivation, illiteracy and injustice as
breaks in the process of development are recognized. Culture and knowledge,
innovations and human creativity, became important stimulants of progress besides
economic incentives. Human Resources Management
Human resources are gradually placed in centre of interest, particularly in health care
provision. However, major changes emerged during the last decades:
• Human Resources Management developed from previous Personnel
Administration and Manpower Planning and Development activities. Even the
titles explain the character of change. At present a new slogan indicates further
steps: “Working together (in teams and with patients)”. Administration 478 (disciplined and clear formal regulations, control and accounting of resources,
frequently with bureaucratic tendency) is superseded by management (with
priority in better resource utilization, decentralized decisions related to health
care implementation), and followed now by entrepreneurship (creating new
opportunities, innovation, orientation toward the future, result orientation and
risk taking in resource mobilization and allocation).
• Another direction of change is from “scientific management” to “human
relations”, to “human capital” and “ethical leadership”. In case of motivation
for work it is another intended change: from stimulation by money and
incentives to encouragement by recognition of achievements and relying on
responsibility.

of work “Knowledge society”
The XXIst century is meant to have several essential problems to solve: unequal
progress in different countries and in depreciated groups and individuals in countries;
growing environmental problems, including shortages of water and energy; ageing of
population, double burden of health risks as result of epidemiology in transition,
social and cultural changes in an global postindustrial and information World with not
yet known health and social consequences. For this entire problem, starting with
economy, the solution is found out in creative production and use of knowledge. The
problem is how the knowledge is understood and how it could be measured. Is it
factual knowledge, an objective truth or proper knowledge presenting individual or
group ideology? Do we need scientific knowledge or wisdom? Is heart of the problem
recognising true or false results or application of what we know, both factual and
from experience? Today dominate measures of rigorous but formal criteria, academic
or administrative competitive comparisons, more about production then about use and
utilization of knowledge. As P Liessman critically observed the concept of knowledge
society was transformed into a postulate of informed society (“Information age”), and
consequently a necessity of life-long learning. Ethics
Ethics remain the most important frame of human aspects and quality of health care.
The main traditional human ethics ordered doing well, but in the modern times the 479 dominant rule is doing right. This is a deep change. At the beginning of 21st century
when most of human values are shaking and uncertain, it is not clear which type of
rules will prevail. The increased gap between those who have material goods and
power and those who are poor, depreciated and marginalized is producing critical
situations in political, social and health matters: in individuals frequent stress,
addictions, social isolation, and suicides; in communities diminished solidarity and
increased violence; in states market orientation, uncertainties, crisis of democracy,
bigger mortality; damage to environment, domination of more powerful, wars and
terrorism.
The problem is aggravated by abrupt introduction and imposing of formal rules
and concept of justice strange to local culture. In many developing countries,
including those in transition, the major intention is, for instance, formal introduction
of bio-ethical codes and request of individual decisions, in societies in which is
culturally deeply rooted communitarian (familial, tribal) approach.
Besides described and often discussed “big” ethical problems related to life
and death (artificial insemination, abortions, suicide, euthanasia etc.), for health
practice are often important daily “small” problems, often hidden by daily routine or
covertly present as special care and interest for benefit of offended (like private
interests of professionals, imbalance in power of health worker and patients, inequity
of arrangements and attitudes toward patients by age, gender, social position, private
relations, finding balance between quality and costs etc.). On the relation and trust
between professionals and people in need frequent “small” ethical problems may
finally have a greater impact then scarce “big” problems. CASE STUDY: “DOM NARODNOG ZDRAVLJA” (HOME OF
PEOPLE’S HEALTH), COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE,
MEDICAL POLICLINIC - GROWING BIG AND LOOSING SOUL
Community Health Centre (Domovi narodnog zdravlja, DNZ) was an original concept
in organization of primary health care. The first root of that concept one can trace
more than 90 years back (1921), when the first health centres were organized as an
active part of “hygienic services” (A. Štampar) in the former Yugoslavia. They had
the following departments: for hygienic education and propaganda, for
epidemiology and for “social medicine”, i.e. preventive services and integrated
(dispensary) care for priority risk groups and “social” illnesses (maternal and child
health, school hygiene and malaria, tuberculosis, venereal diseases, trachoma et
similar). The principle of “dispensary medicine” was integration of prevention, social
support and curative medicine. DNZ covered one or more districts, operated health
posts in small communities, and were responsible to regional hygienic institutes. In
Yugoslavia in 1940 were 10 institutes of hygiene, 51 DNZs and 159 health posts, out
of them in Croatia 2 hygienic institutes, 12 DNZs and 53 health posts, a small number
for more then 600 local communities. Principal source of financial resources was state
budget with only some examples run by health cooperatives. Major change started in
1948 when new health centres (“Domovi zdravlja”, DZ) financed through health
insurance was organized. They incorporated all out-patient services at the primary
care level, including previously private general practitioners and all special
dispensaries working for a short time as self standing institutions. The Law on 480 organization of health services 1961 established them as “self-managed
organizations”, founded by commune and financed through compulsory health
insurance. They continue to contribute to health education but started also during
sixties to participate in medical education (undergraduate and postgraduate) for nurses
and physicians. The DZ were, besides, the cradle of a new specialization of
General/Family Practice in 1964 and remained the most important basis for organized
postgraduate teaching and research in primary health care. In 1974 health insurance
was decentralized to the communal level. At that time health centres were expected to
deliver comprehensive primary care based on dispensary type of work. They were
either self standing organizations or merged with all other health units in a district, i.e.
also with specialized medical services based in outpatient departments of hospitals.
The regular technical meetings of professionals in best of DZ contributed to
development of a system of permanent vocational education. During the 30-years
period of 1961-91 the numbers show restructuring of organizations and an increase of
DZs in comparison with the MCs and particularly with the independent smaller heath
posts (Zdravstvene stanice”, ZS), Table 2.

57 1991 25 98 10 The average size of individual health centres was also rising so that in 1991
only 47 DZ have been staffed up to 19 physicians, 14 DZ employed 20-39 physicians
and 18 more than 40 physicians. Of them 5 had even more then 90 employed
physicians and two more then 200. The false philosophy was that big organizations
are more efficient. However, the opposite was true.
The “soul” of an original
“home of health” was lost. Team work was replaced by bureaucratic management and
control. The additional contribution by local community diminished, what combined
with general economic crisis lead to dissatisfaction of health worker and consequently
clients. The analyses showed that integrated approach to health care was successful
around general practitioners only in small DZs, but preventive and social aspects
were poorly treated in big organizations, where prevailed polyclinic treatment. The
participation of people and close relation with community were also disrupted and
formally performed only on “higher” administrative and political levels. This was the
way how the last days of self-governing socialism demonstrated inefficiency in
Yugoslavia. During the severe aggression on Croatia after partition of Yugoslavia 5
MC and 21 DZ were destroyed, but the decentralized system and devotion of health
professionals contributed to successful protection of people. After the war, during the
time of transition, the main solution for described weak points of DZs, otherwise
adequate organizational pattern of primary health care, was found in “privatisation”.
The preventive services and important public health nursing became part of
centralized state public health services, and teams of general practitioners persuaded
to start independent (“private”) contractual relations with the Croatian state health
insurance. Previous DZ in that way remained only an administrative shell caring for
premises. The integrated approach to health care remained only a traditional attitude 481 of some of general practitioners and some of MCH and school dispensaries. It
happened right in time when in many developing and of the most developed countries
ideas of group practices and small health centres became popular.
The case is interesting because demonstrates how socio-political and cultural
factors influence not only public health principles, but also organizational patterns.
Besides, the health technology based on human relations obviously is suffering from
big organizational structures. EXERCISES
Task 1. A changing world: first think about necessity and
available resources
Your task is to write:
a) Mission statement of your organization;
b) Vision statement of your organization.
Mission is declaration of existing general objectives and principles of operations
of an organization, and vision outlines what the organization wants to become.
Both have to include purpose, accepted values, specificities (what
distinguishes them from others), responsibility toward members, clients and
society.
Consider external situation and needs:
• Important leads in economics: producing or selling, innovations and role of
research and learning in economic development;
• The waves of socio-political changes:
− Egalitarian and libertarian issues - globalisation/neo-colonialism (look
for broader context of social policies);
− Technicism/humanism, quality/equity ("Panakea" or "Hygiea" in health
tradition);
− Individualism/communitarianism (individual or personal liberty and
social justice).
• Suggested middle way solutions:
Sustained development policy, human rights promotion (supported by
humanistic and religious organizations) – are they realistic solutions?
Consider internal situation and needs:
• Collaborators' expectations and interests: genuine or pretended (instrumental).
What is needed: diversification or homogenisation, centralization or
decentralization?
• Social concern: What is more important? Quality or Equity (practice
guidelines based on Evidence Based Medicine or professional autonomy,
scientific rigidity or social sensitivity and flexibility?
• Management issues: How to stimulate pro-active attitude and change from
stale health administration (order) towards management of services (best use
of resources), and further to entrepreneurship (opening new opportunities) in
the health system: research, education, practice.
Consider own intentions (be honest and look for own interests): 482 • Would you really like to become an innovator or would you prefer to remain
hidden performer, protected in an administrative system (how much are you
afraid of uncertainties);
• In which way you would like to strengthen your leadership? (authoritarian
way, democratic, broad-minded participatory way, or laissez faire direction);
• Are you ready to accept risks of innovations? Do you have any political
expectations or ethical issues limitations?
Consider type and characteristics of necessary change:
• Essential characteristics
− novelty: transferred or original idea (your imagination is decisive);
− intensity: reforms or radical solutions (masked or open, step by step or
great leap);
− horizon: short-term or long-term: results visible at once or later;
− target: organizational or functional, described in terms of 4P
(M.Morgan): Procedures/People/Process/Products
− support you will need (tolerance, acceptance, commitment) and from
whom;
− expansion method you are planning (by diffusion, through further
problem solving, research and development process).
• Estimated necessary resources and feasibility of change.
• Estimated time for implementation and first results. Be realistic, according to
experience of some economists (D. Salamon) the time needed for change in
technology is 3-5 years, in the market behaviour and habits of people 8-10
years, in management 10-12 years.

7. The criteria for assessment of your written statements will be:
clear and easy understandable (not ambiguous);
realistic and rational (not just idealistic jingle);
socially, ethically and culturally acceptable; and
memorable and vibrant (not bureaucratic and dull).
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Task 2. Big issues of “small” ethical problems in routine
health practice
One may argue that all ethical problems are “big”, because of their gradual but
growing influence on identity and moral personality of professionals, the trustfulness
of whole profession and behaviour of people. They are usually a slippery slope
between normal, traditional and “expected” behaviour and corruption of basic moral
conventions. Sometimes people do what is far from their declared principles. The best
way to learn about ethics is not to know by heart principles, but to discuss the
experiences of daily practice.
Your task is to “discover” the main daily ethical problems in health practice you
know, discuss the reason they are present and how one may prevent them to reach the
risky level. To list them you may first reflect on the following short (and oversimplified)
stories (cases). 483 Case 1. Confronting interests
“I may trust only in tests done in laboratory where I can supervise the quality of work. You
have been already in two other laboratories, but you can see that results, although falling in the
same range, slightly differ. This is the reason that I have to ask you to repeat the tests and this
time in laboratory I am supervising. New results will not necessarily change your treatment and
the diagnosis may remain same, but it is better to test again and be sure and safe. If you do not
follow my sincere recommendation, I believe you better find another doctor!” said the doctor
who is a famed specialist.
What the patient will do? Case 2. Restricted choice
An elderly woman with osteoarthritis of her knee is trying to find a new doctor,
because two previous doctors she consulted recommended her almost only to observe
diet and reduce weight, and did not listen to her experience of beneficial massage with
an ointment she has forgotten name. They also repeatedly insisted on physical therapy
in spite of her complaint to the health administrator. They offended her because she is
sure they would listen to her more carefully, when she could pay them some money.
The third doctor who was asked to take her on his list refused her telling that his list is
full.
Case 3. Hidden external influences
After talks with the representative of a well-known pharmaceutical firm the physician
was persuaded that a new drug for diabetics type II would be better for his patients
and he decided that all of them should change therapy and use the new recommended
drug. Because of his interest the representative of the firm decided to facilitate
doctor’s attendance to an international congress in Rome, paying him the air ticket.
Has doctor accepted that offer?
Case 4. Ethics of public programs
The public media announced invitation to all women over age 40 to report for a
mammography test for early diagnosis of breast cancer. The procedure is safe and
life-saving they stated, and all women with positive and suspicious results will be
immediately advised to find an expert for further treatment. For those who cannot pay
for further treatment there would be a chance to get help by charity organization.
Is it correct that the invitation does not tell anything about possible drawbacks?
Case 5. Priorities
A policy is discussed about the way to arrange the list of priorities for some surgical
treatments in short supply. The usual points are discussed: to keep strictly and only
the order in which patient came to ask for treatment or would it be necessary to look
for some additional facts. Under discussion were: judgment of relevant experts about
medical factors (e.g. urgency, expected best results), age and gender, familiar
conditions (e.g. number of dependents), other social factors (socially recognized
important people, experts, creative artists, national symbols etc.), and sponsors able to
materially contribute to the development of similar services by additional equipment
or training of health workers. 484 Although the group was aware that the existing practice will not be in
accordance with principles of their choice, they agreed that only the order of coming
and age of patient (younger have advantage) may be used as criteria of priority. Was
this a correct decision?
Case 6. Informed consent
The informed consent of patient is important and the requirement was introduced that
patients should sign a printed statement before a number of important medical
procedures. Asked to sign such document, an elderly man asked for 2-3 days time to
consult members of his family. It was explained to him that it should be a personal
decision and a shorter time can be given to him for thinking it over, but the final
decision has to be his own. After explanation the man refused to sign.
Was anything wrong in described procedure?
Case 7. Life is multi-dimensional
A middle aged man, worker, living alone, with chronic respiratory problems was
frequently coming to his doctor for new drugs and few friendly words. One day quite
unexpectedly he brought a sum of money, not complaining and not asking for
anything, but telling to the nurse and doctor who came into the nurse’s room, that this
money he prepared for them. Surprised doctor and nurse felt offended, because they
never asked money from their patient, and asked “But why are you doing this, have
we not been always kind with you?” “Indeed, and this is the reason that I brought to
you this small amount of spared money.” The doctor and nurse refused money and
after a short argument patient took the money back and left. After several days the
doctor and nurse heard from neighbours that the man committed suicide.
The life is multi-dimensional and simple rules are not always adequate.
Case 8. How to assure equity
How to decide whether a health unit is contributing to health equity among people?
Obvious answer is that (a) no cases of discrimination are recorded. This is, however
only the peak of the iceberg. To be confident about the sustainable fight against
inequity there must be fulfilled also other conditions (b) like guaranteed universal
access, regardless of personal characteristics, physical and geographic restrictions,
ability to pay et similar. (c) Adequate knowledge and skills, empathy, and concern of
professionals for patient, i.e. style of work are an additional but probably the most
important prerequisite. The additional requirement includes (d) personal relations,
observing privacy and dignity of people, understanding of cultural and social
differences. Even more is required by the further task: (e) full responsibility and
participation in the process of health care both by health professionals and patients.
The crucial measure (f) would be advocacy of health needs of people in front of
higher authorities and fair distribution of resources among the broader scope of other
services, representing the disadvantaged and handicapped people. Proactive attitude is
the most difficult additional duty requiring political skills and full engagement in the
life of community. It is partly out of reach of local powers, but without raising that
voice the chances for benefits remain doubtful.
Using the described scale try to estimate how is a certain health unit you know
contributing to equitable health of people. 485 Case 9. Inequity as avoidable inequality
In a school all children are treated equally (school lunch, physical activity, learning
conditions), but their health, growth and development, never end as equal and they are
disappointed. In another school the children are treated in an equitable way and their
health, growth and development have a tendency to be comparable, and they feel
satisfied. illustrate what is happening in these schools and how you understand
difference between equality and equity.
Case 10. Ethical intervention ladder
There are always many complaints that the general conditions, state policies, role of
industries, media and other parties are responsible for poor health care. Should public
health programs organized or supported by state persuade people to start participate in
health programs and coerce adults to lead healthy lives (by anti-smoking laws, traffic
regulations etc.), actively intrude into personal and familial life. Or, opposite, has
state be just a careful observer, simply monitoring the current situation, provide
information, enable healthy choices, providing incentives for healthy behaviour, and
restrict and eliminate free choices of people only in cases when the health risk of
others is endangered along what is called the “intervention ladder”.
Look for “stewardship model“ of public health application of ethical principles
(Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Public health: ethical issues. A guide to the report,
2007. Internet: www.nuffieldbioethics.org)
The criteria for assessment of your result: (1) Your awareness of hidden
“small” ethical problems in practice, (2) Demarcation of ethical problems: personal
and professional, balancing interests of professionals and those in need, formal
consent and free decision of choice, quality and costs of medical procedures, equity
and equality, (3) Group reflection on origins of unethical behaviour, and ways to
prevent it, (4) Group opinion on intervention among colleagues (e.g. in case that one
of colleague is alcoholic, corrupt, prone to fraud patients, unacceptably poor in
knowledge and skills).
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Learning by
reflecting life stories as opposite to learn principles. REFERENCES

Students 488 EDUCATION AND TRAINIG AS PART OF HEALTH
PRACTICE
Želimir Jakšić, Herman R. Folmer, Luka Kovačić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND The health system is complex and dynamic
Education and training is a common starting point in most of interventions aiming
towards improving health care practice. However, choice of contents, methods and
educational technology is part of local health culture, general cultural, social and
political conditions. Fragmentary introduction of new element into existing system
might be not only inefficient, but also introduce confusion and even damage.
Therefore one has to understand essential policies and realities of the whole system.
Here are described possible wrong managerial decisions in two directions: acceptance
of circumstances as a fixed structure not open to any change (conventional error) and
opposite to this assuming that everything is open to change (utopian error). Figure 1. Complexity of the health care system The right approach is obviously somewhere between these two errors, but it is
often hidden by tradition, all kinds of ideologies and direct political utilities. One has
also to consider that the system is dynamic and changes may occur unexpectedly
because usually not all facts are known, and local circumstances change under
influence of broader environment, a changing World. “Knowledge society”
The XXIst century is meant to have several essential problems to solve: unequal
progress in different countries and in depreciated groups and individuals in countries; 489 growing environmental problems, including shortages of water and energy; ageing of
population, double burden of health risks as result of epidemiology in transition,
social and cultural changes in an global post-industrial and information World with
not yet known health and social consequences. Figure 2. The knowledge society For all of these problems, starting with economy, the solution is found out in
creative production and use of knowledge. The problem is how the knowledge is
understood and how it could be measured. Is it factual knowledge, an objective truth
or proper knowledge presenting individual or group ideology? Do we need scientific
knowledge or wisdom? Is heart of the problem recognising true or false results or
application of what we know, or both, factual and from experiences? Today dominate
measures of rigorous but formal criteria, academic or administrative competitive
comparisons, more about production then about use and utilization of knowledge. As
P Liessman critically observed the concept of knowledge society was transformed
into a postulate of informed society (“Information age”), and consequently a necessity
of life-long learning. Learning
Learning is by itself not a simple process of acquiring new information and
remembering facts, but a complex transformation of personality and development of
new ways of behaviour. Because of that it has to be acquired, it is not possible to
transfer it. It is an interaction of experience and reflection, abstract conceptualisation
and practice (D Kolb’s model of learning, 1986). One has to differentiate training
(acquiring a skill) and learning (acquiring of knowledge) and education (imparting
and accepting of knowledge, but also becoming cultured). First is memorizing facts
and know-how, but it needs further reflection and inter-relation with own experience,
what is leading to interpretation and understanding of meaning, followed by obtaining
proper attitude of mind and finally gain the whole integrity. Oversimplifying that
process or interrupting it to early create disappointments. One well known related to
health care was in seventies of last century, when funcionalists tried to simplify 490 education of front-line health workers, training them what needs to be done in certain
conditions without understanding why (“medicina simplificata”). Many textbooks
have been printed in form of cook-books. It was shown, however, that such training
could be successful only when supplemented with education about rational of
processes and significance on the given task for the role of health worker. The other
unfortunate example is at present under severe pressure of copious information, when
facts are received without context and inter-relation, what is producing a feeling of
learning and knowledge, and is quite opposite, producing “half-educated”
intellectuals, insecure or not critical to suggestions, so that marketing messages could
be accepted as important new knowledge. Figure 3. The Educational Media Centre Network in Croatia as a support for education
in primary health care Educational goals have often to combine quite opposite capabilities and
attitudes: How to become critical and trustful? How to be pro-active and thoughtful?
How to collaborate with others, keep own believes and tolerate opposite? How to
decide in emergencies or under threat of uncertainties without relevant data? How to
combine scientific rigor, professional dignity and political skills? How to participate
in and lead teams, developing them from hierarchical, to functional, and to
interdisciplinary ones?
The content of learning is special item to be considered. New technologies
facilitate approach to new information (distance learning, internet etc), but in the
same time open an important question: how to escape of an avalanche of information,
potentially interesting, but not necessarily useful. How to chose what is (1)valid and
credible, (2)important and relevant for practice, (3)applicable and acceptable. 491 The scientific facts are not sufficient for their interpretation, the cultural and
ethical values are necessary. Culture
Culture is one of the most complex expressions with many connotations. The term
may be understood as just production of arts (cultural industries), or as traditional
folklore, or ultimately all manifestations of social life such as customs, religions
rituals, habits of association and institutions. The controversies might appear between,
for instance, between national and international understandings (in search for
identity), among intellectualism, spiritualism and aesteticism (as different approaches
or ideologies of expected social progress), between cognitive and emotional reactions
(in creation of personal style and manner). Figure 4. Film as a attractive media used in health education A separate feature is identity of health culture. It is built from many layers of
people’s experience and believes, years of interaction with health and medical
professionals, complementary, alternative and anti-medicine, obsolete slogans and
commercial messages, lasting, persistent and resistant to change. For countries in
transition a widely spread attitude that health may be sacrificed for economic
development is difficult to change in believe that, contrary, health is of vital
importance for economic development. It is a world-wide problem in many
developing countries, collectively, as well as in families, and even individuals. Education and development
The different connotations exist in many essential factors connected with the role of
education in development. There is not one rule and one truth to be implemented. 492 Therefore it is wrong to transfer and import solutions, but necessity to
harmonize approaches in a tolerant way and most important to analyse not only short
living policies and economic suggestion, but also cultural and ethical aspects. Learned
people should not only become knowledgeable and aware of new possibilities, but
also better understanding the own position, capabilities and interests. Educated
personal attitude is decisive: indifference of those who know little is most hazardous,
but equally dangerous are utopianism and despair of sophisticated academicians
without touch with practice. Figure 5. Education for health is important factor contributing to the development CASE STUDY: INTERNATIONAL POSTGRADUATE COURSE
“PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT OF PRIMARY HEALTH
CARE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES”
Introduction
From 1978 until 1996 at the Andrija Štampar School of Public Health, School of
Medicine, University of Zagreb organized 17 international courses of 9 week
duration. Each course was attended by between 18 to 25 participants, 358 of them in
total, from 62 mostly developing countries. The participants attended the courses were
medical doctors, nurses, environmentalists, economists and other professionals,
usually younger than 35, from middle level management. The courses were organized
as a joint cooperative program between the governments of Yugoslavia (former) until
1989, and Croatia 1990-1996, and The Netherlands. 493 The course was designed to link planning and management with specific
technical procedures and social functions of health workers more than theoretical
considerations of techniques in planning and management. Course aim and objectives
The principal aim of the course was to train professionals in the field of planning and
management of primary health care in developing countries. The course was designed to
link planning and management with specific professional contents of primary health care
and the understanding of social processes which play an important role in
decision-making and cooperation in the field of primary health care. According to the
stated aims, participants experienced in management of primary health care were
recruited.
The specific objectives of the course were:
• To develop and support positive attitudes towards primary health care as a part
of social development and towards the people as the main active element in the
health system; to reinforce positive attitudes to rational methods in the planning
and administration of services.
• To develop skills:
− in analyzing and solving technical and organizational problems of health
services and techniques in the judgment of alternative solutions;
− in resource allocation and health planning, particularly development of
adequate health manpower;
− in communication, team work and leadership.
• To increase knowledge to be used in:
− listing and assessment of technological and managerial problems
encountered in primary health care;
− problem-solving methodology;
− analysis of status of health, trends in community development and
health priorities, relation of health to other sectors of development;
− orientation as to the position and involvement of the community in health
care planning and practice;
− planning and management of integrated comprehensive primary health
care services tackling typical problems such as maternal and child health
and family planning, prevention and control of epidemic and endemic
diseases, nutrition, health education, organization of medical care;
− health manpower planning, development and leadership;
− monitoring and evaluation of health services and control of
implementation of health plans;
− training and research in primary health care. Course content
The course was organized in blocks which last on the average about one week. Every
block combines theoretical parts of teaching, individual reports by participants and
working group results, practical exercises and field visits. Planning and management
were linked with the contents of primary health care and actual examples, so that 494 individual programs developed into more complex ones and finally into the whole
system. The final choice of contents and order of presentation were adapted according
to the needs of participants.
Block 1 (Introductory block) dealt with the refreshment of fundamentals of
planning and management. It was an opportunity for the participants to get to know
each other. Indicators for particular countries are compared and problems of the
development of the policy and strategy “Health for All by the Year 2000” and “Primary
Health Care” were discussed.
Block 2 dealt with general social and economic components and conditions for
the development of primary health service as well as with general social and economic
aspects of planning and management. The process of policy formulation and broad
programming was analyzed. The first two blocks include experiences of the health
system organization and development including field visits.
Block 3 covered questions of selecting topics of appropriate technology and
development strategy. This part includes certain PHC components such as
environmental problems, sanitation and communicable disease control. Field visit were
included. Examples of specific programs such as endemic disease control programs
were used to discuss the problem of integrating these programs into comprehensive
primary health care.
Block 4 covered the health program formulation and detailed programming. The
comparisons were made between programs under different circumstances (rural, urban
settings, migratory population, etc.) The relations between PHC and different parts of
health services especially hospitals and specialized medical care were analyzed. Field
visits and exercises were organized to demonstrate different working conditions.
Block 5 dealt with maternal and child health, regarding measures and strategies
and particularly manpower planning, training and management of PHC practice. Special
attention was given to dilemmas of health manpower at the grass-root level, and to the
profiles of the middle-level managers at the district and provincial level.
Block 6 dealt with major resources, such as: (a) community participation; (b)
coordination, supervision, communication and leadership; (c) health economics and
management of material and financial resources; (d) mental health, health education and
operation of health services.
Block 7 covered planning and management methods as applied on different
models. A model province from a developing country was used for studying indicators,
problem analysis, assessment of development trends and priorities, resource allocation,
organization, supplies and monitoring of services. Based on the knowledge from
previous blocks, participants were taking part in a system of managerial games and
exercises and evaluate the results and outcomes by real experiences from their own
countries.
Block 8 dealt with a synthetic approach to PHC from the point of view of
contents of work and components as well as from the point of view of organization and
management. Major problems of PHC implementation, constraints and obstacles were
analyzed by working groups of participants.
At the end of the Course a final conference was organized during which
participants presented their plans in solving actual problems of PHC in their field for the
coming year. 495 Teaching/training methods
Participant’s responsibility during the course was to participate actively in the teaching
program in several ways: to conduct joint sessions, working groups and discussions and
to describe problems and experiences of their country as well as to give short lectures on
topics they have experience in. According to the assessment of teachers and participants
the recruitment of candidates and their active participation in most of cases was very
successful. Lecturers were in a position to discuss problems with participants and not to
merely give lectures. The main information blocks lasted usually 15-20 minutes and were
followed by discussions and further solving of specified problems. Work in small groups
of 4-5 participants was a frequent and regular form of teaching. With the aim to elaborate
specific primary health care managerial problems in details, the participants were split
into 3-4 working groups. Problems were presented in a form of a panel discussion. Very
interesting and motivating for the participants were role playing and games (1). The
participants also had a task to write the final paper, being a plan of action in PHC
management in their position at home for the coming short term period. The Final
Conference was held under several topics.
In order to achieve the objectives of the course, on an average, one-day visit to
different institutions per week was organized. Every field visit was organized so that
participants had specified tasks in observation, surveying and reporting the health care
settings and functions.
For the course participants the Course Manual, consisting of ten chapters
following in general the structure of the course by blocks, was edited and distributed to
the participants as the handbook for the course. The manual has 470 pages and was
distributed in the related teaching blocks. The course manual was reedited each year.
The participants were also provided with various materials of the World Health
Organization (“WHO: Leadership development for mental health”, “Management
Development for Primary Health Care”, “Primary Health Care Towards the Year 2000”,
“The Health Centre in District Health System”, “Acute Respiratory Infections in
Children”, “Technical Bases for the WHO Recommendation on the Management of
Pneumonia in Children”) as well as from almost every institution they visited.
The basic concept and terminology used in the course were in accordance with
the terminology of the World Health Organization: “Managerial process for national
development within the strategy: Health for all by the year 2000”. Evaluation
The evaluation process includes a formal evaluation organized at the end of each training
block and a more detailed one at the end of the course. Block evaluation consists of
anonymous answering to standard questionnaires (based on FAO questionnaire,
recommended by a Holland group of experts in 1981 and followed since) followed by
oral evaluation in which all participants in turn comment the last block and suggest
changes to be made in the blocks to follow. Final evaluation of the course follows the
same procedure, only using a more detailed questionnaire. Evaluation of the 1994 course
As an example of the evaluation regularly used in the International Course “Planning
and management of primary health care in developing countries” here is
presented part of the official 1994 course Report related to evaluation. 496 Final evaluation questionnaire 1994 1. The size and the composition of the group
17 out of 19 participants assessed the size of the group to be just right for the purpose of
the course, 1 participant found it to be too small and 1 big. Regarding the composition by
professional qualifications, most answers are also in the category of “just right”, 11
answers, but 5 of them answered the group was “too mixed” and 3 “not mixed enough”.
2. The contacts during the course
Practically all the answers to the questions on contacts are positive, both regarding
professional and informal ones. It is interesting to note that the participants of this year
course assessed their contacts (in both categories) as the same positive while in the last
year course the contacts within the participants were less positively assessed than the
contacts with the staff.
3. The duration of the course
Most participants evaluated the duration of the course to be just right, both with regard to
the program covered (10) and with regard to their own requirements (11).
4. The program of the course
All the participants assessed the course program to be well balanced, neither too rigid nor
too lax. Most of them were satisfied with the balance between free time and amount of
homework assignments, but 9 of them assessed to have had not enough free time and
only one to have had too much of free time.
5. The relevance of the course
In this section of the evaluation questionnaire the overall relevance was assessed as well
as the relevance of lecture notes and manual, field visits and the equipment used. Most of
the participants rated the course as relevant (2 “very high”, 10 “high”, 6 “acceptable” and
1 “low”). The average was 3.7 on the scale from 5 - very high to 1 - low. The answers
regarding some specific aspects of the course also fall in the same categories.
Regarding the training topics, the participants most frequently mentioned the
following subjects as the ones most useful for their future work: comprehensive
diagnosis, community participation, management techniques, resource allocation, health
manpower development and health education. It should be noted that, in answering this
question, they listed as much as 19 subjects. 9 subjects were mentioned as not so useful
for their future work, but almost all of them only by one participant. This indicates that
the choice of topics was very well balanced and matches the interests of the group
members.
6. Lectures and practical
10 participants evaluated the theoretical level to be just right, 7 too high and 2 too low. 17
of them also judged the practical level to be right (neither too complicated nor too
simple). For 2 practical were too complicated. The share of both theoretical lectures and
practical work was assessed as appropriate, and accordingly, the time available for each
of these training forms was perceived as balanced.
7. The teaching methods/techniques
The participants, when asked to assess to what extent had individual teaching
techniques/aids been effective in contributing to increase knowledge, insights and ideas,
ranked the following ones as the most effective: field trips, discussions, case studies,
practical work.
Most or all of the lecturers were perceived as responsive, stimulating participants'
initiative, using their experiences and prepared to discuss about what they said.
8. Organization and facilities 497 The administrative and secretarial support was assessed as very good (5) good (7) and
satisfactory (6) and, with only one participant assessing it as unsatisfactory.
The average rating for the lecture/meeting rooms was 4.1, i.e. between very good
and good; the average rating for the quality of accommodation was 3.3.
Lunch was organized in the School restaurant, as well as dinner in the first week
upon arrival. After that, money for dinner was given to participants in order to give them
more choice to prepare it according to their own wishes.
The organizers provided the participants with all the relevant information on
cultural and sporting events in the city. A guided city tour was organized as well as the
visit to the Croatian National Theatre. Participants had the opportunity to play table
tennis at the School premises. Various other forms of social activities were also going on,
such as the international dinner, dances, parties, etc. as usual, but most of participants
expected more.
Experiences and proposals for the 1994
A general observation for this year's Course was that the course corresponds to the needs
formulated by candidates and, on the other side, the group composition is responding to
the policies, objectives and methods of work announced in the course.
1. The main orientation of the course to the middle level management is
internationally recognized as one of the most important strategies for the implementation
of policies of Health for All and strengthening of Primary Health Care. The World Health
Assembly has stressed the district action programming as one of the essential elements in
national health development, and this is exactly the policy followed by the course in
Zagreb. This is well reflected in the criteria for the selection of candidates, course
objectives and type of training activities during the course.
2. The essential influence of the type and kind of candidates was evaluated several
times before. This year the candidates were on a good professional level and were a very
motivated group. All the group members were participating very actively, which was
achieved through different types of active assignment, field and group work, exercises
and structured round table discussions, as well as through individual contacts with
teachers and institutions of interest.
3. The general schedule of the course seems to be adequate. The course is very
concentrated and requires maximal effort from every participant. The printed manual has
proved to be of great help.
4. The participation of foreign resource persons has again proved to be very
satisfactory (J. Eshuis, from the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam, N. Sartorius from
the World Health Organization, Zuhal Amato from Turkey, and P. Reitmaier from the
University of Heidelberg, Germany). A tradition of inviting guest teacher and resource
person from developing countries was continued also this year. This practice to have the
firsthand experienced expert from developing world as well as to continue the practice to
inform and activate the World Health Organization and other international organizations
to support the course in proposing candidates, following them, helping in evaluating the
course, and actively participating in course performance and cooperation among similar
training institutions is viewed as very useful. For that reason, a proposal for further
participation of teachers from developing countries is forwarded (Annex 4).
5. The World Health Organization, The Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam,
the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Republic of Croatia were of great help in informing and recruiting potential course 498 participants. With their help the number of applicants was bigger than expected due to
political situation in this part of Europe. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of
Croatia was very ready to take the sponsorship of the course.
6. This year close cooperation with the Zagreb International Fair continued with
organization of panels and practical at their premises and this was a great opportunity to
practice the assessment of world medical technology.
7. Missing participants from Americas, which probably happened mostly due to
shortage of time between announcement and the beginning of the course, was regarded
by other participants as failure of the course organizers.

process: what experiences they gained, how a new knowledge could be relevant to their
practice and how much the training material was useful for them. They firstly answered
anonymously to 8 questions and than they presented, what they wish, their comments in
plenary (it was usually used the round technique). Their answers could be from 1 (the
worse) to 5 (the best). In Table 1 the results of the 1994 course as group averages are
presented. 1994 course was attended by 19 participants.

The International postgraduate course “Planning and management of primary health
care in developing countries” was organized for 17 consecutive years (from 1978 to
1996) and attended by 358 participants (Table 2). Some countries were very well
represented. Ethiopia systematically sends almost each year one participants from
health province and one middle level manager from the Ministry of Health (22
participants in total) (3). Very good influence of the Zagreb course to the 500 development of health services could be seen in the case of Iran. 20 participants
trained in Zagreb after return home organized several training courses of the same
curricula for middle level managers in Iranian provinces and districts. 2008 Mojgan
Tavassoli reported the success story of the Iranian primary health care in the Bulletin
of the WHO (4).

some countries (China – 13 participants; Nigeria – 11; Indonesia - 15), in spite of large
number of participants we can not expect bigger influence because of their relative under
representation. From some countries only 1-3 participants attended the Zagreb course
(Argentina, Burma, Burundi, Guatemala, Chile, Panama, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Malaysia
and others). EXERCISES
Task 1. The “learning society”: what and how? Problem
solving and learning on experience
THE NEXT SOCIETY WILL BE A KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY
(P. Drucker, The Economist, Nov 1, 2001) (2). Your task: start or improve work in your “learning organization”.
“Learning organization” is a more or less stable group of small number of colleagues,
who regularly meet to reflect on the experience in practice or data from other, steady
and carefully chosen sources (better not directly from well known experts, but from
documents, journals and also through new technologies such as kinematics, distance
learning, tele-education, Internet (Web-based training). Besides, important is
horizontal communication and partnership with users (patients, students) and public
media. They should know what you are working and you should reflect on their
experiences.
Organizational learning is based on the team learning, open system thinking,
stimulating individual capabilities, building cohesive vision and cultural values (see
D. Schön, C. Argyris) (5,6,7).
Consider attitudes the group should accept:
• People need to understand the purpose and meaning of what they learn. Enrich
functionalist Task analysis of the group: deliberate role, functions, and tasks
without further elaboration. If it is difficult to start, recommend that reviewing
daily professional activities of group members;
• Recognize intellectual (expert, cognitive) capital and discuss the road from
facts to wisdom. Accept that knowledge could be an object of management
(Knowledge Management, KM);
• Admit the importance of capability in performing health care, because
knowledge alone is not sufficient. The capabilities of group members might be
different and this is beneficial for group learning. All capabilities like also all
factors of intelligence might be of equal value. Capability is as intelligence a
balanced ability in solving problems at work and in life. However, the
importance of emotional and social intelligence is particularly large for health
professionals;
• Agree to survive the flood of information, escape playing around with vague
and ambiguous terms and “interesting” but not relevant information. For
critical choice of readings one may use EBM (Evidence Based Medicine) 502 criteria: the content should be (1) valid and credible, (2) important and relevant
for practice, (3) applicable and acceptable. • • • It might be useful to refresh understanding of learning processes:
Differentiate Factual knowledge (what: consciously reproducible),
Procedural knowledge (how: largely unconscious, instinctive”, forgotten
experience), Personal knowledge (assimilated into own cognitive processes);
Case analysis and problem solving (PS): definition and analysis of the
chosen problem, generation and comparison of several alternative solutions,
application and evaluation of consequence, and finally most important:
recapitulating what we have learned;
Experiential learning (EL): especially important in postgraduate and
continuous learning. Major dysfunction is separating “theory” and “experience”. Effective learning is not just memorizing facts. Other important conditions
are:
• involvement in practice and group reflection about cases and experiences;
• choosing multum instead multa, especially when learning skills;
• stimulating creativity (e.g. by trying out suggested new techniques, actively
participating in research, playing problem-solving games, by writing articles
etc.);
• besides technical, reading and other books (not only newspapers, and not only
journals);
• practicing physical activity and regular relaxation;
The criteria for assessment of your plans to improve the “Learning
organisation”
You have to include:
Regular work, at least one hour each month;
Involvement a small group of 4-6 (8) members with similar interests and possible
different experiences;
Securing steady input of technical information;
Stress on essential process of group reflection on specified actual cases;
Implementation of new knowledge into practice is decisive criterion in evaluation.
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Task 2. Development of a teaching/learning module
A teaching/learning module is an element of teaching and learning treating a defined
problem in health practice and aiming to solve it by increasing knowledge and
experience of involved (health) professionals, stimulate modification of their attitudes
and changing their behaviour. It is usually a part of a larger educational program or of
continuing learning.
Your task: Design a one-week seminar to improve management of
primary health care teams.
Consider format for constructing the teaching/learning module: 503 • Identify what you should change: choose a concrete problem out of actual
practice in a setting members of the working group know. Use individual
reports or “brain storming” of participants;
• Estimate possible improvements feasible under given conditions (one week of
organized teaching/learning);
• Define educational objectives: overall and specific regarding knowledge, skills
and attitudes;
• Choose title of the module (it is best to be in form of a question and easy
remembered) –it will be probably later revised several times;
• Write short introduction describing rationale;
• Choose the target group of participants (students), particularly those from
whom one may expect to implement what was taught;
• List tentative subject contents;
• Discuss appropriate teaching/learning methodology: it should be regarded as a
whole dynamic way, not just a list of teaching/learning forms. Learning should
be active and task-oriented, a kind of learning by doing. The seminar itself
should demonstrate what is recommended as methodological approach.
Sometimes a short lecture or description of a case is a good starter. The most
important is to be realistic and available time has to be considered. It is not
recommendable to cover by information a vast territory without planning time
to for “digestion” and reflection about relevant issues;
• Think over how will be assessed what students have learned and how they
could demonstrate their capacity to implement it in practice;
• Allow time for evaluation and answer of the group to the question: What we
have learned.
Solve logistics and organizational problem:
Estimate costs and find the way they are covered;
Find premises and places for field work;
Provide and check necessary equipment;
Make certain that teaching materials are ready and available;
Think about accommodation and provisions, entertainment and free time of
participants;
• Solve formalities: invitations and information of those concerned, invitation of
celebrities, publicity, catering etc.
•
•
•
•
• Format of presentation
• Written rationale and title
• List of specific objective and how they will be assessed
• Schedule of teaching activities by contents, form and time
• Oral explanations, comments and justifications
Criteria for assessment of your result
• Are the objectives relevant to the identified problem and do the solution follow
contemporary tendencies in human resources development?
• Is the way of assessment related to objectives?
• Do contents and methods of teaching/learning correspond to objectives? 504 • Is the teaching/learning schedule realistic and feasible?
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. Task 3. Supervision and control are important parts of
teaching and learning
Your task: Read the description of an event from practice, answer and discuss
the following questions and others you guess as important.
The young health technician has come back from his first supervisory tour. He
complained to the medical officer that community is very unhappy with the way in
which field workers are collecting data and advising people how to improve hygienic
conditions in their households and preserve food. Their behaviour will have
repercussion on the whole programme of rural sanitation in this region, he states.
Several people complained that damage was done to smoked meat and other food
conserved for winter. Sometimes quite large "samples" have been taken and some
rotten parts have been destroyed instead used to feed animals. He asked the medical
officer to intervene.
One of experienced field workers meets the doctor in charge the next day. He
is a mature person and works in that locality a long time. He is well-known to
everybody, people like him and give him sometimes small gifts consisting of their
home products. He states that some of people do not yet understand the meaning of
new sanitary measures, but are following all requests because they are nervous and
afraid due to recent outbreaks of food poisoning and trichinellosis. He complains that
the young supervisor, although coming from the higher schooling, does not know how
to communicate with people. He has seen several families and apologised for bad
work of field workers who do not only explain what has to be done, but also inspect,
take samples and destroy immediately rotten food. He asked medical officer against
the new supervisor who is not only inexperienced, but also arrogant.
Doctor promised to organise a meeting to discuss situation. •
•
•
•
•
• Discuss in the group the following and other relevant questions:
Is such case an exception or a typical case?
What is the essential cause of described tension?
Whose side you think doctor should take?
Is a general meeting the best way to solve the problem?
Who is actually responsible for described conflict?
How you would solve a similar case? 1.
2. The criteria for assessment of your result:
Answers to questions, explanation and justification of conclusions;
Special attention and weight will be given to the last two questions.
What you have learned during this exercise?
Reflect on your experience and discuss it with colleagues. 505 REFERENCES

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
People experience a lot of health problems during their life. They deal with most
of them by themselves, an only a minority of their health concerns deserves a
need for professional medical help. In a population of 1000 people, about 750 will
experience a health problem during their life. Only 250 will require a visit to the
medical facility, 9 will be hospitalised, and only 1 will be examined in a
university institution (1, 2) (Figure 1). Figure 1. Estimate, how many people out of 1000 would need for professional medical
help at which level of health care. Every health care system has its medical doctor of first contact, who works in
the interface of the population and health care. The development of primary care went
in creation of health care teams organised according to the need of the population.
The approach to health care in primary care is different from the approaches
in secondary in tertiary care: the emphasis should be put on comprehensive care of
the health problems from the viewpoint of the person and from the viewpoint of the
disease. The approaches, health problems, the patients and the organisation of
health care are different from the ones we know in secondary care. Characteristics of primary health care
Primary health care has the following characteristics (3):
• long term relationship with the population it serves;
• personal contact with the patient and his family; and
• comprehensive approach to health problems. 509 It is characteristic that primary health care takes care of health problems
that are common. Quite often these problems are dealt with in a specific way. Morbidity in primary health care
An average primary care physician deals with at least 80% of all health problems
presented to him and only a small minority is sent to other specialists or to hospital.
Usually the patient is referred to hospital or the specialist through a referral letter and
discharged from this kind of care through a discharge letter. The referral can be done
either for a specific short intervention (e.g. specific examination, consultation) or a more
long term cooperation is envisaged when the specialist is involved in a long term
management of one of the conditions the patient may have (e.g. a diabetic patient in an
advanced stage of the disease may require support from a diabetes specialist for that
disease). Primary health care task profile
The specific morbidity in primary care influences the tasks performed by this
service,
The content of primary care consists of the following measures:
1. Health promotion and disease prevention, especially within the vulnerable
groups of the population (children, women at childbearing age) and with
specific diseases and conditions.
2. Management of diseases.
3. Emergency situations.
4. Palliation. Organisation of primary health care
Professionals
These tasks are performed in an organisational structure that is variable from
setting to setting. Traditionally, primary care was mainly delivered by general
practitioners in offices or at home. With the development of medicine and the
changing requirements for health services, the following profiles were developed
for primary care:
1. The general practitioner
The main driving force in primary care is a general practitioner, who
traditionally took care of all the health problems and all the groups of the
population. In some countries his role was seriously challenged and some
of his tasks were given to other primary care specialists.
2. Other physicians involved in primary care
Some countries have introduced specialist care at primary level as well.
Therefore we have primary care dentists, paediatricians (taking care of the
children), school medicine specialists, occupational medicine specialists,
primary care gynaecologists, ophthalmologists, and internists. They usually
take care of either a specific group in the population or they take care of a
specific health problem
3. Nurses
Adequate primary care can not function without proper nursing support. In
general, two kinds of nurses exist: 510 • practice nurses are employed to work in practice and take care of the
administration of the practice
• community nurses are a specialized health care profile that works in
the community. Their main role is taking care of people at home,
coordinating care of patient requiring constant care
4. Other health professionals
A host of different health professionals may be involved in primary care. The
list includes laboratory workers, physiotherapists, emergency car drivers and
others
5. Non-health professionals
In order the primary health care to function other non-health care workers are
necessary. They perform their tasks according to their original education and
adapt their knowledge according to their work (e.g. economists). Organisation
All these professionals may be organised in a dispersed manner through a network. In
the recent times, coordination of services within group practices is more common.
Some countries (e.g. former Yugoslavia) have developed health centres as
organisational form of delivering primary health care. This system has proven to be a
good innovation regardless some of the limitations it has encountered. Conclusions
Adequately organised primary health care is the cornerstone of every health care
system. If organised properly, it is able to provide high quality health care for
reasonable prices with good health results for the population. This is why it has
always received a high priority in health care policy. EXERCISE
Primary health care can be taught at various levels using different teaching
methods, depending on the level of students’ knowledge and the teaching aims.
The following example of exercise, entitled “Patient in primary care” could be
used as a module for students at the beginning of their study. The timetable
suggestion is presented in Table 1.

After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• be aware of principles of primary health care;
• recognize;
• know ;
• improve the knowledge and understanding.
Primary health care is essential health care made universally accessible to
individuals and families in the community. It is a base and the entrance of
the whole health care system, often has the role of gate keeper. It has to be
organized according to social realities in which communities live and work.
The health system is developed relatively well among the countries in the
South Eastern European region. The heath personnel are well-trained and
public health services are well established and organized. Around 30% of
general practitioners are specialists in family medicine.
Health care services in Croatia are organized on three levels: primary,
secondary and tertiary. On primary level operate general/family medicine,
paediatric, gynaecological and dental practices, public health nursing,
diagnostic laboratories and supporting services and pharmacies. The core of
primary health services in Croatia are general/family medicine, paediatric
services and community nurses.

Želimir Jakšić, Luka Kovačić THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
Primary health care is essential health care made universally accessible to
individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them,
through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country
can afford. It forms an integral part both of the country's health system of
which it is the nucleus and of the overall social and economic development of
the community.
Alma Ata Declaration (1) Introduction
The strengthening and further development of primary health care is a policy accepted
in many countries. The question is how this concept is implemented in practice.
In the difficult economic and social conditions (to mention only increasing
unemployment and international debts), there is both a need for adequate, socially
sensitive and well balanced primary health care, and also a growing opposition to these
ideas. Under financial restrictions the weaker partner usually suffers more. This is a
decisive moment for future of primary health care and for the health of people in
general. There is no time to delay decisions or wait. The social aspects of primary health care are essential
Primary health care has to be organized according to social realities in which
communities live and work. Because of that, a variety of solutions might be expected.
Principles have to be applied with full understanding of conditions and with expectation
of changes in the period of dynamic development. The socio-economic relations,
community structures, differences in power and interest, existing communication and
other social networks have to be taken into account. There are also specific ecological
conditions which influence the differences in epidemiological situation, health risks and
needs.
The orientation of health care towards the needy and the underprivileged (rural
populations, youth, elderly, etc.) is one of the important principles. The growing
inequalities in health have to be opposed by an essential change in socio-economic
relations. The problem cannot be solved by establishing a second - class service for such
groups, as it is often in reality. Primary health care has to be differentiated from
"primitive" health care.

management of primary health care in developing countries. Training guide and
manual. Zagreb: Andrija Štampar School of Public Health, Medical School,
University of Zagreb, 1996. 515 Another social aspect of primary health care is covered by community
participation and involvement. Communities have to decide what they want in the
way of health care and how to achieve it. More than in any other field, there are many
false and disappointing ways by which this concept is put into practice. Unrealistic
expectations are raised, without changing the general social and political conditions.
New approach to the technology of primary health care is needed. In some
instances it will be sufficient to adapt existing technologies to needs, but many new ones
have to be developed. Self-care, group care and community care are few examples. In
reality, however "high-technology" approach has suppressed primary health care,
considering it only as a vehicle for delivery of services. Primary health care should be
developed as a health discipline in its own right. Research and education should
support this development.
Primary health care is expected to build a bridge between traditional and
contemporary specialized medicine. Therefore, it should be organized using the
intermediate and combined type of technology. It has to be different from haphazard
practices of traditional medicine and also from specialist polyclinics, which are regarded
as the prototype of medical "industry".
The organization of volunteers and support of free initiative might be examples
of success in practice, but continuity of activities should be secured, the reference and
communication with other parts of the health system provided and profit making
malpractice avoided. Organizational forms of primary health care
Different organizational solutions in implementation of PHC have to be expected
under different conditions, i.e. in individual countries and health systems. This does not
mean, however, that every solution is appropriate. Integration of health programmes,
interaction and coordination of work of health and other sectors, continuity and building
of permanent infrastructure are intended principles. In reality, a strong confrontation
among different programmes is a common finding. The controversy between
"selective" and "comprehensive" primary health care reflects deep differences in
political interests and social policies.
Primary health care is envisaged as a general solution for all types of
communities and all people. It was repeatedly stated that primary health care approach
should be the general answer to health needs of all people, regardless whether they live
in better developed areas or in poor and underprivileged circumstances, in urban or in
rural settings. However, very often primary health care is wrongly conceived as a
special project for delivery of health services for poor rural population. Some of these
population groups really need to have priority, but they should not be considered in
isolation. Primary health care is not a second class service for the underprivileged.
Different intentions are covered under the same name of PHC. For instance, the
role of hospitals in PHC is a very sensitive point: declarations and realities have to be
differentiated.
A system of community - based health centres provide a working model, but
bureaucratization and over institutionalization have to be avoided. Without strong 516 political commitment and planned intervention under the name of PHC a service will
develop with emphasis on medical cure and care.
The community-oriented health workers and family practitioners
(volunteers, auxiliaries, nurses, midwives and physicians), their team work and
leadership in the health field should be the focus of the system. They should be accepted
and close to local culture and because of that accepted by people. In reality their
attitudes, interests and training are often far from people's interest and culture. Besides,
their power and position in the hierarchy of health services are very low.
The implementation of PHC demands active support by the whole health
system. Among the most important requirements are the appropriate political
atmosphere, planning of adequate resources, reorientation of health workers,
intersectoral collaboration and networking of the involved institutions.
Verbal support is usually given to these PHC principles but restrictions are
imposed. Sometimes, the financial and best human resources are oriented to other parts
of the health system. Besides this, PHC is often organized as a special project to other
vertical health programmes. The networking is often formal and every sector carefully
watches its own resources.
There are differences between intentions and realities in implementation of PHC,
but at least intentions are now well formulated. They have to be protected from
corruption. Hard work and a long way are ahead.
The question is why the difference, the gap between intention and real practice is
still widening in many places. Is it because the economic conditions diminished
implementation, simply because not enough was done by responsible groups, or because
there is another intention hidden growing a “new vine in old bottles”. CASE STUDY
Organization of health care in Croatia
Health care services in Croatia are organized on three levels: primary, secondary and
tertiary.
Primary level: General/family medicine, paediatric, gynaecological and dental
practices, public health nursing, diagnostic laboratories and supporting services,
pharmacies. The core of primary health services in Croatia are general/family
medicine, paediatric services and community nurses.
Secondary level: county hospitals with specialized policlinics, specialized
hospitals for chronic diseases, county institutes of public health.
Tertiary level: teaching hospitals, clinical hospital centres and state's institutes
of health (e.g. National Institute of Public Health).
Facilities discharging health activities are either in state, county or private
ownership. Teaching hospitals, clinical hospital centres and state's institutes of health
are state owned. Health centres (“Home of Health”), polyclinics, general and special
hospitals, pharmacies, institutions for emergency medical aid, home care institutions
and county institutes of public health are county-owned. Polyclinics, pharmacies,
general practice and family medicine units, specialty medicine units, as well as
laboratories can be private.
Although the county is responsible for organization of the primary and
secondary level, the state for the tertiary level, the most important responsibility for 517 Table1. Health service delivery indicators

Source: Croatian Health Service Yearbook, Croatian National Institute of
Public Health 518 During 2003 and 2004 started a new intensive project of training of primary
physicians as family physicians (180 each year) with the financial support from
Croatian Health Insurance Institute (CHII). Some of health delivery indicators are
shown in table 1, and health services indicators in table 2. Financing and Reimbursement of Health Care
Two basic acts regulate health care and health insurance: Health Care Act and Health
Insurance Act. In accordance with the former, Croatian citizens have health insurance
based on the equal entitlement to overall health care with a high level of solidarity.
Health care in Croatia is financed from several sources. A major part of the
Croatian health system is financed according to the national health insurance model.
The funds are collected from the contributions from employees' salaries that are paid
by employers based on salary percentage, from the farmers' contributions, and from
transfers from the central government budget or county budget for certain categories
of the population. Croatian government budget is providing more than 85% of
funding for health care services (Croatian Health Insurance Institute-CHII funds are
collected from compulsory health insurance contributions that are paid from salaries
of insured persons). In Croatia health care allocations amount 9% of its GDP, which
is significantly higher in comparison to the CEE and SEE countries.
According to the Health Insurance Act in Croatia, there are three main health
insurance schemes: basic, supplementary and private health insurance.
Basic health insurance is compulsory and is provided by the Croatian Health
Insurance Institute (CHII). Supplementary health insurance is also provided by the
CHII as well as by private insurance companies. Private health insurance provides
higher standard of health services than provided by the basic, obligatory insurance
coverage.
The CHII insurance scheme provides basic health services to insured persons
through their legal right on the so-called 'package/basket of health services'. This
'package/basket' strictly identifies health care services covered by the CHII, as well as
health services that are paid through the supplementary health insurance scheme.
Apart from the participation charge, some health services are paid directly by
the patients, such as non - prescription drugs. The citizens pay full price for some
health services in private health institutions. This especially refers to dental health
care, specialist-consultation service, and some services provided at private
polyclinics, special state-owned or private hospitals (4). Access to health care
Every citizen has right to choose his/her own primary health medical doctor: general
practitioner/family physician or paediatrician (for children), and gynaecologist for
control of pregnancy and gynaecological problems. Parents can also choose the GP
for their children. This is mostly the case for the rural and underserved areas, but
recently also for urban areas in the case that GP is family physician specialist.
Individuals with chronic diseases are followed-up by general practitioners/ family
physician (or paediatrician for children). GP can ask advice from the specialist if 519 she/he can not solve the problem of the patient (diagnostic procedure,
recommendation for treatment). Prescriptions for the chronic patient are done by GP.
For acute patients the procedure is the same as for the chronic patient. In the
case of emergency, the emergency service is called by the patient or family.
Emergency cars (ambulances) are equipped by physician, technician and driver. After
health problem is solved by emergency services and hospital (if needed), patient will
continue his/her care by his/her own doctor.
Patients with long term care use the health services in the same way, if they
stay at home. If they need the nursing care there is community nursing service, what
can do nursing services in the home. Patients GP is asked to prescribe such services.
If patient needs such services for longer period than health insurance administration
should confirm such needs. If patient is not able to live at home there is possibility to
be hospitalized in the hospital for long term care, r she or he can go to elderly home.
Each elderly home has rooms for bed-ridden patients. Nursing care in such situation is
taken by nurses and assistant nurses employed by elderly home. Medical care in the
elderly home is provided by GP.
Dental care is at primary level and the access to this care is free for everybody.
Te most of dental care practices are private, but they have the contract with the health
insurance for free treatment of population.
Physiotherapy is organized at community level; patients need the referral ticket
from GP to the specialist (physiotherapist), who can order physiotherapy.
Patients can be seen by GP free of charge (before April, 2008 patients had to
pay tax of 10 kunas per visit – up to 30 kunas per month). For the use of specialist
service patient have to pay certain amount. This payment is covered by additional
voluntary insurance, and patients who have this type of insurance will not pay tax. EXERCISES
care Task 1: Compare of intentions and realities in primary health Primary health care is a crucial term for the studies in public health and related
specialties. It well known descriptive definition and explanation of meaning is described
in the Declaration of Alma Ata (2). There are several layers in the meaning of that term.
In this exercise we shall simplify it by speaking about principles and components or
elements of primary health care. Dividing these two aspects may help in clarifying the
exact meaning as we conceive it in practice.
You should answer the questionnaire individually and then compare the answers
with the opinion of others in the group. Individual and group attitudes, estimates and
judgements of principles and elements of primary health care as they appear "in theory"
and “in practice” will be specified.
In expressing your own opinion in the questionnaire you should consider real
circumstances. There are no good or bad answers, but differences in attitudes and
individual experiences. You will find that some questions are ambiguous and general so
that it is difficult to answer them. In such situations you should try to think in examples.
If you find differences between your answers and answers of your colleagues,
you will discover that speaking in concrete examples and pictures contributes to mutual 520 understanding far better than sophisticated abstract discussions. You will also find that,
the same example may be judged differently from different points of view.
When summarizing the experience in the group, consider that the most common
“miss – interpretations” of primary health care fall in some of the following categories:
PHC = primitive health care
PHC = peripheral (rural) health care
PHC = personal health care, primary medical care.
Besides, there are deep ideological controversies hidden under the term of
primary health care. Is it meant to be the same as basic health care, or is it selective or
comprehensive (integrated) PHC.
Expected outcomes for the task 1:
1. Answered questionnaire (see Annex)
2. Comments to answers, item by item, after consideration in your working group,
discussing particularly differences between optimal and actual, and among
situations in various countries.
3. Short summary report and suggestions to the plenary session. Task 2: Comparisons of primary health care under different
conditions
During the visits organized to different places in the country many data are collected
about different organizational patterns of primary health care services. This was
especially true for the old and new part of big urban areas and for rural areas with dense
as opposite to scattered populations. This exercise is aiming to summarize your
observations.

the plenary session of participants for consideration.
The organization of health services is directly or indirectly dependent on
population structure and dominant health problems, but also on tradition and leadership.
Consider inter-relations of these factors. What you can learn after comparing the visited
places with your own circumstances? Have you identified some elements or details
which would be useful for your services? Have you learned some negative experiences
to know what has to be avoided?
Expected outcomes for the task 2:
The table 3 has to be completed and compared with observations of colleagues. REFERENCES

HEALTH CARE
Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
A very frequent practical problem in planning and promoting health care is finding a
balance between selective and integrated, special and general. It is, for instance, a choice
between developing an infrastructure of primary health care units or stimulating specific
“vertical” programs.
Theoretically balancing special and general does not represent a problem. Both
are needed and inter-related. Apparently very selective programs can stimulate other
health activities in the community and in fact operate as a nucleus of an integrated
program. Programs which are called integrated may simply be just a collection of
selective and parallel programs.
In practice the dilemma has its social roots, and one has to understand what lies
behind one or another strategy. Centrally initiated projects usually have to show success
in a short time. Under these conditions selective programs may actively destroy the
existing health culture and infrastructure, but also blindly insisting on integration and
development off infrastructure to demonstrate achievement for political benefit of local
administration may also disrupt existing social networks and discourage people's
participation.
Another important aspect is the cost of integration. Integration and the resulting
complexity of services will increase the visible costs, but less compulsiveness and less
formal regulation will reduce human costs of integration. Different types of dilemmas
One may recognize at least four different types of headings under which appears the
described type of dilemma. Preventive versus curative services
The major division of health care appeared in many societies between private-curative and
public-preventive health care. This influenced all types of health services, hospitals and primary
health care units, as well as education of professionals and research. The opponents of
integration have been pointing out negative experiences with integration because preventive
services often have been "eaten up" by curative services. There have been reports, e.g. that
community health workers are spending all their time in curative activities, in contrast to
isolated vertical programs in which they performed "preventive" activities. But isolated
preventive activities (like screening without intervention) have not been unaccepted by people
and are a technical and ethical disgrace. The dispensary type of work was proposed as a model 527 of combined activities, and health centres as a combined organizational unit. However, a
permanent effort is needed to maintain the right balance. Vertical programs versus health services of primary infrastructure
A special service is used in vertical programs as a vehicle to provide necessary procedures and
activities to cover groups "at risk". This approach is based on a concept of functionalism, an
assumption that there exists a potent and available technology for major health problems. By
division of labour and procedures one may increase the effectiveness and even more the
efficiency of services solving one problem after another. This proved true in some instances
where assumptions were correct, but failed in most of others. Some targets were reached faster,
but the effect was only temporary. The coverage was increased on many occasions, but
contacts were intermittent, self-limiting and superficial. Services were often expensive, and the
beneficial consequences died out after the project was finished. The problem of integration of
vertical programs in general health services was widely recognized during the sixties and the
general disappointment with the effects was strongly expressed during the seventies, and in
Alma-Ata Conference. However, resistance to integration is often very strong, either because
of bureaucratic powers running special programs or because of different groups in the shadows,
interested in promoting a certain technology. Specialist approach versus generalist (holistic) approach
A special case of disintegration and selectiveness in general health services developed
with specialization of health workers and particularization of health sciences in many
separate disciplines. This disintegration was also developing inside some of the
special vertical programs mentioned above. Traditional medicine was, and is also
now, often specialized. With the development of new technologies the process has
speeded up. On one hand it is a sign of progress, but on the other we can observe
negative phenomena. Examples include the development of technology-oriented
front-line health workers, crippled by a failure to understand their role in society;
work of high level specialists on specific lines in artificial circumstances less and less
interested in seeing the health problem as whole and personal problems of the patient.
There has been an increase in such "dehumanization" of medicine and malpractice of
utilization of available resources, in which both patient and specialist are victims of
the system. This problem was recognized 10-20 years ago in many countries, but
solutions have been accepted with difficulties. Unequal distribution of the most
expensive technology is a consequence of social pressures and preserved under the
pretext that high quality has to be guaranteed by specialization. A consumer approach
predominates in many circles, stating that the most expensive is also the best. These
problems are very pressing in both developing and developed countries, although with
different numbers of people and on different levels. Health services versus community approach and self-care
This is disintegration of health services from other aspects of community life and health from
other sectors. This aspect of selectiveness is widely present, but not yet fully recognized and
completely understood. It is a complex problem involving understanding of social change in 528 communities and their influences on health, distribution of power decision- making,
recognition and acceptance of alternative organizations. In the last 10-15 years a breakthrough
was made in better understanding that lay people themselves are and should be active in health
care.
It is wrong to choose only one side: prevention or cure, vertical programs or
general services, specialists or generalists, health services or community involvement. It
is always both, but with different balances and a different focus according to
circumstances such as population density, kind of health problem, training of health
staff and changes in time. The decisive circumstances
The effects of special vertical programs are related to the fact are they connected with
an existing general permanent infrastructure in the community or built in a vacuum. The
permanent structure has to be reliable from the standpoint and experience of people. The
structure can be any of the following social institutions: local government, health units,
schools, political organizations, voluntary organizations, etc.
There are several characteristics of vertical programs which determine their role
in primary health care. One of them is the prevalence of health needs and technology
capable to solve the problem; example: smallpox eradication. Time needed to solve the
problem and terminate the program may be the critical issue.
The examples are centrally planned vertical programs to control some of the
endemic diseases.
With resistant problems in which the solution require active contribution of
people and changes in their behaviour, it is most important that special vertical
programs interact with local people and existing permanent communal services, like
schools, health units, voluntary organizations, etc. This is best seen in some
experimental and evaluation studies in the field of nutrition and sanitation.
In a situation where health services grow, it is common experience that some of
the vertical programs coexist side by side with general health services. To overcome this
separation, a formal "integration" is proposed so that working groups of a vertical
program are organized as separate units inside regular services. At least some
information and coordination of work are forced, and the problem of status or
differences in wages and salaries is diminished. Organizing such integration is often
very difficult because of changes in authorities and responsibilities, and a double
command arising as a management problem.
A similar situation may be produced following the division of labour inside
general health services, when some parts of programs grow fast and gradually organize
themselves as separate service units. We have a phenomenon that growing produces
disintegration. Maternal and child health, dispensaries for special diseases or separate
population groups, occupational
Health services, preventive services, etc. can demonstrate such a tendency inside
primary health care. If they additionally have or develop a separate authority on a higher
level of services or administration, there is a very similar situation which can happen
after formal integration of parts of vertical programs into general services. This is then
an apparently integrated service but actually functioning as a selective program. 529 Examples are common in services providing permanent health care for problems
considered to have great importance (MCH, tuberculosis control, cardiovascular
diseases, etc.). How to make the best balance
Selective approach and integrated approach may both have positive and negative
consequences, depending on time and circumstances. In that sense the two strategies are not
completely opposed. Positive consequences of selective approaches include:
•
•
•
• momentum in motivating people;
fast results;
increased coverage;
efficient use of certain specific resources.
Among negative consequences one may list: •
•
•
•
• limited duration of effects;
tendency to develop petrified structures;
waste in manpower;
development of narrow professional interests (separate kingdoms);
inefficient use of resources and poor participation of people in the long run. The integrated approach building into the permanent general
infrastructure has these potential advantages:
•
•
•
• interaction with people and supporting participation;
permanent long-range results;
equitable coverage (if this is one of the chosen aims);
motivating local resources and stimulating self-reliance. As negative consequences one may consider:
•
•
•
• "the drop in the sea" effect;
unfavourable results, such as prevention suppressed by curative services;
slow development;
"poor quality". In real life selectiveness and integration are the poles of the same system and the
time dimension is neglected: the transformation of services from differentiated to
integrated, and than again to differentiate is overlooked. The essential differences are
shown in Table 1.
In decision to foster one or another approach, the following arguments are
important:
1. Type of health needs which are prevalent or most important:
In circumstances in which chronic diseases and long lasting problems prevail, when
many multiple diseases and problems appear when prevention has to be stressed, 530 when psychological and social aspects are important, and when continuity of care is
needed - in all these situations an integrated approach has advantage.
2. Participation and involvement of people:
When a free choice of services and a closeness of services are needed, when equity
needs to be stressed, when one has to utilize potentials of primary groups (families,
voluntary organizations etc.) for health care, and when an inter-sectoral approach is
needed - the integrated approach again should be the first choice.
Table 1. Two understandings of primary health care (PHC)
SELECTIVE PHC COMPREHANSIVE PHC Main carrier Technical advancement Objective Solution of
problems Horizons Short-term Long-term Methodology Effective programs
(vertical initiation) Building local capabilities
(horizontal spread) Success criterion Evidence of efficacy Sustained self-reliance Typical vehicle Quantitative management Social action (qualitative) Impact Limited and temporary Slow
and
conditioned selected Community development
health Comprehensive
improvement health culturally 3. The socio-economic position of health services:
When financial restrictions are expected for a longer time, when a planned and
coordinated development of the whole system is desirable, when a tendency is visible
that there are dysfunctions in the system (inadequate training, poor management),
and when flexibility of the system in relation to changes in environment is needed - in
most of the described occasions the integrated strategy might be more useful.
4. The choice is never completely free. It depends on political circumstances:
To obtain full effect of developing an integrated infrastructure it is important that
decentralization, community participation and inter-sectoral approach are politically
stimulated. 531 EXERCISE
Task 1
Answer the following question: Was message of Alma-Ata Declaration development
of horizontal or vertical primary health care? You may check the recommended
readings. Task 2
Two groups of students should confront in arguing one for vertical programs and the
other for horizontal (comprehensive) primary health care. Task 3
Discuss in the small group: Why is idea of vertical programs and selective primary
care related to libertarian ideology and comprehensive primary care closer to social
and egalitarian attitudes? REFERENCES

THE NEW MILLENIUM
Želimir Jakšić THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
The future of hospitals and health services is a fashionable subject in the current
discussions at the turn of the century (and the millennium!) (1-8). Nevertheless, it is a
necessity because of different technical and economic pressures. Anyhow, it is a
challenge because of the complexity and uncertainties in dealing with one of the
oldest social institutions, deeply rooted in every culture. While forecasting, dreamers
and entrepreneurs meet to express their desires and interests. History has to be called
upon and future quested, the facts reviewed. Different practitioners everywhere hope
for new solutions. However, we know that most of predictions are regularly wrong
even in the short run. In spite of that, the exercise is useful as a chance for critical
consideration of complex facts. So, let us enjoy carefully, once again, our myths and
expectations. Past experience
There is an old saying that those who do not know their past do not have a future. Hospitals had
a glorious past (9). It may strengthen self-confidence and our myth that it has been one of the
basic institutions of our civilisation. It will continue to fulfil certain essential needs of people
being one of the strongest features of humanism, solidarity and charity, as well as of creative
potentials in science and technology.
During a long history, hospitals were continuously changing so that diversity is one of
their characteristics. Being a part of a local culture, they also reflect general global trends. At
present, the winds of globalisation are stronger, following an overall trend in technology and
economics.
This is producing social tensions and problems. In extreme examples, some prestigious
hospitals in many countries serve only the needs of powerful minorities and many expensive
technologies are misused at the expense of relevant primary health interventions for a broader
circle of poor people. Hospitals are here to stay, but appropriate “social diversity” has to be
protected for the benefit of people and efficiency of resource utilisation. A review of different types of hospitals
Speaking about types of European hospitals, we should consider them in the broadest way, not
only their shape and organisation, but also the main structural traits like mission and aims, or
position of staff and patients. For our purpose we will choose some which have played a greater
role in the history of Europe and which have influenced our thinking today. 534 When we start thinking about established institutions, we have to describe some of the
famous ancestors of hospitals (10):
• The Aesclepieian temples in Ancient Greece (where in front of statues of “saintmortal” Aesclepius, his daughters Hygiea and Panacea and other members of his
families, priests and priestesses interpreted oracles and ordered treatment); Figure 1. “Temple of Asclepious” in Split and hospitium in Zadar • Valetudinaria (originating from Latin word valetudo – health) and Thermae in
Roman Times where soldiers and civilians were searching for health. This early recorded examples were sacred places combining the powers of gods and
nature for recovering from illnesses, but also strengthening health and capabilities of people. In
the same places and with the same idea, we today have spas, rehabilitation centres,
thalassotherapeutic, recreational and tourist centres, etc.
Following these old European roots, we come to immediate ancestors:
• • Hospitia (original Latin meaning of places offering hospitality) were predecessors of
a number of hospitals developed by Christian religious orders in monasteries
widespread in the Middle Ages. Hospitia and these hospital served pilgrims,
travellers, poor people and others, following the traditional hospitality and seven
works of mercy.
As in the previous times the main aim was to reduce suffering but even more
important was to save souls. Very similar arrangements but at a smaller scale, as a
shelter for very old and chronically handicapped or ill or very poor, were organised
by priests and nuns in rural areas, close to parish churches, and sometimes by
neighbourhoods for people without relatives. Some of these continue to serve until
now. 535 Figure 2. “Aquae Iasae”, Varaždinske Toplice Figure 3. Hospital close to church, northern Croatia • A completely different mission had quarantines, lepper-houses, army creases,
military lazarettes, and poorhouses organised by local and urban governments at 536 about the same time. The aim was to protect the community and prevent the spread
of epidemics. Figure 4. The first quarantine, Dubrovnik • Younger hospitals in urban areas were off-springs of hospitals related to monasteries
and poorhouses, organised by public authorities to shelter ill people who could not
afford it themselves. They were run by physicians and sisters, so that treatment and
care were organised according to a new experience of medicine. On one hand, it were
help to suffering patients, and on the other serving to protect the urban community to
satisfy feelings of justice, solidarity and charity. In the 17th century they started to be
separate from asylums, and it was a real beginning of an institution which we now
call a hospital. It is difficult to regard present hospitals as direct successors of all these institutions
because medical science, technology and management changed thoroughly. In spite of that,
some of the principle perceptive can be found in most types of the present hospitals: general
hospitals, homes for the elderly and handicapped and similar socio-medical institutions, acute
and long-term hospitals, modern hospiciums for palliative care etc. are all closely related by
origin.
Modern technology, the birth of scientific medicine and development of
complex diagnostic and treatment technologies influenced several types of institutions:
• Specialised hospitals, dispersed (cottage hospitals) and pavilion-type hospitals reflect
also specialisation in medicine, different types of patients’ needs and relevant
technologies, difficulties in transportation in some areas, and better feelings of
patients. 537 Figure 5. City hospitals, Zagreb Figure 6. Sanatorium for tuberculous patients, Zagreb mountains • “Industrial” or mono-block hospitals were the result of concerns for costs, best use of
expensive technologies and experts. Mono-block hospitals are still most preferred. A
typical industrial hospital is efficient but presses the staff to work on-lines in an
industrial manner, contributing to developing narrow specialism. 538 Figure 7. “Industrial” mono-block hospital, Zagreb clinical hospital Lately, for various reasons, such as a changed medical technology, a growing
urbanisation, better means of communication, multi-morbidity etc. the division of hospitals to
special and general hospitals has gradually changed to classification of hospitals to acute (shortstay) and chronic (long-stay) hospitals.
This is a possible reminder of hospital heritage. What may one conclude? Let us
underline only general and lasting characteristics:
1. Importance, deep cultural influences and social embedding of hospital;
2. Distinct, closed and powerful structure, beyond the role as a unit of health services;
3. Diversity based on different mixtures of continuously same missions (caring for the needy,
enhancing social security and quality of life of ill people, protecting community, and
collecting experiences and teaching medical arts);
4. Capability of adapting to deep changes under the influence of external developments in
spite of solid general structure. Numerical data describing the present situation
In Europe is working about 30 000 hospitals and they employ the largest part of health workers,
representing 3% of the total workforce of Europe making one of the largest industries (11).
During the last decade in most European countries one can observe an increase of beds
in long-stay hospitals, while in acute hospitals the number of beds is slowly falling, and in the
same time the number of admissions is increasing. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate changes in the
period 1980-1998 in Europe (12-14).
In spite of the recent reforms and containment policies around 50% of physicians and
40% of health expenditures are spent by hospitals. Figure 10 illustrates recent situation in
Europe (12-14). 539 Figure 8. Number of hospital beds per 100 000 inhabitants Figure 9. In-patient care admissions per 100 inhabitants The differences among countries are evident and largely understandable, especially
between the North and the South, and the East and the West (12-14). They are understandable 540 because of the past developments and can be seen in most properties of care arrangements and
delivery patterns. Figure 10. Percentage of physicians working in hospitals As an illustration of striking differences in hospital data, interesting data are shown in
figure 11.
Northern countries count higher numbers of long-stay hospital beds and Eastern
countries short-stay hospital beds. Although negative correlation has been demonstrated
between the number of the first and the other, the relation is not strong and may be explained by
several extreme results and by the way how the beds are classified.
Many countries in Europe, except for Nordic countries, face the shortage of beds for
low intensity long-term care. This shortage combined with growing needs, undeveloped
conditions to support home care, unresolved tensions in financing and running a socio-medical
institution between health and social care authorities has pressed general hospitals by necessity
to mix together short and long-term care, and consequently work apparently inefficiently. Last available data for 1995 in comparison with those of 1986 are shown in
Table 1. Because of changes in administrative arrangements the comparisons during a longer
period are difficult or even impossible. One can recognize differences between established
market countries (EU) and CEE countries: rates describing admissions and length of stay in
acute care hospitals are higher in CEE countries. There is, however, even a greater difference
between Mediterranean and Nordic countries: higher rates of admissions and shorter length of
stay. One has to interpret it carefully because weighted averages are calculated from data
coming from different sources. In spite of that, one has to accept the fact that the differences
exist not only between the European East and West, but even more between the North and the
South (15). 541 992712 +Beds in nursing & elderly homes/10000: 1994 Relation of numbers of hospital beds in

countries in Europe, but there is also a general trend towards more admissions, shorter
length of stay and a growing number of beds in long-stay hospitals. An important
additional fact is that in most countries around half of physicians and 40% of
expenditures are used by hospitals. 542 Factors influencing the shape and type of hospitals
Hospitals have symbolically followed the path from a temple to a cathedral, and further on to
an industrial enterprise and “recreational” centre, always following the leading historical trends
and being close social powers.
However, hospitals of Europe live under rather different conditions predisposed not only to
different health needs and economic conditions but influenced even more by traditional social
and cultural factors. One important European issue was the role of the family and consequently
religious, political and social way of life, including the use of social institutions, etc. (16). A
number of factors were described in literature as influencing and gradually shaping the
hospitals (Figure 12 and Table 2). ADVANCES IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY FACTORS

ways. As it is presented the inner circle has a direct an immediate effect, and factors in the
outside circle have an important influence, which is visible only a longer period, possibly
several decades. The intermediate group of factors is most visible and re presents the main
concern for managers. Most of factors usually start influence from outside, but they launch
internal processes and may present themselves as being genuine.
The factors related to technological and managerial changes, spread fast and affecting
many countries, usually starting from the richest and often frustrating the poorest. Most experts
a priori regard them as progressive advancements, so they create a fashion and express
themselves as obvious internal needs. Their impact is direct and mostly connected with
essential technologies, medical and other, interfering with basic procedures. 543 Table 2. A tentative lists of factors influencing prospects of hospitals
INTERMEDIATE CIRCLE
• Rising costs of medical procedures and interventions
- social inequalities and poverty
- problems of privatisation and market mechanisms in heath fields
- government, charity, economics and social policies • Health policy
- general and family practice
- home care
- doctors and patients’ rights
- quality management
OUTER CIRCLE • Social circumstances
- diminishing family ties and breaking down of social networks
- age structure and trans-cultural migrations of populations
- mounting of violence and insecurity
- complex collaboration of charities, non-governmental organizations, free initiatives • Changes in health needs
- health problems of affluence (behavioural, obesity, …)
- alarming numbers of impaired, handicapped and dependent people
- higher pressure towards prevention and rehabilitation
- returning problems of infections and ecological threats
- addictions and mental problems • Higher level of education, information and expectations of people
- active partnership and participation in medical decisions
- awareness of limits of medicine and utilisation of complementary services
- protection of personal rights and moral concerns in relation to experts
- increasing prevalence of “minor” psycho-socio-medical problems with severe consequences
- tightly packed mixture of scientific facts and advertisements The next group of factors often causes tensions and subjective responses because they
are understood not as an objective necessity, but individual or group decisions and policies
expressing their interests. In that way they operate as external and also as internal factors. They
appear to be dynamic, but often looking for dynamics without change. Usually, their essential
nature can be recognised and judged only after some time.
The outer circle of factors is producing slow changes, regularly not noticed or ignored
as unimportant for some time. However, in the long run these factors are the most decisive
ones. They are bound to local conditions and might have a variety of meanings in different
countries, regions, or situations.
The majority of described factors start as external, but some is initiated from the inside
of an institution by a successful scientific or managerial group or a purposely built R&D
department. Recently, the Total Quality Management (TQM) has demonstrated an ambition to
stimulate such processes.
In considering the future changes of hospitals, one may systematically consider all
factors, recognise those most influential and find strategies to utilise them. 544 In summary, we may state several, at the first glance, contradictory statements:
• Hospitals, as deeply rooted cultural institutions, will survive. All main types of
hospitals (acute, long-stay, community and teaching) will continue to exist, but
will probably follow different ways. This statement may be illustrated by
monitoring of data about acute and long-term hospitals, as well as about the
number of admissions.
• Nevertheless, the old “citadel cannot hold” (17). A wave of alterations in
medical styles, becoming gradually more active in diagnostics and treatment,
will influence the opening towards community. Besides, the fast change of
medical technologies will ask for extremely flexible and permanent
innovations. The shift of functions, substitution of techniques, and relocation
of places is under way, as can be illustrated by a shorter average length of stay
in hospitals, emerging of hospices, spread of day-hospitals, growth of hospital
outreach services, etc. It is pending that some types of hospital should be
reinvented or developed.
• In a society longing to become hospital-free and declaring against institutionalisation,
one third of people might need traditional hospital help. Epidemic of old age, persistent
poverty at the level of 20% of people, socially induced pathology (violence, stress,
unemployment, insecurity), addicts, the infirm and handicapped, all produce a wide
range of needs oriented towards social and health institutions, because social support
and family resources are scarce. A great number of different types of institutions,
working units, associations, self-help groups etc. increase the need for improved
communication, and a greater effort for improved collaboration. Waves of health reforms
During the last decades there have been permanent waves of health reforms initiated
by international organisations and powerful political and economic centres (18-20).
During the seventies, Health for All policy (HFA) was globally spread together with
all other “for All” (egalitarian) policies initiated by United Nations. It stressed the
importance of community based primary health care, and was critical to the medical
establishment. It gained support in governments of many, especially developing
countries, but it faced resistance by groups of medical experts and some international
organisations. It was implemented in some developing countries as selective (vertical)
primary care. In most of developed countries it was transformed to a kind of primary
medical care based on teams of general practitioners. The reorientation of hospitals
was requested towards embedding it within the frames of health care as a support and
consulting agency of primary health care. The reduction in the number of hospital
beds was seen as important strategies to turn upside down the triangle representing the
health system with hospitals on top and primary health care at the bottom, particularly
regarding health expenditures. The most important point was equitable distribution of
services. The impact of HFA policy was slow, but improvements were globally
documented.
In the meantime, the economic and political situation changed from
favouring egalitarian to libertarian manner. It was largely ideological and political,
based on ideas of neoliberalism. The earthquake produced by the fall of the Berlin
wall prompted a tsunami of health reforms not only in countries being previously
behind the Iron curtain, but also in all other countries. It also divided international 545 agencies: on one side World Health Organisation, and on the other side World Bank
and other Bretton Woods institutions.

New integrated Transitions (?)
HFA/PHC New PH/Health promotion New HFA Strategies Egalitarian (socialist, left) health policies
Structural adjustment as a new economic and social policy produced the
Health reform as a policy for health sector. Health reform was an attempt to raise
health concern of people and stimulate medical productivity of health services by
pushing health into the area of private interests and competitive state of affairs.
Governments were under political and economic pressure from inside and from
international agencies to reduce (“target”) social provision and introduce competitive
and contractual conditions in public funds. Specifically in the health field, the
arrangements were made to separate providers from purchasers and to foster
competition among the providers. Health was largely regarded as a private good and
health care as a commodity trade. The expectations were to reach better quality of
services and higher productivity by spending less public resources. It was welcomed
in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe as a sign of freedom, a chance for
entrepreneurship and personal achievements, after years of shortages, suppression and
imposed discipline.
Although in a number of countries hospitals were partly protected from radical
changes, there were attempts in others to strengthen the competition among them as
providers by different means, including their “privatisation”. These efforts were not
always successful so that already in mid nineties the pendulum was swinging back.
However, the tendency to reduce the number of acute hospital beds continued and
their substitution by other types of services was promoted.
The described health reforms changed the previous picture of health services in
many countries but also destroyed some of the traditional resources without empirical
proof of advantages of market relations in comparison with Bismarck or Beveridge
principles in the field of health care. Besides, many reforms were under influence of 546 short-term expectations based on efficiency and narrowly conceived vertical health
programmes as is usual in projects influenced by outside donors. A considerable part
of liberated energy of health experts was lost in reorganisation and financial
management instead being used to improve health care provision. The greatest cost of
reforms was seen in the field of growing inequalities in health between the rich and
the poor, and also in ethnic majorities versus ethnic minorities, between genders, and
among different age groups. Deterioration of health condition of deprived social
groups was demonstrated in many developing and developed countries.
The political, monetary and trade powers supported irresistibly the spreading
of libertarian ideas to all corners of social life. It started to be a global phenomenon
during the last decade of the past century. It should have brought benefits through
liberalisation of trade and fast exchange of information. Because it is targeted towards
growth and productivity, the potential threats have been recognised in deterioration of
ecological conditions, suppression of local cultures, and prescription of political
solutions by big powers, because it appears that some people are more global than
others. Direct health damages are possible in human trades (migrations,
unemployment), spread of social diseases and violence, epidemics, power of
transnational corporations with trade and not health interests in medical industries and
similar.
In Table 4 possible perspectives of health systems in modern and post-modern
times are tentatively presented (21). Selected trends in technical and managerial
aspects of development are listed, mostly those in which changes one could witness
every day.

HEALTH TEAMS In Table 4 these characteristics are shown in parallel, indicating many inter-related
and complex processes one can expect. After considering changes in such a way, it
becomes clear that many and various results could be foreseen. Different
developments are possible in the future. Our individual activity in searching for the
best solutions might become the most relevant issue.
One has to conclude that the issue of health in the recent changes of health
policies remains unsettled. A search for a new balance between productivity and
equity in health is persistent. Is a third sustainable way just another utopia or a valid
possibility? Although it is a general political question, there is plenty of room for
technical innovations, which will finally decide the way of hospital perspective and
social practice. Two ways of thinking about the future mission
Missions declaring the outlook towards future are the result of different combinations
of two major ways of value systems. These diverse approaches developed to satisfy
different human needs and were presented already in the ancient myth about
daughters of Asclepious, Panacea and Hygieia. In the life of stationary health
institutions they were pictured in old hospicia and valetudinaria. They are evidently
present also today in different health policies, and consequently in different types of
hospitals (Table 5).

We may describe them in terms of present-day “Sacred cows”, the most au courant
concepts, so often quoted in the form of acronyms (Table 6).
However, it is difficult to differentiate them clearly because the terms have
changed their connotations. Quality and Equity are the best examples (24). Quality
has changed from the traditional meaning of a technical excellence of services
towards market oriented meaning of “satisfying people’s perceived needs and
demands”. Equity has changed from the traditional concept of an essential part of 548 human rights to equity in legal rights, fairness (“the art of possible”) and partnership
(“shared responsibility”) (25-27).
Table 6. Current opposite views in terms of “sacred cows”
QUALITY EQUITY EBM - Evidence Based Medicine PR – Patients’ Rights TQM – Total quality management H/FC – Home/Family Care PEL – Professionalism,
Leadership Ethics LO – Learning Organisations and PHC – Primary Health Care
PP – Patients’ Partnership
SS – Sustainability and Subsidiarity EE – Efficiency and Effectiveness So we have to conclude that in searching for the best definition of hospital
missions there is a tendency of moving towards integration, an attempt at least to
break through the traditional institutional walls, in spite of many real life difficulties. Current policies and their criticism
The missions are translated into policies. Among important policies, expected to solve
problems and also open new lasting perspectives, we may identify the following:
• new health market reforms, informed patients’ participation - The patient-centred
hospital;
• the change in contents, orientation towards health and quality of life - The healthy
hospital;
• quality management, based on “learning organisations” - The learning hospital;
• conservative elitist approach: Hospital as the centre of excellence;
• close relations inside the health system, especially primary health care, supporting
initiatives such as “hospital at home” - The collaborative, “well embedded” hospital.
There is a positive intention in each of the mentioned policies and in some of the
examples of their implementation. A combination of them in different quantities may fit to
needs and wishes of hospitals in different situations. At the same time they raise opponents and
consequently difficulties and constraints.
Patient-centred hospital
Patient-centred hospital in its full meaning should not be just a hospital where all services are
organised around patients but where both the patients and the public are well informed about
their work and performance and could participate in decisions on strategies for development
(28,29). It obviously could help in communication, and “marketing”, but the decision making
process should not be delayed or distorted. It also raises a far reaching question, how much of
medical “secrets” one should “disclose” to the public? Nobody is apparently waiting for the
answer, the process is already running. (See, for instance, web sites of National Committee for 549 Quality Assurance, Health Care Report Cards, etc.). The time will tell us if it is going to be
related to benefits and detriments of patients, medical experts and hospitals as institutions.
The pending questions about tactics remain:
1. Is it wise to change the tradition at the time of growing alternatives emerging in the
market not even thinking about presenting the objective results of their work?
2. Are all parts of the health system willing to start the same and how could it be
controlled?
Health Promoting Hospital
The European Pilot Project supported by World Health Organization is now over then 10 years
old (11,30). The Budapest Declaration of 1991 specified strategies and responsibilities of
potential participants in an international network. It was followed by a formal Agreement
(1993) and Vienna Recommendations. The core group of 20 hospitals evaluated and reported
an impressive set of sub-projects. Subprojects were related to health of patients (patient
satisfaction, nutrition, health education, rehabilitation, hygiene and safety), to health of staff, to
health of community (promoting children health, prevention of accidents, control of
alcoholism, young people information service, etc.), and to metaphorically conceived “healthy
organization” of hospitals (effective communication with patients, decentralization, networking
etc.). Largely, the projects are improving and complementing hospital services, building outreach services, and better networking with others, aiming to involve or influence a broader
group of European hospitals. Most of the participants at present are in the group of hospitals
with 200-500 beds. Obviously, one has to consider new roles of different types of hospitals to
avoid a change of terms only and to avoid mixing of roles with different other partners in the
health system, particularly primary health care. The critical points consider a potential problem
in building new hospital based outreach services using the existing resources in an expensive
way.
Learning hospital
The development of learning/teaching networks supported by modern technologies of
interactive tele-communication seems unavoidable. Sooner or later most health institutions will
be interconnected (“virtual integration”), without vertical integration, grounding great potential
gains (31-33). As a simple start one may describe a project called EuroTransMed. It involves a
growing number of several hundred hospitals in Europe for lunch-time interactive lectures
every Tuesday during the teaching semesters. These are coded satellite lectures and discussions
in real time.
Several similar national networks exist in countries of Europe. Many world-wide
possibilities are open through the Internet. The critical point is not how to get information but
how to choose the right ones and organise their use. The flood of information may be
counterproductive, thus increasing the danger of hidden control by sponsors and others looking
for their individual interests and not for common benefit. It is not at all an easy task for users to
judge the quality of information. The clearing and control of information, on the other side,
may destroy all potential benefits. Some applications of tele-medicine might suppress the local
expertise and experience instead of supporting it. Often it is easier to teach others than to learn
ourselves.
Centres of excellence
Centre of excellences are important as references for quality and as the only way to organise
and protect one’s own values and rationality in the field of technology transfer under pressures
of global economics. There are many unresolved questions (34,35). Should centres of
excellence be nominated or let to develop? They could get more resources and a “trade name”, 550 so that many would like to be considered for such a position. The essential factor for success is
an able team of experts with a wide understanding of local health culture and policies,
potentials and needs, and at the same time practicing scientific approach and rigour. Experts
have to show outstandingly firm integrity. Such teams develop over years. Further structural
questions are: Would it be better to concentrate teams in one place (centralised approach) or
distribute and disperse them in several institutions? Are teaching hospitals by definition centres
of excellence? There is not a pattern showing definitive advantages and the answers depend on
local conditions (36). Therefore, this policy will be open to permanent local struggles and a
political issue in most countries.
Collaborative hospital
Collaborative hospital is the objective of a broadly supported policy. One can state that it is
widely accepted, but rarely realised (6,37-39). The immediate problem of collaboration is that
all those who should collaborate are counting on the same resources and because of that they do
not trust each other. The other problem is that often hospitals are bigger and stronger
institutions and may dictate conditions for collaboration. One of the major difficulties is rather
deep mutual misunderstanding with others because of multiple essential differences. One can
demonstrate it by considering just a few basic differences between hospitals and primary health
care units (Table 7).

In summary, all described policies look acceptable and sound well. However, they have
their shortcomings. It is understandable that many hospitals are cautious, as well as their
partners in health field and in circle of policy decision-makers. How could somebody believe
that the most powerful of all health institutions will start to change beyond what is necessary for
marketing purposes and their own interests? The way to show a substantial interest is not to
declare intentions in big words but to start changes and evaluate them step by step. Should one consider new types of hospitals?
The form and name of hospitals will change. We already observe spring ups, such as “hospital
substitutes”, “hospitals without beds” (day care hospitals), “hospitals at home”, “virtual
hospitals”, “tele-medical hospitals” etc. (40-43). There is a great interest for comparing and
evaluating in-patient hospital care and home care 23, 44-50). One has to conclude that new
types of hospitals are probable and one has to be prepared for changes. It might be important to
consider new types built on foundations of the existing hospitals.
Deep changes have to be expected because of changes in technology. There are already
experiences how to deal with them. After a certain time of adaptation, finally one has to build a
new structure, which is new, in spite of carrying the old name. The other kind of change is
under pressure of people’s needs and demands. In this case new buildings might be constructed 551 based on old concepts but often under a new attractive name. The new name shows a tendency
to cover bad feelings and experiences with the traditional institutions, although the contents
might be similar.
Under such circumstances the answer to the posed question whether reforms or
(re)inventions would be needed should be – both is probable. For instance, reform of teaching
hospitals might be needed, invention of health oriented contemporary valetudinaria (as it is
described bellow) and reinventing of new community hospitals (as it is described later under
the title of Case study). The teaching hospital
A traditional teaching hospital fulfilled tasks in research, training and the most complicated part
of medical treatment (“tertiary health care level”). It was always complex and difficult, but now
it has become almost impossibility. As a consequence, one may observe a movement in
different directions.
In most teaching hospitals the research part became the biggest and started to dominate the
other two functions. Among other reasons, not an unimportant one is to get resources from
research funds, in many countries more copious than health and educational funds.
Consequently the stay of patients in teaching hospitals is shortened and applied technologies are
sophisticated. Medical services are focused on diagnosis, most complicating treatment
procedures and critical events. In that way, clinical training of undergraduates is narrowed to
demonstrations using training environment suitable mostly for postgraduate training of
specialists.
Teaching hospitals encompassing larger parts in different research fields and absorbing
more experts became large institutions, or a system of interconnected institutions. In some
examples, this caused them to play a role of a separate part and isolated them from the general
health system. The problem of relative isolation led them away to research irrelevant for
practice of health care for the time being, and oriented more towards international relations than
problems at home.
A related problem is that teaching hospitals are linked to health sector in the
government and to universities. To solve that in the few countries where teaching hospitals
have not grown too big, teaching hospitals alone with all other capacities for education of health
workers were put in the centre of the system in charge to manage regional health care. That was
reported to be beneficial for relevant teaching, quality of regional health care, research oriented
towards current local problems, but hindering capacity to follow advances in basic biomedical
sciences and guarantee prompt and safe transfer of technologies.
In other cases the system was purposely dispersed, and diverse hospitals and institutions
took over parts of previous tasks of teaching hospitals in training or research. Co-ordination and
rational use of resources became a problem and efficiency was questioned. In spite of that, for
most countries a decentralised system is a necessity. The empirical evidence has not provided
proof that large institutions are more efficient.
In the times of globalisation, it has become more important how the teaching hospitals
will serve as a bridge between countries, while protection against hostile international market is
growing. Therefore, the reform of the complex traditionally called teaching hospital is on top of
priorities, even though the solutions are not obvious.
The experience from Croatia today demonstrates a situation of a small country with a
recent war and poor economic situation and a system in transition to libertarian market
conditions. Our teaching hospitals are largely decentralised, poorly co-ordinated and so far
mostly swinging between tasks of tertiary care and education. Some important research 552 institutions have been built separately. Our teaching hospitals have a certain regional influence
but not a built-up responsibility neither for development of services nor for inter-regional and
inter-national collaboration. The shortage of resources for all sectors covered by teaching
hospitals (scientific research, health care and education) is at present hiding deficiencies and
diverse interests inside institutions, diminishing the total production and generating
inappropriate quality of work. The new valetudinarium (a public rehabilitation and training
centre)
It is well known that the change in population structure of Europe and increased longevity
produces greater need for care of the infirm, disabled and lonely persons as well as a growing
concern for health, fitness and interest for active recreation. More people need help to warrant
better quality of life, rehabilitate their physical, psychological and social functions, to prevent
the deterioration of their conditions and to care about themselves. These demands are not new
but we have recently been in the middle of an epidemic situation and reasonable forecasts tell
us that after 2010-15 and later it has to be expected to become a normal endemic situation in all
countries of Europe. A new understanding for these needs will certainly develop, because no
feasible solution is possible following traditional or modern approaches. The vicious circle
should be transformed into virtuous circle (51) (Figure 13). “From vicious to virtuous circle” G. Wistow “SUBSTITUTION”

HOME CARE VALETUDINARIA Figure 13. From vicious to virtuous circle The role of hospitals in turning the vicious to virtuous circle is multiple and important.
It has to prevent the increasing admission rates by developing better relations with primary
services and develop “substitute” and out-reach services (community hospital). The long-stay
hospitals and nurseries need to intensify rehabilitation efforts and assure the continuation of
rehabilitation at home and in the communities.
These core tasks in caring for the elderly, infirm and handicapped have always been
distributed among families, neighbourhoods and special kinds of public institutions (like
valetudinaria, spas and asylums), usually supported by voluntary and religious organisations. 553 As the family role diminished dramatically, particularly in countries and in a period of unseen
increase of material standard of life, the pressure for social intervention increased and produced
a panic among governments and social services. The pressure is felt also in hospitals. Reaction
to that is seen in three directions: a) development of hospices specialised for palliative care, b)
various attempts to combine health care with recreational, tourist, climatic, rehabilitative
enterprises, aiming predominantly to health protection and promotion, c) support to home care
like “hospital at home”, etc.
In all these developments there is a common denominator in the basic philosophy
(assisting and enabling for better quality of life), and a similar set of techniques originating from
rehabilitation of disabled persons. It is characterised by personal approach to mental and
physical functions of each individual but also care for his work opportunities, home and social
environment. To these are added clinical experiences in dealing with specific functional
problems and introduction of proper behavioural attitudes towards preventive and promotive
health activities. An outstanding role is seen in activating the handicapped themselves in all
spheres of life, and particularly in appropriate physical activities, what is still restrained in
contemporary medical practice. One could say that in the coming years the rehabilitation and
prevention will become a relevant general medical approach and unavoidable for successful
treatment and healing.
The question is how on the basis of the present institution one could envisage structure
and functions of a new valetudinarium supporting home and primary care services in helping
people to sustain their functional abilities and what is fashionably called “quality of life”. It
might be looked upon as a dominant and appreciated institution in the circle of the hospital
family. Many technical and organisational questions are left to be answered and answers might
be different according to local cultures what should prevail: the Nordic activism, the
Mediterranean takes it easy art of life, or the Central-European orderly regime? The main
challenge would be co-ordination and support of resources existing in the families,
neighbourhoods and communities as well as primary health and medical resources? CASE STUDY
An experience from Croatia
As in many countries in Central Europe, there was a popular tradition in Croatia to treat people
in spas, so that inns and traditional hospices, later hotels and hospitals, and finally rehabilitation
centres were raised around them. Moreover, rehabilitation was organised in hospital
departments of general and some special hospitals (e.g. traumatology), and at last also in special
institutes connected with teaching hospitals. The popular treatment of rheumatic troubles of the
elderly and other handicapped, of a growing number of injured in traffic accidents etc. was
performed in hospitals or by outreach units of hospitals, while primary health care was largely
left out and treated the major group of the same patients by pharmacological means. This was a
double, expensive and disintegrated way of rehabilitation process gradually discouraged by
limitation of insurance funds.
During the last war, because of many wounded and disabled persons, a project was
launched with international help to start Community Based Rehabilitation (52). It started in
difficult times and developed as a separate project with evident advantages. However,
misunderstandings and resistance were strong, based on traditional attitudes about medical
rehabilitation as a hospital specialty and little interest of primary health centre to be involved.
Many other needs and demands have been identified in local communities besides disabilities
of war victims. It was also shown that community based rehabilitation was an effective and 554 efficient component making the whole rehabilitation system less expensive and improving the
final results. In spite of that, after the greatest post-war needs have been over, the project lost
support. The question remained if Community Based Rehabilitation could survive competition,
misunderstandings and all kinds of passive and active resistance. It might happen that a new
type of open door institution has to face the same type of difficulties. A new community-based personal hospital
When we consider possible changes of hospitals expecting benefits for the entire health system,
a community hospital may have the priority. It should become a centre for regional coordination of health services, a local focus for accumulation and transfer of knowledge and
experiences. The idea is that smaller regional or sub-regional hospitals should be transformed
into an institution functioning as a vital local support of primary health care and general/family
practitioners, as well as social care and socio-medical institution for palliative care, community
based rehabilitation units, etc. This might be a new community hospital (53).
The community hospital itself should be a combination of a traditional general hospital,
a health promotion hospital and a learning hospital. Its characteristics might be described with
the following attributes:
• short-term (neither ultra acute, one day hospital without beds, nor predominantly a
long-term hospital);
• general (not specialized for any particular disease);
• middle sized (200-400 beds) (54);
• active in health promotion, prevention and rehabilitation;
• community oriented, transparent and visible to the community,
• performing and supporting some of out-reach, home-centred health care activities;
• flexible in organization and arrangements;
• keeping open door policy for local health experts;
• performing and supporting teaching and research as part of quality assurance.
The dynamics of changes in the described direction will differ, but probably speedingup in the coming years. This is clearly a common and important element of a renewed system
of hospitals.
We will describe now our experiences in some details. A warning from the Croatian experience
The history of hospitals in Croatia was similar to those in the Southern Europe, and later in the
18th century to the Middle Europe, namely the Habsburg Empire. The strongest impulse to
organization of health care at the territory of the former Yugoslavia was the work of A.
Štampar after the World War I. His socio-medical views were oriented towards “people’s
health”. With great energy and skill he created a system of Institutes of Public Health and
health centres. Active in the League of Nations and having been one of the founders of the
World Health Organization, Stampar was known as a “bear of the Balkans” because of his
energy and, recently, as “the grandfather of primary care” because of his principles (55).
Hospitals were not his stronghold and he could understand them only as a supportive part of a
comprehensive health system. In his time, hospitals were isolated as centres of medical and
social power. To balance that power and private practitioners, his strategy was to develop
health and equity oriented primary care.
On these foundations it was not by chance that later “Andrija Štampar” School of
Public Health started in Zagreb the first vocational training of general practitioners 555 (“specialization” in general practice, Professor A. Vuletić). A network of health centres was
spread throughout the country, consisting of services provided by GPs and by dispensaries for
socially important maternal and child health, tuberculosis, and other public health activities. At
the same time, “stationary capacities” were built, as an expression of a tendency towards
regional self-sufficiency. The tensions between hospitals and primary services, well known in
many countries, were pronounced.
In those circumstances, integration of hospitals with other services was early
recognized as a problem. In regional centres for a territory up to 200 000 inhabitants, the merge
of general hospitals with all other outpatient, public health and primary care units into one
organization, started in 1957 and was in full strength in 1970. The organization was called
“Medical centre” and 24-25 of them comprised practically all general hospitals in provincial
towns, except 8 in four biggest towns of the Republic (56). Medical centres were meant to
functionally interweave prevention and care, in- and out-patient services, even allowing
interchange of physicians in and out of hospitals in the same disciplines or services. The
marriage existed for more than 20 years with ups and downs, but rarely fully meeting their
original objectives. Evaluation studies showed that the success shown in better efficiency was
largely dependent on local managers who could envisage and insist on a mission of integrated
health care. Without that additional leadership the organizations were lost in solving individual
problems separately, further dividing interests with an additional problem of hidden transfer of
resources to the stronger part, which was the stationary part in the hospital. Finally, just before
the divorce, the flow of resources was legally stopped, so that only administrative frame
remained from the original idea of integration.
This experience might be important in consideration of the future of hospitals as a
warning not against the idea but about the difficulties in the implementation. Unfortunately,
because of coincidence of many external economic and political factors influencing the
described outcomes, the main reasons for failure have never been clearly identified. Concluding summary
1. Considering the future, we have to understand our limits. We may put together our best
wishes but we will never reach the actual future surprise and shock. However, by
formulating our expectations we contribute to the wide stream of development. The
future is not only in adaptation to turbulence of history and solution of present
problems, but in contribution by innovations, experiments and daring to change. The
solution is in openness to new perspective while swimming in the main stream, and not
in protecting the old citadel.
2. The hospital will continue to exist as an important part of a health system. Rather, it will
develop in many diverse types of hospitals in the four main classes:
• group of high-level institutes and hospitals enabled for scientific research and
advanced teaching
• “innovated” community/regional hospitals making the backbone of stationary
services, built into the local network of health and social services, with special
concern for acute and critical episodes of medical and personal needs of patients
• long-term hospitals in many forms of combined health and social institution
according to local traditions and cultures
• group of institutions (“valetudinaria”) concentrating facilities oriented towards
health promotion, relaxation and rehabilitation, attracting a wide range of
people and placed in attractive natural resorts. 556 3. The hospitals share the destiny with other social institutions influenced by:
• socio-economic factors such as ageing structure of populations, economic
inequalities, immigrants, growth of tensions and violence, problems of
affluence
• fast medical and technological changes in surgery, genetic and molecular
interventions and other altering deeply the present medical treatment
• needs, expectations and attitudes of patients, customers and the public
• shortages in appropriate staff for human personal care, inter-disciplinarity of
staffing and other shifting in human health resources
4. In spite of strong influence of the globalization trends, there will continue diversity in
attitudes and running-styles of hospitals in different parts of Europe in accordance with
different social, cultural and religious traditions, social policies, role of states, position
of families and local communities, etc. There will be unstable mixing of five
historically developed pivots: Nordic and Mediterranean, East and West, with a discrete
Middle, with possible addition of substantial newcomers outside Europe.
5. Relations and opening to surrounding community might be a promising strategy for
most of hospitals (except some national teaching hospitals). In the long run, it might
prove superior to closing, defending the gained position or relying predominantly on
trans-national medical and pharmaceutical power structures. In sustaining lasting
relations with communities win/win strategy should dominate, relying on proper
initiatives, collaboration, stimulation and support, avoiding whenever possible the
win/lose philosophy, based on replacement or suppression of other local resources and
tendency to market domination.
6. It is time challenging leadership and management of hospitals. Open-minded flexibility
and entrepreneurship has to be combined with wisdom and critical professionalism.
The investment in development of experts and stimulating work conditions has to be
balanced with comfort, privacy and satisfaction of personal needs and rights of patients.
Support of inter- and trans-disciplinary teams and networking with other institutions are
among the most difficult tasks, equal only to survival in flood of information and
diversity of unexpected day-to-day running problems. EXERCISE
Recipe for the future: Firm mission and flexible management
Let us for a moment to be a captain steering a big solid ship (such as hospitals are). Standing at
its commanding deck, the captain is carefully watching the main, the map and the instruments.
What will he find? He will easily spot many swimmers around, trying to climb the deck of the
ship, but also many small boats and rafts trying to catch those swimmers (for good, or for
bad?). It will disappoint him to observe how some of the passengers, for non understandable
reasons, jump into the water and swim to small rowing boats and rafts. At the same time, he
will continuously feel in the air strong winds pushing forward new technologies. The
instruments will show him the high atmospheric pressure of globalization (for good, or for
bad?). Looking forward he is aware of dangers threatening his ship by under cliffs and reefs of
publicizing data dealing with safety and efficacy of his services. Besides, the members of his
crew repeatedly warn him that water is penetrating different parts of the ship and that it is very
difficult to follow exactly his orders and manoeuvres. 557 Task
What can he do, and how would he like his ship to be transformed? First, one has to
consider the actual situation. The situation because varies in different countries, local
circumstances and is permanently changing. Prepare data for selected country, analyse and
discuss the situation in small group and present it in panel.
Point of consideration
However, in all conditions there will be time to respond along with general
managerial rules and local style. In most cases a rather aggressive re-adaptation will
be necessary (28,57,58). Here are recalled several adequate rules:
• Changes in technologies will induce changes in management (“new plants do
not survive in old pots”). For instance, new imaging technologies need a better
clinical feed-back, and the pattern of “industry-like” hospital, where specialists
work in their narrow fields on a production-line becomes inappropriate for
them.
• Human resource management becomes more important than economic and
technical management dominating at present.
• Innovations and flexible organisation become more important than
maintenance and survival strategies, so often applied in critical situations.
• Autonomy (responsibility and accountability) is needed, but more important
are agreed rules of behaviour than encouragement of anarchy.
Management has to develop magic communication skills (what types of skills) being
sensitive to requirements of patients (customers), to appreciate professional freedom of experts
and to improve relations with competing and sometimes unscrupulous rivals in the market.

Mental health prevention, mental health promotion, Slovenia
After completing this module, students should have increased
knowledge about mental health, and they should be aware of the
magnitude of the mental health problem in Europe and understand the
major obstacles for mental health service and mental health prevention
planning.
Mental health conceptualize a state of well-being, perceived self
efficacy, competence, autonomy, intergenerational dependence and
recognition of the ability to realize one's intellectual and emotional
potential. Mental health care are services provided to individuals or
communities by agents of the health services or professions to
promote, maintain, monitor, or restore mental health. Students will
become familiar with extensiveness of the problem, and levels of
preventing it. It is illustrated by the case of Slovenia.
Teaching methods include lectures, exercises, individual work,
interactive methods such as small group discussions, seminars etc.
Plenary lectures are followed by discussion and project work in
exercises. The work is done partly individually and partly in small
groups.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Definitions and explanation of basic terms
Mental health
According to World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is more than the
mere lack of mental disorder (1-3). The WHO states that mental health
conceptualize a state of well-being, perceived self efficacy, competence,
autonomy, intergenerational dependence and recognition of the ability to realize
one's intellectual, and emotional potential. It is also a state in which the individual
realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his/her
community (4). In this positive sense, mental health is the foundation for wellbeing and effective functioning for an individual and for the community. This
core concept of mental health is consistent with its wide and varied interpretation
across cultures (4). Mental disorder
Mental disorder refers to a psychological or physiological pattern that occurs in an
individual and is usually associated with distress or disability that is not expected as
part of normal development or culture. It is any of various conditions characterized
by impairment of an individual's normal cognitive, emotional, or behavioural
functioning, and caused by social, psychological, biochemical, genetic, or other
factors, such as infection or head trauma (5). Mental health care
According to Last et al. (6), health care are services provided to individuals or
communities by agents of the health services or professions to promote, maintain,
monitor, or restore health. Health care is not limited to medical care, which implies
therapeutic action by or under the supervision of a physician. According to this
general definition of health care, mental health care are services provided to
individuals or communities by agents of the health services or professions to
promote, maintain, monitor, or restore mental health. Mental health services
According to Last et al. (6), health services are services that are performed by
health care professionals or by others under their direction, for the purpose of
promoting, maintaining, or restoring health. In addition to personal health care,
health services include measures for health protection, health promotion, and
disease prevention. According to this general definition of health services, we could
define mental health services as services that are performed by mental health care
professionals or by others under their direction, for the purpose of promoting,
maintaining, or restoring mental health of a population. 562 Community mental health
Community mental health is a decentralized pattern of mental health, mental health
care, or other services for people with mental diseases accessible and responsive to
local needs because it is based in a variety of community settings. Community
mental health assessment, which has grown into a science called psychiatric
epidemiology, is a field of research measuring rates of mental disorder upon which
mental health care systems can be developed and evaluated (7). Mental health prevention
General concept of disease prevention and its levels (primordial, primary,
secondary, and tertiary; detailed description of these levels is out of scope of this
module) (6), can be applied to all different fields of population health, also to the
field of mental health. Mental health prevention could be described as interventions
to avert the initial onset of mental disorder, interventions to treat these disorders
and prevent comorbidity and interventions used to prevent relapse, and disability. Mental hygiene
In public health, the concept of “mental hygiene” is more and more important. Felix
and Bowers (8) defined mental hygiene as knowledge and skills requisite to reduce
mental disorders and maintain mental health. Levels of mental health prevention
Before discussing levels of mental health prevention according to public health
classification, we need to expose one of most important supportive elements not
only for primordial level of prevention, where is usually classified, but for all levels
of mental health prevention - a healthy mental health policy - a special document,
containing the goals for improving the mental health situation of the country at all
levels (9).
Like mental health policy, also stigma as negative companion, and one of
the most responsible causes for social exclusion of people with mental disorders,
and undertreatment, is penetrating all levels of mental health prevention.
Combating stigma should be present at all levels of mental health prevention, and
public education in this respect should be one of the most important efforts of
public health. There already exist programmes for combating stigma, one of the
most prominent being World Psychiatric Association “Schizophrenia. Open the
doors” that mission is to dispel the myths and misunderstandings surrounding
schizophrenia. Stigma creates a vicious cycle of alienation and discrimination which
can lead to social isolation, inability to work, alcohol or drug abuse, homelessness, or
excessive institutionalization, all of which decrease the chance of recovery (10). On
the other hand, those affected need to be encouraged to seek mental health
prevention treatment (e.g. psychotherapy, and support groups).
Similarly as in prevention of other disease groups, also in mental
disorders we divide prevention in four groups, being primordial, primary,
secondary and tertiary. 563 Primordial prevention
Primordial level of mental health prevention is aiming at keeping mental disorders
from ever occurring.
Activities at this level are mainly focused at total population and are acting
by using non-specific measures. The most important activities are taken at the
field of:
1. Policy
In this category mental health policy (healthy mental health policy), and
social policy targeting reduction of social exclusion, unemployment and
stigma, are classified.
Stable and supportive political system, secure environment
supporting violence prevention, good housing conditions, good and
.accessible educational system, good employment policy, and good care for
occupational health are of great importance for well-being of an individual
and population, and also determine mental health of a population.
Reducing unemployment and enhancing job security, that both proved to
be one of the main primary prevention actions in mental health, since
unemployment is strongly connected with anxiety, depression and
substance abuse.
2. Health promotion
Mental health promotion with providing mental health supportive social
environments, especially to endangered and vulnerable population groups
(e.g. mothers and young children, workplace mental health promotion,
addiction prevention programmes, etc.), as well as promoting healthy
environment on general (healthy food supplies, accessible transport, etc.) is
the next category.,
Mental health promotion is defined as a process of enabling people to
increase control over the determinants of their mental well-being and to
improve it (9). It covers a variety of strategies, all aimed at having a positive
impact on mental health.
Like all health promotion, mental health promotion involves actions
that create living conditions and environments to support mental health and
allow people to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles. This includes a range
of actions that increase the chances of more people experiencing better
mental health at the community level (4). Examples of mental health
promotion interventions include (11):
• improving the social environments in schools,
• designing facilities to encourage meeting and social interaction in
communities,
• promotion of healthy lifestyle,
• follow up and support for healthy and good parenting,
• promoting healthy upbringing and education,
• workplace mental health promotion campaigns, etc.
The key areas of mental health promotion in the community to be addressed
are therefore directed to:
• reducing work-related stress, including unemployment, and
underemployment, but main focus is in reducing stressful working 564 conditions. Educational programmes for employers and employees
about mental distress and mental disorders and prevention are
recommended. The Scottish programme Health on the Workplace, for
example rewards employers for their interest in healthy and
motivating environment and for preventing sick leaves. Similar
initiatives are emerging also in Slovenia in last years,
• campaigning for access to education and fighting against poverty and
social exclusion are cornerstones of social policy directed towards
better mental health of the population (12). Programmes for reducing
poverty and social exclusion, this is programmes for reducing
homelessness, racism, discrimination and stigmatization are one of the
main weapons for reducing the rising mental health morbidity in
Europe, as well as in Slovenia (13),
• social support with friendship, good social relations and strong
supportive networks improve mental health. Good social relationship
reduce the physiological response to stress,
• stress prevention programmes with campaigning for leisure and
recreational activities are further preventive measures. Access to relief
and rest and recreation in leisure time are included. Body-mind
techniques for relaxation could prevent a great deal of distress, and
consecutively outbreak of mental disorders in some individuals, as
well as other diseases.
3. Self-care
At the individual level taking measures of self-care by practicing healthy
lifestyles and learning of skills for coping with stress (mental hygiene) is
very important part of good mental health (8,11). Primary prevention
Primary level of mental health prevention is, like primordial level, also aiming at
keeping mental diseases from ever occurring, but it is dealing with endangered and
vulnerable population groups (e.g. adolescents, pregnant women, people in
employment, disabled, old people etc.) and is acting by using more specific
measures like health education. Examples of primary mental disease prevention
interventions include:
1. prenatal care and education about parenting,
2. support after childbirth with counselling and practical help in breastfeeding
and reducing tension and fatigue,
3. financial and social support to families at social risk,
4. child-abuse awareness and preventive programmes,
5. drug and alcohol free parenting programmes in endangered groups,
6. counselling for crime victims, and
7. somatic disease prevention, since chronic somatic illness increases likelihood
for ill mental health. 565 Secondary prevention
Secondary level of mental diseases prevention involves the early detection of
mental disorders and early intervention to reduce the risk of chronicity, disability
and suicide. Early detection and treatment in all mental disorders improves their
outcome and prognosis.
1. Screening.
Especially important is this kind of prevention in the field of depression, and
alcohol disorders:
• early detection of depression as most common mental disorder proved
to improve outcomes and reduce suicidal rates as confirmed by many
studies. US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends
screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems
in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and followup, but the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against
routine screening of children or adolescents for depression (14).
Screening for depression and educating general practitioners
(GPs) for recognising signs and symptoms of depression has become
one of the most widely used preventive tools all over the world. This
kind of education of GPs proved reduction in suicide rates because of
such educational campaigns are strongly embedded also in the
Slovenian education of family physicians and proved similar results;
• screening and behavioural counselling interventions to reduce alcohol
misuse by adults, including pregnant women is recommended as well (14).
It is used in many primary practices, as well as in some NGOs, and social
settings through self help and counselling. Early recognition is of course to
be followed by proper and evidence based treatment being mostly parallel
psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic and educational.
On the other side, USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to
recommend for or against routine screening by primary care clinicians to
detect suicide risk in the general population (14).
2. Other types of secondary prevention.
But not only screening programmes are secondary prevention. Other types
of secondary prevention are case finding, and health risk assessment (15).
In some cases, also an individual can help to try to find signs of
disease him/herself. Self examinations and self help are routine techniques to
be transferred and encouraged with individuals with mental disorders,
especially when reoccurring. The educational courses and individual
counselling on recognising warning signs of disorder and coping strategies,
as well as self help groups, are valuable tool in the hands of the individuals
at risk and their close ones. This is similar to the case in self-examination of
breasts in women to find early signs of breast cancer. Tertiary prevention
Tertiary level of prevention of mental diseases is: dealing with treatment and care
for people with clinically expressed mental disorders. We distinguish between
acute, primary, or early phase, and chronically, late or rehabilitation phase: 566 1. Psychiatric or primary care treatment
Psychiatric or primary care treatment is aiming at reducing the signs and
symptoms of mental disorder, improving coping abilities of patients and
families and in improving adherence to treatment process. The ultimate goal
is also to improve functioning and the quality of life of patients.
2. Psychiatric rehabilitation
Psychiatric rehabilitation aims to reduce disability because of mental
disorder in the patients' natural surroundings, which is most often his/her
home environment. Psychiatric rehabilitation targets patients' assessed and
clearly defined personal needs, needs of his/her carers and relatives and uses
methods of empowerment and participation to achieve as high level of
personal satisfaction as possible.
Multidisciplinary team work is used to define clear rehabilitation
goals and steps to achieve them with careful monitoring and follow up.
Coping strategies are taught and discussed with patients and family member,
distress is managed and medication is maintained almost inevitably. These
methods are combined with counselling, motivation, self help, sheltered
accommodation, sheltered employment and education if needed.
Majority of rehabilitation takes place in the community, even though
this process is started already in the phase of psychiatric treatment. The
needed level of rehabilitation support varies enormously and depends on the
patients' perceived needs an current functioning more importantly than on
the signs and symptoms of his/hers disorder. Epidemiology of mental disorders in Europe
General considerations
Mental disorders contribute 12.3% to the total burden of disease; the expected
burden will rise to 15% in 2020, this is. 450 million people worldwide. Mental
disorders contribute from 31% (Europe) to 43% (USA) to the total disability
adjusted life years (16).
The prevalence of mental disorders in Europe is increasing, 12-months
prevalence is estimated to 27% in 16 European countries. Every second European
will develop mental disorder once in his/her life, women more often than men
(33%: 22%) (17). Almost half of the people with mental disorders have more than
one diagnosis. Co-morbidity with somatic illness and with psychoactive substances
abuse and dependence are most common. Co-morbidity of depressive disorder with
coronary heart disease is 45% (18). 48% of somatic symptoms are connected with
depression (19), which present difficulties in early recognition and treatment and
consequently highly burdens medical services, produces over prescription of
different medication and increases the cost of treatments. Overall costs of
depression involving direct cost of treatment and indirect cost of sick-leaves,
absenteeism and underproduction are rising in developed countries (20). Most
common mental disorders are anxiety, depression and substance abuse disorders
(21). One fifth of women and one tenth of men will develop depressive disorder at
least once in their lifetime (22). 567 A WHO study, performed by Murray at al. (23), identified depression to be
heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in
industrial countries, following by abuse of alcohol. (Figure 1) Figure 1. Results of the WHO study “Global Burden of Disease”. Source: European
Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) (24). The research proves that the prevalence of common mental disorders connects itself
with the lower socio-economic status or social inequality (21). Unequal distribution
of wealth is more strongly connected with worse mental and physical health and
with early mortality than the GDP (25). The cost of mental disorders in Europe
amounts to 295 billion Euro.
Mental disorders remain under-recognised and under-treated. In European
Union (EU) only 26% of people with mental disorder get proper treatment. Among
reasons for under-treatment are poor accessibility of services for mental health,
under-recognition and stigma associated with mental disorders (17).
The most severe consequence of mental disorders is suicidality.
Suicidality
More than 90% of suicides occur in the context of a psychiatric disorder,
depression being by far the most important one. Annually, more than 58,000
persons in the countries of the European Union commit suicide. Suicide rates
(number of people died of suicide per 100.000 population) per country range from
5.92 per 100,000 in Italy up to 25 per 100,000 in Slovenia (WHO-data, 20012003) (Figure 2). 568 Figure 2. Suicide rates in EAAD partner countries. Source: European Alliance Against
Depression (EAAD) (24). Europe-wide, dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of
death for young men and the third highest risk for young women. About 14% of all
suicides occur in the age range of 15–24 (Report on the state of young people’s
health in the EU, EC Working Paper). Compared to the number of suicide deaths,
the number of suicide attempts is assumed to be much higher. Estimates for the
younger aged, range from 20 to 30 suicide attempts on every suicide. Given this
situation, interventions aiming at the prevention of suicidality and, thereby,
especially focusing on children, adolescents and young people are urgently needed.
Mental disorders are also connected to harmful alcohol consumption. In
addition to having a direct impact on drinkers it also poses a threat to others. Drinkdriving and working under the influence of alcohol; drinking during pregnancy; and
violence related to alcohol consumption too often cause early death of mostly
young people, invalidity, and social deprivation. Harmful and hazardous alcohol
consumption causes more than 7 per cent of early morbidity and mortality in EU,
which represents an enormous economic burden to society. At her speech at the 3rd
European conference on alcohol policies - Building Capacity for Action, 2008, the
Minister of Health of the Republic of Slovenia, Zofija Mazej Kukovič, pointed out
that the Estimated annual costs at the EU level resulting from harmful use of
alcohol have been estimated to EUR 125 billion, or 1.3 percent of the gross national
product. Child and adolescent mental health in EU
In Europe one adolescent out of five has cognitive, emotional and behavioural
difficulties and one adolescent out of eight suffers from a diagnosable mental
disorder. The prevalence of these disorders is increasing decade by decade. Suicide 569 associated with depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, conduct disorders,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) and post traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) in children deserve concerted action. Developmental psychiatric disorders
rarely have a spontaneous remission and may cause difficult social adaptation or
mental disorder in adult life, if not early diagnosed and treated (26). Mental health on the WHO and EU agenda
Mental health is the WHO's agenda of priority as well as the European Commission
regarding EU population's health.
1. In »Health 21«, adopted in 1999, the Target 6 is dealing with improvement
of mental health (27). According to this target, by the year 2020, people's
psychosocial wellbeing should be improved and better comprehensive
services should be available to and accessible by people with mental health
problems. Preventive, clinical and rehabilitative services were supposed to
be of a good quality.
2. In 2001 WHO report (28), the following recommendations were accepted:
• provide treatment in primary care - the management and treatment of
mental disorders in primary care is a fundamental step which enables
the largest number of people to get easier and faster access to services
it needs to be recognized that many are already seeking help at this
level. This not only gives better care. It cuts wastage resulting from
unnecessary investigations and inappropriate and non-specific
treatments. For this to happen, however, general health personnel
need to be trained in the essential skills of mental health care. Such
training ensures the best use of available knowledge for the largest
number of people and makes possible the immediate application of
interventions. Mental health should therefore be included in training
curricula, with refresher courses to improve the effectiveness of the
management of mental disorders in general health services;
• make psychotropic drugs available - essential psychotropic drugs
should be provided and made constantly available at all levels of
health care. These medicines should be included in every country's
essential drugs list, and the best drugs to treat conditions should be
made available whenever possible. In some countries, this may
require enabling legislation changes. These drugs can ameliorate
symptoms, reduce disability, shorten the course of many disorders,
and prevent relapse. They often provide the first-line treatment,
especially in situations where psychosocial interventions and highly
skilled professionals are unavailable;
• give care in the community - community care has a better effect than
institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of
individuals with chronic mental disorders. Shifting patients from
mental hospitals to care in the community is also cost-effective and
respects human rights. Mental health services should therefore be
provided in the community, with the use of all available resources.
Community-based services can lead to early intervention and limit the
stigma of taking treatment. Large custodial mental hospitals should be 570 • • • • replaced by community care facilities, backed by general hospital
psychiatric beds and home care support, which meet all the needs of
the ill that were the responsibility of those hospitals. This shift
towards community care requires health workers and rehabilitation
services to be available at community level, along with the provision
of crisis support, protected housing, and sheltered employment;
educate the public - public education and awareness campaigns on
mental health should be launched in all countries. The main goal is to
reduce barriers to treatment and care by increasing awareness of the
frequency of mental disorders, their treatability, the recovery process
and the human rights of people with mental disorders. The care
choices available and their benefits should be widely disseminated so
that responses from the general population, professionals, media,
policy-makers and politicians reflect the best available knowledge.
This is already a priority for a number of countries, and national and
international organizations. Well-planned public awareness and
education campaigns can reduce stigma and discrimination, increase
the use of mental health services, and bring mental and physical
health care closer to each other;
involve communities, families and consumers - communities, families
and consumers should be included in the development and decisionmaking of policies, programmes and services. This should lead to
services being better tailored to people's needs and better used. In
addition, interventions should take account of age, sex, culture and
social conditions, so as to meet the needs of people with mental
disorders and their families;
establish national policies, programmes and legislation - mental health
policy, programmes and legislation are necessary steps for significant
and sustained action. These should be based on current knowledge
and human rights considerations. Most countries need to increase their
budgets for mental health programmes from existing low levels. Some
countries that have recently developed or revised their policy and
legislation have made progress in implementing their mental health
care programmes. Mental health reforms should be part of the larger
health system reforms. Health insurance schemes should not
discriminate against persons with mental disorders, in order to give
wider access to treatment and to reduce burdens of care;
develop human resources - most developing countries need to
increase and improve training of mental health professionals, who will
provide specialized care as well as support the primary health care
programmes. Most developing countries lack an adequate number of
such specialists to staff mental health services. Once trained, these
professionals should be encouraged to remain in their country in
positions that make the best use of their skills. This human resource
development is especially necessary for countries with few resources
at present. Though primary care provides the most useful setting for
initial care, specialists are needed to provide a wider range of
services. Specialist mental health care teams ideally should include 571 medical and non-medical professionals, such as psychiatrists, clinical
psychologists, psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers and
occupational therapists, who can work together towards the total care
and integration of patients in the community;
• link with other sectors - Sectors other than health, such as education,
labour, welfare, and law, and nongovernmental organizations should
be involved in improving the mental health of communities.
Nongovernmental organizations should be much more proactive, with
better-defined roles, and should be encouraged to give greater support
to local initiatives;
• monitor community mental health - The mental health of communities
should be monitored by including mental health indicators in health
information and reporting systems. The indices should include both
the numbers of individuals with mental disorders and the quality of
their care, as well as some more general measures of the mental health
of communities. Such monitoring helps to determine trends and to
detect mental health changes resulting from external events, such as
disasters. Monitoring is necessary to assess the effectiveness of
mental health prevention and treatment programmes, and it also
strengthens arguments for the provision of more resources. New
indicators for the mental health of communities are necessary;
• support more research - more research into biological and psychosocial
aspects of mental health is needed in order to increase the
understanding of mental disorders and to develop more effective
interventions. Such research should be carried out on a wide
international basis to understand variations across communities and to
learn more about factors that influence the cause, course and outcome
of mental disorders. Building research capacity in developing countries
is an urgent need (28).
3. In 2005, a Mental Health Declaration for Europe was adopted in Helsinki
(29). The Ministers of Health of Member States in the European Region of
the WHO, in the presence of the European Commissioner for Health and
Consumer Protection, together with the WHO Regional Director for Europe,
recognized that the promotion of mental health and the prevention,
treatment, care and rehabilitation of mental health problems are a priority for
WHO and its Member States, the European Union (EU) and the Council of
Europe (29). According to this declaration, it is a priority of every country to
design and implement comprehensive, integrated and efficient mental health
system that covers promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, care
and recovery;
4. This Declaration was followed by the Mental Health Action Plan for Europe
(30). This action plan sets out 12 priority areas of action being:
• promoting mental well-being for all,
• demonstrating the centrality of mental health,
• tackling stigma and discrimination,
• promoting activities sensitive to vulnerable life stages,
• preventing mental health problems and suicide,
• ensuring access to good primary care for mental health problems, 572 • offering effective care in community-based services for people with
severe mental health problems,
• establishing partnerships across sectors,
• creating a sufficient and competent workforce,
• establishing good mental health information,
• providing fair and adequate funding, and
• evaluating effectiveness and generate new evidence.
It stresses the need for mental health activities capable of improving the
well-being of the whole population, preventing mental health problems and
enhancing the inclusion and functioning of people experiencing mental
health problems (31). CASE STUDY: MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN SLOVENIA
Epidemiological data on mental disorders in Slovenia
In Slovenia, the burden of mental disorders in is measured only indirectly, and only
some proxy variables allow us to infer about extensiveness of the problem. On one
hand, we have the data on health care resources and health care utilization, which
tell one story about the problem (by observing the number of outpatient visits on the
primary and secondary level, hospital admissions, retirements and absenteeism due
to mental disorders). On the other hand there are data on determinants. The third
part of the story tells us morality data, precisely the data on suicide. Thus, the
problem of epidemiological data in mental disorders in Slovenia is, that we do not
have morbidity data (incidence and prevalence of mental disorders) since we do not
have corresponding registries. But this is not only the case in Slovenia. Measuring
mental health is very difficult, since the data on mental disorders are tightly
connected to personal data protection. On the other hand, measuring the burden of
mental disorders isn’t a financial priority nor in Slovenia, nor elsewhere.
Mindful project leaded by Slovenian authors (32), tried to make the
methodology of supervising of mental health prevention equal in several EU states,
but did not find common indicators for measuring positive mental health in EU. Adult mental health data
1. Data on determinants of mental disorders
Results of CINDI Health Monitor Survey for 2001 showed that (33):
• 8.4% participants reported depression (males 6.3%, females 10.1%),
• 19.1% participants reported insomnia (males 16.1%, females 21.6%)
during the last month prior the survey:
• 7.7% participants (males 5.4%, females 9.5%) took sedatives or
sleeping pills during the last week prior the survey,
• 24.3% participants (males 21.0%, females 27.0%) perceived tension,
stress, or heavy pressure every day or frequently, and had at least
minor difficulties in coping with these feelings (34),
• global prevalence of heavy alcohol drinking for Slovenia was 13.4%
(males 22.6%, females 5.5%) (35, 36). 573 2. Suicide
Every thirtieth death in Slovenia is due to suicide, which is approximately
600 persons committing suicide per year and represent one of the nine
highest suicidal rates in the world, with standardized death rate of about
22-24 per 100.000 population in total population (males 37-42; females 912) (37). The most affected parts are Štajerska, Prekmurje Koroška and
Dolenjska, which are placed on the east and east-north of the country. The
gender difference is 3.6 (in males) versus 1 (in females), which is in line
with other high risk countries. Suicide is connected with metal disorders
(depression, alcohol dependence and schizophrenia), with old age,
unemployment and poverty (38).
In conclusion, we could say that in adults two major mental health problems in
Slovenia at the moment are prominent, being alcohol addiction and suicide, while
depression and stress are still under study. Child and adolescent mental health data
In children and especially in adolescents the major problem is alcohol use and
abuse, and possible addiction later, and illicit drugs abuse. Several kind of evidence
proves increase in alcohol and other addiction in young people and adolescent
group.
1. Alcohol consumption and other addiction
Data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs
(ESPAD) for the year 2003 showed that the percentage of Slovenian students
who had been drinking any alcohol during the last 12 months was 83%,
while the proportion of students who have used marijuana or hashish was
28%. The use of other illicit drugs was about 5%, the use of inhalants was
15%, and the use of tranquillisers or sedatives without a doctor’s prescription
as well as alcohol in combination with pills was 5 and 6% respectively (39).
Other results could be found in earlier reports (40, 41).
Other data show that smoking behaviour in adolescence was
connected with truancy, substance abuse, suicide attempts and infrequent
engagement in sports, thus being a part of problematic behaviour in this life
period and indicating that smoking is a life style of more vulnerable part of
the population (42).
3. Depression and self esteem
The study on Risk factors in Slovene secondary school students, performed
on representative sample in 1998 showed clinically important level of
depression in 20.5% of boys, and in 41.5% of girls (evaluated by Zung selfrating depression scale). The average value of results on the depression scale
was 45.6, indicating that depression is rather prominent characteristic of
secondary school students. Along to these results, average value of selfesteem on the 0-10 self-rating scale was in boys 6.9, while in girls it was 6.3.
On general, girls expressed higher level of depression and lower level of
self-esteem than boys (43).
2. Suicide
Suicide in adolescent population is among the first three causes of death in
all countries that have reliable health monitoring data. In Slovenia 20 574 adolescent die because of suicide each year, the number of boys being four
times greater than the number of girls. The research proved that suicidal
adolescents (13,6% of girls and 6,8% of boys) were experiencing family
dysfunction and confrontation with unresolved problems prior to suicidal
attempts and that they used dysfunctional strategies for their resolution (44),
which provided grounds for several preventive actions on the field. Sport and
physical activity were defined as protective factors relating to adolescent
suicide attempts, being a coping style in distress, even though they had not
proven to have a direct effect on non-suicidal behaviour (45). Needs assessment
The need for research in mental health in Slovenia is in spite of all described
initiatives still enormous. We actually do not have randomized clinical trials on
various programmes on prevention It is also true, that recommendations for
evaluation of prevention are still not developed on EU level, but should be prepared
by EU Taskforce on evidence in mental health shortly. Primordial and primary level of prevention
Mental health policy
For the time being, a national programme of mental health has not yet been adopted
in Slovenia. Mental health it is the responsibility of the Council for Health, a
Government advisory body which includes experts from the fields of both health
and social security.
In Slovenia the former National Programme for Public Health prevention
which was operative until 2004 did not include mental health priorities and
prevention. The new is in preparation and is should be adopted this year. In its draft,
mental health is mentioned several times as important field of public health action.
However, national programmes have been suggested for preventing suicide
and dependence on alcohol and drugs. The guidelines for alcohol addiction
prevention were developed by the Ministerial task group and finished lately. Actual
implementation of preventive programmes still lacks continuity.
The Mental Health Act which regulates system of health and social care on
the field of mental health, holders of activities, and rights of persons under
treatment including voluntary and involuntary admission to treatment, advocacy and
care planning was recently adopted (46), what can be regarded as very big step
forward. Mental health promotion and mental health education
efforts
In Slovenia there are several health promoting activities which include also mental
health component.
Among actions that increase the chances of more people experiencing better
mental health, the “Wind in the hair” programme could be classified. This
programme is a very successful national prevention programme implemented in
local communities with support of National Sports Association (47). Sport activities 575 with concerts, befriending and rewarding healthy lifestyle activities was successful
enough to get a European certificate and to be implemented in several EU countries.
There are also many activities which could be classified on one hand among
mental health promotion activities, and on the other among primary prevention:
1. Programmes for infants and toddlers
Programmes for infants and toddlers influence above all parents’ behaviour
and upbringing, but they should also target social injustice, prevention of
physical abuse, violent behaviour and provide psychological counselling at
crisis, for example in divorce. In the neighbouring Austria the literacy of
parents regarding developmental phases, conflict solving, parenting styles
and their access to relevant information about needed help are targeted.
In Slovenia these programmes are strongly connected to primary
health care teams and community nurses. Nationally all kinds of prevention
programmes are also developed through obstetric dispensaries, those
providing counselling and help in prenatal and immediate postnatal periods.
The social and psychological interventions are still often lacking.
2. School children and adolescents mental health prevention
The concern about ill mental health of children and adolescents is one of the
main areas of interest of Slovene psychiatry from 1950s (48). Until now
Slovenia developed a network of mental health services for children and
adolescents which were until a decade ago affiliated with the national health
care service. The majority of prevention and treatment was developed within
the framework of educational and social care provision. School counselling
services with psychologists and pedagogues are today part of each school
workforce. These experts are strongly connected with child and adolescent
psychiatric services, which are in last years more often part of private
psychiatric outpatient clinics than the public ones. The development
nevertheless follows the principles of holistic and community care with
involvement of educational, social and medical institutions in care planning
in line with the child or adolescent mental health needs. The role of parents
in this process is strongly supported, even stronger when the mental health
problems are difficult to manage.
3. “That is me” project
In Celje region “That is me” (in Slovene To sem jaz) project was lunched
for health promotion among youth in 2000 (49, 50). It showed that greatest
adolescents’ problems are lack of self-confidence and optimism, lack of
self-respect and fear of failure. The website was launched to provide
information about health and well being and to influence adolescent views
and values about their health and well- being and to prevent risky
behaviour.
4. “Taking brain to the party” programme
The programme called “Taking brain to the party” (in Slovene Z glavo na
zabavo) had much success in last years in illicit drug prevention (51). It is
strongly supported by media and targets places where young people gather,
have parties and exercise risky behaviours.
5. Healthy schools
Schoolchildren mental health prevention is targeted also to the teachers, who
should develop sensitivity to emotional needs of children. Schools should develop 576 programmes preventing violence, abuse and bullying. Adequate counselling is part
of the psychological support to victims and perpetuators (if children). These
programmes are being developed also in Slovenian network of Healthy Schools.
This programme makes an important improvement at early recognition and
treatment of eating disorders, anxiety and depression. Substance abuse prevention
is included in many local school programmes and developed on the national level
as a set of educational interventions in schools.
Mental health prevention for children and adolescents in Slovenia is
providing counselling workshops and seminars for teachers, school counsellors
and parents about psychopathology, suicidality, social skills training and healthy
lifestyle. The programme includes also drug prevention mainly through education.
It is performed in primary schools with the guidance of National Institute for
Health Prevention and some Regional Public Health Institutes, and with prominent
Slovenian child psychiatrists.
The central psychiatric hospital and Child Guidance Clinic are
organizing professional crisis interventions in need, for example on
occasions of suicidal attempts, suicide or unpredictable violent behaviours in
schools.
6. The “European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD)” network
EAAD is an international network of experts with the aim to promote the
care of depressed patients by initiating community-based intervention
programmes in 17 European countries including Slovenia. It aimed to
prevent depression and suicide (52). Results of the Nuremberg pilot study
have already shown that the community-based intervention following the 4level-approach was clearly effective in reducing suicidal acts (about 20 %).
When evaluating the efficacy of the EAAD intervention programme, the
primary outcome criterion is, in general, again changes of numbers of
completed and attempted suicides in EAAD intervention regions.
In Slovene regions Celje and Koroška, which have the highest social
exclusion rates and highest suicidal rates, the project included an educational
programme about treatment of depression and suicide prevention with
general practitioners and medical nurses. The prevention programme has also
been implemented with police officers, social workers and priests. The
project was evaluated and showed important suicide reduction. The regional
programme for suicide prevention in region of Celje conducted by Zavod za
zdravstveno varstvo Celje a serial of preventive, mainly educational activities
for suicide reduction from 2001 (53). Problems in mental health promotion and primary
prevention
The main implementation problem of evidence based prevention is lack of human
resources and the educational gap among their acquired and needed knowledge and
skills. Mental health promotion and prevention workforce is the people who already
work in primary or secondary medical services, or the people who work as teachers,
psychologist or pedagogues in their school working environments. In last years
some initiatives are emerging in educational institutions, for example in the Faculty
of Health Sciences of Ljubljana University (study programme Nursing) and in the 577 Faculty for Education of Ljubljana University (study programme Social pedagogy)
for developing mental health prevention and promotion educational programmes at
undergraduate and at postgraduate level.
Programmes and projects already described, are not a part of regular
curriculum and therefore not accessible to all children and adolescents.
Similarly to other EU countries and US, we witness in Slovenia lack of
resources for training and lack of working posts for prevention and promotion.
Educational curricula do not follow quickly developing mental health promotion
and prevention science and evidence. This level of prevention is underdeveloped,
since Slovenia’s health care system is still mainly oriented in treatment of diseases
and we could hardly say that it is in its way to reorienting health care services
towards more comprehensive (54). Secondary level of prevention
Secondary level of prevention is to be performed by special units of Community
Health Centres. Majority of primary care physicians underwent additional
educational programmes on recognizing depression and suiciudality and improved
their diagnosis. Lack of human resources impedes the development and
implementation of early recognition and treatment of mental disorders that proves
to be most important preventive mental health tool as described in many documents
and papers (55).
There are around six so-called Counselling centres for children, adolescent and
their parents in Slovenia, which offer different activities in the filed of mental health,
especially early diagnostic of mental health and learning problems, individual and
group therapy. In these centres interdisciplinarity and muldisectoriality is a method of
work with a child, adolescent and their patent. Some of these centres are active also in
the field of research, education and prevention also.
There exist other activities which could be to the certain extent classified as
secondary prevention - crisis telephone lines as for example “Call in mental crisis” (in
Slovene: Klic v duševni stiski) could be seen as special form of secondary prevention.
This service seems to becoming more and more used also in Slovenia and it is also
increasingly reachable through information technology communication. Tertiary level of prevention
Psychiatric services
Before presenting the current situation of psychiatric services in Slovenia, we
would like to present some historical points of view.
History of psychiatric services in Slovenia
The historical context of Slovene psychiatry and psychiatric rehabilitation is important for
understanding the development of mental health prevention in our country. The
beginnings of psychiatry in Slovenian lands reach as far back as the year 1786, when the
first ward for mentally ill monks was established in the general hospital of Ljubljana. In
1827, the first specialized ward for the treatment of the mentally ill was founded within the
general hospital of Ljubljana. In 1881, a large psychiatric hospital was built in the manner
that was at the time regarded to be the right one: outside the town, in unspoiled nature and 578 tranquilizing greenery. Before the 1940 Slovenia had 1.1 bed per 1000 population. The
German and post-war psychocide reduced the capacities by one half. After the war (and
nowadays), we made do with 6 psychiatric hospitals - including the University Psychiatric
Hospital - and 0.8 beds per 1000 population and the average hospital treatment period of
48 days. During the Second World War, Slovenia was occupied by Nazi-Germany who in
1942 enforced the so-called euthanasia programme with about 450 patients from one of
the Slovene psychiatric hospitals.
During the war the University Psychiatric Hospital in Ljubljana helped the
anti-nazi resistance in every possible way. It also contributed by diagnosing
antifascists who were in danger, as mentally ill and hiding them among the “'real”
patients. It offered medical help to wounded fighters of the resistance and helped
antifascists escape the Nazi controlled areas and join the resistance. Psychiatrists
also tried to use “psychiatric diagnosis” to help a Jewish family that tried to escape
from Croatian fascist Ustasha across Slovenia to Italy. Two leading psychiatrists
were liquidated by the occupator for their cooperation with the resistance, the
principal was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment, many of the staff members were
interned, and some died in the liberation war.
It is a historical paradox that after the end of the war, in Slovenia,
psychocide went on for another ten years. Patients were treated so badly that the
mortality was almost as high as it had been towards the end of the war, i.e. about
40% - due to famine and tuberculosis. For Hitler, patients had been “lives unworthy
of lives”, for communists they were an obstacle on the way to better socialist future.
But in general, the communist regime of ex-Yugoslavia was much “'softer” than
those in other East European countries.
Political intervention
A case of intervention from the part of the communist authorities after the war was the
following: an internationally renowned author and politician fell from grace and became
a kind of dissident. He then fell ill with Alzheimer's disease and was hospitalized at the
clinic for distinctively disturbed behaviour at the wish of his wife and children. The
authorities often inquired whether detention was still necessary and whether he could
not have been taken care of outside the psychiatric clinic. They were truly afraid of the
reaction of the international public and the possible reproach that they used psychiatry
to do away with political opponents (personal communication with Jože Darovec,
former director of Ljubljana Psychiatric Hospital, 2008).
The practice of detention of “dangerous people” during foreign statesmen visits
was abolished only in 1968 by prof. Miloš Kobal, He was educated in Great Britain and
used his experience from there - as well as his own ideas - for an extremely early reform
of the Slovenian psychiatry, as early as 1968/70 - much earlier, in fact, than many other
more developed European countries: he diminished the number of beds by sending
patients to other suitable institutions (not to the streets like President J. F. Kennedy and F.
Basaglia in Italy), opened the majority of the up-to-then closed wards, founded the centre
for mental health, the day and night ward, the family care within a family other than a
patient's own, established specialized wards for the treatment of addictions in all
psychiatric hospitals, designed the dispensary psychiatric care, introduced psychiatric
counselling service in most old people's homes and asylums, introduced the long-term
therapy by fluphenazine depot in 1969 and the lithium therapy already in 1970 (personal
communication with Jože Darovec, 2008). 579 Current state of psychiatric services
Psychiatric service is in Slovenia given in all levels of health care system:
1. Primary mental health care.
Acute treatment of all mental disorders is available at the primary health care
level, but in a limited way as described previously. Primary health care is
delivered by Community Health Care Centres and private practitioners. At
the moment there is about 75 Community Health Centres in Slovenia.
Some of Community Health Care Centres, but not all unfortunately, has
specialized units called dispensaries – psychiatric dispensary for adults and
mental hygiene dispensaries for children and adolescent. The reorientation
towards more comprehensive primary health service is questionable since it is
under rapid transformation towards privatization;
2. Secondary and tertiary level of mental health care.
At the secondary and tertiary level of mental health care, there are altogether
six regional psychiatric hospitals including the University psychiatric
hospital. All have wards for general psychiatry, psycho-geriatrics and the
treatment of alcohol dependency. The University Psychiatric Hospital also
has wards for adolescent psychiatry, drug dependency and psychotherapy.
There is also the Child Psychiatry Ward in the Paediatric Clinic.
In 2002, the number of all psychiatric hospital beds was 1569 (56). About
30 beds have been allocated for child and adolescent psychiatry. In the period
1998/99, beds actually in use per 100.000 population (all psychiatric in-patient
institution) decreased from 84 in 1965/95 period to 71 (56).
There are 24 child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country.
Hospital treatments are becoming shorter and more intensive, with
complementary services providing day hospitals and participation in selected
activities for time limited follow up.

presented, in comparison to some other EU members (9).

0.04 Rehabilitation
Psychiatric rehabilitation methods are developed in institutions and in the community
and these systems are connecting themselves with the method of care planning. This
is achieved by communication among inpatient and community services as far as
possible. Since there is no community psychiatric treatment available in Slovenia yet,
except from an attempt of the psychiatric team in the central hospital to perform
community psychiatric treatment, these endeavours are sporadic and not available to
everybody in need, but rather exceptional and due to personal engagement of mental
health workers. The legislation and financing are however anyway being prepared and
close to adoption right now in 2008.
In Ljubljana (the capital), a rehabilitation unit of the psychiatric hospital was
therefore established to follow up the patients with severe mental illness with high risk for
relapse and dual diagnosis. This service is well connected with non-governmental (NGOs)
and social services as well as primary health care services. These connections are widely
used also by other hospital departments, but nevertheless can not reply to the needs of
patients and their families. Crisis interventions are organized by the central primary health
care service providing urgent interventions. This service need better collaboration with
psychiatrists in the cases of involuntary referrals, but this is not achieved because of lack
of psychiatrists and other psychiatric personnel. Professional and user organizations and
associations of interested experts have been founded for the group of patients with severe
mental illness. The largest are ŠENT, ALTRA, OZARA and PARADOKS which are,
together with the psychiatric profession, involved in preventive, mainly anti-stigma
programmes. Among the psychosocial services offered are housing facilities with support,
day centres, vocational rehabilitation development, sheltered employment and education
for professionals, patients and carers. NGOs providing support for people with anxiety,
depression, substance abuse and dependence, and for carers, and families of people with
dementia are emerging as well in last ten years with increasing influence to health and
social policy. The carers (families) organization has developed a network of interest for
mental health prevention and promotion in Slovenia at the level of republic and connected
itself with international organizations of carers (57).
Here we will shortly introduce only two of NGOs, being ŠENT, and Trading
centres since detailed description of all of them is beyond the scope of this module.
1. Slovenian association for mental health ŠENT.
ŠENT is the largest non-profit NGO in Slovenia providing from 1992
coordinated social care for patients with severe mental illness. The difference to
other NGOs was at first acknowledging the need for coordination among
psychiatric and social care services to improve quality and comprehensiveness of
care for people in need. The context of mutual respect provided grounds for
quick and stable development of vocational rehabilitation, education of patients,
families and professionals, day centres and group homes. All these services are
intended for the group of patients (users) with disability due to mental illness and
stigma, and supported by carers and patients. ŠENT is today taking lead in anti
stigmatization of mental illness, education of professionals for newly emerging
community psychiatry and community social work. It provides also advocacy
and self help groups mostly in day centres and among families of patients with
severe mental illness. The variety of needs, opportunities and demands regarding
mental health service development, consumers’ movement, legal and
organizational issues provide a turbulent environment for continuous 581 development of this organization. The programmes are comparable to other
NGOs listed above.
2. Trading centres for people with disabilities.
One of the rehabilitation initiatives is “Trading centres for people with
disabilities”.
One of the biggest trading companies in Slovenia recently planned
to implement a programme that would allow people with disabilities better
access to their various facilities. This programme, labelled “Kindly to
disabled” focuses on all groups of people with disabilities, including the
physically disabled, those with learning disabilities and people with
disabilities caused by mental disorders. The programme was developed in
cooperation with Slovenian Association for mental health ŠENT, which
provided counselling on the matter and education for employees about the
needs of the disabled. Since the needs of different disabled groups are very
different, a series of adaptations including employees’ attitudes and
communication skills was proposed beside technical adaptation of the
shops’ environments. This action seems to be becoming important
preventive step for including the disabled in the society on equal terms.
The project should succeed because the disabled strongly participated in
the assessment of the needed adaptations and in the education of the
employees and employers. Results of some studies on mental health in Slovenia
There exist some different kinds of research on different aspects of mental disorders
and their consequences. The majority of programmes are evaluated regarding their
efficiency in experimental circumstances. Among studies are following:
1. Delphi study on alcohol prevention in Slovenia (58)
Alcohol abuse is an avoidable behaviour that can threaten health. In Slovenia,
only a few public campaigns against drinking alcohol are under way. It is
important to establish which community measures are acceptable to society in
Slovenia in order to reduce alcohol-related risks.
This study was a Delphi study with 45 professionals from different
disciplines was conducted. Participants offered many suggestions to improve
the current situation. After three rounds of questionnaires, 86 participant
statements were accepted as a consensus.
Results showed that actions such as: state monopolies, alcohol taxation,
legislative restrictions on availability and purchase of alcohol, age-related
restriction on sales, drink-driving laws, school-based alcohol education and
media information campaigns are most likely to be achieved by consensus.
The main target populations for implementation of alcohol-related educational
programmes are children, young people and employees.
The conclusions of this study were that as a result of the study, a
number of community actions against drinking alcohol that could be
acceptable for society can now be suggested. They vary across different target
populations, change agents (individuals, organizations and institutions) and
methods of implementation.
2. Outcome assessment (59) 582 Majority of long-term hospitalized patients with severe mental disorders
considered resistant to standard hospital psychiatric treatment have been
discharged during last decade from Slovene psychiatric hospitals mainly due to
economic pressure without any assessment of outcomes or patients’ needs.
Rehabilitation unit has been established within University Psychiatric Hospital
in Ljubljana for inpatients with severe mental disorders. The research was
aimed at to find out characteristics and needs of patients with schizophrenia in
order to develop hospital service in accordance with patients’ needs.
In the study, forty-one long-term hospitalized and frequently admitted
patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia were followed through 12 months
period by a public psychiatric hospital team due to discharge planning. The
patients were assessed regarding their needs, clinical status, global functioning,
and quality of life and thoroughly informed about their illness, treatment and
rehabilitation plan.
Follow up assessments showed improvement in negative syndrome of
schizophrenia, better satisfaction in some areas of patients’ lives and a
decrease in their needs in spite of considered resistance to standard hospital
psychiatric treatment.
The study results prove rehabilitation programme to be successful for
patients with severe mental disorders and present some information for further
development of services for patients with severe mental disorders in Slovenia.
3. Evaluation of stigma
In Slovenia there were several evaluations of attitudes of different groups
toward people with mental disorders. One of them is a study entitled ”Does
psychiatric education reduce stigma? “(60).
Evaluation of discriminative attitudes of medical students towards people
with mental disorders was evaluated by a questionnaire before and after the
mental health curricula in several faculties that have mental health curricula. The
attitudes towards psychiatric patients didn’t change much after education, except
from lowering the level of fear perceived by students (Table 2).
Table 2: Differences between students in discriminative attitudes towards people with mental
disorders before the study of psychiatry and after the completion of the cycle of
lectures and exercises in the year 2004.

showed higher discrimination scores among patients’, than in students’ group.
This was interpreted as self stigma, but it might be better defined as an
expressed reluctance to participate in the patients’ group which is characterised
by extreme exclusion, poverty and low life opportunities
Another study was undertaken by a medical student that organized a
serial of films presentations of stories of people with different mental
disorders. The attitudes of student after these shows were somewhat better in
certain areas of discrimination. Future steps for strengthening mental care in Slovenia
There are several challenges posed in front of public health and clinical sphere in the
field of mental care in Slovenia, two of most important being
• one challenge is, of course, adoption of mental health policy and national plan for
mental health. According to WHO (61), national mental health policies should not
be solely concerned with mental health disorders, but also recognize promotes
mental health. These would include the socio-economic and environmental factors,
described above, as well as behaviour. Policies for reduction of suicide, anxiety
and depression should develop evidence based approach towards improvement of
early recognition of mental disorders with increasing sensibility of employers,
professional mental health workers and public about early recognition of warning
signs of mental disorders, suicidal behaviour, recognizing triggers and
circumstances connected with suicide, dangerous behaviour and mental illness.
Denmark for example achieved 60% reduction of suicide rate with combination of
policies and preventive programmes in last 20 years: among these are reduces
access to suicidal means (weapons), with better treatment of somatic and mental
disorders after suicide attempts, with improved access to telephone counselling and
emergency psychiatry and with increase in social and cultural stability (62);
• another challenge is to reorient mental care towards more comprehensive
one, with more emphasis on mental health promotion and mental disorders
prevention. Mental health promotion should be mainstreamed into policies
and programmes in government and business sectors including education,
labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare, as well as the
health sector. Particularly important are the decision-makers in
governments at local and national levels, whose actions affect mental
health in ways that they may not realize (61). One of the biggest challenges
facing Slovenia at the moment in the area of health promotion is increasing
concern among both, the general public and among experts and
professionals about mental health, (62). Slovenia should build a strong
network of experts, institutions and consumers organizations that are
responsible in the field of mental health promotion and prevention. To
intensify effects, there is a need to harmonize programmes with a long term
vision, making them concrete through actions across different settings, at
different levels, pointed to different target groups (62). 584 EXERCISE
Task 1
Make a Medline search on medical students-stigma-mental illness, choose several
most cited articles and try to propose a model for reducing discrimination in this
group for your country. Task 2
Search for available needs assessment (mental health) questionnaire and list it. Use the
most cited one and exercise its implementation with a close person (without diagnosis) Task 3
Make a list of needed mental health services in your local area and try to explain your
decisions. Task 4
Design a substance abuse prevention programme for your local community. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Mental health, community mental health services, integrated mental
health services
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• Be aware of the mental health as a community's public health
problem;
• Recognize the main determinants of mental health;
• Understand the way public health can contribute to mental health
improvement;
• Have increased knowledge on the types of mental health services;
• Identify the steps to be taken for developing community mental
health services.
Mental health is considered a public health problem due to the
following particularities of the mental diseases: high incidence and
prevalence; long term duration, with consequences over family, social
and professional life; cause severe disability; high cost imposed on
individual, family and community; associated stigma and
discrimination. The main determinants of mental health are: socioeconomic, demographic and psychological factors. Public health can
bring a major contribution to the improvement of mental health by its
main functions, such as: needs evaluation, priority setting, policy
development, health promotion and disease prevention, mental health
services research and development.
According to WHO recommendations, mental health services should
be organized based on principles of accessibility, coordinated care,
continuity of care, effectiveness, equity and respect for human rights.
As well, mental health care should be provided through general health
services and community settings. Large and
centralized psychiatric institutions need to be replaced by other more
appropriate mental health services. The shifting of patients from mental
hospitals to care in the community should be based, primarily on the
existence of a mental health policy that promotes the development of
community-based care. Policies should be drawn up with the 590 involvement of all stakeholders and should be based upon up-to-date
and reliable information. Mental health policy and service provision
should take into account the context of general health systems
organization and financing. For a successful implementation of the
mental health policy, political, legislative, financial and administrative
support is required.
Teaching methods Specific
recommendations
for teachers
Assessment of
Students Teaching methods include: lectures, group discussions, group
exercises, role playing. The students will be split in three groups and
asked to work on three different subjects for undertaking a situation
analysis. The students will do a role play, having assigned different
roles in a ‘working group’ (policy-makers, health professionals,
patients, family members, NGOs and other interested parties)
appointed to formulate a mental health policy (that includes
development of community-based care) and to plan for a community
mental health service.
60% work under teacher supervision, 40% individual students’ work.
No special facilities, equipment or teaching materials are necessary.

Silvia Gabriela Scintee, Adriana Galan THERORETICAL BACKGROUND
1. Mental health – a community’s public health problem
In the World Health Report 2001 - Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope,
World Health Organization is making the following statement: mental health –
neglected for far too long – is crucial to the overall well-being of individuals,
societies and countries and must be universally regarded in a new light (1). Mental
health deserves special attention and it is considered a public health problem due to
the following particularities of the mental diseases:
− High incidence and prevalence. Of the 870 million people living in the
European Region, at any one time about 100 million people are estimated to
suffer from anxiety and depression; over 21 million to suffer from alcohol use
disorders; over 7 million from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias; about
4 million from schizophrenia; 4 million from bipolar affective disorder; and 4
million from panic disorders (2);
− Long term duration, with consequences over family, social and professional
life. Neuropsychiatric disorders also account for over 40% of chronic diseases.
In many countries, mental health problems account for 35–45% of absenteeism
from work (2);
− Cause severe disability. It was estimated that, in 1990, mental and
neurological disorders accounted for 10% of the total Daly’s lost due to all
diseases and injuries. This was 12% in 2000. By 2020, it is projected that the
burden of these disorders will have increased to 15% (1);
− High cost imposed on individual, family and community. There are very few
studies that estimate the aggregate economic costs of mental disorders. WHO
2001 World Health Report quotes one such study (Rice et al. 1990) that
concluded that the aggregate yearly cost for the United States accounted for
about 2.5% of gross national product, a study from the Netherlands that has
estimated expenditure on mental disorders as 23.2% of all health service costs
(Meerding et al. 1998) and a study in the United Kingdom that found that
inpatient expenditure only was 22% (Patel & Knapp 1998). Indirect costs
arising from productivity loss account for a larger proportion of overall costs
than direct costs. However, all the estimates of economic evaluations are most
certainly underestimates, since lost opportunity costs to individuals and
families are not taken into account (1).
− Associated stigma and discrimination. Because of this stigma, people with
mental disorders experience limitations in employment, education and
housing. This in turn affects their ability to gain access to appropriate care,
integrate into society and recover from their illness (2). 592 1.1 Main determinants of mental health
As known, the health status of a population is determined by: (a) biological factors,
(b) environmental factors (economical, social and physical), (c) lifestyle (behavioural
and cultural factors) and (d) health care systems. The main determinants of mental
health are: socio-economic, demographic and psychological factors.
1.1.1 Socio-economical factors
Public health literature shows with evidence based arguments that the main
determinants of poor health are poverty and inequity. Furthermore, poverty and
associated conditions of unemployment, low educational level, deprivation and
homelessness are not influencing mental health only in poor countries, but also affect
a sizeable minority of rich countries. Data from cross-national surveys in poor
countries (Brazil, Chile, India and Zimbabwe) shows that common mental disorders
are about twice as frequent among the poor as among the rich. In the United States,
children from the poorest families were found to be at increased risk of disorders in
the ratio of 2:1 for behavioural disorders and 3:1 for comorbid conditions (1). The
poverty determines not only the onset, but the evolution of psychiatric disorders, as
well. The stigma attached to mental diseases creates a vicious cycle of alienation and
discrimination – leading to social isolation, inability to work, alcohol or drug abuse,
homelessness, or excessive institutionalization – which decreases the chance of
recovery and normal life.
1.1.2 Demographical factors
Gender
In general, the behavioural and mental disorders affect equally the both sexes. There
are sex differences on each diagnostic category. Thus, the depressive and anxiety
disorders are more frequent in women, while substance abuse and antisocial
personality disorders are more common in men (3). Among the reasons of higher
prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in women there are: hormonal changes
as part of the reproductive life cycle, the social role of the women that burdens them
with higher responsibilities and exposes them to greater stress, high rates of domestic
violence and sexual violence against women, high prevalence of physical disorders
among women.
Age
Mental disorders have a high prevalence among children and adolescents. The most
frequent disorders in children are the impairments or delays in the development of
specific functions such speech (dyslexia) or overall pervasive development (autism).
A high prevalence of mental disorders is also seen in old age, especially for dementia
and depression. Thus, the increase in life expectancy of persons with mental
disorders, as well as the increasing number of persons who reach an age for which the
risk of developing a mental disorder is higher determines a high prevalence of the
psychiatric pathology.
Urbanization
This process is accompanied by increased homelessness, poverty, higher levels of
pollution, overcrowding, violence, rapid technological change and disruption in the
family structures and loss of social support – factors that have a negative impact on
mental health (4). 593 1.1.3 Psychological factors
Individual factors
The presence of a serious physical disorder may affect the mental health of individual
as well as of entire families because of psychosocial consequences such as an
infirmity (i.e. surgical removal of one breast) or stigma and discrimination (AIDS).
Other individual factors refer to the different life events, either positive (such as:
unexpected substantial gains, a great success) or negative (professional failures,
losses), or even life change events (job or professional responsibilities change,
migration).
Familial factors
Unstable or disrupted family environments have a role in the outset and the evolution
of mental disorders. A well known example is the concept of ‚expressed emotions’
studied in the families of patients with schizophrenia. ‚Expressed emotions’ in these
studies have included critical comments, hostility, emotional over-involvement and
warmth (1). As well, family life events such as changes in family structure, a serious
disease or disability of a family member are affecting mental health.
Environmental factors
Mental disorders are firmly rooted in the social environment of the individual, at both
micro-group level and the whole society level. At the micro-group level the person
could be affected by conflictual relationships, or negative life events such as the
disease, the death, the injustices or losses suffered by the members of the group
(friends, relatives, colleagues, neighbours, etc). At the whole society level the wars,
civil wars, natural disasters, can traumatize entire populations and the effects are
higher in the less developed countries with less problems solving capacity (1).
Even if the biological factors, the factors from the physical environment and
the health care systems have a smaller influence on the onset of the mental disorders,
these are not to be neglected. Almost all of the common severe mental and
behavioural disorders are associated with a significant genetic component of risk. As
the many other physical illnesses the mental disorders are the result of a complex
interaction of two or more factors. 1.2 The contribution of public health to a better mental health of
the community
Public health can bring a major contribution to the improvement of mental health by
its main functions, such as: needs evaluation, priority setting, policy development,
health promotion and disease prevention, mental health services research and
development.
1.2.1 Needs evaluation and development of policies addressed to the priority
problems
Until not so long, accurate evaluation of the mental health status has been impeded,
on one hand by the difficulties in defining and identifying the mental disorders, and
on the other hand by the inadequacy of data collection systems. Advances during
recent decades in standardizing clinical assessment made possible as mental disorders
to be diagnosed as reliably and accurately as most of the common physical disorders.
Structured interview schedules and diagnostic symptom/sign checklists allow
mental health professionals to collect information using standard questions and pre- 594 coded responses. The symptoms and signs have been defined in detail to allow for
uniform application. Finally, diagnostic criteria for disorders have been standardized
internationally (1).
Data on mental health status of a population is not usually found in the routine
statistical records and specially designed epidemiological and medico-social surveys
are necessary in order to get information on the incidence and prevalence of mental
disorders. Besides information on mental health diseases, information on major
determinants of mental health and health care systems are necessary in order to
identify priority problems and to formulate policies to address these problems.
In fulfilling its role of technical adviser to the Member States in mental health
related matters, World Health Organization noticed that there was not enough
information on mental health, especially on the available resources to alleviate the
mental health problems. Thus, in 2000, the World Health Organization launched the
project Atlas to address this gap. The objectives of this project include the collection,
compilation and dissemination of relevant information about mental health resources
in different countries. The first set of publications from the project appeared in 2001
and the second editions with updated information in 2005. One significant addition in
2005 was the inclusion of information on epidemiology of mental disorders for all
low and middle income countries.
Emphasizing the necessity of a well-functioning and coordinated information
system for measuring a minimum number of mental health indicators for both the
formulation and evaluation of policies on mental health, World Health Organization
mentions 'Monitoring of community mental health' among the ten recommendations
for action in its World Health Report 2001 - Mental Health: New Understanding,
New Hope (1).
1.2.2 Health promotion and disease prevention
Taking into account the high economic and social costs of mental diseases for the
society, mental health promotion and mental disorders prevention have a tremendous
importance. Mental health promotion strategies have also a positive impact on other
problems such as: delinquency among youngsters, school abandon and violence
against children. These strategies should take into account both the community needs,
and the social and cultural environments.
Mental health promotion strategies could be classified in three main categories
(1):
1. Interventions targeting factors determining or maintaining ill-health. As an
example – programmes that enhance the quality of children-parents
relationship, given the fact that psychological and cognitive development of
children depend upon the interaction of the children with their parents;
2. Interventions targeting population groups. A population group that might need
such programmes are elderly. By 2025, there will be 1.2 billion people in the
world who are over 60 years of age, close to three-quarters of them in the
developing world, which represent an important determinant of mental health
disorders increase;
3. Interventions targeting particular settings. An example could be school
targeted programmes. Besides family, the school is crucial in preparing the
children for life. Thus, schools should teach life-skills such as problem
solving, critical thinking, empathy, communication skills, interpersonal 595 relations development and methods to cope with emotions. As well, schools
should offer a friendly environment, where the tolerance, the equality between
sexes, ethnical, social or religious groups, the creativity, the self-esteem and
self-confidence should be encouraged.
Mental health prevention could be done at three levels.
1. Primary prevention is predominantly targeted to the mental health
determinants and avoids the diseases development, reducing in this way the
incidence of the diseases. Community based primary prevention programmes
can bring a huge contribution to the well-being of individuals by controlling
mental health determinants that action at community level.
2. Secondary prevention has the purpose of early detection of diseases, arrest the
disease evolution, avoid further complications and sequelae and limit
disability. Through cure and reduction of disease duration secondary
prevention reduces the prevalence of the diseases. Even if the main
contribution belongs to the psychiatric services, the primary health care
services or services provided at the community level can help by early
detection of the diseases and by monitoring the treatment prescribed by
specialists.
3. Tertiary prevention reduces the handicap, helps the socio-professional
recovery, assures the independence and self-satisfaction on the quality of life
of the individual. It comprises both interventions at the level of the individual
and modifications of the environment. The best interventions are the integrated
tertiary prevention programmes in which community participates covering the
social needs of the individuals. 1.2.3. Mental health services research and development
Mental health services have some particularities that make them different. Primarily,
in many countries they are not integrated in the general health services. Mental
disorders are common and most patients are only seen in primary care, but their
disorders are often not detected as the medical team from the primary care level is not
trained in detection of mental disorders. The prejudice towards mental health service
users, together with the silent debut of mental diseases, keeps a low level of
addressability to mental health services. As well, denying their disease, the patients do
not address to health services until their disease is too serious and they need hospital
care. Numerous studies show that rates of service utilization by people with mental
health problems remain low. For instance, in the Netherlands more than 40 per cent of
people with bi-polar disorder are estimated not to come into contact with mental
health services. The ESEMED study (European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental
Disorders), covering six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and Spain), concluded that there was insufficient use of both general and
specialist mental health services relative to the prevalence of mental health problems
in the population, with only one in four people in need coming into contact with
services, although contact rates were higher for some problems such as mood
disorders (5). For this reason the active detection of the mental diseases is very
important.
A broad range of ingredients of care are requested to meet both medical and
social needs of people with mental disabilities, including medication, psychotherapy, 596 psychosocial rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, employment, housing, etc. As
well, mental health services can be effective only when provided within a
multidisciplinary care team: psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, etc. The
complex needs of many persons with mental disorders cannot be met by the health
sector alone. Intersectoral collaboration is therefore essential. Collaboration is needed
both within the health sector (intrasectoral collaboration) and outside the health sector
(intersectoral collaboration) (6).
Decentralization and health financing reforms have largely been driven by a
desire to improve access to health care, advance equity in health service provision and
promote the use of cost-effective technologies so as to obtain the best possible health
outcomes for populations. On the other hand, financing reforms have also been seen
by governments as a method of controlling the cost of providing health care and
spreading the cost to other players, especially the users of services. Health financing
reforms include changes in revenue collection based on the concept of pooling and
reforms in the purchasing of health services. However, general health reforms might
have negative impact on mental health: the fragmentation and exclusion of services
for people with mental disorders through decentralization; increased out-of-pocket
payments that would harm the interests of people with mental disorders, as they are
unlikely to have the resources to pay for services; exclusion from the treatment for
mental disorders by introduction of pooling systems such as public and private
insurance schemes (4).
World-wide, out-of-pocket payment is the most important method for
financing mental health care in 17.8% of WHO member countries. In 62.8% of WHO
member countries the most important method is tax based; in 14.4% of countries:
social insurance; in 1.7% of countries: private insurance; and in 3.3% of countries
external grants from international organizations and other countries. In the European
Region social insurance is the primary method of financing in 44.9% of countries.
Out-of-pocket payment is the second most used method of financing mental health
care in 28.9% of countries in the European Region (7).
Mental health services are widely underfunded, especially in developing
countries. Nearly 28% of WHO member countries do not have separate budgets for
mental health. Of the countries that have such budgets, 37% spend less than 1% of
their health budgets on mental health. Expenditure on mental health amounts to under
1% of the health budgets in 62% of developing countries and 16% of developed
countries. Thus there is a significant discrepancy between the burden of mental
disorders and the resources dedicated to mental health services (4). In order to
properly finance the mental health system, decision makers should find ways to
mobilize sufficient funds, should use economic research methods to identify how the
funds should be allocated to cover the needs and to find cost control tools (8). 2. Mental health care in community based services
The provision of mental health care in community settings has been highly debated in
the last two decades. The starting point was the discontent with the long term care
hospitals. Long term hospitalization was held accountable by progressive loss of life
skills and accumulation of “deficit symptoms” or “institutionalism”. Other concerns
included repeated cases of ill-treatment to patients, the geographical and professional
isolation of institutions and their staffs, poor reporting and accounting procedures, 597 failures of management, leadership and administration, insufficient finances,
ineffective staff training, and inadequate inspection and quality assurance measures.
The resulting response was deinstitutionalization (9).
As there was no scientific evidence that community services alone can provide
satisfactory comprehensive care, the best alternative was considered a balanced care
model. Balanced care is essentially community-based, but hospitals play an important
backup role. This means that mental health services are provided in normal
community settings close to the population served, and hospital stays are as brief as
possible, arranged promptly and employed only when necessary. The balanced care
approach seeks to provide services that (9):
− are close to home, including modern hospitals for acute admissions and longterm residential facilities in the community;
− are mobile, including services that provide home treatment;
− address disabilities as well as symptoms;
− provide treatment and care specific to the diagnosis and needs of each
individual;
− adhere to international conventions on human rights;
− reflect the priorities of the service users themselves; and
− are coordinated among mental health care providers and agencies. 2.1 Types of mental health services
According to WHO recommendations, mental health services should be organized
based on principles of accessibility, coordinated care, continuity of care,
effectiveness, equity and respect for human rights. As well, mental health care should
be provided through general health services and community settings. Large and
centralized psychiatric institutions need to be replaced by other more appropriate
mental health services. WHO does not make any recommendation on a specific model
for organizing mental health services. The organization and delivery should take into
account the country’s social, cultural, political and economic context. The various
components of mental health services are grouped in three main categories: services
integrated to the general health system, community services and institutional services
(6).
2.1.1 Mental health services integrated into the general health system
Mental health services in primary care include preventive and curative services and it
is delivered by primary care professionals: general practitioners, nurses, community
health workers and other health staff based in primary care clinics. This requires
significant investment in training primary care professionals to detect and treat mental
disorders. Furthermore, primary care staff should have the time to conduct mental
health interventions. Clinical outcomes of primary care integrated mental health
services depends on the knowledge and skills of primary care staff in diagnosing and
treating common mental disorders, as well as on the availability of drugs and of
psychosocial treatment. Primary care services are easily accessible and are generally
better accepted than other forms of service delivery by persons with mental health
disorders. This is mainly attributable to the reduced stigma associated with seeking
help from such services. Both providers and users generally find these services
inexpensive in comparison with other mental health services. 598 Mental health services in general hospitals include certain services offered in
district general hospitals and academic or central hospitals that form part of the
general health system. Such services include psychiatric inpatient wards, psychiatric
beds in general wards and emergency departments, and outpatient clinics. There may
also be some specialist services, e.g. for children, adolescents and the elderly. These
services are provided by specialist mental health professionals such as psychiatrists,
psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers, psychologists. The clinical outcomes
associated with these services are variable and depend on their quality and quantity.
Mental health services based in general hospitals are usually well accepted. Because
general hospitals are usually located in large urban centres, however, there may be
problems of accessibility in countries lacking good transport systems. For service
providers, mental health services in general hospitals are likely to be more expensive
than services provided in primary care but less expensive than those provided in
specialized institutions. Service users also have to incur additional travel and time
costs that can create additional access barriers in some countries.
2.1.2 Community mental health services
Formal community mental health services include community-based rehabilitation
service, hospital diversion programmes, mobile crisis teams, therapeutic and
residential supervised services, home help and support services, and communitybased services for special populations such as trauma victims, children, adolescents
and the elderly. Community mental health services need close working links with
general hospitals and mental hospitals, with primary care services and informal care
providers working in the community. These services require some staff with a high
level of skills and training, although many functions can be delivered by general
health workers with some training in mental health. Community mental health
services provide an opportunity for many persons with severe mental disorders to
continue living in the community and thus promote community integration. High
levels of satisfaction with community mental health services are associated with their
accessibility, a reduced level of stigma associated with help-seeking for mental
disorders and a reduced likelihood of violations of human rights.
Informal community mental health services may be provided by local
community members other than general health professionals or dedicated mental
health professionals and para-professionals. Informal providers are a useful
complement to formal mental health services and can be important in improving the
outcomes of persons with mental disorders. Such service providers usually have high
acceptability and there are few access barriers as the providers are nearly always
based in the communities they serve.
2.1.3 Institutional mental health services
Specialist institutional mental health services are provided by outpatient clinics and
public or private hospital-based facilities that offer various services in inpatient
wards. Among the services there are those provided by acute and high security units,
units for children and elderly people and forensic psychiatry units. Specialist services
are usually tertiary referral centres and patients who are difficult to treat make up a
large proportion of their case-loads. If well funded and well resourced they provide
care of high quality and produce outcomes that are good enough to justify their
continuation. Nearly all specialist services have problems of access, associated with a 599 lack of availability, with location in urban centres that have inadequate transport
links, and with stigma attached to seeking help from such services. Specialist services
are costly to set up and maintain, mainly because of the high level of investment in
infrastructure and staff.
Dedicated mental hospitals mainly provide long-stay custodial services. In
many parts of the world they are either the only mental health services or remain a
substantial component of such services. Mental hospitals are frequently associated
with poor outcomes attributable to a combination of factors such as poor clinical care,
violations of human rights, the nature of institutionalized care and a lack of
rehabilitative activities. Stigma associated with mental hospitals also reduces their
acceptability and accessibility. 2.2 Community care based mental health services
Community mental health services can include a wide array of settings and different
levels of care provided by mental health professionals and para-professionals, usually
working in multidisciplinary teams (10). Examples of services provided in community
care settings are presented below.
Community-based rehabilitation and treatment programmes - aiming to assist
people with mental disorders to live a full community life. There are many models of
community-based service provision such as case management, hospital diversion
programmes, intensive home support and outreach services. In the case management
model, each patient is allocated a ‘case manager’ who assesses the patient’s needs,
develops a care plan, offers linkages with the care providers and advocacy. Intensive
case management services can be provided for a short period during a crisis in order
to avoid or prevent hospitalization (hospital diversion programme).
Specialist mental health services for treatment and care of people with severe
mental health problems in the community. Specialist teams need to be organized.
Examples are specialist community services to care for people with severe problems
such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, dementia and severe depression.
These services need to be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and should
comprise multidisciplinary staff.
Housing services include supported, residential and emergency housing (11).
Supported housing ensures the provision of affordable accommodation and a range of
supporting services enabling patients able to live independently to maintain their
living arrangements. Residential housing enables patients that cannot live
independently to acquire skills and confidence in a group setting in order to maximize
their independence. Emergency housing provides services to homeless patients who
require intensive stabilization (but no hospitalization).
Crisis intervention services need to be provided in association with primary
care providers, who are usually the first “port of call” in a crisis. This requires good
referral and linkage systems with primary care services, as well as with mental health
services in general hospitals. In some countries, community mental health teams also
provide home-based intensive crisis intervention services through mobile and
outreach crisis teams. Hospital diversion programmes in other countries try to divert
people in crisis from a hospital admission to other community-based facilities such as
crisis shelters. 600 Education and training community mental health services are usually involved
in education and training of staff for their own services, as well as of primary health
care staff and mental health professionals working in general hospitals.
Community mental health services need to develop good intersectoral
collaboration, because people with mental disorders have complex needs that cut
across service sectors. Links need to be established with primary health care services
and with services provided through general hospital settings.
Community mental health services need to participate in research especially in
the area of service delivery, for example by investigating the effectiveness of different
models of service delivery. Community mental health services have first-hand
knowledge of delivering community-based services, and this can usefully feed into
the framing of research priorities and questions.
People with mental disorders have multiple needs related to health, welfare,
employment, housing, criminal justice and education. For these reasons, community
mental health services need to work collaboratively with other sectors and establish
clear referral pathways, mutual supervision and training.
All these services could be combined in different community mental health
care models, from country to country, depending on various factors including the
socio-cultural context, how national health services are organized and the availability
of financial and human resources. 2.3 Developing community mental health services
Community care facilities exist in only 68.1% of WHO member countries, covering
83.3% of the world’s population. Across different income groups, community care
facilities in mental health are present in 51.7% of the low income countries and in
97.4% of the high income countries. There were also significant differences between
income group and the presence of community care facilities within countries (7).
Currently 28% of countries in Europe do not have any community-based mental
health services. There is wide variability according to levels of economic
development. Only 33% of low-income European countries have community-based
mental health services, whereas 91% of high-income countries have such services.
Among those countries that do report having community services, the actual extent of
service coverage also varies widely (10).
Recent developments in the understanding, treatment and care of people with
mental disorders have shown that the most effective care of people with mental
disorders is provided at community level. The importance of the community for
mental health is highlighted by the World Health Organization in the World Health
Report 2001 - Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope, where 3 out of 10
recommendations refer directly to the community (1):
− Give care in the community (3). ‘Community care has a better effect than
institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of individuals with
chronic mental disorders. Shifting patients from mental hospitals to care in the
community is also cost-effective and respects human rights. Mental health
services should therefore be provided in the community, with the use of all
available resources. Community-based services can lead to early intervention
and limit the stigma of taking treatment. Large custodial mental hospitals
should be replaced by community care facilities, backed by general hospital 601 psychiatric beds and home care support, which meet all the needs of the ill that
were the responsibility of those hospitals. This shift towards community care
requires health workers and rehabilitation services to be available at
community level, along with the provision of crisis support, protected housing,
and sheltered employment.’
− Involve communities, families and consumers (5). ‘Communities, families and
consumers should be included in the development and decision-making of policies,
programmes and services. This should lead to services being better tailored to
people’s needs and better used. In addition, interventions should take account of
age, sex, culture and social conditions, so as to meet the needs of people with
mental disorders and their families.’
− Monitor community mental health (9). 'The mental health of communities
should be monitored by including mental health indicators in health
information and reporting systems. The indices should include both the
numbers of individuals with mental disorders and the quality of their care, as
well as some more general measures of the mental health of communities. Such
monitoring helps to determine trends and to detect mental health changes
resulting from external events, such as disasters. Monitoring is necessary to
assess the effectiveness of mental health prevention and treatment
programmes, and it also strengthens arguments for the provision of more
resources. New indicators for the mental health of communities are
necessary.’
The shifting of patients from mental hospitals to care in the community should
be based, primarily on the existence of a mental health policy that promotes the
development of community-based care. Policies should be drawn up with the
involvement of all stakeholders and should be based upon up-to-date and reliable
information concerning the community, mental health indicators, effective treatments,
prevention and promotion strategies, and mental health resources. Mental health
policy and service provision should take into account the context of general health
systems organization and financing.
An analysis of the data gathered by Project Atlas (7) shows that only 62.1% of
WHO member countries, accounting for 68.3% of the population, have a mental
health policy. In European Region 70.6% of countries have a mental health policy.
Most countries that report having a policy also have all the essential components
incorporated into them: treatment, prevention, rehabilitation, promotion and
advocacy. Intersectoral collaboration, collaboration with NGOs, provision of social
assistance, human resource development, improvement of community care facilities
especially for the underserved are some of the other components also included in the
policies of some countries. The Project Atlas does not have data on the degree in
which these policies are implemented.
For a successful implementation of the mental health policy, political,
legislative, financial and administrative support is required. Necessary investments
have to be made in buildings, staff, training, and the provision of backup facilities.
Monitoring and evaluation are important aspects of change: planning and evaluation
should go hand in hand, and evaluation should, wherever possible, have an
epidemiological basis. The policy will need to be reviewed periodically to allow for
the modification or updating of programmes (1). 602 The main principles that should guide the development of community mental
health care services are: accessibility, comprehensiveness, coordination and
continuity of care, effectiveness, equity and respect for the human rights (6). The
development of community mental health services should take into account the
comprehensive and locally based provision of treatment and care, accessible to
patients and their families. Services should be comprehensive in that they provide a
range of facilities to meet the mental health needs of the population. If re-shaping of
large hospitals is envisaged, developing of community services should come first.
Deinstitutionalization can proceed in stages once community-based alternatives are in
place and all the functions of the institution are reproduced in the community.
Planning for community mental health services should not be an isolated
process. Service planners have to determine the exact mix of different types of mental
health services and the level of provision of particular service delivery channels. No
matter how developed a community care network is in place, there will always be a
need for long-stay facilities for an extremely small proportion of patients. However,
most of these patients can be accommodated in small units located in the community,
approximating community living as far as possible, or alternatively, in small long-stay
wards in hospitals that also provide other specialist services (6). As the complex
needs of many persons with mental disorders cannot be met by the health sector
alone, intersectoral collaboration should therefore be taken into consideration, both
within the health sector and outside the health sector.
Also, financing issues should be considered. Primarily, the general health
financing system should be well understood as even in the countries in which mental
health financing is not distinct of the general health financing, it is shaped or
determined by this. In order to understand the level of current resources and how they
are used, the entire mental health system should be mapped, and the resource base for
mental health services should be identified, as well as the allocation strategies. The
selection of method for purchasing mental health services should take into account the
increase of effectiveness and efficiency in services provision. EXERCISE
Task 1 – Situation analysis
The students will be split in three groups and asked to work on the following subjects:
− Analyse the national mental health policy;
− Analyse the country’s general health system: organization and financing,
degree of decentralization;
− Analyse the country’s mental health system: organization and financing,
human resources. Task 2 – Community mental health services development
The students will do a role play, having assigned different roles in a ‘working group’
(policy-makers, health professionals, patients, family members, NGOs and other
interested parties) appointed to formulate a mental health policy (that includes
development of community-based care) and to plan for a community mental health
service focusing on the following issues:
− What needs should be covered; 603 −
−
−
− What services will be provided;
What investments are necessary;
Where the money will come from;
What would be the implementation strategy. REFERENCES

Health promotion, health promoting hospitals, health promoting
management of chronic disease, Golnik
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• understand the idea of settings approach to health promotion;
• be aware of four areas of Health Promoting Hospitals (HPH) strategy;
• recognize the benefits of health promotion (HP) in hospitals;
• understand the purpose, structure and functioning of International
Network of HPH;
• be familiar with standards and core strategies for HPH;
• acknowledge the importance of new HP and disease prevention
services in HPH;
• recognize the importance of patients' empowerment for health
promoting management of chronic disease.
The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion put forward the idea that health
is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life.
This settings approach to HP led to a number of initiatives, among them
HPH.
The HPH strategy focuses on four areas: promoting the health of
patients, promoting the health of staff, changing the organization to a
health promoting setting, and promoting the health of the community in
the catchments area of the hospital.
The need for and the relevance of setting standards for HP in
hospitals was realized in the International Network of HPH, which acts as
a network of networks linking all national and/or regional networks. It
supports the exchange of ideas and strategies implemented in different
cultures and health care systems, developing knowledge on strategic
issues and enlarging the vision. Nowadays, the International Network of
HPH comprises 30 member states, 33 national and/or regional networks
and more than 650 hospitals. Address for

recommendations, guidance, and support with regard to HP in hospitals.
An important element is the activation of the patient’s individual resources
and competences in coping with disease. Example of effective
intervention of this type of services is the case of Golnik hospital, where
introducing specific type of treatment for specific group of patients has
developed from hospital vision to national clinical pathway
implementation.

HEALTH GOALS
Mitja Košnik, Jerneja Farkaš-Lainščak THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Basics of health promotion
Health promotion is defined as the process of enabling people to increase control
over, and improve their health (1). Health promotion goes beyond health education
and disease prevention in as far as it is based on the concept of salutogenesis and
stresses the analysis and development of the health potential of individuals (2). Health
in this context not only refers to the traditional, objective and biomedical view of the
absence of infirmity or disease but to a holistic view that adds mental resources and
social well-being to physical health (3, 4). The statement of principles known as the
Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1), developed by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 1986, is internationally accepted as the guiding framework
for health promotion activity. Settings approach to health promotion
Based on the notion of health as a positive concept, the Ottawa Charter for Health
Promotion put forward the idea that health is created and lived by people within
the settings of their everyday life. This settings approach to health promotion,
founded on the experience of community and organizational development, led to a
number of initiatives such as Healthy Cities, Health Promoting Schools, Health
Promoting Workplaces, Health Promoting Hospitals (HPH), etc. in order to
improve people’s health where they spend most of their time (5). The settings
approach acknowledges that behavioural changes are only possible and stable if
they are integrated into everyday life and correspond with concurrent habits and
existing cultures (6). Development of the Health Promoting Hospitals concept
Twenty years ago, WHO initiated HPH movement in order to support hospitals
towards placing greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention,
rather than on diagnostic and curative services alone. The HPH strategy focuses
on four areas: promoting the health of patients, promoting the health of staff,
changing the organization to a health promoting setting, and promoting the health
of the community in the catchments area of the hospital (7). These four areas are
reflected in the definition of a HPH, which states that HPH does not only provide
high quality comprehensive medical and nursing services, but also develops a
corporate identity that embraces the aims of health promotion, develops a health
promoting organizational structure and culture, including active, participatory
roles for patients and all members of staff, develops itself into a health promoting
physical environment, and actively cooperates with its community (4). 608 Promoting the health of patients
Health professionals in hospitals can have a lasting impact on influencing the
behaviour of patients and relatives, who are more responsive to health advice in
situations of experienced disease (8). This is of particular importance for two reasons:
firstly, the prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing in Europe and throughout the
world (9); secondly, many hospital treatments today not only prevent premature death
but improve the quality of life of patients (10). In order to maintain this quality, the
patient’s own behaviour after discharge and effective support from relatives are
important variables. Therefore, one of the HPH's priorities is to encourage healthy
behaviour, prevent readmissions and maintain quality of life of patients (7). Promoting the health of staff
Paradoxically, in hospitals – organizations that aim to restore health – the
acknowledgement of factors that endanger the health of their staff is poorly developed
(11). These working places, most of which are occupied by women, are characterized
by certain physical, chemical, biological and psychosocial risk factors. With the
increasing lack and migration of health professionals, hospitals have to compete for
the best staff. Hospitals that offer a safe and health promoting working environment
and that involve staff in creating such an environment will be more successful to
attract, recruit and retain staff (12). Health promotion programmes can improve the
health of staff, reduce costly short-term absenteeism rates, and improve productivity
and quality (13). Changing the organization to a health promoting setting
and promoting the health of the local community
Hospitals also typically produce high amounts of waste and hazardous substances.
Introducing health promotion strategies in hospitals can help reduce the pollution of
the environment and the cooperation with other institutions and professionals can help
achieve the highest possible coordination of care. Furthermore, as research and
teaching institutions hospital produce, accumulate and disseminate a lot of knowledge
and they can have an impact on the local health structures and influence professional
practice elsewhere (7). In this context, hospitals are expected to expand their role
beyond the curative services to a pro-acting vehicle for health improvement. Towards
this aim, HPH target the health of individuals (staff, patients, local community
population) but they promote the health of their organization as well, by creating a
sustainable organization, capable of confronting today’s challenges (14). Evolution of the International Network of Health
Promoting Hospitals
A first connection between hospitals and health promotion appeared at the end of the
1970s when health promotion and disease prevention came up in the United States as
additional professional services provided by the hospital (15). In order to support the
introduction of health promotion programmes in hospitals, the WHO Regional Office
for Europe started the first international consultations in 1988. In the subsequent year,
the WHO model project »Health and Hospital« was initiated with the Rudolfstiftung 609 Hospital in Vienna, as a partner institution (13). After this phase of consultation and
experimenting the HPH movement went into its developmental phase, being marked
by the initiation of the European Pilot Hospital Project by the WHO Regional Office
for Europe in 1993. This phase, which lasted from 1993 to 1997, involved intensive
monitoring of the development of projects in 20 partner hospitals from 11 European
countries (Austria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Sweden) (16).
Subsequent to the closing of this pilot phase, national and regional networks
were developed and the network reached its consolidation phase. Since then, national
and regional networks take an important role in encouraging the cooperation and
exchange of experience between hospitals of a region or a country, including the
identification of areas of common interest, the sharing of resources and the
development of common evaluation systems. The International Network of HPH acts
as a network of networks linking all national and/or regional networks. It supports the
exchange of ideas and strategies implemented in different cultures and health care
systems, developing knowledge on strategic issues and enlarging the vision.
Nowadays, the International Network of HPH comprises 30 member states, 33
national and/or regional networks and more than 650 hospitals (17).
Many more countries and hospitals are regularly participating in the annual
international HPH conferences which have been organized since 1993 in Warsaw,
Padova, Linköping, Londonderry, Vienna, Darmstadt, Swansea, Athens, Copenhagen,
Bratislava, Florence, Moscow, Dublin, Lithuania, Vienna and - in 2008 - Berlin. A
semi-annual HPH Newsletter has been issued also since 1993.
In addition to the national and/or regional networks, specific HPH task forces
put efforts into further developing the HPH concept for specific thematic areas or for
specific hospital types (e.g. Health promoting psychiatric health care services, Health
promotion for children and adolescents in the hospital, Migrant friendly and culturally
competent hospitals, Putting HPH policy into action (18 HPH core strategies),
Standards for HPH and quality-based reimbursement) (16).
The HPH network is currently developing into an international association. It
is governed by an elected international governance board and has a general assembly
meeting once a year. The secretariat is based at the WHO Collaborating Centre for
Evidence Based Health Promotion in Hospitals in Copenhagen (18). The international
HPH conferences, the international HPH Newsletter and other scientific and technical
functions are supported by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Promotion in
Hospitals and Health Care, which is situated in Vienna (19).
Subsequently, the progress of HPH has resulted in a series of influential
reports that include The Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals, The
Ljubljana Charter on Reforming Health Care, and The Vienna Recommendations on
Health Promoting Hospitals (20-22). The latest document forms the set of principles
on which the HPH concept is based. According to them a HPH should:
1. promote human dignity, equity, solidarity, and professional ethics,
acknowledging differences in needs, values and culture of different population
groups;
2. be oriented towards quality improvement, the well-being of patients, relatives
and staff, protection of the environment and realization of the potential to
become a learning organization;
3. focus on health with a holistic approach and not only on curative services; 610 4. be centred on people providing health services in the best way possible for
patients and relatives to facilitate the healing process and contribute to the
empowerment of patients;
5. use resources efficiently, cost-effectively and allocate resources on the basis of
contribution to health improvement;
6. form as close link as possible with other levels of the health care system and
the community (22). Standards and core strategies for Health Promoting
Hospitals
The need for and the relevance of setting standards for health promotion in hospitals
was realized in the International Network of HPH. Over a 2-year period a set of
standards was developed in order to make the standards applicable and acceptable in
all hospitals and in order to make it possible to integrate the standards in existing
quality standards for hospitals as established by several international and national
quality and accreditation organizations (7). The standards have now been through a
pilot test, which has confirmed that they are understandable, meaningful, relevant and
applicable. International quality organizations are encouraged to integrate the
standards in their already established sets of standards and in the future use of the
standards. The final set of five standards concern: Management Policy, Patient
Assessment, Patient Information and Intervention, Promoting a Healthy Workplace,
and Continuity and Cooperation (23). The standards relate to patient pathways and
define responsibilities and activities concerning health promotion as an integrated part
of all services offered to patients in every hospital. Each standard consists of a
standard formulation, objective and definition of sub standards (24).
In 2001, WHO launched a working group to develop an up-to-date strategic
framework for HPH since the situation of hospitals is characterized by a permanent
and increasing pressure of their dynamic environments to adapt to changing political
and economic, professional and consumer expectations concerning the process and
content of hospital services. Two general tendencies can be distinguished within the
trend of hospital reforms:
1. strategic re-positioning of the hospital with the need to redefine the range and
mix of services (i.e. the distinction between core business and other services,
balancing inpatient/outpatient services or acute/chronic/rehabilitative services,
inclusion of educative elements, specialization of types of hospitals and
departments, and integration with primary care and social services and
intersectoral collaboration);
2. assuring and improving quality of services (i.e. to improve the safety,
appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of services and improve
satisfaction of stakeholders, introducing different quality approaches,
accreditation and put a stronger emphasis on evidence based medicine and
patient’s rights) (7).
To be able to identify the specific contributions of health promotion to
such strategic re-positioning and quality improvement in hospitals, six general 611 strategies for the three target groups (patients, staff and the community) were
introduced (Table 1).
Table 1. Six general health promotion strategies for each group of stakeholders (patients, staff,
and the community).
Health promotion strategies
1. Health promotion quality development of treatment and care, by empowerment of
stakeholders for health promoting self-care/self-reproduction
2. Health promotion quality development of treatment and care, by empowerment of
stakeholders for health promoting co-production
3. Health promotion quality development for health promoting and empowering hospital
setting for stakeholders
4. Provision of specific health promotion services – empowering illness management (patient
education) for stakeholders
5. Provision of specific health promotion services – empowering lifestyle development
(health education) for stakeholders
6. Provision of specific health promotion activities – participation in health promoting and
empowering community development for stakeholders Service oriented strategies include quality improvement of already existing
clinical and hotel services (strategies 1, 2) or strategies introducing new, primarily
educative services with mid-term or long-term health effects (strategies 4, 5).
Strategies can be distinguished according to their orientation of treating or managing
specific diseases (strategies 2, 4) and strategies oriented at services for maintaining or
improving positive health (strategies 1, 5). Concerning settings, strategies developing
the hospital setting itself (strategy 3) can be distinguished from strategies of
participation of the hospital in developing the community setting (strategy 6) or other
settings within the community (e.g. workplaces or schools). By being oriented at
improving health gain and not just clinical outcome, these six strategies do not only
apply to patients (and their relatives), but in a somewhat modified way also to staff
and members of the community the hospital serves and is situated in, resulting in
eighteen core strategies for health promotion in hospitals (7, 12). Dilemmas facing Health Promoting Hospitals
The main perceived barriers faced in the development of HPH are shortages of funds,
personnel, time management and professional skills. The WHO refers to the fact that
most health professionals in the hospital setting do not readily associate health
promotion as part of their role (25). In the past, the projects carried out within the
HPH network were characterized by a more traditional focus on health education
interventions for patients and to a lesser extent for staff (10). Similar problems to
those stated above can be found throughout the HPH movement in the HPH Network
Progress Reports (26). Nearly all of the European member states report commonly
encountered problems. This is not surprising, however, and perhaps inevitable given
that many European countries stress the lack of government-related policy support,
lack of individual organizational management commitment and lack of resources set
aside for health promotion in hospitals (27). Perhaps the main driver for HPH reform 612 in Europe is the capacity for hospitals to affect and influence public health reform and
therefore directly influence the health of their surrounding communities. Hospitals
and their leaders are being held increasingly accountable for the health status of local
populations (28). This represents the greatest challenge for the HPH movement and
perhaps its biggest failure to date. A broader vision would see the development of not
just what could be termed as HPH, but institutions that could be classified as Public
Health Hospitals. A Public Health Hospital is one that develops its staff to move away
from increasing medicalized subspecialization to an increasing understanding of the
wider health agenda (29). It does this as part of a health promoting capacity-building
process that leads to an organization’s overall structural development, as well as
offering a support structure for wider community health promotion initiatives through
collaboration with public health agencies (30).
Tountas and colleagues reported that effective planning of hospital health
promotion activities is required so that the daily routine is not interrupted. Besides of
personnel shortage and lack of funding, lack of health promotion background was
found to be perceived as a significant problem (14). On the other hand, Polluste and
colleagues compared the implementation of health promoting and quality-related
activities in HPH and those hospitals which have not joined the HPH network (nonHPH) in Estonia. In the beginning of 2005, they conducted a postal survey among the
top managers of fifty-four Estonian hospitals. The questionnaire was based on the
WHO standards for HPH and on the set of the national quality assurance (QA)
requirements for health services. The study demonstrated some significant differences
in the uptake of health promotion and QA activities between HPH and non-HPH. For
example, regular patient satisfaction studies were conducted in 83% of HPH and 46%
of non-HPH (p<0.03) and 65% of HPH and 46% of non-HPH cooperated with various
patient organizations (p<0.03). Systems for reporting and analysis of complications
were implemented in 71% of HPH and 33% of non-HPH (p<0.03); also, the
implementation of various guidelines was more developed in HPH. All HPH have
carried out a risk analysis on the workplace and staff job satisfaction studies were
conducted in 89% of HPH and 41% non-HPH (p<0.05). They concluded that the
concepts of HPH and QA are closely related. Making progress in health promotion is
accompanied with QA and vice versa. Implementation of health-promoting activities
in hospitals promote the well-being and health of patients and hospital staff, and
creates a supportive environment to provide safe and high-quality health services
(31). To further develop HPH, effort needs to be made to ensure that hospital leaders
and management are considered first. If managerial staff have an appropriate
understanding of the concept and principles of HPH, then it is more likely that health
promotion activities can be introduced into the daily workings of hospitals, and the
necessary funds, personnel and training on health promotion skills be provided (32).
It does appear, however, that the HPH movement is spreading rather than
diminishing. The focus of the HPH projects is now enlarging, addressing also
organizational and community issues such as a change of organizational culture and
environmental issues. A future challenge of HPH is still to link organizational health
promoting activities with continuous quality improvement programmes, making use
of the apparent similarities such as the focus on continuous process and development,
involvement and ownership, monitoring and measurement, and to incorporate the
principle of health promotion into the organizational structure and culture (12). 613 CASE STUDY: MEETING THE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH
GOALS: THE CASE OF GOLNIK HOSPITAL, SLOVENIA
New health promotion and disease prevention services
The initial idea of HPH was focused on placing greater emphasis on health promotion
and disease prevention, rather than on diagnostic and curative services alone. In
public health, disease prevention is usually defined as primary disease prevention
which prevents diseases from occurring, secondary prevention which detects disease
at an early stage and prevents disease from developing, and tertiary prevention which
prevents aggravation or recurrence of disease and secures maintenance of functional
level (7). Traditionally, hospitals primarily take care of tasks that relate to secondary
or tertiary prevention whereas the primary sector and other social institutions take
care of primary prevention. It is, however, increasingly recognized that hospitals can
play a significant role in linking all three levels of prevention in order to gain patients’
satisfactory outcome (33). The focus stays on effective treatment, but in order to
optimize health gain, the outcome concept of hospitals has widened to include, in
addition to clinical outcomes, also patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life,
and health literacy. All of these aspects have to get the attention within the treatment
process.
There is international consensus that patients should be given
recommendations, guidance, and support with regard to health promotion in hospitals
(23). Health promotion secures that risk conditions are identified and that the patient
has knowledge of the significance of these conditions, recommendations for changes,
and active support for carrying out these changes. From this perspective follows that
it makes sense to invest not only in clinical interventions, but also in other
interventions to improve health, like educating patients for self-management and
developing situations to make the »healthy choice the easy choice«. An important
element is the activation of the patient’s individual resources and competences in
coping with disease (28). A practical example for empowering patients for coproduction would be diagnosis and treatment related patient information, training and
counselling (e.g. by informing patients about how they can contribute to the
recuperation process, by describing alternatives and side effects), in order to enable
patients to participate in the diagnostic process (e.g. by providing all information
needed); participate in treatment-related decision-making; actively participate in
treatment and care processes (e.g. by complying with the prescriptions). Thus, health
promotion and specific disease prevention form a continuum. Empowerment of patients for health promoting
management of chronic disease
Expert interventions in hospitals provide in general only a turning point in disease
process, and a basis for recuperation or the successful management of chronic disease.
Every contact with hospital based physicians either during hospitalization or
ambulatory visit represents an ample opportunity to involve patients in diagnostic and
therapeutic management of their medical condition. Personal experience of disease
deterioration, even to a slight degree, generally makes patients susceptible to nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions in which their active role is
indispensable. The main part of recuperation or of the day-to-day disease 614 management has to be performed primarily by the patients themselves, with specific
professional support by the hospital, specialized services, or other health care
services. This phase of the disease career lasts much longer and is out of direct control
of the hospital, but is crucial for the outcome of regaining health and quality of life.
Hospitals have to take this perspective on the disease career into account by
either providing necessary disease specific support by themselves or by referring
patients to other, specialized providers in the health care system. The more complex
and the more rare the disease and its treatment gets, the more likely it remains a task
of the hospital itself, but this of course requires adequate legal and financial
regulation which allows to provide these services systematically. One example of
effective intervention of this type of services is the case of Golnik hospital, where
introducing specific type of treatment for specific group of patients has developed
from hospital vision to national clinical pathway implementation. Specific immunotherapy: concepts and principles
Introduction
Specific immunotherapy is a well established form of treatment of patients with some
allergic diseases. Among main indications is allergic rhinitis. The goal of specific
immunotherapy is to diminish the allergic response to allergens. The outcome of
immunotherapy is a decrease in symptoms during allergen exposure, better response
to medical therapy and decreased risk of new allergen sensitizations. In very few
patients complete disappearance of the disease may be achieved as well. Selection of patients
Immunotherapy is only effective in carefully selected patients. IgE mediated allergy
has to be proven. Appropriate patients are those in whom:
1. allergic symptoms are due to only one allergen or a group of cross reactive
allergens;
2. for symptomatic relief high and regular doses of systemic and local drugs are
necessary;
3. duration of the allergen exposure season is long.
Clinical studies have shown that patients with multiple allergies do not benefit
from immunotherapy. Other diseases which might be the predominant cause of
patients’ symptoms should be excluded, like structural diseases of the nose and
nonallergic rhinitis. Immunotherapy is effective only in patients, where allergy is the
only/predominant mechanism of symptoms. Burden of immunotherapy for the health care system
As immunotherapy is time consuming and requires excellent compliance by the
patients in order to get an effect, immunotherapy is not suitable for patients with mild
and short lasting allergic diseases, which are easily controlled with medications. It is
important also to consider the costs of allergen extracts for immunotherapy which are
substantial and the same for patient with severe as for the patient with mild disease.
Immunotherapy has also unpleasant and even dangerous side effects. Local
reactions at the site of allergen application (swelling, itching) are quite common;
fortunately systemic allergic reactions are extremely rare in pollen and dust mite 615 immunotherapy. Life threatening reactions are particularly common in patients with
unstable asthma and patients with anaphylaxis. Medical and pharmaceutical approach to organization of
immunotherapy
Immunotherapy should be offered only to those patients in whom high efficacy and
low risk of side effects of the treatment is expected. However, the main interest of the
producers and traders of allergen extracts is a widespread use of immunotherapy
concerning safety more than efficacy of the treatment. In order to reach their goal,
they run a promotion which is not always based on evidence derived from clinical
studies. Sadly enough, many practicing medical doctors are not updated with the
results of evidence based medicine, but get most medical information from
pharmaceutical representatives and promotion leaflets (34). Introduction of sublingual immunotherapy in Slovenia
In Slovenia subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has been used for decades. SCIT
applications were mostly limited to the hospital based allergologists. Beside safety
aspects the main reason for the limited use of immunotherapy was the way of
reimbursement. Allergen extracts were not registered in Slovenia and were only
purchased by the health institution on their own expense. Doctors were not able to
make a prescription for the allergen extract for the pharmacy. For that reason private
and community based allergologists were discouraged to prescribe immunotherapy
and consequently didn’t get experience in selection and follow up of the patients on
immunotherapy.
In 2007 sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was registered in Slovenia and
reimbursed by health insurance. That form of immunotherapy is suitable also for
allergologists with only outpatient practice. As patients don’t need to visit doctor for
monthly injections and the cost of allergen is reimbursed, we expected much higher
interest in prescribing that form of immunotherapy.
Clinical studies of SLIT showed comparable efficacy to SCIT when performed
in carefully selected groups of mono/oligosensitized patients. In all clinical trials
SLIT was performed with a single allergen or a combination of two allergens in full
dose of each allergen. Moreover, studies showed marked dose response. Reducing the
dose of allergen to one third, the effect of SLIT was undistinguishable from placebo.
However, producers of allergen extracts offered and promoted using:
1. many allergens, whose efficacy was not studied in clinical trials;
2. non-standardized allergen extracts in low dose;
3. mixtures of unrelated allergens. Expected negative effects of introduction of sublingual
immunotherapy on health
Allergologists in Golnik hospital, who are very experienced in immunotherapy, using
it for years not only in respiratory allergy, but also in venom allergy, recognized the
threat for health care system due to inefficient use of health care resources. Namely
we expected: 616 1. prescriptions of SLIT to patients, in whom there is only a weak indication;
2. insufficient performance of SLIT, namely only prescribing of allergen and not
guiding the patient through the process of SLIT;
3. predominant prescribing of mixtures of allergens and even allergens with no
clinical relevance.
For that reason we prepared a program for education of allergologists willing
to prescribe SLIT and set up a national clinical pathway for SLIT. Activities for setting up a national clinical pathway for
sublingual immunotherapy
Activity 1
First step was to negotiate the conditions for reimbursement of allergen extract with
health care insurance company. It was decided, that a patient gets a fully reimbursed
SLIT extract after agreement of allergy counsel that predefined criteria for SLIT are
fulfilled. Activity 2
Next step was the selection of the criteria for immunotherapy. We followed European
guidelines for immunotherapy (35). We prepared a check-list where the allergologist
marked the indication and the selection of the allergen for SLIT. Only allergens which
were shown in randomized clinical trials to be effective were put on the list. Only one
allergen could be selected for SLIT or in the case of two important non-cross reactive
allergens, two separate SLIT were performed. The check list in fact offered the
allergologist to become familiar with the standard for appropriate selection of patient
and allergen for immunotherapy (Appendix). Activity 3
Next step was a development of a document, which would guide the allergologist and
the patient through the process of SLIT. Prescription of allergen extract must be made
on time as the treatment has to begin 2 months before the pollen season. Patient
should be instructed how to take the drug, familiar with the local side effect of the
therapy, and adherent to therapy. For that reason a check list for the patient was
prepared, where all important dates are put (date for the beginning of the therapy,
dates of follow up visits, and a table where the patient confirms the use of allergen
drops and reports possible side effects). In the beginning of the SLIT patients are
offered a phone contact with the allergy nurse to clarify possible misunderstandings.
Follow up visits are planned before the pollen season to provide the patient with the
medications and at the top of the season to evaluate the efficacy of the SLIT.
All the documents were put in a form of a booklet, which is owned by a patient
but the copies of each filled page are put into the patient’s medical documentation file
in the allergologist’s office. The cover of the booklet was used for the detailed
explanation of SLIT to the patient, including the instruction for treatment of side
effects. 617 Activity 4
Activities were undertaken to obtain a consensus of the members of the Slovenian
Association of Allergy and Clinical Immunology on the content and the aim of the
clinical pathway. The same approach was used for adult and paediatric patients.
To facilitate the adherence of doctors with the clinical pathway, it was decided
that the data on the first year of the immunotherapy would be analyzed and presented
as a Slovenian study of introduction of the SLIT. We obtained some sponsorship for
the analysis form the producer of the allergen extracts.
In the first year 90 adult patients were recruited by 12 allergologists. Fortythree patients were treated at Golnik hospital and 47 by other allergologists.
Indications for SLIT were allergic rhinitis (seasonal 70, perennial 21) and asthma
(31). In 2 patients SLIT was started after SCIT discontinuation because of side
effects. Majority of patients (73) were treated with a singled allergen, 16 with a full
dose of two allergens and only 1 with a mixture of allergens (Table 2).

* 1 patient was treated with a combination of grass, birch and hazel pollen. 89 Conclusion
SLIT was effectively introduced in accordance with evidence based medicine and
European guidelines for immunotherapy (35). We believe that our approach reached
the following goals:
1. optimal clinical outcome of the treatment, namely the minimal possible
symptoms of the allergic rhinitis during the period of allergen exposure;
2. optimal patient-related outcome. With the empowerment of the patients we
probably achieved a positive perception of the treatment by the patients and
improved their satisfaction in spite of long lasting therapy. Finally, by well
selected patients, well performed SLIT and appropriate follow up during the
pollen season patients had better quality of life in spite of the long lasting
difficult therapy and bothersome chronic disease;
3. optimal health care system-related outcome, namely the best ratio between the
cost and the outcome of the treatment. The health care resources were directed
toward the patients, who were optimally selected and care was taken, that
resources were used optimally.
Proposal for introduction of sublingual immunotherapy is presented in Appendix. 618 EXERCISE

Selma Šogorić; Aleksandar Džakula; THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The World Health Organization (WHO), Office for Europe initiated the Healthy Cities
Project in 1986 as a long-term international development project that seeks to put health
on the agenda of the local, city level political decision-makers. The idea of the Healthy
City was likable since everyone could imagine the city he/she/it would like to live in, and
in the fifteen years time the group of the 35 (First phase) cities extended into 3000 cities
Europe wide, connected together through the WHO, Euro and the Network of the
European National Healthy Cities Networks. Other regional WHO Offices (Pacific
region, Eastern Mediterranean, ASIA, PAHO) supported the HC project development so
we entered 21 century with over 5000 Healthy Cities worldwide (1,2).
The Healthy Cities approach is grounded on system theories that perceived
community as an eco-system with capacity to work towards solutions to its own
community identified problems. The Healthy City notion of community is focused on
identifying community strengths instead of (just) diagnosing its’ problems and deficits.
Theories of community, based on the exact opposite of Mrs. Thatcher’s now famous
notion that “There is no society there are only individuals”, suggest that communities
form a whole, which is greater than the sum of the individuals within them. The
concept of community relates to a geographical entity as well as to sub systems such
as social groups, or those joined by business or family ties, but it includes
simultaneously the idea of mutuality and shared norms and values (3).
In order to secure project stability and continuity initiation of the Healthy City
requires explicit political commitment and consensus across party political lines, leading,
throughout the years, to the development of the sound project infrastructure (HC Office,
Steering Committee, Coordinating Committee, working groups, alliances, etc.), and
creation of the clear city health and development strategy (City Health Profile, City
Health Development Plan).
Healthy City is a process; it is about the change, innovation and formal system
reorientation. It is not award recognizing past merits; it is a tool helping to address our
cities present and future societal and developmental challenges. And there were many
of them for the (post war and transitional) Croatian Cities.
The Healthy City Project challenges city administrations to take seriously the
process of developing health–enhancing public policies and create physical and social
environments that support health but, as well, strengthen citizens’ participation.
With the vide variety of projects Healthy Cities Networks aimed to bring
improvements into the life of their citizens - children (safe playgrounds, additional
medical care, healthy kindergartens) and youth (free time activities), elderly
(neighbourly help, ‘elderly for elderly’ volunteer care, help at home, day centres,
hospice and palliative care services) and disabled (removing architectural barriers,
guide for disabled, beach adapted for disabled, lowering public telephones and
adjusting transport) young families (successful parenting skills, counselling and hot
lines, children and parents communication…) and socially deprived groups. (4) Cities 625 administration commitment to that task is evident from their yearly official analysis
(city social profile), City Council working guidelines (yearly business plans) or
changes in budget allocation. For example the City of Rijeka made the resolution (not
obligated by national legislation, but as their own, additional obligation) to provide
for “minimum 5% of the total city revenues for the social program”.
Public opinion changed as well. (Quotation – citizens’ views) “People become
aware that what we do today is good for their children… Healthy city project helps us
do the most we can, given the circumstances we live in… Work on the project results
in the increased awareness, pride that it is our city and that I am responsible for it…”
(Quotation – citizens’ views) “The main challenge of the Healthy City project is to
continue bringing efficiently together all parties interested in solving the identified
problems, and developing mutual trust and co-operation.” It is necessary “to maintain
the existing achievements, and to further upgrade them, providing vision for future in
urban planning, economic and human development of the city.”
Mentioned examples could clarify how the Healthy Cities (idea and tools)
could help to buffer the problems and negative health trends in communities. It
changes the way in which individuals, communities, private and voluntary
organizations and local governments think about, understand and make decisions
about health. Croatian cities and public health professionals accepted “healthy city”
idea form very beginning and used this new approach to empower communities
during period of transition, war aggression and various health challenges appeared
after first steps of the “Healthy city project” in 1986 (5). CASE STUDY
Unemployment
At the end of 90-tiees unemployment, especially among young and mid career
workers, was one of the hottest issues in the Croatian cities. It was addressed in three
different but complementary ways - as the issue of sustainable economic
development, through the empowerment of unemployed and as the training
(vocational) challenge. City of Labin
The City of Labin, for example, had fascinating results with so-called “entrepreneurial
incubator”, generating new jobs by providing shelter (city subsidies working
premises) to potentially successful small/middle size businesses. In the two years time
supported enterprises had to demonstrate their ability to grow and generate new jobs
locally in order to become eligible to get a city land (on very privileged price) to build
own working halls and extend business. City of Zagreb
In the City of Zagreb majority of the unemployed (29.1%) were those with no
working experience, while the second largest group (15.9%) were those with 20-30year working experience who unexpectedly lose their jobs due to their firm
bankruptcy. The strategy to address this problem developed by the Healthy City
project team in Zagreb went in two directions. One set of interventions was run by the
Zagreb Employment Agency and included provision of the new education 626 opportunities, additional training and re-training free of charge for the end users
(unemployed). The other set of interventions (as well financially supported by the
City) was run by the Zagreb Association of the Unemployed that provided a series of
workshops for their members on ‘How to Succeed in Finding Job’. Through the
workshops most of the participants improved self-confidence, identified own
potentials, developed personal job-finding plan and learned how to present themselves
to potential employers. Over half of them (61%) succeeded in the few months time –
to find a job or get re-trained. City of Split
The Split Healthy City project tried to address the lack of entrepreneurial skills in
general population (in our culture people expect that job will be given to them, very
few have a courage and skills to start own business, author remark) by putting
emphasis on primary school children training. With the project named PETRA they
introduced the project management techniques in the school curricula enabling young
children to design and run own projects i.e. develop management skills early in life. Environment protection and quality improvement
The protection and improvement of the environment quality was another area of the
greatest importance for Croatian cities. Between 1996 and 2006 the City of Rijeka
made major improvements; introduced natural gas into the households, protected
drinking water (Zvir I and II), improved sewerage collection and disposition
(collector at Delta), waste management…
Due to the traffic congestion caused by constantly increasing number of motor
vehicles in the City of Zagreb main environmental challenges were connected with
the air quality. Zagreb Healthy City project brought together a large group of partner
agencies to address (jointly) this problem. Several city departments (The City
Planning and Environmental Health Office, City Office for Urban Design, Building,
Housing, Utility and Traffic and the City Health and social welfare Office) and city
owned companies - ZET (trams, buses and other public transport), Zagreb Parking
(maintenance and building of parking areas and underground garages), Zrinjevac
(maintenance of public green areas), Cistoca (waste disposal and recycling, cleaning
and washing the streets) worked on development and implementation of the strategy
which aimed to solve traffic congestions (through road construction), enhance nonmotor traffic conditions (curb lowering and bicycle lane building), foster public
transport and use of environmentally-friendly fuel (bio diesel), increase safety and
decrease noise and air pollution. “Democracy schools – Youth Council”
One of the Croatian Healthy Cities shiniest examples of democratic and participatory
practices development is the “Democracy schools – Youth Council” project.
Democracy School program is in-school (6 to 8 grade of primary and 1 to 4 grades of
secondary schools) training that improves students’ knowledge of democratic
practices and develop theirs social and debate skills. School program enables
teenager’s to articulate their expectations from local community, and Youth Councils
(established as the City Council advisory bodies) allows their direct participation in 627 decision-making processes of local authorities (identifying needs and allocation
resources for youth programs). Project is highly valued and spread all over Croatia.
During the last six years 12 Croatian cities established either City’s Children or Youth
Councils. EXCERISE

At the end of this course students should be able to:
• Be aware of theoretical principles and concept of
Occupational Health and Occupational Health Services;
• Broader their knowledge on Occupational Health policy
with public health approach;
• Fully understand and be able to differ the terms
Occupational Health vs. Workers’ Health;
• Recognize the role of all participants and stakeholders in
workers’ health.
Health at work and healthy work environments are among the
most valuable assets of individuals, communities and countries.
Nowadays, new broader approach is promoted, recognizing the
fact that occupational health is a key, but not a unique element
of workers’ health. Workers health is a public health approach
to resolving the health problems of working populations
including all determinants of health recognized as targets of risk
management. It focuses on primary prevention of occupational
and work-related diseases and injuries, protection and
promotion of the health of workers. Address for

system and policy requires strengthen governmental
stewardship and ensure continuous political commitment to
occupational health. OH policy should provide the development
of legislation and standards in the field as well as effective
mechanisms for financing of occupational health services. The
expected results should be ensuring access to basic occupational
health services for all workers with establishing essential
requirements for service provision and providing the quality
assurance systems for occupational health services.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKERS’ HEALTH
AS PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH
Jovanka Karadžinska-Bislimovska, Jordan Minov, Snežana
Risteska-Kuc, Sašo Stoleski, Dragan Mijakoski THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Health and safety at work as a basic human right and constitutes a social and health
dimension of the principle of sustainable development. The occupational health and
the well-being of the working people is a key element for the total socio-economic
development of every country.
More than the half of the word population belongs to the global working force
which is continuously, during its working age, more or less submitted to a large
number of factors hazardous to health that originated from the working place. Old and new risks at workplaces
Beside the traditional problems and risks at work (such as noise, vibration, physical
workload, biological and chemical agents, infective agents, bad working conditions)
to which 25 to30% of the working population is still exposed, the new changes of the
working processes and the new technology are carrying new risks and challenges of
the professional pathology of the working place, even to those that are looking quite
safe and harmless. Those are new chemical substances and materials, some of them
with unknown and unidentified hazardous effects, new biotechnological and
carcinogenic materials, allergenic substances, highly frequented non-ionizing
radiation, ionizing radiation, psycho-social stress, unsuitable ergonomic design etc
(Figure 1). There are additional effects like social and economic conditions,
fluctuation of the work force, working place mobility, psychophysical abuse and
violence at the work place. There are the changes in the organization of the work and
shift-work, fragmentation of enterprises and increased number of the small-size
enterprises and self-employed. Dynamic and growing demand on the work as a result
of the market globalization significantly changes the economic structures and the
working conditions at almost every single workplace (1).
Accordingly, there are no safety or risk free workplaces in the industry,
economic or non economic enterprises, service activities, public or private large,
medium or small enterprises. Especially in the developing countries with still present
out-of-date technology and use of old equipment, without respect of the existing
legislative for protection at work and the health surveillance of the workers seized
without a Register of occupational hazards and workplaces with occupational risk.
All of this bring up to work injuries, occupational diseases and work-related
diseases such as musculoskeletal, psychological, cardiovascular, respiratory,
neurological, cancers etc. that are cause for a long term absence from work, lowered
or terminally lost working ability, invalidity or death. 631 Blood pressure

are connected to “hard” working places, the risk of ruined health is present even at
work places considered safely like a work with a computer. Some segments of the
working population are with a specific vulnerability when exposed to certain
professional risks: female working force, young and old workers, farmers, workers in
an informal sector, middle and small enterprises, self-employed etc. Especially
serious is the problem with child labour, people with special needs, unemployed.
Respiratory diseases that are occurring due to inhalation of microscopic
particles, organic or non-organic (SiO2, asbestos, coal dust, pesticides etc), are
present in many professions: construction engineering, mining, metallurgy,
agriculture, textile industry, tobacco industry, wood industry and pastry product
industry. Because of the long latent period of some of this diseases (carcinoma,
asbestosis, silicosis) they are still present in the countries with a high level of control
and protection at the work place. From the total number of the patients with asthma 518% are due to professional causes, 14% of the pulmonary obstructive diseases or
243.000 deaths per year with a the pulmonary obstructive diseases are with a
occupational aetiology.
300-350 different chemical, biological and physical agents in professional
surroundings are classified as carcinogenic materials. Round 20-30% male and 5-20%
female, age 15-64 years, from the active working population can be exposed to those
carcinogenic agents. On global level 10.3% of the pulmonary and tracheal cancers are
due to exposure to asbestos, cadmium, arsenics, chromium, nickel or silica, and 2.4%
leukaemia’s are due to occupational exposure. It is assessed that 2-38% out of the
total morbidities of cancers are due to the occupational etiological factor. 632 Musculoskeletal diseases are multi factorial and are connected with the
ergonomic factors at workplace, heavy physical workload, repeated bending and
sudden moves, as well as repeated monotonous movements, un-physiological
continuous posture of the body, vibrations etc, organizational and social
characteristics of the work. Especially high is the prevalence to those diseases in
construction workers, farmers and health workers. Half of the active working
population of USA is complaining about those diseases. The WHO 2002 World report
on health is pointing out the fact that 35% of the cases with the low beck pain are due
to hazardous occupational ergonomic exposure (2).
Globally, the noise is also one of the most frequent risks at the workplace and
is cause for 16% of the definite and irreversible hearing loss. The damage to the
hearing can additionally become a risk for a numerous accidents and injuries at work
as well different consequences from that. Occupational health indicators
The health indicators in the domain of health and safety at work according to WHO
are: the rate for incidence and prevalence of the occupational diseases and work
related diseases, rate of fatal accidents and injuries at work, morbidity rate at the
active working population, disability incidence in 100000 population.
The influence of the work on the health is difficult to observe. The countries
work in different health and insurance systems, the declared rates of the occupational
diseases are based on the existing national legislative, effectiveness in detecting,
enlisting and registration of the occupational diseases, as well as the compensatory
mechanisms and systems for compensation. The extrapolation done according to the
incidence of the occupational diseases in the European countries are good
informational system going from 3-5 to 1000, gives annual incidence of 68157000000 cases of occupational diseases.
The risk factors that can cause injuries at work are numerous and at different
work places. According to the ILO annually in the world happens 120 000 000
injuries at work out of which 200 000 are fatal injuries at work. That means that the
average risk from injuries at work is 42 on 1000 workers with a fatal outcome of
8.30/100 000. The average European risk is 25/1000 for injuries and 6.25 for fatal
injuries (3).
This numbers can and must be prevented in the interest of the health and well
being as well as from the point of interest for the economy and the productivity of the
labour. Occupational Health and burden of diseases
Aiming to measure the health condition of the population from the aspect of paying
off, as well as to assess which intervention that will improve the health needs special
attention a concept of DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) was introduced. That is
a measurement which is measuring the burden from the disease and is presented
through total loss due to a damage health from any reason whether it is a premature
death or invalidity / limitation in the functioning that can be both physical and mental,
in different period of time. Because of that, the use of DALY enables to establish
priority for health services, to establish groups with special risk and providing 633 comparable measurements for intervention as well as for program and sector
planning.
According to WHO Global Plan of Action on Workers’ Health occupational
risks are among ten threats in WHO EURO (2,3 Daly’s%). The results published in
the Global burden of disease 2002 are pointing that 2.7% of DALY worldwide (38
millions DALY) are result of occupational diseases compeering to 15.9% DALY as a
result of malnutrition as a leading reason and 0.5% DALY as a reason listed last (1,2).
The prevention of occupational diseases and injuries is legal and moral
obligation although it involves great expenses. According to the European Agency for
Safety and Health at work, the cost for occupational diseases and injuries is between
2.6 – 3.8% GDP. Depending on country, different costs are estimated and prescribed:
cost for sick- leave and invalidity (Netherlands 1995 - 4.8 billion euros), medical
costs (Netherlands1995-0.6 billion euros), production loss due to work disability
(Germany 1995 – 45 billion euros), lost for the sick/injured and their families (Great
Britain -6.3 billion euros). The total cost for occupational diseases and injuries in Italy
in 1996 was 28 billion euros (3).
Economic losses from poor working conditions, occupational accidents and
occupational diseases in South East Europe are more than 7 billion USD, annually
(about 5% of the GDP) (4).
The cost connected to the occupational diseases and injuries at work can be
divided in tree groups:
−
Direct (primary and secondary);
−
Indirect;
− Immeasurable.
The direct primary cost is: cost for medical care and health protection that are
paid from the Health insurance fund for treatment, rehabilitation and therapy of the
occupational diseases and injuries at work while the direct secondary cost is covering
all the costs that the individual is paying for treatment of his/hers condition which is a
result of a certain occupational diseases and injuries at work.
The indirect cost includes absenteeism, time period necessary to regenerated
the process of production in which the patient suffering from certain occupational
diseases and injuries at work was included, training for the substitute, insurance that
has to be paid by the enterprise etc.
The immeasurable cost (pain, suffering of the individuals and their
surrounding) is increasing the price of the occupational diseases and injuries at work
that in most cases could be prevented.
The poor health care and protection at the work place leads to reduction of the
working ability that can cause a loss of 10-20%of the GDP. According to the
estimations of the World Bank, 2/3 of the DALY could be prevented with programs
for health and safety at work (5). Occupational health and key elements
Health at work and healthy work environments are among the most valuable assets of
individuals, communities and countries. “Occupational health is an important strategy
not only to ensure the health of workers, but also to contribute positively to the
national economies through improved productivity, quality of products, work 634 motivation, job satisfaction, and contribute also to the overall quality of life of
working people and society” (1).
The term “occupational health” on traditional manner includes the
maintenance and promotion and workers health and working capacity, but also the
improvement of the working environment and safe and healthy workplaces.
Nowadays, new broader approach is promoted, recognizing the fact that
occupational health is a key, but not a unique element of workers’ health. Workers
health is a public health approach to resolving the health problems of working
populations including all determinants of health recognized as targets of risk
management. It focuses on primary prevention of occupational and work-related
diseases and injuries, protection and promotion of the health of workers. Occupational
health constitutes the core of this approach, followed by the other public health
activities such as prevention and control of communicable and chronic diseases,
health promotion, organization and financing of health services, and environmental
health. The workers health approach requires close collaboration of all stakeholders
and coordination of all interventions related to the health of workers (1) (Figure 2).

complex, multifactorial, multimechanism and multioutcome”(6).
The health of the workers depends on a combination of factors and a complex
interaction between them:
• working environment: mechanical, physical chemical, biological, ergonomic,
psycho-social factors; social determinants related to work: employment status,
occupational position, social inequalities and poverty;
• work-related health behaviour: individual preventive health practices and
personal health-related behaviour in general;
• access to health services: adequate and affordable occupational health services
for primary prevention, cure and rehabilitation. 635 Occupational health system and Occupational health services
All these facts confirm the need for infrastructure, continuity and security, evidence
and quality, comprehensive multidisciplinary content, coverage, cost-effectiveness,
multisectorial collaboration in occupational health (OH) system (7).
The development of OH system includes the critical prerequisites like political
commitment, legal basis, leading institutions, training and education, methods and
guidelines, standards, collaboration of employers and employees, financing and
infrastructure (1).
The major component of occupational safety and health system or
infrastructure is occupational health service. Unfortunately, today, a lot of workers of
the world have never even heard of such services. Even in many industrialized
countries the coverage of occupational health services is below 50%, and in most
countries of the world the rate is below 10%. The main goal is that all workers have
access to OHS (5).
Comprehensive and long-term response from international organizations
(WHO, ILO, EC) and joint efforts are recognized and needed in order to develop
occupational health system including occupational health services as a key tool.
Occupational health services provide also an important instrument for practical
implementation of the Conventions and recommendations of international
organizations, WHO and ILO as well as implementation of the principles of European
Directives on Occupational safety and health. The Government and policy-makers
should make more effective use of occupational health approach and practices to
support overall socio-economic development, development of modern work life and
social and economic dimensions in the national development program There is a need
to define concise national policy and program for development of occupational health
services as a system providing expert support for enterprises and working people (8).
ILO Convention No.161 and its accompanying Recommendation No. 171 are
used in many countries, as models for establishing requirements for the organization
and functioning of occupational health services (9, 10).
EU Document "Improving Quality and Productivity at Work: Community
Strategy 2007-2012 on Health and Safety at Work emphasized the need for services to
all working people of the world.
The implementation of Article 7 of framework Directive 89/391/EEC reveals
considerable disparities with regard to the quality, coverage and accessibility of
prevention services. One of the key objectives in the Community Strategy is the
development of occupational health services especially for underserved, vulnerable
and high risks sectors and workers (11).
60th World health Assembly (WHA60), 2007 endorsed the Global Plan of
Action on Workers’ health (GPA 2008-2017) and urged the Member States to take a
number of measures on workers health (1).
This Plan of action is based on several principles in the different priority areas. These
principles are intended to guide the formulation, implementation and evaluation of
programs and activities in the area of workers health. They consist of: right to health
and to favourable working conditions, priority of primary prevention, workplace as a
setting for health interventions, coordinated response by the health system, equity in
workers health (12). 636 Basic Occupational Health Services (BOHS)
One of the objectives of WHO GPA is to “Improve the Performance and the Access
to Occupation Health Services” and pointing out that all workers should have access
to the occupational health services. In order to achieve this goal, the Basic
Occupational Health Services (BOHS) approach is recommended, as a joint response
to the priority area set for the WHO, ILO and ICOH collaboration. The concept of
BOHS is based on the principles of primary health care (equity, universality) with the
objective the WHO Global Plan of Action, ILO Convention No161 and
Recommendation 171 (7).
The Basic Occupational Health Services are an essential service for protection
of people's health at work, for promotion of health, well-being and work ability, as
well as for prevention of ill-health and accident (16).
BOHS should provide the services accessible and available to all workers,
addressing to local needs and adapted to local conditions and existing resources,
effective and cost-effective in service provision.
The objective of Basic Occupational Health is to provide OH services for all
workpeople in the world (in both industrialized and developing countries) regardless
of the sector of economy, size of company, geographic area, or nature of employment
contract. The provision of BOHS should be an integrated part of the social policy of
work life and should be guaranteed by public authority.
The OHS infrastructure is called OHS system and it depends on the overall
national health system for health services and occupational health and safety.
However, the BOHS infrastructure should be the part of integrated infrastructure for
health and safety, can be carried out by several types of services units, collaborate
with and take support from primary health care, collaborate with safety services and
specially should serve underserved, high risks, SMEs (12).
Occupational health services support the employer in improving work
conditions, but employer has the primary responsibility for health and safety at work.
On one side the appointment of occupational health services does not discharge the
employer from his responsibility for work conditions and on other side Occupational
health services assist the employer in fulfilling his obligations for health and safety at
work (13).
Without prejudicing the responsibility primary responsibilities of the
employers and of tripartite collaboration, social partners and the Government the
provision of services to sectors which do lack tripartite mechanism are the
responsibility of the Government and other public sector in general.
Governments should ensure equity and access to occupational health services
and their quality regardless of the mode of service provision. All levels of the health
system play a role in the provision of services, from basic functions at the primary
health care level to the more sophisticated functions at the regional and national level.
The full coverage of the total working population in the countries should be set
as a long - term objective. In the first stage priority should be given to the high-risk
sectors and the seriously underserved groups which are most in need.
While specialized comprehensive occupational health services are the best way
to support the well established industrial and services sectors, for the underserved
sectors and high risk and vulnerable workers it was found appropriate to combine
such development with the overall development of primary health care services 637 system. In organization of such service the possibilities to utilize the
WHO/ILO/ICOH Basic Occupational Health Services approach was found
appropriate (14). Activities of Occupational Health Services
The activities of occupational health services are based on prevention and promotion
focused on workers’ health and work environment. BOHS have a strong focus on
primary prevention; the concept is comprehensive and includes prevention, cure and
rehabilitation. Activities are complemented by the workplace health promotion.
BOHS activities start with process of orientation and planning, and proceed to the
identification of needs, risk assessment, proposal and management of preventive and
control actions to employers and workers and evaluation of activities on the basis of
data on workers’ health and work environment with further steps in the process of
development (15):
• Planning, orientation and identification of health and safety needs;
• Surveillance of the work environment;
• Surveillance of workers’ health;
• Risk assessment ;
• Information and education on risks and advice on need for preventive and
control actions;
• Preventive actions for the management and control of health and safety
hazards and risks;
• Prevention of accidents;
• Maintaining first-aid and participation in emergency preparedness;
• Diagnosis of occupational and work-related diseases;
• Curative and rehabilitation services;
• Workplace health promotion (healthy lifestyle, general preventive and public
health measures);
• Collection of data and record keeping;
• Evaluation of OH activities and their effects and impacts;
• Re-planning and necessary actions for the development of services. Service provision models
Different models for the provision of occupational health services are available:
• Big industry (in-plant) model is the most widespread, OHS for special sector
or trade; Group services and private consultancies organized jointly by SMSE;
• Public health care establishments like community and other local primary
health services (health centres, out-patient departments, group medical
practices) (16).
The provision of Basic Occupational Health Services (BOHS) should be a
priority in countries and economic sectors with high occupational risk and very low
coverage of workers by occupational health services. The proposed model of BOHS
as a part of integrated infrastructure of OH System should enable provision of OHS
on all levels, from basic function at primary health care level, to the more 638 sophisticated functions (International standard services and comprehensive OHS) at
local and national level (4).
The provisions of the BOHS for every worker must be supported by the public
sector and mechanisms for delivering and financing should be put in place to protect
workers health and safety and to ensure the sustainable development (16). Human resources
In the optimal case the occupational health services will be provided by a
multidisciplinary team: physician-specialist in occupational health, nurse,
occupational hygienist and psychologist. In some countries, where not enough
specialists are available, primary health care team may provide services with
additional training in occupational health. At the secondary level, different support
services (diagnostic, analytical etc.)are needed National centres of excellence Institutes of occupational health should provide the evidence base for preventive
interventions, technical support to OHS, specialized laboratory tests and services and
training of OH practitioners, and to plan and monitor implementation of OHS.
Workers should be actively involved in the evaluation and control of the hazards. The
risk management tools should be the basis of the intervention on the workplace
settings (16,17).
Occupational health services can also seek support from inspection agencies labour and public health inspectorates.
State policy should support education and training of experts for occupational
health services through the specialization in the areas of occupational health,
participation in field research and establishment of professional associations of
occupational health services. Financing of OHS
According to ILO convention No161, on OHS, the employer has the main financial
responsibility for providing occupational health services. So, the financing reflects
employer’s responsibility for working conditions and it is presented by the different
options: direct financing, indirect financing or public funding.
The direct funding is focused on: Big industry model, Group services or
Consultancies. Indirect financing includes the various insurance schemes, special
funds or shares. In some countries occupational health is covered by public funding
through the central government or local authorities. Instead of conclusions
The development of occupational health system and policy requires implementing one
step-by step approach. As a start point is necessary to strengthen governmental
stewardship and ensure continuous political commitment to occupational health. OH
policy should provide the development of legislation and standards in the field as well
as effective mechanisms for financing of occupational health services. The expected
results should be ensuring access to basic occupational health services for all workers 639 with establishing essential requirements for service provision and providing the
quality assurance systems for occupational health services.
For realization of the planed steps should stimulate national and international
efforts for capacity building and establishing critical core capacities of countries to
deal with workers health. The key message should be the integration of the
development of occupational health services into national strategies, health systems
performance improvement plans, and health sector reforms, in particular with regards
to primary health care and public health. EXERCISE
After introductory lecture, students work in small groups and are asked to discuss on
recommended subjects:
• The situation of Occupational Health Services in their country;
• Identify possible problems in students country and discuss on the priorities;
• Suggest improvement, taking into account any possible obstacles.
Each group will produce a written report on the tasks. Timing: 2 hours. REFERENCES

After completing this module students and public health professionals
should have increased knowledge of modern psychotherapy as
autonomous profession which is integrated as part of the public health
service. Through the comparison of developed psychotherapy services
in Austria and undeveloped psychotherapy services in Slovenia, they
should be aware of the different phases and challenges with which
modern psychotherapy is confronted in its endeavours to become an
integral part of comprehensive health care.
This module describes the history and present status of psychotherapy
in Austria and Slovenia. Austrian psychotherapy is one of the most
developed in the world and a good example of positive development.
Slovenian psychotherapy is confronted with many problems of a
country in transition.
Teaching methods include lectures, exercises, individual work,
interactive methods such as small group discussions, seminars etc.
Plenary lectures are followed by discussion and project work in
exercises. The work is done partly individually and partly in small
groups.

Miran Možina THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
In this module following topics will be shortly covered: basic terms, historical
development and expansion of psychotherapy, psychotherapy as a profession, fields
of activity of psychotherapists, psychotherapists’ organisations, training, and
economic aspects (1), as well as significance of psychotherapy for public health. Definitions and explanation of basic terms
Psychotherapy
According to European Association for Psychotherapy (Appendix 1 to the Board
Minutes, Siracuse 17th to 18th of October 2003) the profession of psychotherapy is
defined as (2):
• the practice of psychotherapy is the comprehensive, conscious and planned
treatment of psychosocial, psychosomatic and behavioural disturbances or
states of suffering with scientific psychotherapeutic methods, through an
interaction between one or more persons being treated, and one or more
psychotherapists, with the aim of relieving disturbing attitudes to change, and
to promote the maturation, development and health of the treated person. It
requires both a general and a specific training/education,
• the independent practice of psychotherapy consists of autonomous, responsible
enactment of the capacities described in paragraph 1; independent of whether
the activity is in a free practice or institutional work. Psychotherapy approaches
The main psychotherapy approaches and schools are: psychoanalytic-psychodynamic,
cognitive behavioural, systemic family, existential-humanistic, person-centred and
related experiential approaches, postmodern and integrative approaches. All these
approaches can have different modalities: individual, marital, family and group
therapies (3). There is an ongoing discussion about whether methods should be
applied in a »pure« way of whether »integrative« models are not perhaps better.
Nevertheless, many common basic elements can be perceived which today contribute
to our understanding of the effectiveness of psychotherapy over and above the
specifics of a particular approach or school (1). Historical development and expansion of psychotherapy
The foundation of modern psychotherapy was systematically developed at the end of
19th century and in the first decades of 20th century with the work of Sigmund Freud 643 (1856–1939). Psychoanalysis was for many decades the only psychotherapeutic
approach, but after the Second World War many new approaches were developed (for
example, cognitive behavioural, humanistic, systemic family approaches and many
others). Over the last twenty years the term psychotherapy has become an
international “supra-term” for different psychotherapeutic approaches to describe a
curative influence of the relationship between psychotherapist and patient/client on
neurotic, psychotic, psychosomatic and somatopsychic disorders.
Psychotherapy became globalised since it expanded all over the world. It can
be estimated that there are about 700.000 psychotherapists worldwide (most of them,
about 300.000, in Europe and about 200.000 in North America) (1). Characteristics of psychotherapeutic profession
Psychotherapy as a profession
Psychotherapy as an autonomous profession is practised during last 20 years. In 1985
the first Law on Psychotherapy was passed in Sweden, and other European countries
followed (for example Italy, Austria, Germany, Netherlands and others). These laws
have the effect of promoting the development of psychotherapy as a profession. There
are professional regulations in other countries, such as USA, Argentina and Chile,
which, however are subsumed under the vocational group of psychologists,
psychiatrists and clinical social workers, and in which psychotherapy as a profession
in its own right does not always appear. Within the framework of these professions
there have been reimbursements of psychotherapy services from insurance schemes
for many years in the USA and Canada (1). Fields of activity of psychotherapists
Psychotherapy is practised by most therapists in private practice or in institutions such
as psychiatric wards/clinics or counselling offices mostly on two large areas:
• treating mental disorders, and
• encouraging personal growth by clients who have no psychiatric diagnosis.
So, psychotherapy is effective as primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, what
will be discussed later on.
Patients are treated usually in sessions lasting one hour, either individually, in
groups or in a family context. The most important form used is the psychotherapeutic
interview, sometimes in connection with exercises designed to stimulate new
experiences with healing effects (1). Psychotherapists have also developed effective
practice on the interfaces with social work, schools and management. And
increasingly, psychotherapists are being called upon to take care of acute trauma
patients in the wake of catastrophes, refugees etc. Psychotherapists’ organisations Until far into the 20th century, only specialists and those within the inner circle were
aware of the existence of different forms of psychotherapy. Not until the founding of
umbrella organisations was it possible to extend the scientific and developmental
dialogue and thereafter to be perceived in a serious fashion by the public at large. In
the meantime, umbrella organisations have been set up on all continents with the aim
of developing psychotherapy in their countries and on their continent in general (1). 644 The most representative umbrella organisation in Europe is European Association for
Psychotherapy (EAP) (4). The EAP represents 128 organisations (28 national
umbrella associations, 17 European-wide associations for psychotherapy) from 41
European countries and by that more than 120.000 psychotherapists. Membership is
also open for individual psychotherapists.
Based on the "Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy of 1990" (5), the EAP
represents high training standards for a scientifically based psychotherapy and stands
for a free and independent practice of psychotherapy. The declaration has following
five points:
1. Psychotherapy is an independent scientific discipline, the practice of which
amounts to an independent and free profession.
2. Training in psychotherapy takes place at an advanced, qualified and scientific
level.
3. The multiplicity of the methods of psychotherapy is assured and guaranteed.
4. A full psychotherapeutic training covers theory, self-experience, and practice
under supervision. Adequate knowledge of various psychotherapeutic
processes is acquired.
5. Access to training is through various preliminary qualifications, in particular in
human and in social sciences.
One of the most important endeavours of EAP at the moment is to create a common
platform of Psychotherapy Regulations in the EU, with the eventual goal of central
legislature and licensing procedures. Benefits of such platform would be:
• EU-wide recognition of psychotherapy as a profession,
• freedom of movement for psychotherapists,
• uniform training standards and licensing procedures,
• overall increase in quality of psychotherapeutic standards. Training
The necessary training to become a psychotherapist, which lasts several years, has
three main pillars:
• self experience,
• theory, and
• practical work under supervision.
The EAP requires for its “European Certificate of Psychotherapy” a minimum of
3200 hours training, both in introductory (so called propaedeutics) and an approach
specific training. Most training takes place in private institutions as a postgraduate
training or as a “second profession” education. During last years there is a growing
interest of the universities for psychotherapy programmes. For example, in October
2005 private university Sigmund Freud in Vienna opened the three level (bachelor,
master and doctoral) psychotherapy study where different approaches are integrated
under the same roof. Economic aspects
Psychotherapy has also become a market. The fees range from gifts to hourly fees of
100 Euro and more depending on the economy of the country in which psychotherapist 645 practises. In countries with a higher degree of regulation of psychotherapy, public
institutions and social securities are providing more and more public money for
psychotherapeutic treatment. In many countries in which psychotherapy has not reached
this status yet, only the richer patients have access to it (1). Significance of psychotherapy for public health
As mentioned above, psychotherapy is effective on several levels of disease
prevention, being from primary to tertiary.
1. Primary prevention.
The role of psychotherapy in primary prevention is keeping mental disorders
from ever occurring. Already Freud’s way of doing psychoanalysis had this
dimension because he has shown that every person who is interested to
improve the quality of her or his life can profit from psychoanalysis before
some recognizable mental disorder appears. Freud’s message is still modern:
“Live more conscious life! Be more aware of the complexity of mental
functioning and realize your potential in work and love!” During the last 40
years this message was spread to millions of people in different psychotherapy
approaches, especially in working with groups, for example in sensitivity
training (6), or encounter groups (7), especially in dealing with endangered and
vulnerable population groups (e.g. adolescents, pregnant women, unemployed
people, disabled, old people etc.). Many psychotherapists developed
programmes that are combined with psychoeducative approach:
• for children and families (8,9),
• for mothers with infants to support them after childbirth with
counselling and practical help (10),
• for groups where members learn how to cope with stress or be more
assertive in everyday life situations
• for child-abuse awareness and preventive programmes,
• preventing violence
• somatic disease prevention, since chronic somatic illness increases
likelihood for ill mental health
• drug and alcohol free parenting programmes in endangered groups, etc.
2. Secondary prevention.
The role of psychotherapy in secondary prevention is in early detection of
mental disorders and early intervention to reduce the risk of chronicity,
disability and suicide. Especially important is this kind of prevention in the
field of depression, and alcohol disorders. Psychotherapists are well educated
for recognising signs and symptoms of depression and alcohol problems. Early
recognition is of course to be followed by evidence based treatment being
mostly parallel - psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic and educational.
Psychotherapists contribute also to health risk assessment. Self
examinations and self help are routine techniques to be transferred and
encouraged with patients with mental disorders, especially when reoccurring.
The educational courses, group and individual counselling on recognising
warning signs of disorder and coping strategies are valuable therapeutic tool in
the hands of the patient and his or her relatives. Already during 1970’s many 646 psychotherapists found ways to spread psychotherapeutic methods in self-help
groups (11,12).
2. Tertiary prevention.
The role of psychotherapy in tertiary prevention is in the treatment and care for
people with clinically expressed mental disorders in acute, primary, or early
phase, and chronically, late or rehabilitation phase. Since the prevalence of
mental disorders in Europe is increasing (13) and because psychotherapy is
especially effective in treating the most common mental disorders (anxiety,
depression and substance abuse disorders) (14) the significance of including
psychotherapy as integral part of comprehensive health care is also becoming
more and more important. During last 30 years psychotherapists have proven
the effectiveness of psychotherapy in treating all kinds of mental disorders in
general and that different approaches have relative similar efficacy (15). CASE STUDY: PSYCHOTHERAPY IN AUSTRIA AND
SLOVENIA INTRODUCTION
In the following section the comparison will be made between developed Austrian
psychotherapy services which are integrated in the health system and undeveloped
psychotherapy services in Slovenia. The comparison makes clear that psychotherapy
must overcome different challenges and develop through different phases to become
an integral part of comprehensive health care. Austria: psychotherapeutic service as integral part of
comprehensive health care
Historical perspective
Pritz outlined the brief history of psychotherapy in Austria (16). Vienna is the
cradle where at the end of 19 th century Freud laid foundations of scientific
psychotherapy. Freud called his method “psychoanalysis”. It became popular all
over the world and even today it is still often used as synonym for psychotherapy.
Several other psychotherapy methods were developed in Austria as a result of
contacts with Freud, for example Individual Psychology, developed by Alfred
Adler (1870-1936), and Logotherapy, developed by Viktor Frankl (1904-1997).
The era of National Socialism (1938-1945) put an abrupt end to the sensational
development of psychotherapy in Austria but after 1945, signs of new life in
psychoanalysis began to stir. Towards a new concept
In the 70’s there was a boom in new psychotherapy approaches (for example
person-centred psychotherapy according to Carl Rogers, psychodrama, Gestalt
therapy, autogenic training, hypnosis, systemic family therapy, etc.). An
enthusiastic phase of development ensued, reinforced when departments bearing the
word “Psychotherapy” in their title were set up at the medical faculties of the
Universities of Vienna, Graz and Innsbruck. Since 1980 there have been regular 647 introductory lectures and seminars at the Departments of Psychology and Pedagogy
at the above mentioned universities.
An important step was taken in 1981 with the foundation of the Umbrella
Organization of Austrian Psychotherapeutic Associations. This organization first
united 7 associations who set their sights on promoting psychotherapy in Austria. The
legal situation at that time was such that only medical doctors were permitted to
practise psychotherapy as a curative treatment. However, nearly 80 % of those
carrying out psychotherapy did not come from medical background, but from other
psychosocial professions, in particular psychologists, social workers and teachers.
This led to a public discussion about quality control in psychotherapy in combination
with the will of the Umbrella Organization to push through legal regulations for
psychotherapy as a profession in its own right. The beginning of self-standing track
After intensive and controversial discussions both among public at large and the
psychotherapy associations, the Law on Psychotherapy was finally passed of in July
1990. This Law, which requires a 7-year training and enables psychotherapy
practised as a profession in its own right, had far-reaching consequences for the
development of psychotherapy in Austria. In 1991 the General Social Security Law
was changed to include the provision that every Austrian citizen who is in need of
psychotherapeutic treatment for an illness must be provided with such treatment as
a part of public health service. Since then work is ongoing to ensure that this Law is
actually put into practice, and today in all 9 Federal provinces insurance companies
have made possible to obtain psychotherapy within public health service (which
was before normal for other forms of medical treatment). Today around 5500
trained psychotherapists in Austria are active in the health care service and the
social services.
So one of the consequences of the new Law was an exponential growth of the
expenditure by Health and Social Insurance for Psychotherapy (source: Hauptverband
der österreichischen Sozialversicherungträger, 28th May, 2002, cited by Pritz (16))
(Table 1). The whole psychotherapy market (private and public together) in 2002 in
Austria had a volume of approximately 200 millions Euros per year.

16.13 648 Also, the psychotherapy training is regulated by a law. All education and
training institutes and facilities require an accreditation from the Health Ministry for
which a Psychotherapy Board is responsible. This Board, made up of representatives
of all psychotherapy approaches, university professors and other representatives of
psychotherapy, consists almost entirely of psychotherapists, and its members number
approximately 60 persons. It is the Board's task to examine the applications for
training accreditation, which is granted only after a rigorous examination of scientific
qualifications and abilities of the trainers. Current position in relation to health care system
Today psychotherapy is integrated in the health care system in whole of Austria. All
public health insurance associations have a system of supplementing payment for
treatment; in certain cases they underwrite the whole amount. Treatment is carried out
in private practises and also in public institutions belonging to the health insurance
associations and in counselling offices which are subsidised from public funds, of
which there are approximately 500 in the whole Austria. Psychotherapy is expanding
within hospitals, too. International significance
It is not a surprise that recently Austria as one of the most developed countries in
psychotherapy field in the world gave another thee very important contributions for
the development of globalised psychotherapy: the foundation of the World Council
for Psychotherapy, the foundation of faculty study of psychotherapy and the
foundation of European Psychotherapy Universities Network.
With the foundation of the World Council for Psychotherapy in 1995, in
Zurich, Switzerland, psychotherapy attained a new quality of communication which
had never existed previously (17). International professional congresses had been held
for many years, but a synoptic view was missing and the importance of overcoming
prejudices towards other modalities and developments in the profession had not
received enough attention. The unified view creates new insights and new hierarchies
of importance; at the same time the situation is stimulating for all questions relating to
psychotherapy. At the World Congresses which have been held so far, in 1996, 1999
and 2002 in Vienna, and 2005 in Buenos Aires, approximately 4000 delegates from
more than 150 countries took part each time and contributed to the dialogue. Training
The integration of psychotherapy to the academic world of universities is crucial for
its affirmation as the autonomous scientifically based discipline and as the
autonomous profession. In October 2005 Sigmund Freud University (SFU) (18) from
Vienna started with the faculty study of psychotherapy (the enrolment is possible
immediately after the secondary school) which is organized in accordance with
Bologna process (three levels - bachelor, master, doctor). This is the first project of
faculty study in psychotherapy in the world which enables students to choose
psychotherapy as the first profession providing a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in
psychotherapy science and that also integrates different psychotherapy approaches
under the same roof. While psychotherapy training was offered exclusively at
postgraduate level by psychotherapy training institutions in the past, SFU blends
academic training for psychotherapists with comprehensive research activities 649 previously carried out at various research institutes separately. The University
cooperates with a number of psychotherapy training institutions in various areas. The
project has also symbolic meaning because it takes place in Freud’s town and under
his name opens new chapter in the development of psychotherapy.
In 2007 Austrian psychotherapists gave initiative for establishing the European
Psychotherapy Universities Network (EPU) (19). EPU has the following mission
statement:
• has a pluralistic perspective on emotional topics, psychotherapeutic approaches
and practice;
• cooperates in psychotherapy research, psychotherapy education and treatment
activities;
• promotes psychotherapy as an academic discipline and profession in its own
rights;
• promotes public founding of psychotherapy;
• provides scientifically based information on psychotherapy to the public. Slovenia: psychotherapy in a country in transition
Slovenia in transition
In the Communist period (1945-1991) Slovenian state welfare system had
advantages in securing easy access to child care, education, employment,
entertainment, health, housing, maternity leave and pensions on a universal basis.
Yet the standard of services was unsatisfactory in many instances, choice was very
limited, and inequality was introduced by the privileges given to members of a large
number of elites. Formally the Yugoslav Federation had moved to a policy of “selfmanagement” in industry and policy areas such as housing in the 1970’s. In reality,
this meant that employees had a lot to say in how services were run, but policies
and budgets were imposed from above. Nongovernmental organizations were
frowned upon, despite the fact that in the pre-Communist period there were many
such small scale organisations in operation. Self-management was not introduced
even formally to traditional welfare services at that period. In line with other
Communist countries, the prevalent mode of handling long-term health and
psychological problems was institutionalization. Institutions exist(ed) for people
with learning difficulties, physical disability and mental illness, side by side with
orphanages. While the physical state of these institutions was reasonable, if poor the
social segregation was almost total (20).
Although better off economically than other East European and ex-Soviet
Union states, Slovenia has experienced an increase in unemployment and a parallel
decrease in growth of real wage and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the beginning
of the nineties. In spite of the revival of economic growth after 1993, the inequalities
of income nevertheless increased, and the unemployment remained relatively high. At
the end of the 1990's Slovenia had ad per capita annual GDP of approximately
$10,000 and the unemployment rate of approximately 14.5. Under the circumstances
of economic restructuring, the system of social security has functioned relatively
efficiently. The share of funds devoted to various cash benefits for the population
increased from a total of 15.9% of the GDP in 1992 to 17.6% of the GDP in 1999. In
1999 GDP was 20 billion US$. A cause of greater concern are the data, which are 650 showing a considerable growth in the number of individuals and families whose
assets had been so reduced after the 1993 that they were not sufficient for subsistence.
At the end of 1990's the investment of money in health care is approximately 7.5% of
the GDP and in social welfare system approximately 17.5% of the GDP (21-23).
After the democratic shift private practice in the health and social care system
became allowed. Since then the number of private practises has been increasing,
posing numerous questions on how to structure and regulate relations between the
public and the private sectors.
At the end of the 1990's Slovenia has been confronted with many difficult
challenges on the macro level:
• the number of recipients of various cash benefits and other social transfers is
rising,
• the share of elderly inhabitants is rapidly increasing,
• there is a growing number of children and young people suffering from
violence and sexual harassment,
• due to economic uncertainty short-term conditions for creating a young family
are not improving,
• the proportion of people with various addiction problems is on the
increase, etc. The development of psychotherapy in Slovenia
When psychoanalysis spread greatly after World War One, its influence also reached Slovenia.
Especially the generation of young artists, born around 1900, showed great interest in the new
science. However, after 1934 interest in psychoanalysis was diminished and no psychoanalytic
circle was formed (24). In the “hard years” of Communist period psychoanalytic works were
discouraged. For example, the only book related to Freud’s work that was translated into
Slovenian language in the seventies was Emil Ludwig’s Der Entzauberte Freud which was
extremely critical. During the 1950’s and 1960’s the conditions for development of
psychotherapy slowly improved, especially in the line of psychiatric services. All over former
Yugoslavia (which Slovenia was part until 1991), dispensaries of mental health became part of
the outpatient medical service. Professional collaboration among psychiatrists and
psychologists in these dispensaries slowly became an everyday need. At first, the task of
psychologists was to develop psychodiagnostic measures, but they grew increasingly more
involved in the clinical therapeutic work, as well. Among psychiatrists and psychologists, a
growing need for additional education emerged. Though possibilities for postgraduate
education in Slovenia improved, a systematic psychotherapeutic training was available only
abroad.
In Slovenia, psychotherapy as an organized professional movement began at
the end of the 1960's when the endeavours of some psychiatrists and clinical
psychologists fruitfully joined. The year 1968 was a turning point in the development
of psychotherapy in Slovenia when first systematic training of clinical psychologists
and psychiatrists interested in psychotherapy started. Thus, the first Slovenian
psychotherapy training was designed as a sub-specialization for psychiatrists and
clinical psychologists. Since it took place within the health service, it was organized
as a psychotherapy section of the Slovenian Medical Society. Renowned Croatian and
Serbian psychoanalysts participated as guests. The one-year psychotherapy course 651 (propaedeutics) comprising theory, self-experience, and practice under supervision,
soon became an integral part of specialization for clinical psychologists and
psychiatrists.
At the end of the 1960's, on the grounds of cooperation with professionals
from Austria (Otto Wilfert, Raoul Schindler), sensitivity trainings were introduced to
Slovenia, which led to an increase of interest in group dynamics on the part of various
professionals (e.g. in education, psychiatric and care-taking institutions). Some
Slovenian psychologists fruitfully combined knowledge of group dynamics and
psychotherapy with counselling in the context of social work. They also found
possibilities to combine psychotherapy and voluntary work in the area of psychosocial
help to children and adolescents with psychosocial problems (25).
In the 1970’s first psychotherapy publications appeared and new inpatient
psychotherapeutic facilities developed in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, such as a
psychotherapeutic centre, a psychotherapeutic ward in the psychiatric hospital, a
centre for the treatment of alcoholism, etc. The contacts of Slovenian psychotherapists
with psychotherapy associations in the former Yugoslavia (The Association of
Yugoslav Psychotherapists was also established in 1968) and abroad expanded. The
psychotherapeutic training (psychodynamicaly oriented) was advanced and included
theory, self-experience in the group, and practice under supervision. The 1970's
brought progress in the field of alcoholism treatment as well. Besides the therapeuticrehabilitative approach which developed in the network of health organizations, there
was an extensive growth of self-help groups (so-called “Clubs for alcoholics in
treatment”). Psychotherapy (principally group psychotherapy) was given an important
role in the integrative approach to treatment and rehabilitation of people with alcohol
addiction (26).
In the 1980’s a group of Lacanian oriented theoreticians played an important
role in popularizing psychoanalytic concepts through intensive translation work and
through writing original papers mainly on theoretical psychoanalysis. The leading
figure of this group, Slavoj Žižek (27), is nowadays the most popular and translated
Slovenian author in the world. He linked psychoanalytic theory with philosophy and
the critique of ideology and art.
During the same period, in the 1980’s and 1990’s, a blossoming of different
psychotherapy approaches took place. In the years 1986-90, new psychotherapy
approaches or schools began entering Slovenia, usually with initial seminars,
designed to offer an introduction and motivate possible candidates for further
trainings. The scope of these new offers with qualified foreign teachers increased and
so did the number of interested candidates, especially from the ranks of professional
helpers, who in psychotherapy saw either a chance to build on their professional
competence or an alternative activity for personal fulfilment.
The collapse of communism and the Balkan wars halted the initial
development of new approaches. The reasons were that some foreign teachers
considered Slovenia – also after the ten days’ war in 1991 – a dangerous area, and that
the disintegration of Yugoslavia decimated some training groups comprising members
of different nations of the formerly uniform state.
The socio-political change in Slovenia in the beginning of 90's coincided with
the founding of EAP and its efforts to define psychotherapy as an independent
profession on a high professional level. In 1998 the Slovenian Umbrella Organisation
of Psychotherapy (28) was founded which united seven associations and became a 652 member of EAP. At the same time Psychotherapists’ Society of Slovenia grew out of
the above mentioned psychotherapy section of Medical Society and united individual
psychotherapists (mostly psychodynamicaly oriented clinical psychologists and
psychiatrists). Current state of psychotherapeutic service
Organization
Individual approaches or schools of psychotherapy in Slovenia are mostly organized
as societies, some operate as institutes. The training consists of three basic parts:
personal experience, theory and practical work with clients under supervision.
However, some of the societies have not been offering their members a sufficient
quantity of integral training in accordance with the European Certificate of
Psychotherapy (ECP) as yet, therefore it is their priority to supplement their training
possibilities and to bring them in accordance with the training standard of the ECP.
As far as training is considered, all societies depend more or less on foreign teachers
because they do not have enough teaching staff themselves. Therefore, one of the
societies’ priorities in the near future is: how to develop training programmes with
more Slovenian teachers.
Number, structure, and qualifications of psychotherapists
At the moment it is still difficult to say how many psychotherapists there are in the
Umbrella Organisation and in Slovenia in general. The Umbrella Organisation does
not have a complete register of psychotherapists of single societies yet. In the register
of Psychotherapists’ Society there are around 50 psychotherapists and approximately
150 associated members. Most societies only have a small number of fully trained
psychotherapists: some of them are “grandparents” and some have completed their
training abroad. The majority of members in the societies are without completed
training. Besides, most therapists are employed in their original professions i.e. as
(clinical) psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, education workers, and their
possibilities to work as psychotherapists differ: they dedicate only a small part of their
working hours or a part of their free time to psychotherapy. So psychotherapy training
improves their professional competence in their primary professions, but they use it to
a much smaller extent to practise psychotherapy in the narrow sense of the word.
Thus, only estimates of the total number of psychotherapists are possible for the time
being: we believe that in the Umbrella Organisation and in the Psychotherapists’
Society there are from 200 to 250 people with the professional identity of a
psychotherapist.
Since psychotherapy in Slovenia was founded in the seventies as a subspecialization for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, these two professions are
still the prevailing among the psychotherapists. Only more recent approaches, in the
late eighties, began training other professions as well: social workers, (social)
education workers, occupational therapists, teachers and others. In the recent years
when the Umbrella Organisation as well as the Psychotherapists’ Society have been
offering propaedeutics, also representatives of professions other than beside
humanities have gained access to a psychotherapeutic training. There is an agreement
that basic professions of psychotherapists can be first of all: medicine, psychology,
education – pedagogy/andragogy, rehabilitation – occupation therapy, sociology,
social work, theology, and anthropology. 653 Research
There is no scientific research institute for the time being, though there have been
initiatives in this direction for quite some time. Given that single societies i.e.
approaches have neither sufficient personnel nor financial means for operating such
an institute, it is intended to be operated by the Umbrella Organisation and also serve
the needs of the individual approaches.
Availability of psychotherapeutic service
Clients can contact a psychotherapist either on their own initiative or upon
recommendation of their general practitioner or psychiatrist. Since the demand is
much greater than the supply, many clients remain without psychotherapeutic help.
Only a minority of them is lucky enough to reach a psychotherapist working for the
public health or social care system or in the private practice. Psychiatrists and clinical
psychologists who offer psychotherapy as a part of their daily routine are employed
mainly in psychiatric hospitals, dispensaries of mental health and counselling centres
for children and adolescents. Social workers at Centres of Social Work offer
counselling as a part of their daily routine. Many social workers have received
training in various forms of psychotherapy and include this knowledge in their
counselling but officially they are not allowed to do so and are not paid to do
psychotherapy.
After the democratic shift in 1991 the private practice was allowed in the field
of medicine, clinical psychology and social work. Today there are approximately 25
private psychiatrists, 5 pedopsychiatrists, and 15 clinical psychologists. The national
health insurance allows them psychotherapy and pays them for it. No other
professions (social workers, let's say) can be paid to practice psychotherapy. It is also
interesting that only psychologists with the specialization in clinical psychology are
allowed to do psychotherapy. Many psychologists who are interested in practicing
psychotherapy legally, cannot do it because it is very difficult to get a specialization
in clinical psychology in the health care system. There is no part state financing
system. There are no more than five psychotherapists in Slovenia who earn their
living with psychotherapy alone.
The patients who get psychotherapy from psychiatrists and clinical
psychologists in the health system are treated free of charge, i.e. the cost is covered by
the national health insurance which pays the same for psychotherapy in the public or
private sector: 35 Euros for individual analytic or behaviour-cognitive therapy (60
minutes), 100 Euros for family and couple therapy (for 2 therapist, 90 min), 100
Euros for group therapy (10 members, 110 min) with one therapist or 180 Euros if
there are two therapists, 30 Euro for relaxation techniques (50 min) and 18 Euros for a
so called “superficial measure” (30 min). A few others have the luck of possessing
sufficient financial means and may find a psychotherapist practising psychotherapy in
his free time. The charges for those clients who pay themselves range from 20 to 60
Euros per hour of psychotherapy. Most of the clients can afford the lowest charge and
most of the clients can’t afford the highest.
The psychiatric hospitals admit mainly people suffering from psychoses and
alcoholism. Alcoholism and suicide were rife in the pre-1990 period, and continue to
be the two major social problems associated with personal vulnerability. It is
estimated that 80,000 people suffer from alcoholism, a huge proportion in a country 654 of not more than two million inhabitants. They constitute approximately 80 per cent
of all psychiatric admissions. Like its neighbour Hungary, Slovenia has the highest
European/world rate of completed suicide (around 35 persons per 100,000). Famous
Slovene psychiatrist Milčinski (29) laid grounds for suicide treatment in Slovenia and
attributed an important part of it to psychotherapy. Since most people with alcohol
problems are motivated for symptomatic treatment, only a small part of them is
included in the treatment of alcoholism in psychiatric hospitals which is based on
sociotherapy and psychotherapy (30). The treatment of psychotic patients is based
predominantly on antipsychotic drugs, while psychosocial rehabilitation is
insufficient. The regime includes formal occupational therapy, therapeutic
communities and group therapy. In reality the psychiatric hospitals present a very
medicalized environment with many negative effects of institutionalization, where for
example even volunteers are often not allowed to enter. In spite of the fact, that
“many psychiatrists and psychologists are well educated, not only in their own field
but also in areas as philosophy (many of them are distinguished authors), and
although in the past 15 to 20 years many health professionals have received training
in various forms of psychotherapy, relatively little effect is seen in the day to day
running of psychiatric services” (31). The psychotherapeutic model hasn’t brought
any essential changes to the predominant medical model in psychiatric hospitals.
There are also no psychotherapy wards or clinics for psychosomatic problems.
It is encouraging, though, that psychotherapy has found its way to all
Slovenian psychiatric hospitals and that it is gradually developing, although there is
still a lot of disbelief if not opposition. In the psychiatric hospital, covering the region
of Gorenjska, for example, a ward for behaviour-cognitive therapy with eight beds
was established in 1998 where mainly anxious-depressive disorders, as well as eating
disorders, psychotic and personality disorders, etc. are successfully treated. Given our
psychiatric hospitals financing system, this ward is making a loss which is being
compensated from the income of classical psychiatric wards. Financially, therefore,
there is a paradox - the more involved and high-quality the treatment is, the worse it is
paid and vice versa.
In elementary and secondary schools, psychotherapy as a method is officially
not allowed. Psychologists, special pedagogues and social workers who work in
schools are allowed to use psychotherapeutic elements only in special cases (if there
is a need for a brief treatment or a crisis intervention, for example) but they have to
direct pupils and families to specialized institutions (counselling centres for children
and adolescents, dispensaries of mental health, pedopsychiatric clinics) if they need
psychotherapy. In spite of the official guidelines many of the above mentioned
professionals take it on themselves to build on their psychotherapeutic knowledge and
skills (mostly in Gestalt, reality, behaviour-cognitive and family therapy) which help
them in their everyday work.
In the Communist period, Catholic Church was excluded from the political
arena but it remained a strong and influential institution. After the democratic shift
Caritas was established and has organized psychotherapeutic training for its
counsellors in the 1990’s. At the moment Faculty for Theology is organizing a twoyear postgraduate study in marital and family therapy. In the capital, Ljubljana, there
is a Franciscan Family Center which has become quite popular during last years.
Namely, its leader, father Gostečnik (32), published some books in which he connects 655 in a popular way relational psychoanalysis and systemic psychotherapy with Christian
spirituality. Slovenian psychotherapy in a quantum leap?
The last three years seem to be especially important for the expansion of
psychotherapy in Slovenia. Namely, important new projects promise to bring a
quantum leap in its development: faculty study of psychotherapy, initiative for Law
on Psychotherapy, national network of centres for psychotherapy and psychotherapy
journal. The initiatives for these projects were closely connected to the fruitful
collaboration of Slovenian umbrella association with EAP and with Austrian
colleagues at the Sigmund Freud University.
Faculty study of psychotherapy
In October 2006 Sigmund Freud University (SFU) from Vienna and Slovenian
Umbrella Association for Psychotherapy have started with the faculty study of
psychotherapy (the enrolment is possible immediately after the secondary school)
which is organized in accordance with Bologna process (three levels – bachelor,
master, doctor) (33). Parallel the special project team prepared the application for the
accreditation of bachelor, master and doctoral degree in psychotherapy Slovenia. The
benefits of Slovenian accreditation would be many, for example student status, the
possibility of state concession with the reduction of study costs. The innovative
potential of the faculty study of psychotherapy is big and is opening many
possibilities for the realisation of new goals, for example the reduction of the
insufficient number of psychotherapists in Slovenia, the integration of Slovenian
psychotherapeutic scene, the improvement of the quality of the practice (for example
in the frame of faculty outpatient department), the shortening and the simplification of
the psychotherapy education, bigger emphasis on psychotherapy research etc.
Potential employability possibilities for masters in psychotherapy science will be in
social and health care system, in schools, health truism, in the field of psychosocial
rehabilitation, psychosocial help programmes, palliative care, psychosocial
counselling, in public, private, non-profit organisations and international charity
organisations.
Initiative for Law on Psychotherapy
In 2006 the Working group for Law on Psychotherapy from the representatives of
Slovenian Umbrella Association for Psychotherapy and from Psychotherapists’
Society was established at the Ministry of Health to prepare a draft of Law on
Psychotherapy. After many intensive and controversial discussions it seems that the
draft will be finished in autumn 2008 and will be opened for public discussions. The
consensus was reached on some main points that are in accordance with EAP
Strassbourg declaration:
National network of centres for psychotherapy
As described above the accessibility of psychotherapy services in Slovenia is low.
According to the increasing number of mental disorders Slovenia would need at least
5000 psychotherapists but there are only about 250 psychotherapists with appropriate
qualifications and most of them don't work full time as psychotherapists. Also the
students of psychotherapy and trainees don't have enough possibilities for supervised 656 practice. So in 2007 the umbrella organization (stimulated by the psychotherapy
faculty study project) gave initiative for establishing the National network of centres
of psychotherapy. In spring 2008 centres in Ljubljana, Koper and Nova Gorica started
to work and in autumn new centres in Celje, Maribor, and Slovenj Gradec will join.
The network will offer psychotherapy at a reasonable price (40 Euros a session) and
also free service for socially deprivileged clients. The centres will be connected to
psychotherapy faculty project so that the students could practice under supervision.
The network counselling phone line already started and different projects which will
embed psychotherapy in local communities are planned.
Psychotherapy journal
In 2007 Slovenian Umbrella organization has launched the first specialized journal
“Kairos – Slovenian Journal of Psychotherapy” in Slovenian and English language
(34). Articles are published from all fields of psychotherapy, as well as
interdisciplinary articles and articles from neighbouring fields. The main aim of the
journal is to encourage the development of psychotherapy as the autonomous
profession on the scientific basis in Slovenia and abroad. Trying to compare psychotherapeutic services in both
countries
It is quite obvious from the comparison between Austria and Slovenia that the
development of psychotherapy has some common characteristics. The main phases of
development or the main characteristics that stimulated the development were:
• development of different psychotherapy approaches;
• forming of the umbrella organisation that united different approaches for the
sake of promoting psychotherapy as an autonomous profession;
• promotion of psychotherapy through publications;
• regulation of the field through the Law on Psychotherapy: regulation of
training through accreditation of training institutions, licence system (register
of psychotherapists), ethical control;
• integration of psychotherapy in the public health care system;
• building a global network of psychotherapists and psychotherapy organisations;
• integration of psychotherapy training to the academic world of universities and
building a network of psychotherapy universities.
In the future Slovenian psychotherapists have many more steps to do to integrate
psychotherapy in the health care system. Good Law on Psychotherapy would be the
crucial step. Learning from good Austrian example can help them to make a good
strategy that would of course also include the special characteristics of Slovenian
context. EXERCISE
Task 1
Make an internet search on “psychotherapy law” and compare different law
regulations of psychotherapy in Europe (for example Austria, Germany, Italy, 657 Netherlands, Sweden, UK) and try to propose a model for further development of
psychotherapy as an integral part of comprehensive health care in your country. Task 2
Make a list of needed mental health services in your local area and explain the need of
psychotherapy as an integral part of these services. Task 3
Find a psychotherapist in or near your local community and make an interview about
his or her practice. Pay special attention to the level of integration of his or her
practice in the public health and social care system. REFERENCES

Palliative care, health care services
After completing this module students and public health professionals
should:
• Recognise major palliative care development challenges and
characteristics
• increase knowledge of trajectories of advanced chronic diseases
• understand the implications of future trends of demographics and
diseases changes for health care organization
• identifie most important decisions in the policy planning
Population ageing and the implications these present for care towards
the end of life are major public health issues for 21st century. In the line
with aging of the population, the pattern of diseases that people suffer
and die from is also changing. Palliative care should be an integral part
of health care and take place in any setting. Palliative care services are
structured in three levels of ascending specialization, referred to the
expertise of the staff providing the service: palliative care approach,
general palliative care and specialist palliative care. Priority care needs
for the three illness trajectories, for short period of evident decline
(mostly cancer), for chronic illnesses with intermittent exacerbations
and sudden dying (organ system failure), and for slow dwindling
(mostly frailty and dementia) are different and specific palliative care
services are needed through different length of time.
Short lectures give students theoretical knowledge and insight into a
range of characteristics of palliative care and its services. With case
study, small group discussions, illustrations from personal experiences,
students determine existing palliative care services in their region and
than they identify the main problems. Through study of recommended
reading and internet search, they try to find or create their own solutions
and models from range of views from all stakeholders.

Urška Lunder THEORETICAL BACKROUND
Introduction
Until the last few decades, most people died quickly, following an infection or injury,
or soon after the initial symptoms of an advanced an untreatable condition like cancer,
diabetes, or heart disease. Modern living conditions and advances in health care have
ensured that most will die slowly, and mostly in old age (1).
In the line with aging of the population, the pattern of diseases that people
suffer and die from is also changing. Increasingly, more people die as a result of
serious chronic disease, and older people in particular are more likely to suffer from
multi-organ failure towards the end of life (2). Diagnosing any one disease as the
main cause of death can be difficult to do with certainty as many older people suffer
from several conditions together that might all contribute to death. Dementia is an
example of one condition that is regularly under-diagnosed.
The top five predicted causes of death for 2020 are (3):
1. heart disease,
2. cerebrovascular disease (including stroke),
3. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
4. lower respiratory infections (in situations with progressive dementia, or other
frailty conditions), and
5. lung cancer.
Population ageing and its implications are major public health issues for 21st
century, and palliative medicine and palliative care increasingly becoming more and
more important. Definition and description of palliative care
Definitions of palliative care and palliative medicine
The core of palliative care is well understood, but because of the complexity of
palliative care there are various definitions used around the world. Palliative care is
defined by the World Health Organization as an approach that improves the quality of
life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening
illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification
and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical,
psychosocial and spiritual (4).
An important part of palliative care is palliative medicine. According to
European Association for Palliative Care, palliative medicine is the appropriate
medical care of patients with advanced and progressive disease for whom the focus of
care is the quality of life and in whom the prognosis is limited (though sometimes
may be several years). Palliative medicine includes consideration of the family's
needs before and after the patient's death (5). 661 Palliative care characteristics
Palliative care provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, affirms life,
regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor prolong death.
Palliative care integrates the psychosocial and spiritual aspects of patient care, and offers a
support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death. It also offers a
support system to help family cope during the patient’s illness and their own bereavement.
Using a team approach, palliative care addresses the needs of patients and their
families, including bereavement counselling if necessary. It enhances quality of life, and
may positively influence the course of the illness.
It is applicable early in the course of the clinical phase of the disease with other
therapies, also such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and includes those
investigations needed to understand distressing clinical complications (Figure 1).

course of disease. Palliative care should be offered as needs develop and before they become
unmanageable. Why palliative care is a public health problem?
Quality of care at the end of life is a global public health problem because of the large
number people affected. Palliative care can with its patient centred care, and selfmanagement orientation prevent needless suffering, Additionally, it could have a
potential to prevent morbidity in the bereaved. The range of problems for different diseases
People living with serious chronic diseases face a wide range of problems. Each disease
brings specific symptoms (6), for example:
• ischemic heart disease may cause the chest pain of angina, breathlessness and fatigue,
• stroke may cause difficulty moving or talking, while 662 • chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may restrict activity because of
breathlessness, fatigue and depression.
Chronic diseases often come together and so add up to cause many problems affecting
the quality of people’s lives. Prevalence of problems in the last year of life is presented
in Figure 2. Figure 2. Prevalence of major problems in the last year of life (6). Models of the typical disease trajectory for common
serious chronic diseases
According to Lynn and Adamson (7), models of the typical disease trajectory for
common serious chronic diseases are as follows.
1. Trajectory 1: short period of evident decline, typically cancer.
This entails a reasonably predictable decline in physical health over a period of
weeks, months, or, in some cases, years (Figure 3). Function High Low death Time
Figure 3. Model of typical trajectory of an illness due to cancer. Source: Lynn and
Adamson 2003 (7). 663 This course may be punctuated by the positive or negative effects of palliative
oncological treatment. Most weight loss, reduction in performance status, and
impaired ability for self care occurs in patients' last few months. With the trend
towards earlier diagnosis and greater openness about discussing prognosis, there
is generally time to anticipate palliative needs and plan for end of life care. This
trajectory enmeshes well with traditional specialist palliative care services, such
as hospices and their associated community palliative care programmes, which
concentrate on providing comprehensive services in the last weeks or months of
life for people with cancer. Resource constraints on hospices and their
community teams, plus their association with dying, can limit their availability
and acceptability.
2. Trajectory 2: long term limitations with intermittent serious episodes, typically
organ failure (heart failure, respiratory failure, liver failure, renal failure).
With conditions such as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
patients are usually ill for many months or years with occasional acute, often
severe, exacerbations (Figure 4). Function High death Low Time Figure 4. Model of a typical illness trajectory for organ failure such as heart failure. Source: Lynn
and Adamson 2003 (7). Deteriorations are generally associated with admission to hospital and intensive
treatment. This clinically intuitive trajectory has sharper dips than are revealed
by pooling quantitative data concerning activities of daily living. Each
exacerbation may result in death, and although the patient usually survives many
such episodes, a gradual deterioration in health and functional status is typical.
The timing of death, however, remains uncertain. In one large study, most
patients with advanced heart failure died when expected to live for at least a
further six months. Many people with end stage heart failure and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease follow this trajectory, but this may not be the case
for some other organ system failures.
3. Trajectory 3: prolonged dwindling, typically dementia.
People who escape cancer and organ system failure are likely to die at an older
age of either brain failure (such as Alzheimer's or other dementia) or generalised
frailty of multiple body systems. 664 This third trajectory is of progressive disability from an already low
baseline of cognitive or physical functioning (Figure 5). Function High death Low Time Figure 5. Model of a typical illness trajectory for dementia or frailty. Source: Lynn and
Adamson 2003 (7). Such patients may lose weight and functional capacity and then succumb to
minor physical events or daily social "hassles" that may in themselves seem
trivial but, occurring in combination with declining reserves, can prove fatal.
This trajectory may be cut short by death after an acute event such as a fractured
neck of femur or pneumonia. Clinical and organizational implications
Priority care needs for the three trajectories
Trajectories allow us to appreciate that "doing everything that can be done for a possible
cure" may be misdirected. The priorities are needed, and priority care needs for the three
illness trajectories are as follows (8):
1. Priority care needs for short period of evident decline (mostly cancer) are as
follows:
• adapting services to rapid changes in the patient,
• controlling symptoms,
• providing support for families: training, respite, and counselling through
bereavement,
• ensuring continuity of the clinical team,
• life closure and completion.
2. Priority care needs for chronic illness with intermittent exacerbations and sudden
dying (organ system failure) are as follows:
• preventing exacerbations and providing early treatment,
• planning for urgent situations,
• making decisions about the benefits of low-yield treatments,
• mobilizing services to the home,
• preparing families for sudden death, 665 • life closure and completion.
3. Priority care needs for slow dwindling (mostly frailty and dementia) are as follows:
• fostering caregiver endurance, loyalty, and reliability,
• providing long-term personal care services and supervision,
• helping family caregivers to find meaning and avoid severe burdens,
• avoiding undesired prolongation of life,
• keeping skin intact,
• finding pleasurable moments to enjoy,
• life closure and completion. Palliative care services levels
Palliative care services are structured in three levels of ascending specialization. These
levels refer to the expertise of the staff providing the service.
1. Level one - palliative care approach.
Palliative care approach is that palliative care principles should be appropriately
applied by all health care professionals.
2. Level two – general palliative care.
At an intermediate level, a proportion of patients and families will benefit from the
expertise of health care professionals who, although not engaged full time in
palliative care have had some additional training and experience in palliative care.
3. Level three – specialist palliative care.
Engaged in palliative care full time and palliative services are their core
activities, provided by an inter-disciplinary team, under direction of a consultant
physician in palliative medicine. Palliative care services
Palliative care should be an integral part of health care and take place in any setting.
In each health area all three levels of services provision should be available in all
care settings, including acute general hospitals and the community. Services should be
sufficiently flexible to allow movement of patients from one care setting to another,
depending on their clinical situation and personal preferences.
Palliative care in the community
The most palliative care is likely to be delivered in the primary care setting. Studies
have indicated that people with terminal diseases spend most of their final year of life at
home (9,10). One of the main principles in palliative care is to provide services to
patients in a setting of their choice. Most people would prefer to die at their home
(11,12). The development of community based palliative care services is vital in the
future development of palliative care services in order to best meet the needs and
personal preferences of patients with advanced cancer or progressive life-threatening
disease of other aetiologies.
The majority of care in the community is provided by a family physician and a
community nurse, and a specialized palliative care nurse can become involved in the
care of patients with advanced incurable disease. Other disciplines are also involved in
the care of patients in the community to varying degrees. These include the
physiotherapist, the occupational therapist, and social worker. 666 There are many factors that prevent patients from receiving adequate care in the
community and which result in the often unnecessary admission of patients to hospitals,
nursing homes or specialist palliative care units. The main reason has been identified as
a lack of support for carers in the community (9,10,13). Although most of the last year
of life is spent at home, approximately 90% of patients dying from cancer are admitted
to a hospital in their last year (9).
Specialist palliative care team
Hospital palliative care teams have evolved into specialist inter-disciplinary consulting
teams, who offer advice and support to professional health care providers regarding the
management of patients with progressive disease. Specialist palliative care team in the
acute general hospital should consist of at least a consultant in palliative medicine, a
specialist palliative care nurse, a social worker, and a secretary.
Specialist palliative units
A particular hospital, depending on the regional needs, may designate a ward or a unit to
function as the specialist palliative care unit for patients requiring specialist palliative
care. Specialist palliative care team in such a unit consists of full interdisciplinary teams
(specialized physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologist, physiotherapist,
occupational therapist, pharmacist, dietician, coordinator of spiritual care, volunteers).
Day care centres
Day care centres are usually attached to the specialist palliative care units. They offer
access to specialist care, a change of environment for patients, and respite for their
families and carers.
Above national palliative care programme, guidelines or standards for specialist
palliative care settings should be established, which would ensure a national consistency
of standards for all specialist palliative care centres.
Hospice
Hospice is usually nongovernmental organization, also with a holistic approach to the end
of life care, dependant on attitude, expertise and understanding rather than a specific
mechanism and setting. It most often includes a house and inpatient unit, but can be also
organized as an institution with homecare teams and bereavement support only. It can
increase the sensitivity for more holistic, proactive and anticipating approach towards the
dying, through individual treatment, sincere communication, attention to detail, continuity
of care, and team work. It is a concept of choice and empowerment at the end of life. It is
a concept of dignity, autonomy and respect for the dying and the family. It is a potential
denominator for public change in attitudes, behaviour, and life-decisions led by
understanding and compassion. It can also be an important link to promote palliative care
in the wider community. Present status
Some countries are now developing national and regional palliative care strategies, and
each country needs to decide which options of care are their priorities that can be offered
or planned for. However, if people do not receive information on what care is available, it
is difficult to argue that best care has been offered. Currently, most health care systems 667 are not set up in a way that makes it easy for people to receive palliative care or to die
where they would wish.
There is still too much unnecessary suffering at the end of life in contemporary
society and inadequate services to relieve it through insufficient professional knowledge,
organizational possibilities through inexistent services network and lack of interest in
palliative care.
Another barrier to better development of palliative care is lack of policy-makers
interest in organizational and strategic planning for people with palliative care needs
already at the present and in the future.
At the same time, palliative care for non-malignant diseases has been voted in
British Medical Journal in April 2008 as the area of health care in which doctors can
make the greatest difference to patient care. Palliative care and the future
The proportion of people in each trajectory will shift with medical advances and
lifestyle changes:
• as people reduce smoking and otherwise prevent lethal cancer, more people will
live long enough to develop vascular and heart disease,
• to the extent that prevention (through diet, medications, and exercise) is effective
for heart disease, more people will live long enough to encounter dementia and
frailty,
• dying from cancer tends to peak around seventy years of age, and heart and lung
disease about a decade later,
• most people who survive past eighty-five eventually need daily care and
accumulate evidence of multisystem lack of reserves.
Thus, to the extent that prevention and early treatment are successful, more people are
likely to live their last years with frailty and dementia (8). In Figure 6, major medical
conditions before death for Medicare beneficiaries are presented. Figure 6. Major medical conditions before death, for Medicare beneficiaries. Source: Lunney,

PALLIATIVE CARE IN SLOVENIA
This case study is basing on policy paper entitled “Organizing palliative care in
Slovene health care system” which represents the last overview concerning the
status of palliative care in Slovenia (15). Epidemiological data
Some basic mortality and morbidity indicators
In Slovenia with approximately 2 million inhabitants there are around 19,000 deaths
per year. The life expectancy at birth is 74.04 years for men, and 80.93 years for
women (16).
The three main causes of death in Slovenia are cardiovascular diseases,
neoplasm and diseases of respiratory system (17).
Regarding neoplasm, Slovenia is a country with a middle size morbidity and
mortality rate caused by cancer. The leading cancer for the male population is lung
cancer (16.8% out of all cancer sites in males) and for the female population is
breast cancer (21.0% out of all cancer sites in females) (18). Where majority of deaths occur?
According to data from 2002, approximately 59% of all deaths in Slovenia occur in
hospitals and other institutions, and 41% occur at home (Table 1) (19). The
situation is still approximately the same in present time.

7,500 Additionally, from the Table 2 data we can estimate the most frequent
symptoms in the last year of life based on the work of Higginson (20). In this
estimation we must be aware of the fact that patients often have many concurrent
symptoms at the last days of life.
Epidemiology - numbers and causes of death can give indication of need for
palliative care, especially when coupled with information on symptoms, emotional,
social and spiritual problems. With this approach we have to be aware of data
inconsistencies and gaps (e.g. recorded cause of death is subject of fashion, or can
be inaccurate in older people where there are multiple causes) and different diseases
have different patterns of progression. But this simple approach can provide us with
useful insight for planning and implementation purposes History and present state of palliative care in Slovenia
Short history
The hospice movement, with home service and education programs, started in the
middle of the 1990s in Ljubljana, the capital city of Slovenia. Slowly, then in about
a decade, palliative care started to penetrate the health care system. Present situation
It is now present in seven cities in Slovenia, in three of them, Ljubljana, Maribor and
Celje their palliative care teams offer not just education to the public and volunteers for
home support for the families, but a whole range of palliative home care services. This
includes palliative nursing care, social and psychological care for patients and their
families at their homes.
Nurses in each hospice in Ljubljana, Maribor and Celje are paid by the National
Health Insurance Company.
General practitioners and community nurses are not involved in organized
palliative care initiatives yet. A particular concern is that Slovenia lacks around 200
primary care physicians and even more nurses at the present time. The problem of
palliative care implementation on the primary care level needs to be closely examined, and
solutions wisely proposed together with a sensitive evaluation of the possible reality.
All hospices together, provide home care for around 500 patients annually. They
organize of workshops, seminars and presentations.
There are around 110 volunteers working in the hospice organizations at the
moment. New groups of volunteers are trained every year.
Bereavement services are organized in all hospices, and there is also a traditional
bereavement children’s group holiday every summer.
New regional organizations of hospice in different parts of Slovenia are
developing, particularly for education on psychosocial topics for volunteers and the
public. Hospice movement in Slovenia serves as an important model of hospice and
palliative care to be implemented into national health system.
Pain programs, like in other countries, started much earlier in most hospitals than
the palliative care programs. There are outpatient pain clinics in nearly every hospital in
Slovenia. Main palliative care services in Slovenia
Main palliative care services in Slovenia are: 670 1. The University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik has established
a palliative care unit within a long-term care department of the hospital. There is a
palliative care team with a physician four nurses, social worker, psychologist and
volunteers.
2. The major institution for cancer patients, Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, has
recently established a Department for palliative care.
3. At General hospital Jesenice few hospital beds are available for palliative care as
well.
4. The Palliative Care Development Institute was founded in 2000 as a training and
resource centre, education, research and advocacy. The Institute plays a crucial role
in the strategic planning and policy development of palliative care on the national
level. Palliative care policy
The Palliative Care Development Institute in co-operation with the Ministry of Health
prepared a National strategic plan for palliative, but it is still in the process of wide
discussion, confirmation and ratification.
The National Committee for Palliative Care at the Ministry of Health is overseeing
and co-ordinating a pilot study on palliative care implementation in the health care system.
The process of developing standards of care for patients at the end of life is under
way, but still at an early stage in Slovenia. Pain as the main palliative care problem
Pain is the major symptom for patients in need of palliative care and therefore drug
consumption for pain treatment is an indirect indicator of the development of
palliative care. All the essential drugs for pain relief are available in Slovenia, with a
normal procedure for prescribing.

Control Board 2005 (21). 671 There was a sudden increase in opioid consumption after 1998, most probably due to
the activities listed previously and new pain relief drugs available on the market. The
decline in last three years demonstrates the need for regular extensive postgraduate
education on pain management. As compared to the rest of Europe, consumption of
morphine in Slovenia is at the global mean level, but under the average European
mean level in 2003 (Figure 8). Figure 8. Consumption of morphine (mg/capita) in Europe in 2003. Source: International Narcotics
Control Board 2005 (21). A study of quality of care at the end of life at the Oncology Institute, Ljubljana,
presented at the International Conference on Palliative Care in Cancer, Ljubljana (22),
showed a retrospective record analysis of quality of care for 145 patients in 2002 for
the last 6 months of life. The results suggested, that the documentation among health
care professionals was incomplete and co-ordination often inappropriate. 75% of
patients received opioids, with successful treatment to the goal of mean VAS 3 in
47% of patients. The major weak points in the care of patients at the Oncology
Institute as compared to the literature were higher rates of prescriptions for
antibiotics, transfusions, and parenteral hydration in the last days, and lack of
evaluation of the common symptoms in palliative care except pain (e.g.
breathlessness, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, etc.). No patient received chemotherapy,
albumin or vasoactive support in the last days of life. In the documentation less data
was available on other symptoms and especially about psychosocial problems of
patients and their families. No other symptoms except pain were evaluated by a scale,
so it was impossible to evaluate the effects of treatment, as documented. From the
study, it was more than obvious how urgent it is to put palliative care standards in 672 place. The study indicated urgent need for extensive professional training, a better
documentation system and co-ordination among all professionals in the health system.
National guidelines for pain management have been published in 1999, and
have already been updated. The WHO-book on Pain and Symptom Management for
Children with Cancer has been translated into Slovenian. In addition to the guidelines,
there was a successful educational campaign organized to train doctors and nurses all
over the region on the basics of pain management. The future of implementation of organized palliative
care in Slovenia
Reasons for slow implementation of nationally organized
palliative care in Slovenia
The possible reasons for the absence of nationally organized effective palliative care
programme in Slovenia could be the historical development of the Slovene society. There
has been long subjugation of the country to another’s rule; our independence began only in
1991. This situation through the centuries contributed to the development of a closed
national character. People are not used to discussing and solving their problems publicly.
The suicide rate in Slovenia is one of the highest in Europe.
In the period of socialism, death was pushed into the sphere of the private, and
the Church, which was competing for the public’s attention, would not enter the
private sphere (23). There was no interest in the development of public institutions,
like palliative care units in hospitals or hospices. There was a strict hierarchical
organization of the health care system, and the concept of team work was not
developed. Nursing, which is the most involved in the care of the dying patient, still
has little power because of its subordinate position within the health care system (24).
Medical doctors, probably because of the lack of palliative care program
during their study and lack of organizational solutions, do not feel comfortable in the
area of palliation and rather emphasize the curative approach.
Finally, there was a complete absence of financial support from the government for
all non-acute diseases (therefore also for the palliative care programs).We could
conclude that:
• the incidence of chronic and progressive diseases in Slovenia compares to
central European countries, but not to their level of palliative care
development: palliative care is not organized nor sufficiently developed in the
Slovene health care system;
• in Slovenia, like in the majority of European countries, the proportion of older
population is increasing, needs for palliative care will become larger (25);
• statistical data about evaluation measures and quality of services in palliative
care are not available, and therefore not very reliable qualitative and financial
estimations of costs for existing initiatives of palliative care are possible. Main issues and obstacles for strategies for the
implementation of palliative care into national health system
The main issues in palliative care for Slovenia are: 673 1. to develop common vision for palliative care for the people who need it now
and for the growing population of elderly, who will need it very soon;
2. to produce common standards in palliative care;
3. to introduce regular undergraduate and postgraduate education;
4. to ensure better teamwork and continuity of care across all settings;
5. to introduce efficient clinical and managerial solutions to ensure better health
outcomes and patient satisfaction; and
6. to bring better understanding that every clinical decision is also a financial
decision and therefore responsibility in the clinical management should be
introduced.
On the other side, the main obstacles for the implementation of organized palliative
care are:
1. lack of knowledge and appropriate attitude among health care professionals;
2. lack of organizational motivation to reach better health and satisfaction
outcomes;
3. lack of clearly defined common standards in palliative care;
4. lack of understanding of team work and continuity of care;
5. lack of the public understanding what palliative care is;
6. lack of economic analyses on end-of-life care:;
7. lack of governmental understanding of palliative care and its benefits; and
8. lack of governmental recognition of the growing needs of patients with chronic
and progressive diseases in the past, and therefore lack of financial incentives.
Common examples of attitudes presenting direct barriers to palliative care
development are:
• “We are already providing this form of care.”
• “We do not have enough money for this development.”
• “We only need to train general practitioners.”
• “We already are starting non-acute departments where nurses are offering care
to patients.”
• “In tertiary hospitals we should not have this type of patients.”
• “Nursing homes should provide such services.”
Such remarks are often heard and illustrate a range of individual and institutional barriers
and lack of understanding of benefits which can be achieved. To respond to this situation a
combination of well trained palliative care teams with clear ideas and vision on the one
hand are needed, along with generic education and a change of attitudes with the ability to
build on earlier successes in order to achieve worthwhile results.
As Gomez-Batiste et al (26) observed, individual and institutional resistance might
be very strong and it is vital to understand the reasons that underpin it and work towards
achieving a consensus of views. This can help to distinguish between palliative care
services and for example, pain clinic or oncology services, in a context where palliative
care standards have been clearly defined. This is particularly important where there is a
political dependency of one service on another, rooted in local power positions. Once a
number of good initiatives are underway, however, and this has been consolidated, local
experience is frequently the most effective rejoinder to criticism. It then becomes possible
to focus more on issues of extension and coverage. 674 Assessment of needs
Baseline studies to assess needs provide vital information on kinds of services that
should be developed. Objective assessment of needs and analysis of baseline context
is also crucial for effective monitoring of the results of a new initiative. We can use a
simple and pragmatic approach to estimate need in palliative care by Higginson that
has three components (20):
• epidemiology;
• comparison with services available; and
• effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis - national and local. Possible strategies for palliative care in Slovenia
There are three main options of possible strategies for palliative care in Slovenia:
1. No change in the current government policy or strategy.
This would most probably lead to a variety of very slowly evolving and
differently formulated palliative care services on different levels of the health
care system, not being integrated into a useful network of the path of every
patient, without proper quality standards, coverage, equity, possibilities for
quality measures and planning towards meeting needs. It would definitely be a
very unsatisfactory experience for patients and their families, and health care
professionals as well.
It would also be possible to expect similar events of misuse and
exploitation of the circumstances like the events in Hotel Črni les, in the 20012003, as reported in the media. Inappropriate care and financial exploitation
was discovered in the situation of absence of organized palliative care on the
national level.
2. Incremental or modest policy change; the development of palliative care units
within nursing departments in every large hospital.
If new governmental policy helps alleviate some of the aspects of the current
problem, like supporting the development of long-term nursing departments in
hospitals only and not acting strategically on all levels of health care where
patients die, very similar results to the first option can be expected. Public
health goals (coverage, equity, quality standard care, efficiency and efficacy)
could not be reached in this way.
3. Radical policy alternatives.
By applying bold changes, most if not all of the policy goals could be
achieved. To guide reforms, many participants in health care should embark on
an era of innovation, evaluation, and learning. Among those are clinicians,
educators, insurance house, provider organizations and government agencies
together with the development of palliative care teams and patient advocacy
organizations. EXERCISES
Task 1
Carefully read the part on theoretical background of this module. Critically discuss the
characteristics of palliative care services and their supportive role in different trajectories
of disease in a small group of students (fishbowl method could be used). 675 Task 2
From domestic and international bibliographic data-bases find out how different
successful models of palliative care services can meet people’s needs at the end of life. REFERENCES
