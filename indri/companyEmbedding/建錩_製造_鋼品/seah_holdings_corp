VANCOUVER, Nov. 25, 2011 /CNW/ - SeAH Holdings Corp. ("SeAH") announces pursuant to National Instrument 62-103 that on May 9, 2011,
 it acquired 10 million units of Roca Mines Inc. ("Roca Mines") in a non-brokered private placement for aggregate consideration of
 $2.5 million or $0.25 per unit. Each unit consisted of one common share
 in the capital of Roca Mines (a "Common Shares") and one half of a common share purchase warrant of Roca Mines. Each
 whole warrant (a "Warrant") entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of $0.30
 per Common Share and the Warrants are exercisable until May 9, 2012.


The Common Shares purchased by SeAH represent approximately 8.07% of the
 123,864,898 issued and outstanding Common Shares. If all of the
 Warrants were exercised, SeAH would hold 15 million Common Shares,
 which would represent approximately 11.64% of the 128,864,898 of the
 Common Shares that would be issued and outstanding upon the exercise of
 the Warrants (assuming that Roca Mines issues no other securities).


SeAH's acquisition of Common Shares and Warrants was made for investment
 purposes. SeAH may, in the future, acquire ownership and control over
 additional securities of Roca Mines, dispose of securities of Roca
 Mines or continue to hold its current position.


Neither SeAH nor any of its affiliates is currently a party to any
 agreement in respect of the acquisition, holding, disposition or voting
 of any securities of Roca Mines.
