OVERVIEW
Ta Chen International, Inc. ("TCI" or "the Company") is a leading master distributor of stainless, aluminum and nickel alloy coils, sheets, plates, long products, tubes and PVFs. TCI is an industry leader in inventory depth, breadth and availability and efficiently serves over 3,000 customers nationwide through 8 strategically located warehouses.
 
Founded by Mr. Robert Shieh in 1989, TCI entered the US market as a newcomer to the stainless steel distribution business. Within 10 years, the Company has grown from a small operation in Los Angeles to become the largest and most recognized name in Stainless Master Distribution in the United States




 
HISTORY
In the early 1990's, the Company focused primarily on the distribution of stainless steel pipes, valves and fittings manufactured by TCI's parent company, Ta Chen Stainless Pipe, Ltd (publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under ticker: 2027). Based in Taiwan, Ta Chen Stainless Pipe is an advanced mill that produces some of the world's highest quality stainless steel welded pipes, tubing, fittings and valves. Today, Ta Chen's PVF products have achieved recognition in the United States and Europe for its superior quality and value.
 
In the mid 1990's, TCI expanded its product line to include stainless steel flat rolled and also added stainless steel long products by the late 1990's. The ability to successfully combine the three product lines - PVF, flat rolled & long products -under one sales platform was an industry first in stainless master distribution. Nevertheless, TCI continued to expand its product offerings which now include aluminum and nickel alloy flat rolled products.
 
In 2001, the Company again opted to take the road less traveled and launched what has become the metals industry's most popular and powerful Internet web order platform. Most importantly, TCI customers have capitalized on the TCI system to increase their own capital and operating efficiencies. Today, over 75% of TCI's daily transactions are completed efficiently over the web and this technology platform provides the Company with unprecedented operating leverage. With the ability to harness this level of operating efficiency, TCI stands alone in its ability to guarantee the industry's best value proposition to our customers.
