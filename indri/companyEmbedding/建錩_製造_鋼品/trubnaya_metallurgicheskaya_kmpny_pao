        TMK supplies premium products with coating GreenWell for an offshore field for the first time
      

        23.12.2015
      

        TMK, one of the world's leading producers of tubular products for the oil and gas industry, shipped premium pipe products with lubricant-free coating GreenWell for LUKOIL-Nizhnevolzhskneft. The supply included 32 tonnes of 177,8 mm P110-grade casing pipes and pipe nipples with TMK UP PF ET premium connection. Pipes were manufactured at Taganrog Metallurgical Works, pipe nipples - at Orsk Machine-Building Plant. The receiving inspection was performed involving specialists of the oilfield service company TMK NGS.
      

        TMK has already supplied premium products for LUKOIL-Nizhnevolzhskneft, but pipes with lubricant-free coating have been shipped for the first time. TMK's pipe products will be used at Y. Korchagin oil and gas condensate field in the Caspian Sea. It will be the first time TMK's pipes with lubricant-free coating are used in an offshore well.
      

        TMK introduced the GreenWell lubricant-free coating technology in 2013. Polymer coating is a cutting-edge alternative to standard lubricants for threaded connections. TMK has supplied pipe products with coating GreenWell for Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Bashneft, LUKOIL and NOVATEK.
      

        The GreenWell lubricant-free technology used for offshore wells allows to speed up the process of assembling pipe strings by reducing preparation time and minimizing damage to the environment, as it eliminates the ingress of lubricant into the water.
