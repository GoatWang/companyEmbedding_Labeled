PANGANG GROUP CHENGDU IRON & STEEL CO.,LTD





















 







 
















 



 


　 　As the result of the amalgamation of the former Pangang Group Chengdu Seamless   Steel Tube Co., Ltd. and the former Chengdu I & S Works, Pangang Group   Chengdu Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. or PGG CSST is an integrated metallurgical   enterprise and a controlling subsidiary of Panzhihua I & S ( Group )   Corporation. The company is also one of the biggest domestic seamless steel tube   makers with the fullest product range and a major manufacturer of construction   steel products in the western region of China.
          　　
          Before the amalgamation, the   two former companies were both large-scaled State-owned metallurgical   enterprises with their glorious histories longer than four decades, having made   great contributions to the development of the country. The former Pangang Group   Chengdu Seamless Steel Tube Co., Ltd. was originally Chengdu Seamless Steel Tube   Plant ( CSST ), once the biggest domestic manufacturer of seamless steel tubes   and pipes, while the former Chengdu I & S Works was also a major I & S   enterprise in Sichuan Province.
          　　
          In 2002, following the State’s blueprint of   a much bigger Pangang Consortium covering the western region of China and the   development strategy by the Chengdu municipal government for restructuring the   industrial organizations in the east suburb of the city, Pangang Group Chengdu   Seamless Steel Tube Co., Ltd. and Chengdu I & S Works were amalgamated,   which was a significant strategic move benefiting all the parties involved,   i.e., the Chengdu municipality, Pangang Group and the two companies. The new   company, PGG CSST has taken the consolidation as a good opportunity to get its   business developed healthy by means of deepening the melting of the two former   companies and improving the management of the two parts as a whole. Meanwhile, a   PGG CSST overall huge program of relocation & technical upgrade with a total   investment of over 3 billion RMB is being undertaken, the first phase of which   focuses on relocation/upgrade of the company’s steel-making facilities.
          　　
          In   2003, following the national development guideline made by the CPC’s Sixteenth   National Conference, PGG CSST will make further efforts to bring about its big   leap forward development, focusing on tapping the potential, cutting down   operation costs, fulfilling the relocation/technical upgrade program as per the   schedule and quality as required and deepening the operational and   organizational reform.
          　　
          For product marketing and selling, PGG CSST shall   further adjust its product mix, improve product quality and tap the market   potential. With the so-called “ macro-marketing” sense, the company shall also   make effort for better coordination between the production and the sale   activities. For the business of steel tubular products, the marketing and sales   shall feature multi- category and multi-size package supplies and professional   technical services, while for the business of construction steel products, the   efforts shall be focused on maintaining the Chengdu-based Western Sichuan   Regional market share with the marketing area defined in a optimum way. New sale   and technical service measures shall be adopted for better follow-up services   for major projects and key customers. Meanwhile, further active coordination   with companies of the same circles shall be made to defend the interest of the   industry as a whole.
          For future expansion, PGG CSST has been performing an   overall relocation and technical upgrade program in a bid to become the second   biggest business of Pangang Group with an annual capacity of 2 million tons of   crude steel and steel products and a yearly revenue up to 6 billion RMB. The   company shall have very sharp competitive edges by means of the capability of   producing such unique product series like large-sized seamless steel tubes made   with the first domestic MPM line of the world first-class level, large-sized,   heavy-walled tubes manufactured with the pilger mill process, a tubular product   series produced by PGG CSST only in China, steel bars rolled with the national   first-class continuous rolling line as well steel wire rods made with the   hi-speed operation line.
          　　
          With a brilliant blueprint of development and the   opportunities brought about by the ongoing “ Go West ” campaign of China, PGG   CSST shall brave the challenges to make progress with the times and continued   creation and growth. Backed by the supports from its customers and friends from   all the fields concerned, PGG CSST shall continuously make every effort to get   Pangang Group built as the I & S aircraft carrier in Western China and   further contribute to the development of the I & S industry of the   country.
