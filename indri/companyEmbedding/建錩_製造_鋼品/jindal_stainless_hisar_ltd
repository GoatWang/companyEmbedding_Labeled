Jindal Stainless (Hisar) Limited
The Hisar plant was established in 1975 when Shri O.P Jindal, envisioned a self reliant India for meeting its stainless steel demand. Stainless steel then was no less than a luxury metal and India was completely dependent on imports to fulfil its demand, which imports attracted duties of up to 300%. It was Shri O.P Jindal’s vision and his pioneering spirit that led to the establishment of the Hisar plant, India’s first stainless steel manufacturing unit.
                        
JSHL was formerly part of Jindal Stainless Limited and pursuant to the approval of the composite scheme of arrangement by Hon’ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh, the Hisar plant was transferred from Jindal Stainless Limited to JSHL.
                        
Since its inception, Hisar plant was integrated on a strategy of both, backward and forward integration, starting from mining, melting, casting, hot rolling to cold rolling and other value additions. Today, it is a fully integrated Stainless Steel plant with a capacity of 800,000 TPA. It is also the world’s largest producer of Stainless Steel strips for razor blades and India’s largest producer of coin blanks, serving the needs of Indian and International mints.
                        
Our Specialty product division caters to the high end precision and specialty stainless steel requirements of reputed Indian and International customers. The product range includes Slabs & Blooms, Hot Rolled Coils, Strips, Plates, Coin Blanks, Precision Strips and Cold Rolled Coils.
                        
Going forward, the Company plans to continue its focus on development of new value added stainless steel grades, process improvements and customer satisfaction through developing customized products matching their specific requirements. Simultaneously, continuous measures are being undertaken to reduce cost in different production processes.
