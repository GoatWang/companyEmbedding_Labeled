    HOUSTON, May 28, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc. (SES) (Nasdaq:SYMX) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, SES Technologies, LLC, Shanghai-based Jiangsu Tianwo-SES Clean Energy Technologies Ltd. (TSEC), and Midrex Technologies, Inc. (Midrex), a subsidiary of Kobe Steel Limited (ADR-OTC:KBSTY), have entered into an exclusive agreement for the joint marketing of coal gasification-based direct reduced iron (DRI) facilities in China. These facilities will combine the premiere SES Gasification Technology with the industry-leading MIDREX ® Direct Reduction Process to create syngas from low quality coals in order to convert iron ore into high-purity DRI.  Midrex and SES will work together to develop and implement the marketing and commercialization strategy, with the intention of securing the product offering's first customers, initially in China. The partners have engaged TSEC, to aid in the marketing of these powerful gasification-based DRI facilities in China. Additionally, TSEC will supply the gasification equipment and licensing of the SES Gasification Technology to any of SES-Midrex DRI projects in its region, which includes all of China, as well as Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines and Vietnam.  SES and Midrex executed the agreement after conducting an early engineering co-development effort of the joint technologies, which provided results leading the partners to believe that this clean, efficient and economic product will have widespread application even outside of China, especially in regions with low quality, low cost coal, which comprise more than 50% of the world's coal resources.  The new coal gasification-based DRI plants are intended to support China's growth in an eco-friendly way as China moves away from high polluting and inefficient blast furnaces to new, cleaner technologies for the fabrication of iron product for steel manufacturing. China is the largest producer of steel in the world, and currently has no DRI-based plants. The Chinese central government is encouraging the replacement of outdated facilities that generate higher emissions with lower efficiencies with new clean, efficient ironmaking technology.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com Canada's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

      Kobe Steel, Ltd.


        TOKYO, July 27, 2017 - Kobe Steel, Ltd. announces that it will open its regional headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand in August. Kobe Steel has established a subsidiary called Kobelco South East Asia Ltd. (or KSEA) to oversee operations in Southeast Asia and South Asia.
      

        Along with regional headquarters in the United States and China, KSEA will serve as the central base to strengthen corporate governance, compliance and other aspects of business management. KSEA will also centralize financial management and further promote coordination within the Kobe Steel Group companies in Southeast Asia and South Asia.
      

        Since the 1960s, the Kobe Steel Group has been expanding its operations in the two regions. It currently has 30 companies mainly in its materials and machinery businesses covering six countries. Recently, Kobe Steel has been accelerating business development in the area. In February 2016, Kobe Steel's Iron & Steel Business established a joint venture in Thailand to produce and sell steel wire rods.
      

        Since risks associated with business activities have become more complex and numerous, in addition to diverse languages, business practices and laws, a regional headquarters is required to effectively deal with these conditions and coordinate operations in the two regions.
      

        Kobe Steel established KSEA in Thailand, as regional headquarters for Southeast Asia and South Asia, where the largest number of its subsidiaries in the regions are located. Thailand is also where Kobe Steel expects business centered on the automotive sector to grow.
      

        With KSEA as the central base, Kobe Steel plans to strengthen business management in Southeast Asia and South Asia. It will also provide support to Group companies, promote personnel exchanges and strengthen cooperation among the Group companies. Promoting business efficiency, Kobe Steel aims to achieve continued growth in the two regions.

        January 21, 2016

        TOKYO, January 21, 2016 - Kobe Steel, Ltd. has established a subsidiary company in Thailand called Kobelco Compressors (Thailand) Ltd. (or KCTH) to market and sell standard air compressors, as well as provide after-sales services. Based in Bangkok, KCTH has begun full-scale marketing from this month. It anticipates supplying 800 compressor units in 2020, amounting to sales of about 3 billion yen.
      

        Kobe Steel's standard compressor business is actively expanding overseas. In November last year, Kobelco Compressors India Pvt. Ltd. began marketing in India. Kobe Steel now has sales locations for its air compressors in 10 countries, and the opening of KCTH is anticipated to further expand its market share.
      

        Standard compressors are mainly used in factories to provide compressed air for such applications as powering equipment and machinery, painting and powder conveying. Utility equipment for these applications is widely used in numerous industries. Power consumption for compressors generally comprises about 20 to 30 percent of the electricity used at factories, requiring high energy performance. Known for its high efficiency and energy-saving features, Kobe Steel's Kobelion series of screw compressors has one of the highest market shares in Japan and Southeast Asia.
      

        The global market size for standard compressors is approximately US$9 billion (about 1 trillion yen). As many Japanese electric machinery and electronics manufacturers have entered the Thai market, demand for compressors is anticipated to increase from the current 3,000 units to approximately 4,000 units in 2020, according to Kobe Steel estimates. On this background, KCTH was established to support the growing market and has begun commercial marketing activities.
      

        Kobe Steel has built up a global network to market and service its standard compressors. Kobe Steel currently has manufacturing locations in three countries: Japan, the United States and China. Sales locations have been established in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia and India.
      

        In addition, Kobe Steel is the only comprehensive compressor manufacturer in the world that can supply large-size screw, reciprocating and centrifugal compressors. Kobe Steel has an estimated 50-percent share of the world market for these nonstandard compressors, or custom-engineered process compressors, which are used in petrochemical plants.
