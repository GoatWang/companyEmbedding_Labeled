For analyzing any company like Mechel PAO from an investment perspective, its important to check the cash flow statement.  While its important to look at the Mechel PAO debt position, the cash flow statement becomes equally important because public companies use accrual accounting.  For example, if a company sells a product which gets counted as Mechel PAO revenue  but does not convert to cash because it does not receive payment in the same quarter, it affects the cash position for that period.  Mechel PAO cash flow analysis is possible because this statement breaks down how balance sheet accounts and income statement items affect cash and cash equivalents.  Mechel PAO had cash and cash equivalents of $13.36M at the beginning of the year and $21.79M at year end for 2016.   MTL increase in investments stood at a negative value of $-74.53M for the latest 2016.

In the CIS, ASC is expected to grow +2.0 to +2.5% (revised up from previous forecast of -0.5% to +0.5%) reflecting stronger economic growth in Russia. In China, ASC growth of +2.5% to +3.5% in 2017 (revised up from previous forecast of -1.0% to 0%), primarily due to strength in real estate and machinery.MoreReplyReplies (12)00SSettyJust when things are looking up.  Mechel ordered to pay 12.7B rub in lawsuit by former partner who intends to sue up to 60B rub.  Mechel is attempting to appeal the ruling.  A person could write a compelling drama series on the ups and downs of Mechel.ReplyReplies (3)10LLadaNivaI'm still surprised at how the Pref. shares lag the Common given the terms of the Pref. guarantee the Pref. dividend can't be less than the dividend on the Common.  Now that MTL is starting to generate positive net income, the Pref. shares will receive dividends while the Common receive nothing for several years until the debt levels are reduced.  By my way of valuation, I'd think the Pref. should be selling at a decent premium to the Common instead of a significant discount.  Preferred ADR's will get about $0.09 per share in mid-August and, by my rough estimates of 2017 earnings, somewhere between $0.20 and $0.25 next year, giving me a current value of at least $1.40-$1.60 ($2.00 or more once we get a couple more quarter's of positive earnings) on the Pref. ADR's, now selling for $1.02.   The risk/reward on the Pref. is a hell of a lot better than on the Common, at least in my humble opinion.MoreReplyReplies (8)10SSettyNearly a $.09 dividend approved for preferred.  Nice little dividend and hopefully just a start.  Next year, we could be looking at a payout 3-4 times higher if good things continue.  I won't hold my breath, but at least this dividend will pay for 3 years of ADR fees, so I will hold my position :)ReplyReplies (7)21IInvestrmanWell, I'd be satisfied seeing that 3.75 area finally traded thru especially on backs of G7 and Poland visit right now, and statements against Russia in general...ReplyReplies (1)12MMAGAthis stock is going nowhere. had agent Orange #$%$ ,it could have been $20-$30 stock. no complaints here.I just sold the last part of my MTL holdings and I will have to pay some hefty tax on this profit. all the money is in AKS.

On the downside,  USA wants to add new sanctions on Russian miners, and there's more steel duty rulings to come.@@@VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - June 15, 2017) - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A and TECK.B, NYSE: TECK) ("Teck") today provided guidance for expected realized steelmaking coal price and an update on volumes for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter 2017 price for steelmaking coal sold under quarterly contract has been established based on an average of three assessments, which results in pricing of approximately US$190 per tonne. This index pricing mechanism will apply effective April 1, 2017, and for future quarters.Teck now expects its second quarter average realized coal price to be between US$160 and US$165 per tonne. The differential between the quarterly benchmark price and our average realized price for the second quarter is larger than usual. After steel mills filled their prompt requirements immediately following the Queensland cyclone, there were very few prime hard coking coal spot sales during the four week period from mid-April. Steelmaking coal sales volumes for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between 6.8 and 7 million tonnes. Final quarterly sales will depend on timing of shipments.http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/teck-updates-steelmaking-coal-guidance-tsx-teck.a-2222182.htmMoreTeck Updates Steelmaking Coal GuidanceVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - June 15, 2017) - Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A and TECK.B, NYSE: TECK) ("Teck") today provided guidance for expected realized steelmaking coal price and an update on volumes for the second quarter ofwww.marketwired.comReply10LLadaNiva$0.09 Preferred ADR dividend coming in August!  At least it will cover my ADR fees for the last three years!  Now, if we can get two or three more quarters of positive earnings, this baby will really start to move.  If you back out FX gains from 1st Q earnings, we could still see a 2018 dividend of around $0.25-$0.30 per ADR unless Met Coal takes a big dive later this year.  Assuming 2nd Q earnings are in line with 1st Q, the Pref. ADR could easily be in the $2.00-$3.00 range.  Meanwhile, those holding the common will be sucking wind for the next several years until the dividend restrictions are lifted by the creditors which could be a long way off.MoreReplyReplies (7)40LLadaNivaWish this company would provide more transparent disclosures.  Unless I missed something, they have yet to say whether any of the creditor agreements have prohibitions on the company paying Preferred Dividends according to the 20% of net profit terms of the shares.  I'm fairly certain there are dividend restrictions on the common shares but haven't seen anything disclosed about the pref. share dividends.  Likewise, it would have been good to know the specific terms of the Elga sale to Gazprom since the terms themselves have a material impact on the company's valuation.  Guess the lack of transparency is part of the the price we pay to hold the shares but it's frustrating they don't provide basic disclosures about material issues.MoreReplyReplies (5)00IInvestrmanEarnings out. OK but overall revenues below 2016Q4 still.

By far the best Russian company I have ever held.@@@April 28, 2017 Moscow – The Board of Directors of PJSC «MMC «Norilsk Nickel», one of the largest refined nickel and palladium producer in the world, has recommended for the Annual General Meeting of shareholders approval the dividend payment for the full financial year 2016 in the amount of RUB 446.10 per ordinary share (approximately USD 7.83 at the RUB/USD exchange rate the Russian Central Bank as of 28.04.2017).ReplyReplies (4)00bblackoutbuzzFY16 turned a profit but MTL may not pay a dividend to preferred shareholders, contrary to its charter, due to new covenants on restructured debt.@@@Oleg Korzhov So answering this question, I would say that the size of the dividends on the preferred stock is about 25% from the net profit under the annual consolidated IFRS report. Now whether we’re going to allocate this to the dividends or not is not yet clear. It depends upon several factors. First of all, it has to be approved by the shareholders meeting. Secondly, we do have other limitations. It is correctly stated in paying dividends under the covenants with the bank, we’re not going to be able to pay that without receiving an approval from the banks.MoreReply10IInvestrmanAnnual Earnings Missed Consensus (Year ending 12/2016)	Next Earnings AnnouncementAnnual Non-GAAP earningsAnnounced April 26, 2017	-$0.76	Annual Consensusof 1 analysts	$0.36	Difference fromconsensus	-147.37%2017 Earningswill announce	(Unconfirmed) July 25, 2017MoreReply03BBoyplunger.comDebbie...

S&P Global Platts assessed Premium Low Vol FOB Australia up $58.50/mt, or 32%, to $241/mt FOB Australia Wednesday, the largest daily rise since the assessment began in 2010, and greater than the $35/mt hike on January 14, 2011, caused by Cyclone Yasi. "The [premium coking coal] market is going berserk," one source said, with "all traditional market players hunting for cargoes." The source said Wednesday evoked memories of Cyclone Yasi in 2011. The source indicated BHP's declaration of force majeure was an important signal and trigger that sent global steelmakers scrambling for non-Queensland met coal supply. This followed force majeures declared by Yancoal, Qcoal and Jellinbah Group. One steelmaker said that while other miners had not publicly declared force majeure, they had already declared it on a "cargo-by-cargo basis." Firm market demand was reflected by the flurry of spot trades for met coal from several swing suppliers -- Canada, the US, Russia and China -- for a wide spectrum of products. The buyer pool also appeared to be diverse, with Northeast Asia, India and Europe all understood to have purchased cargoes. GLOBAL SUPPLY SHORTAGE The wide geographical range of trades points to the global magnitude of the supply shortage faced by the market. This was reflected in bid indications from end-users Wednesday. The highest indicative bid was $240/mt FOB Australia for premium HCCs by a large international steelmaker. Another international steelmaker saw a price range of $200-$250/mt FOB Australia as a bid indication due to a scarcity of resources. Mirroring these bid indications were trades done, or very close to being done. One was for a premium coal of Australian origin re-exported from Chinese ports at $240/mt FOB China. The volume was said to be 60,000 mt. Another was Chinese premium HCC with CSR over 70% at above $260/mt FOB China, for 60,000 mt for an April laycan. "The price is high because there are no coals," a market source said. A steelmaker said: "Some of our shipments have been canceled. The problem [shortage] is real." Other premium HCCs were also traded, with more than two trades of Canadian coal, though all on a floating price basis. In the second-tier segment, there were no trades being done, but a sell-side source indicated he would increase his offer price by $13/mt day on day for non-Australian HCC with 55-60% CSR. There was a spot offer for US coal with 62-63% CSR, 29-30% VM and 0.9% sulfur at $205/mt CFR India. This was for a Panamax cargo for an April 10-20 laycan. In the semi-soft market, a supplier raised his offer by $35/mt day on day to $130/mt for 39-40% VM, 5-6% ash coal, saying inquiries had now risen. "We're expecting some inquiries from China, and there have been ones from India and Japan. There just isn't much coal available," he said. One major Asian steelmaker said he would bid $130/mt for 36-39% CSR, 34-36% VM semisoft coal. The PCI market, in contrast, saw the smallest uptick. A spot trade was done for Russian material with 19-21% VM, below 10% ash, 0.3-0.5% sulfur and around 65-75 HGI at around $125/mt CFR India, for an April 5-15 laycan.MoreReplyReplies (1)30IInvestrmanRight now after what Mr. Putin said last night, siding with Assad, I feel there will be a global boycott against Russian in many ways...I can't believe Putin would support this #$%$ who gasses own people, just to keep business product sales up between the two Nations...ReplyReplies (2)11Show More63,000 people have canceled their Tesla Model 3 ordersBusiness InsiderStart Living The Millionaire LifestyleTorOptionSponsored'Don't put that guy in front of the cameras again': Fox News host unloads on Stephen Miller after altercation with CNN reporterBusiness InsiderYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

Mechel PAO's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Korzhov commented on the 2Q2016 operational results:


                                        








"In this accounting period, the coal industry demonstrated stable demand on both global and domestic markets, with a growth registered in both quarter benchmarks and spot prices. In 2Q2016, China remained the market's chief driver, and showed an increased demand for coal in the second quarter due to the decrease of local production. This year, Chinese authorities announced plans to close down unprofitable facilities which produce a total of up to 250 million tonnes a year. According to analysts, about a third of this volume has already left the market. Accordingly, imports took the place of these unprofitable producers, especially as far as coking coal was concerned.


                                        








"Mechel put this market situation to good use. We increased overall mining by 4% and redirected some of our chief product — coking coal concentrate —to China, increasing our sales to this country nearly by half quarter on quarter. We also made several coking coal shipments to India and Vietnam, which are new markets for us.


                                        








"PCI sales went down by 21% largely due to our running out of stock, which was entirely sold to Asia in the previous quarter due to the price dynamics we found comfortable for us. Today we consider PCI sales to South Korea as per our long-term contracts as a priority.


                                        








"The 16-percent increase in anthracite sales was due to a favorable price situation in Europe (Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium). Besides that, the seasonal increase of agglomerate production at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant had its impact on the increase of demand for anthracite in the facility's agglomeration process.


                                        








"Steam coal sales went up by 9% due to an increase in shipments from Elga Coal Complex and Southern Kuzbass Coal Company's facilities. Over 50% of steam coal in this accounting period was exported to China.


                                        








"Coke sales went up by 5% in 2Q2016 due to an increase in domestic demand. It is important to note that we have resumed shipping coke to the United States in this accounting period.

In 2Q2016, China remained the market's chief driver, and showed an increased demand for coal in the second quarter due to the decrease of local production. This year, Chinese authorities announced plans to close down unprofitable facilities which produce a total of up to 250 million tonnes a year. According to analysts, about a third of this volume has already left the market. Accordingly, imports took the place of these unprofitable producers, especially as far as coking coal was concerned. "Mechel put this market situation to good use. We increased overall mining by 4% and redirected some of our chief product - coking coal concentrate -to China, increasing our sales to this country nearly by half quarter on quarter. We also made several coking coal shipments to India and Vietnam, which are new markets for us."PCI sales went down by 21% largely due to our running out of stock, which was entirely sold to Asia in the previous quarter due to the price dynamics we found comfortable for us. Today we consider PCI sales to South Korea as per our long-term contracts as a priority."The 16-percent increase in anthracite sales was due to a favorable price situation in Europe (Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium). Besides that, the seasonal increase of agglomerate production at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant had its impact on the increase of demand for anthracite in the facility's agglomeration process."Steam coal sales went up by 9% due to an increase in shipments from Elga Coal Complex and Southern Kuzbass Coal Company's facilities. Over 50% of steam coal in this accounting period was exported to China."Coke sales went up by 5% in 2Q2016 due to an increase in domestic demand. It is important to note that we have resumed shipping coke to the United States in this accounting period."The steel division increased production quarter-on-quarter - steel production went up by 2%, pig iron by 3%. I would like to note that we have moved forward in implementing our strategy aimed at boosting our share in the high-margin product market, which resulted in billet sales decreased by 41%. This year Mechel supplied Russian Railways with over 120,000 tonnes of rails, and we plan to bring this volume up to 220,000-250,000 tonnes by the year's end. "In 2Q2016, domestic sales of flat rolls saw an insignificant decrease of 2%. At the same time, in the regions where our European steel trade network Mechel Service Global is present, we see a growth in demand for this type of product and we plan to expand our client base in the future."The five-percent increase in long rolls sales in 2Q2016 quarter-on-quarter was due to a seasonal hike in demand for rebar and other products from construction companies. Opening new Mechel Service offices in Northern Caucasus and Volga Federal Districts had a positive impact on our sales dynamics. "Sales of Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant's ferrosilicon to the Group's enterprises and third parties went down by 14% due to some shipments being put off until the third quarter, while ferrosilicon production maintained the same level."The nine-percent increase in hardware sales in 2Q2016 was due to Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant's efficient work with its clients and an increase in sales of wire ropes for energy, mining and oil industries, partly replacing import goods, as well as an expansion of our market through shipments to other CIS states."Our power division in the second quarter decreased electricity generation by 22% quarter-on-quarter. This decrease is due to planned repairs and equipment reconstruction at Southern Kuzbass Power Plant. The 55-percent decrease in heat generation is due to seasonal factors as the heating period drew to a close." ***Mechel PAO Ekaterina Videman Tel: + 7 495 221 88 88 ekaterina.videman@mechel.com***Mechel is an international mining and steel company which employs over 67,000 people.

		Mechel PAO  (NYSE:MTL)   Graham Number: $N/A (As of Mar. 2017)




=GURUF("NYSE:MTL","Graham Number")





Graham Number is a figure that measures a stock's fundamental value by taking into account the company's earnings per share and book value per share. The Graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock. According to the theory, any stock price below the Graham number is considered undervalued, and thus worth investing in.
As of today, the stock price of Mechel PAO is $4.78. Mechel PAO's graham number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 was $N/A. Therefore, Mechel PAO's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is N/A.
Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Calculation
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
Mechel PAO's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2016 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5* Tangible Book per Share *EPS without NRI)


=sqrt of (22.5*-25.468*0.604401142281)

Mechel PAO's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book per Share*EPS without NRI (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5**1.69024021502)


=N/A

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
Mechel PAO's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Mar. 2017 )


=4.78/N/A


=N/A



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
		1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
		2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
		3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.

Our History



Mechel’s history originates with a small company in Kemerovo Region’s town of Mezhdurechensk, which was marketing coal and rolled products domestically and internationally. The company managed to acquire its own production assets – Southern Kuzbass Coal Company, which comprises mining and auxiliary enterprises in Mezhdurechensk area, and Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant in the Chelyabinsk Region. Later, the company was joined by Southern Urals Nickel Plant in the town of Orsk of the Orenburg Region. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant will lend its name to the new company, «Mechel».Southern Kuzbass Coal Company and Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant became the future holding’s heart and the base for its further development. With coal and steel producers melded into one production chain, the company could grow, build efficient production and benefit by the synergy. That synergy became the basis for further asset consolidation and development of Mechel Group.20162015201420132012201120102009 2008 2007 2006 2005 20042003 and earlier2016In January 2016, Urals Stampings Plant produced a batch of stainless steel forgings for the icebreaker flagship in the 22220 project.

The settlement for shift personnel will provide space for 3,000 residents and include a public center and five residential areas. It is a key point for the large-scale development of the Elga deposit.
In June, Mechel won the auction for the subsoil license for Pionerskoye iron ore deposit, located in the Neryungri Region in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Prospective additional reserves are estimated at 750 million tonnes of ore. The deposit also has dolomite reserves, which can be used to produce refractories.
As part of developing Elga Coal Complex, in summer 2011  a three-party contract was signed between Mecheltrans Vostok OOO, Sinara-Transport Machines OAO, and VTB Leasing OAO for development, production and delivery of TEM-8 type locomotives. The locomotives we are leasing will be used on the 315-kilometer Ulak-Elga rail branch, which links Mechel Group’s Elga Coal Complex with the Baikal-Amur Mainline.
A new converter # 2 in Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s oxygen-converter shop was launched, which  was the first stage in the complex reconstruction program for Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s oxygen converter shop. Once the program is completed, the shop’s steel annual output will go up by 950,000 tonnes to a total of 4,550,000 tonnes.
In July, Yakutugol Holding Company OAO’s Nerungrinskaya washing plant processed 783,000 tonnes of coking coal and produced 536,000 tonnes of concentrate and 197,000 tonnes of middlings. This is the highest monthly result the plant achieved in its 26-year history.
In August, Trade Port Posiet reached record transshipment results in its history. The record was achieved due to improvements in the port’s technical support made within the framework of the large-scale modernization program which includes technical re-equipment and expansion of the port’s infrastructure, aimed at increasing the port’s annual coal transshipment capacity to 9 million tonnes.
In September, as part of implementing plans to expand into new markets, the company announced the creation of Mechel Somani Carbon Private Limited, India, set up jointly with India’s Somani Group. The joint venture will handle distribution of metallurgical coals on the Indian market. The project’s distribution area will be located on India’s east coast, 20 kilometers from India’s major port of Vizag, in an industrially developed region. Creation of this joint venture led to a significant increase in the number of metallurgical coal customers in India.
As part of reconstructing its smelting production, in October 2011 the company launched an experimental industrial complex to produce ferronickel including a 12 MW electric furnace at Southern Urals Nickel Plant. The program is aimed at increasing production efficiency, lowering production costs and dramatically reducing the volume of waste released into the atmosphere. Once the complex is launched, the plant will use a new technology for producing ferronickel by smelting in electric furnaces, which has no analogies in the world.
As part of the long-term environment protection program Mechel is implementing at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, a biochemical cleaning facility to treat phenolic waste water was launched at Mechel-Coke in October 2011. The new facility employs the method of neutralizing waste water by applying special complexes of phenol-destroying microorganisms, which break waste into water and carbon dioxide. This technology allows the company to thoroughly cleanse its emissions of phenols, thiocyanates and ammonium nitrogen and ensures higher neutralization efficiency.
On November 28, 2011 Mechel signed a long-term partnership agreement with BelAZ OAO during the session of the Supreme State Council of the Union State of Russia and Belarus held on the level of heads of state. The long-term partnership agreement provides for supplies of BelAZ-produced mining dump trucks to Mechel’s enterprises, supplies of spare parts for those trucks, setting up production of cargo platforms for BelAZ mining dump trucks at Mechel’s plants, and certification of a Mechel subsidiary as one of BelAZ’s service centers in the Russian Federation.
According to the results of a contest held by the information and publishing service Metallosnabzhenie I Sbyt supported by the Russian Union of Steel Product Suppliers and the International Industrial Exhibition Metal-Expo’2011, the Mechel Service service and sales network was acknowledged a winner in the nomination for the Best Federal Sales Network.
In December 2011, based upon the Cbonds news agency’s analysis, Mechel won the top place in the Best Primary Placement for Domestic Bonds nomination for the placement of the 17-19 series debentures with a maturity of 10 years and a put option in five years. This is proof of the high level of trust that investors have for the company’s financial policy.
In December, Mechel reported the launch of the blooming concaster #5 at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s oxygen converter shop. The blooming concaster #5 with an annual capacity of one million tonnes is due to supply the universal rolling mill with top-quality continuously-cast billets. The estimated funding for the complex, including the blooming concaster #5, the ladle furnace # 4 and the vacuum degasser, totals some 189 million dollars.
In December, Mechel also announces the launch of the reconstructed coke-oven battery #5 at Mechel Mining OAO’s subsidiary Mechel-Coke OOO. The battery’s annual capacity is 470,000 tonnes of coke. Once the battery reaches full load, Mechel-Coke will produce over 3.1 million tonnes of coke a year, boosting production by 17%. Reconstruction of coke-oven battery #5’s facilities cost a total of 1.8 billion rubles (some 56.2 million US dollars).
In December, Mechel completed the transaction for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Donetsk Electrometallurgical Plant (DEMZ AO, Ukraine) with annual capacity of 1 million tonnes of steel. The acquisition is valued at $537 million, with payment to be made in installments over 7 years. Acquisition of Donetsk Electrometallurgical Plant is a logical step for the company as we pursue our strong partnership and investment ties with the Ukrainian plant. This is a new level of development for Mechel Group’s steel segment aimed at increasing the Group’s total production volume and, which is particularly important, the share of high margin products in the Group’s product portfolio.
In December, the company finished laying tracks along the entire route of the railway link from Ulak station to the Elga coal deposit. Construction involved laying 321 kilometers of tracks. The railway’s completion is one of the most complicated and important stages in implementing the unique project of developing the Elga coal deposit, which is one of the world’s largest coking coal fields.
In 2011, Mechel produced over 27.6 million tonnes of coal, over 6.1 million tonnes of steel and sold over 12.5 million tonnes of coking coal concentrate, over 4.3 million tonnes of PCI and anthracites, over 6.4 million tonnes of steam coal, over 4.4 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, over 4.5 million tonnes of long and flat rolls, some 1 million tonnes of hardware and melded wire mesh, 16,300 tonnes of nickel, 84,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon, 58,000 tonnes of chrome, some 4 billion KW/h of electricity and over 7 billion Gcal of heat.
Mechel consolidates 30 production enterprises. 2010In April, Mechel acquired Laminorul Braila steel plant, located in south-eastern Romania. The plant manufactures structural shapes of different types: beams, channel bars, equal and unequal angles for industrial, civil and machinery construction. This is the only plant in Romania manufacturing special profile (bulb bar) which is used in shipbuilding.
In July, Mechel acquired Turkish steel trading group Ramateks. The main activity of Ramateks Group is distribution of construction and stainless steel long products as well as other types of steel products. Ramateks storage capacities are located in Istanbul and Konya. The company also has equipment for steel product cutting. The group joined Mechel’s international trade subsidiary Mechel Service Global B.V.
In July, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin launched a fine and stainless steel production complex in the arc-furnace melting shop #6 of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Commissioning of the new complex resulted in improvement of casted steel quality, boost in annual output of slabs from 600 thousand tonnes to 1.2 million tonnes, significant product range expansion and decrease in consumption of raw materials and power. The new equipment not only ensured better quality of products but also enabled the plant to increase output of plates and coils of corrosion-resistant steel grades, competing in quality with the products of the leading European producers, after reconstruction of the plant’s rolling facilities. Such products are not manufactured in Russia, so the complex’s launch allowed Russia to significantly cut down on imports and even exclude them in some cases.
In September, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin commissioned a new electric steelmaking complex at Izhstal OAO. Commissioning of the new facility will mark complete transition of Izhstal OAO to electric furnace steelmaking. This is one of the key stages for the plant’s large-scale technical upgrade program, which provides for renovation of steelmaking complex and modernization of steel rolling facilities of Izhstal OAO. Technical modernization of the plant will result in more effective production, reduced costs, compliance with global quality standards and will allow us to satisfy the demand for specialty steel grades by the automobile, aircraft, aerospace and construction industries. It would also eventually mean more taxes paid to the budgets of all levels, new jobs creation, compliance with the latest safety requirements, and significant reduction of air emissions in the city of Izhevsk.
In September, Mechel OAO signed a loan agreement to finance the universal rolling mill installation project at its Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant.
In November, Mechel has increased its stake in the charter capital of the Toplofikatsia Rousse AD power station up to 100%, from the previously owned stake of 49%. Consolidation of 100% stake in Toplofikatsia Rousse AD was implemented in line with Mechel’s power segment development strategy. It provided new opportunities for realization of electric power in the promising European market and strengthened Mechel’s position in power industry.
In December, Yakutugol OAO passed the mining and transport part of the project documentation that is one of the key components of the construction project for the Elga Coal Complex’s first line.
In December, Mechel’s subsidiary, Mechel Materials OOO launched construction of a complex for Portland blast-furnace slag cement production with 1.6 million tonnes capacity on the premises of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. The commissioning of a grinding-mixing complex is planned for the 2nd quarter of 2012.
In December, the US-based Mechel-Bluestone launched its newest coal processing plant for washing coal mined at the Keystone Operations near Keystone, West Virginia. The K2 plant, worth 12 million dollars in investments, can process annually up to 3 million tonnes of run-of-mine coal. The launch will allow Mechel Bluestone to double its production of low-volatile coking coal.
In December, Mechel launched a new production line for steel electrode copper-coated wire on December 18 at its Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant subsidiary. The commissioning ceremony was attended by Plenipotentiary Presidential Representative in the Volga Federal District Grigory Rapota, President of the Republic of Bashkortostan Rustem Khamitov and Mechel OAO’s Chairman of the Board of Directors Igor Zyuzin.
According to 2010’s results as surveyed by the Prommetiz association, Mechel was acknowledged leader of Russian hardware market. In 2010, Mechel’s hardware enterprises jointly produced more hardware than any other Russian member companies of Prommetiz association.
Mechel comprised about 30 enterprises.
In 2010, Mechel produced 11.5 million tonnes of coking coal concentrate, some 2 million tonnes of other metallurgical coals (anthracites and PCI), over 8 million tonnes of steam coal, over 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, over 3.8 million tonnes of coke, over 6 million tonnes of steel, 868,000 tonnes of hardware, 17,000 tonnes of nickel, 90,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon, 82,000 tonnes of ferrochrome, and over 4,019 billion kWh of electric power.2009 Production plummeted to its worst in the first quarter of 2009. Compared to the same period in 2008, production of coking coal went down by over 75% and of iron ore concentrate by 25%.
Throughout 2009, the situation was steadily improving. In 2009’s third quarter coking coal production more than doubled compared to the second quarter.
Despite hardships, all Mechel enterprises continued working. In February 2009, demand for some of the company’s products grew, which enabled Mechel to increase the plants’ load. For example, steel plants were loaded 70-80%. Despite the crisis, Mechel signed several long-term contracts, such as the five-year agreement to supply South Korea’s Hyundai Steel with coking coal, signed in March.
It is necessary to note that Mechel’s steel plants were in a markedly better position than their counterparts, due to a common well-balanced production chain from raw material production to high value-added products. The most significant issues were being resolved centrally through Mechel’s structure.
However, the company halted most of its investment programs due to the crisis. Those programs were resumed once the market stabilized and in the order of importance for the company’s business.
Despite the crisis, Mechel continued to implement its top priority projects. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant was preparing for the construction of the universal rolling mill. Construction of the spur-track to the Elga deposit continued, as well as reconstruction of Izhstal’s steel-producing facilities which began a year earlier.
Mechel’s own service and sales network proved a major asset during the crisis. A diverse grid of big and small trade departments and subsidiaries, highly professional staff and an extensive client base enabled the company to sell its products even during crisis.
In February 2009, Mechel continued construction of the spur-track to the Elga coalfield. By then, 59 kilometers of the railroad had been repaired. Bridges were built and drainpipes laid along the railroad’s full length, with 24 bridges nearly complete and over 100 drainpipes laid down. A total of over 1,000 road constructors and other machines were involved in the process.
In April, despite the crisis, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant launched the blast furnace #4. The furnace was halted in November 2008 due to revision of production plans and the plant’s production cuts. The furnace’s idling was used to undertake major repairs. The furnace’s reconstruction and other repairs enabled the plant to efficiently meet growing demand for steel and ensure future production volumes in accordance with market needs.
In April, Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant launched a new product – steel ropes manufactured from plastically drafted strands. The lifetime of steel ropes with plastically drafted strands is 1.5 times longer as compared to conventional ropes. Such ropes are used in open mine excavators, in mine hoists, tower and hoisting cranes, in oil production, etc.
Also in April, Mechel signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% shares and interests of U.S. entities Bluestone Industries, Inc. With four mining complexes comprising eight active open pit and five underground mines Bluestone’s coking coal holdings in West Virginia include up to an estimated 725 million tonnes of reserves and resources. The vast majority is premium quality, low volatility hard coking coal suitable for sale to steel producers. With more than 30 customers, Bluestone’s customer base is well-diversified and includes the world’s top coke and steel producers. Bluestone’s assets enabled Mechel to diversify and strengthen its production capacities and expand its geography.
In May 2009, Mechel’s subsidiary Mechel Service OOO launched its own welded mesh production. VR-1 grade wire and cold deformed rebars of 2.8 mm -8.0 mm diameter produced at Mechel OAO’s subsidiaries would be used as feedstock. Construction companies of Moscow and Moscow Region would be the main off-takers of the welded meshes.
Mechel became Russia’s first steel company to resume coke production during the crisis. Periods of forced idling were used for major and routine repairs. In June, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant’s subsidiary Mechel-Coke launched the coke-oven battery #4 which was halted in January 2008 for repairs and then was put on hot standby mode. Also in June, Moscow Coke and Gas Plant commissioned a block of coke-oven batteries..
In December, Prommetiz, a Russian association of hardware producers, released a survey on hardware market development in Russia revealing that in October and November 2009 the two plants of Mechel’s steel segment – Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant ОАО (BMK OAO) and Vyartsilya Metal Products Plant ZAO (VMZ ZAO) jointly produced more hardware than any other Russian member companies of Prommetiz association. Thus, in Q4 2009 Mechel gained the first position in Russia by hardware production volume. On the whole, 2009 became for Mechel the year to restore production to pre-crisis volumes.
Mechel comprised 24 enterprises and 3 trade ports.
In 2009, Mechel produced some 17.8 million tonnes of coal, over 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, over 3.2 million tonnes of coke, some 5.5 million tonnes of steel, 627,000 tonnes of hardware, 16,000 tonnes of nickel, 86,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon, 83,000 tonnes of ferrochrome, some 3.5 billion kWh of electric power.2008 In February 2008, Mechel began constructing a spur-track linking the Baikal-Amur Mainline’s Ulak station with the Elga deposit. Construction is launched as part of developing the promising Elga coal field and implementing the mining segment’s development program. The group planned to launch development of the Elga deposit simultaneously with the rail-link’s construction.
Also in February, Mechel and RZhD OAO (Russia’s Railroad state agency) signed a contract on long-term partnership and supply of Russia’s railroads with rolled products manufactured by Mechel. To honor the agreement, Mechel launched construction of a state-of-the-art universal rolling mill on Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, with the capacity of over 1 million tonnes a year. The new mill will produce high-quality railroad rails up to 100 meters in length and will make Russia one of the few countries that produce high-quality long rails for high-speed and high-loaded railroads.
In April, Mechel announced its acquisition of two Romanian steel plants, Ductil Steel Buzau and Otelu Rosu, the company’s third and fourth steel assets in Romania. Otelu Rosu produces steel and billets, while Ductil Steel Buzau manufactures rolled products and hardware from carbon and low-alloy steel. This acquisition enabled Mechel to continue development of its steel business in Eastern Europe.
In May, Oriel Resources Ltd. joined Mechel, along with its components — Tikhvin Ferroalloy Plant in the Leningrad Region, the Shevchenko nickel deposit and the Voskhod chrome ore deposit.
Mechel announced signing a contract for construction of a new melting complex at Southern Urals Nickel Plant. The contract, which is signed in accordance with the plant’s investment program, provides for a fundamental re-equipment of the plant and includes the design and supply of a 12 MW DC furnace. The 12 MW plant was designed to include the latest proven technology in the field of ferro-smelting and environmental protection. The technology has been designed by employing a holistic process approach to achieve low operating costs and high recoveries along with high levels of reliability.
Also in May, Mechel changed changed its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) to its ordinary share ratio from 1:3 to 1:1. From the date Mechel’s ADRs were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the price of each ADR increased from US$21 to a record high of US$171 in 2008. Following standard market practice, the company decided to increase liquidity of Mechel’s securities and give investors the opportunity to operate in a more customary price range while managing their investment strategies.
In May, Mechel commissioned a new modern ring rolling mill at Urals Stampings Plant. The new machine enabled Urals Stampings Plant to produce rings with an outer diameter of 400-4200 mm and a height of 60-1000 mm. There is high demand for these products from many promising industries, including oil and gas, aircraft, and mechanical engineering.
Also in May 2008, Mechel’s subsidiary Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant won the tender to acquire the rights to utilize the subsoil plot on the Uvatsk deposit of quartzite and quartz sandstones. The deposit is located in the Nizhneudinsk District of the Irkutsk Region, approximately 30 kilometers from the town of Nizhneudinsk, in the interfluvial area between the Kamenka and Uvat rivers. The explored reserves of quartzite in the Uvatsk deposit amount to about 7 million tonnes, with previous estimates indicating the potential for about 120 million tonnes. Quartzite ore is used to produce ferrosilicon, required in manufacturing metal products.
In June and July, two of Mechel’s Romanian assets — Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii — launched new construction reinforcement production lines. The project was consistent with the program of Mechel’s service and sales subsidiary, Mechel Service OOO, aimed at entering the market of custom-made construction reinforcement for Romanian customers.
In July 2008, Mechel’s  Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant (CMP) subsidiary signed a contract with and Danieli, to supply technology and equipment to construct a rail and structural steel mill at CMP.
In August, Mechel announced the reconstruction of steel production lines and modernization of rolling mills at Izhstal OAO. The company’s chief goal was to maintain its leading position as producer of high-quality and grade steel. The reconstruction included closure of the outdated blast furnace production and the plant’s transfer to electric furnaces. Reconstruction was launched without halting production.
Also in August,  Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant completed reconstruction of the last of four systems for gas cleaning. Upgrading from electrical filters to bag collectors was a significant step in the reconstruction and enabled the system to deplete impurities from outgoing furnace top gases by 99.6%.
One of Mechel’s top strategic priorities is to set up a stable resource base for its enterprises. Mechel’s steel production is sourced internally with its own coke made of coking coal mined at the company’s mines and open pits. In September, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant completed major repairs of its coking battery #4. Repairs increased the battery’s capacity by 41 thousand tonnes per year, improved production quality and decreased the environmental impact. Due to this synergy, Mechel can cut production costs, increase its production’s financial and operational stability, and better control its products’ quality.
Also in September, Russia’s President Dmitry Medvedev and Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev officially opened Mechel’s mining and processing plant at the Voskhod chore ore deposit in the Aktyubinsk Region, Kazakhstan. Part the chrome ore concentrate produced by the plant would be consumed by Mechel’s Tikhvin Ferroalloys Smelting Plant. The remaining volume would be marketed in Russia and internationally.
Also in September, Mechel’s service and trade subsidiary Mechel Service acquired a 100% stake in German-based HBL Holding GmbH which comprised 14 service and trading companies in Germany.
In October, Mechel announced signing a contract with Minmetals, one of China’s largest state-owned industrial corporations, to construct the rail and structural steel mill at its Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant OAO subsidiary on a turn-key basis with a tied loan being granted. Minmetals agreed to perform construction of the workshop, installation of the mill’s equipment and commissioning of technologies to be provided by Danieli.
In November, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant and RZhD signed a contract to supply rail products to RZhD OAO from 2010 to 2030.
Despite the looming global economic crisis, Mechel’s enterprises showed stable production results over the first three quarters of 2008. However, with industries such as engineering, automobile and construction cutting down production due to financial crisis, paying demand fell, followed by steel industry’s production volumes. The fall of global steel production led to falling demand for coking coal and decreased ferroalloy production, which in turn created an acute lack of funds. Mechel mapped out anti-crisis measures, with serious saving, cutting down all possible costs and all non-vital expenses, boosting sales departments, refinancing loans. The company’s main goal was to minimize production costs and maintain what operations met existing demand.
Mechel owned 23 enterprises and 3 trade ports.
In 2008 Mechel produced some 26.4 million tonnes of coal, 4.7 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, over 3.3 million tonnes of coke, some 6 million tonnes of steel, over 700,000 tonnes of hardware, 16,000 tonnes of nickel, 84,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon, 58,000 tonnes of ferrochrome, over 4 billion kWh of electric power.2007 In January 2007, Mechel Campia Turzii commissioned new ecological equipment — a press to process neutralized pickling solutions. This technology allowed the plant to give up use of the open slime storage and proved beneficial for the environment.
In March, Mechel Targoviste launched a new concasting machine. By March 2007, Mechel invested over 38 million dollars in Mechel Targoviste. Mechel’s management again proved its ability to transform an unprofitable enterprise and adapt it to survive in a competitive market.
In March 2007, Mechel bought its first major energy generating asset, confirming its intention to make power its separate business division. By winning the auction, Mechel acquired the controlling stake in Southern Kuzbass Power Plant OAO. Mechel bought the power station in a bid to raise the company’s efficiency by acquiring the ability to produce high value-added products, such as electricity, from its own steam coal, cut production costs due to generation of its own electric power, as well as get additional profit by marketing electricity and heat.
In May, Port Posiet commissioned a new 510-meter quay wall and warehouses. The quay wall was built as part of the port’s development program, which aimed at attaining a 9-million-tonne annual cargo turnover. It also included implementation of highly efficient coal reloading equipment and construction of warehouses.
In May Mechel bought, a controlling stake in Kuzbass Power Sales OAO as part of developing Mechel’s power segment. Kuzbass Power Sales is Siberia’s largest power seller. The acquisition allowed Mechel to create a vertically integrated power company which would have its own generators, raw materials and an expansive client base.
In the second half of 2007, Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant commissioned a series of new production equipment. The complex producing high-tensile stabilized reinforcing wire was launched in June, allowing the plant to manufacture a brand new product, low-relaxation stabilized reinforcing wire.
In July, the plant commissioned a new hardware-producing complex and laid the foundation for a new steel wire and cable making complex. These were major events timed to celebrate the plant’s 245th anniversary. The new lines allowed the plant to increase output of cable wire and thin cables, wire for making staples, as well as fibre wire.
In October Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant launched two new drawing machines for spring wire which was already being produced by the plant. The first spring wire production line was commissioned in 2005.
In December, the plant launched a modern equipment complex to produce high-tensile stabilized reinforcing wire strands used in construction. The new complex enabled BMP to manufacture 25,500 tonnes annually of a new type of product - stabilized reinforcing ropes.
In August 2007, Mechel acquired Bratsk Ferroalloy Plant, East Siberia’s largest high-quality ferrosilicon producer. It accounted for 16% of Russia’s internal ferrosilicon market in 2006 and 20% in the first three months of 2007, and 11% of exports in 2006.
Ferroalloys are used by steel producers, including Mechel’s own enterprises. The plant’s inclusion in Mechel Group enabled the company to significantly cut production costs and increase efficiency due to synergy between its raw materials, steel and power segments.
In September, Mechel acquired its third port — the Mechel Temryuk seaport, located on the Azov Sea’s Taman shore. The port would mostly reload coal. It can be used by river-sea type ships that can sail the Black and Mediterranean Seas as well as Eastern Europe’s internal waterways.
The port was acquired as part of constructing a global transport system and expanding the company’s logistics routes. This acquisition gave Mechel more options in regulating supply logistics, including export, minimizing dependence on transport market opportunities and shipping its products directly to its customers without involving third-party agents.
Transport system development is an important priority for Mechel. The company owns a railway operator — Mecheltrans OOO, which has its own gondola cars and a modern service center based in Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant.
In October, Mechel won the auction for Yakutugol’s controlling stake, increasing its share from 25% plus one to 100%, acquiring the Elga coalfield as well. The company paid a record sum of some 2.3 billion dollars for the two assets.
Yakutugol OAO mined a total of 10 million tonnes per annum, mainly coking coal as well as some steam coal. The company’s existing assets had estimated reserves of some 200 million tonnes. The Elga coal deposit’s reserves are set at 2.2 billion tonnes of coking coal. Experts estimated that coal reserves in that region can reach up to 30-40 billion tonnes. With this acquisition, Mechel became owner of Russia’s last coal asset left unprivatized and gained access to a major high-quality coking coal deposit, which created a firm basis for Mechel’s long-term mining development.
In December, Mechel acquired 49% of Toplofikatsia Rousse, a thermal power station based in Rousse, Bulgaria. The deal was part of Mechel’s bid to develop an independent power segment and find new markets for the company’s steam coal.
Mechel comprised 19 enterprises and 3 trade ports.
In 2007, Mechel produced over 21 million tonnes of coal, some 5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, some 3.9 million tonnes of coke, 6.1 million tonnes of steel, over 680,000 tonnes of hardware, over 17,000 tonnes of nickel, some 38,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon, 3.4 billion kWh of electric power.2006 In March 2006, Mechel decided to optimize its capital investment program. The program set aside additional funds for further development and expansion of Mechel’s mining segment. It reflected Mechel’s overall strategy aimed at the segment’s growth, including new acquisitions in the mining sector.
In September, Southern Kuzbass Coal Company commissioned Olzherassk Underground Mine. The new enterprise is rigged with up-to-date mining equipment. The mine’s reserves are estimated at 160 million tonnes of coking coal.
In October 2006, Mechel acquired controlling stake in Moscow Coke and Gas Plant OAO. The deal corresponded with Mechel OAO’s strategy where the mining segment’s development, expansion of the company’s presence in coal and coke markets and increasing synergy were top priorities.
In November, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant commissioned a new coke-oven battery. Once it reached full capacity, the annual coke production would increase by 500,000 tonnes. The battery’s produce is used to manufacture marketable coke, as well as supply Southern Urals Nickel Plant.
In December, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant launched a concasting machine #4. The new aggregate allowed the company to dramatically cut production costs and step up quality of its long products. The machine was part of the plant’s technical re-equipment.
Once the machine reached its full capacity, the share of billets produced by constant casting in Mechel’s plants grew from 30% to 50%.
Mechel comprised 12 enterprises and 2 trade ports.
In 2006, Mechel produced over 17 million tonnes of coal, some 5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, some 2.6 million tonnes of coke, some 6 million tonnes of steel, 611,000 tonnes of hardware, and 14,400 tonnes of nickel.2005 In January 2005, Mechel wins the auction for shares of Yakutugol Holding Company OAO and becomes owner of the controlling stake (25% plus one share). The acquisition fitted well into the company’s overall strategy of reinforcing the mining division and increasing coking coal production. This victory paved the way for the company to expand its interests in the new region. Consolidation of Yakutian assets in late 2007 is a fine illustration to the consistency of Mechel’s strategy.
In April, Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant launched the first agglomachine for the new agglofactory. This increased Mechel’s capacity to meet its requirements in iron ore and allowed the company to boost shipments from Korshunov Mining Plant. The second agglomachine was launched in September.
Mechel wins the auction for the right to use subsoil plots for coking coal exploration and mining of two sites of the Erunakovsk deposit with estimated reserves of 264.6 million tonnes.
Mechel acquired controlling stake in Port Kambarka OAO for some 3.4 million dollars. Port Kambarka, located in Udmurt Republic’s village of Kama, is one of Russia’s deepest ports. The port can process river-sea cargo ships not only delivering within Russia, but also bound for Europe through the Baltic and Northern Seas.
In June, Mechel wins the auction for the right to use subsoil plots for coking coal exploration and mining at the Olzherassk, Sibirginsk and Raspadsk deposits. Combined with the plots the company acquired in 2004 and spring of 2005, Mechel increased its coal base by 1.15 billion tonnes.
Mechel comprised 11 enterprises and 2 trade ports.
In 2005, Mechel produced over 15.6 million tonnes of coal, over 4.5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, some 2.6 million tonnes of coke, some 5.9 million tonnes of steel, 557,000 tonnes of hardware and some 12,600 tonnes of nickel.2004In March 2004, Mechel added a transport division to its business by acquiring a seaport. Port Posiet is located on the shores of the Japanese Sea south of Vladivostok on the border of Russia, China and North Korea. It allowed Mechel to optimize its shipments to Pacific Asia. Today the port is used mostly to reload coal concentrate.
In every one of its enterprises, Mechel implements a sweeping program aimed at increasing efficiency and quality, as well as cut production costs. Many enterprises, particularly steel plants, required major renovation of their production facilities.  For instance, in March 2004 Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant launched a blast-furnace after reconstruction which increased its capacity by 50% to 1.5 million tonnes of pig iron per annum, which in turn significantly increased the plant’s production volumes. In May the plant launched a new constant casting machine producing 1 million tonnes of billets a year. The machine allowed the plant to boost production of billets by constant casting from 15% to 30%.
In May Mechel won the auction for 26.9% of Izhstal OAO’s stock. Izhstal is one of Russia’s major producers of rolled products and hardware from specialty steels and alloys. Acquiring Izhstal stock upheld Mechel’s position as Russia’s leading specialty steels and alloys producer. Mechel proceeded to buy up Izhstal’s stock to get a controlling stake, finally acquiring 87.35% of the stock in April 2005. By then, the company was already implementing production-and quality-boosting programs at the plant.
On October 29, 2004, Mechel made the initial public offering (IPO) of 10% of its shares, following a year and a half of intensive and large-scale preparation. The shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which enjoys world-wide prestige and presents the toughest requirements to those who wish to be listed there. As a result of the listing, Mechel managed to attract some 300 million dollars for its stock, which were used for investment, acquisition of new assets and equipment to upgrade its enterprises.
Mechel thus became the first and so far the only coal and steel producer in Russia and Eastern Europe to make its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. The IPO gave Mechel a new impetus. Today Mechel has some 30% of its common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange as well as Russia’s RTS and MMVB. The company’s preferred shares are also circulated.
In November 2004, Mechel wins the auction for the right to use subsoil plots for coking coal exploration and mining at the Sibirginsk and Tomsk deposits. In December, Mechel got licenses for Raspadsk Open Pit and Berezovsk-2 areas, boosting its estimated reserves by 120.5 million tonnes total in the course of a month.
In December, Mechel sold its stock in Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant.
The company comprised 9 enterprises and 1 trade port.
In 2004, Mechel produced over 15.6 million tonnes of coal, some 3.9 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, some 3 million tonnes of coke, 6.2 million tonnes of steel, some 600,000 tonnes of hardware and 12,700 tonnes of nickel.2003 and earlier2003
As part of preparation work for the IPO, on March 19, 2003 the managing company of the newly created holding was registered and had all assets transferred to its balance. It was named Mechel OAO, and that date became Mechel’s official birthday. The company became one of Russia’s first holdings to unite steel and mining assets. Mechel’s creation was also a crowning moment for longstanding partnerships that linked its assets. Cooperation between coal, mining, hardware and steel producers allowed the company to consolidate resources and production sites, minimize dependence on external sources of raw materials and market stability. Those things proved Mechel’s recipe for success.
In April 2003 the company acquired Urals Stampings Plant in Chelyabinsk Region, Russia’s leading producer of stampings from quality steels, heat-resistant and titanium alloys. Cooperation between Urals Stampings Plant and Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant allowed Mechel to develop new promising markets for its products.
In June that same year, the company acquired its second steel plant in Romania, in the town of Campia Turzii. The plant produces a wide range of steel products. Later on, Mechel’s Romanian assets were named for their home towns — Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii respectively.
In September 2003, Korshunov Mining Plant joined Mechel. The plant was bankrupt since 1998, and had to halt production completely in April 2002 as its chief customer refused to pay. Both the enterprise and its staff were faced with lack of customers and so lack of means to survive. This had an immediate impact on the social situation in Irkutsk Region’s town of Zheleznogorsk-Iliymsky, as the city budget was directly dependent on the plant. Strategic partnership with Mechel helped dispel the crisis. Iron ore concentrate produced by Korshunov Mining Plant was since then shipped to the Urals, with Mechel investing in the plant and the town’s social policies. Finally the plant made a settlement with its creditors. The plant made a good addition to the Mechel family and could use the advantages of cooperation between mining and steel plants. Korshunov Mining Plant began increasing production levels and launched a large-scale technical revamping program.
In October, the Mechel team acquired a Lithuanian hardware plant, dubbed Mechel Nemunas. The plant produces hardware products — wire, mesh and nails — for domestic market.
By the end of 2003, Mechel owned 7 enterprises.
In 2003, Mechel produced over 14 million tonnes of coal, some 3.5 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate, over 2.7 million tonnes of coke, over 5 million tonnes of steel, some 430,000 tonnes of hardware and some 13,500 tonnes of nickel.
