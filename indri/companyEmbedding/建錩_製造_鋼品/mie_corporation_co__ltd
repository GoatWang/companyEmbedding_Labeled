Products
In the twenty-first century, the Toyota Home business seeks to use the technological capabilities of the Toyota Group to provide consumers with comfortable, earthquake-resistant, and environmentally-friendly homes based on the steadfast conviction of 'truly wanting to make better homes in Japan', a country that experiences frequent earthquakes and has a smaller land mass compared to other developed nations.
In addition to the 'SINCE' series of steel rigid frame unit homes, the leading product since the launch of the housing business, and the 'ESPACiO' series of steel frame homes that can easily be adapted to urban living environments, Toyota Housing entered the steel-frame housing business with a focus on the condominium business and developed flexible construction methods that can respond to customer needs.
The element common to all Toyota home products is the commitment to create homes that can be used comfortably and in harmony with nature indefinitely. Toyota Housing adopted Eco Mirai no Ie as a common name for products that are friendly to the earth, the living environment, and household finances and proactively developed and incorporated advanced environmental technologies.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
See also: Momofuku Ando and Chicken Ramen
It was established in Japan on September 4, 1948, by Momofuku Ando[2] as Nissin Food Products Co., Ltd. of Japan (日清食品株式会社, Nisshin Shokuhin Kabushiki-gaisha) and ten years later introduced the first instant ramen noodle product, Chikin Ramen (Chicken Ramen). They established a US subsidiary Nissin Foods in 1970 and sold instant ramen noodle products under the name Top Ramen. Instant noodles (1958) and cup noodles (1971) were both invented by Momofuku Ando.[3][4] Nissin Foods has its headquarters in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka.[5][6]
Recent years and expansion[edit]
The company moved to its current headquarters in 1977, when the construction of the building was completed.[7]
Nissin Foods are also Purveyors to the Imperial House of Japan.[citation needed]
In 2007, Myojo Foods Co., Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissin Foods.[8]

 Nanyo Complex Tosoh was established in 1935 in Yamaguchi prefecture, on a site which has been expanded and is called the Tosoh Nanyo Complex-a sprawling 3.7 million square meter facility, that is today one of Japan's largest fully integrated chemical manufacturing complexes. The Complex boasts the largest in-house generating facility in Japan, capable of generating up to 829,000 kilowatts of electricity. Moreover, Tosoh's own port facility is capable of handling 48,000-ton cargo ship. Here at the complex, Tosoh initially began producing soda ash; later expanding its production line to include such products as caustic soda, chlorine and chlorine derivatives such as VCM, PVC, chloroprene rubber, and ethylene amines, among others.
