    About Us                        Mukand Iron & Steel Works Limited, re-christened ‘Mukand Ltd.' on and from March 23, 1989, was registered on November 29, 1937.

They did so after some persuasion, in 1939.The Steel Plant at Kalwe commenced operations in 1965. A structural shop, later re-christened ‘Machine Building Division' was also set up at Kalwe by the same year. The Company established its leadership in the two businesses, steel and machine building, fairly quickly.The history of Mukand Ltd is the history of its resilience, continual renewal and resurgence.                       Mukand Ltd.'s leadership in steel technology is built on a long history of pioneering, kept alive by adaptive absorption of advanced technology's sustained in-house research and development.Mukand Ltd. was India's first steelmaker to successfully adopt the ‘continuous billet casting' technology using ‘F' type continuous casting machine, when this technology was in its infancy in the West.Mukand Ltd. was the first in India to successfully adopt the vacuum oxygen decarburisation technology for the manufacture of stainless steel.
