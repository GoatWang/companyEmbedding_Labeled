    MOSCOW, Feb. 1, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mechel OAO (NYSE:MTL), one of the leading Russian mining and metals companies, announces the appointment of a new Managing Director of Izhstal OAO (Izhstal), part of Mechel Group.  Konstantin Kretov, 48, was appointed Managing Director of Izhstal effective February 1, 2011. He succeeds Valery Moiseyev, who managed the plant since 1992 and who will continue to oversee the plant's operations as Chairman of Izhstal's board of directors.  UK Mechel Steel's General Director Andrei Deineko noted that "Valery Moiseyev has been working at Izhstal for nearly 40 years, including 18 years managing it. With him at the helm, the plant overcame the difficult years of economic reforms in the 1990s, having preserved its potential in production and personnel, as well as its status as a specialty and stainless steel rolled products manufacturer. In recent years, the plant invested much effort in boosting the production of high value-added products. Based upon 2010 operational results, Izhstal's production topped pre-crisis levels. Also, under Valery Moiseyev's leadership the company successfully implemented a full-scale project for reconstruction of steel-making lines and continued to upgrade its rolling mills. These measures raised the company to a new level of technological sophistication."  Regarding Mr. Moiseyev's new role, Mr. Deineko commented, "As Chairman of Izhstal OAO's board of directors, Valery Moiseyev will now concentrate on dealing with strategic issues – that is the task we have today for this talented manager."  With respect to Mr. Kretov's assumption of the position of Managing Director, Mr. Deineko said, "Valery Moiseyev has set a very high standard in administrating the plant. I am sure that Konstantin Kretov will successfully continue this work. He has a great deal of practical experience in steel production, and proved to be a skillful specialist and an experienced manager."

Russia's Mechel says Q1 steel, coking coal output gained



Singapore (Platts)--13 Apr 2011 203 am EDT/603 GMT




Russian steel and mining group Mechel produced 1.59 million mt of crude
steel in the first quarter of 2011, up 11% from the same period in 2010,
thanks to the launch of new production facilities, the company said Wednesday.     Mechel increased production for almost all of its products, it said in
its latest operational report.      The launch of a new electric steelmaking complex at Izhstal OAO and a new
high-quality and stainless steel production complex at Chelyabinsk
Metallurgical plant in 2010 enabled Mechel to boost steelmaking and
billet-making capacities, the company said.     Long products output rose 9% year on year to 913,000 mt in Q1 2011, and
flat products by 29% to 132,000 mt.

     "Due to the launch of new facilities, production of steel, steel alloy
electrode and high-strength wires, as well as regular wire, was increased in
particular," Mechel general director Yevgeny Mikhel said. "Output of forgings
and stampings exceeded last year's figures by 24% and 38% respectively, due to
high demand both on domestic and international markets."       Meanwhile, coking coal production reached 3.1 million mt during the
quarter, up 31%, despite the temporary halting of the coking coal washing shop
of Yakutugol's Nerungrinsk washing plant due to the collapse of three
thickeners. Two of the three washing lines have subsequently resumed, it said.     Anthracite and PCI output rose 37% to 496,900 mt.     Mechel's Southern Kuzbass OAO unit has "fully mastered the technology of
preparing high-quality mixes of PCI coals which enabled the plant to increase
production by 87%," Mikhel added.     Iron ore production totaled 916,000 mt, chrome ore 61.4 mt, nickel 4.3
mt, ferrosilicon 22.8 mt and ferrochrome 23.5 mt.     Coke and pig iron production slipped, meanwhile. Mechel produced 931,800
mt of coke, down 2.4%, and 1 million mt of pig iron, down 3.7%.     Separately, the company said in a note Wednesday the Justice family will
sell part of its preferred shares in Mechel OAO, obtained as part of the sale
of the US Bluestone coal asset to the Russian group.      The offer comprises up to 26 million of the preferred shares to Russian
and international investors and Mechel has applied for admission of the
securities to trade without listing on the Russian Trading System exchange and
on MICEX, it said.--Julien Hall, julien_hall@platts.com--Hector Forster, hector_forster@platts.com

AbstractThe influence of the temperature and time of softening thermocyclic annealing on the morphology and size distribution of carbides in high-speed steel is investigated. It is established that hot plasticity is facilitated by globular microstructure, when round carbides are uniformly distributed throughout the ferrite matrix. Thermocyclic treatment of high-speed steel creates a structural state with desirable carbide morphology. For maximum effectiveness, thermocyclic treatment is combined with holding at maximum and minimum temperatures. Research permits the development of thermocyclic treatment of hot-rolled high-speed steel bar in industrial chamber furnaces.Original Russian Text © S.A. Zinchenko, M.I. Makhnev, P.A.
