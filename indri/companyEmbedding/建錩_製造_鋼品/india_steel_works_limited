JSW Steel Ltd. (BSE: 500228, NSE: JSWSTEEL) The flagship company of over $11 billion JSW Group, JSW Steel is one of India's leading integrated steel manufacturers with a capacity of 18 MTPA. It is one of the fastest growing companies in India with a footprint in over 140 countries. JSW STeel is an Indian steel company owned by the JSW Group based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.[2] JSW Steel, after merger of ISPAT steel, has become India's second largest private sector steel company. The current installed capacity is 18 MTPA.[3] A $11 billion conglomerate, with presence across India, USA, South America & Africa, the JSW Group is a part of the O.P. Jindal Group with strong footprints across core economic sectors, namely, Steel, Energy, Infrastructure, Cement, Ventures and Sports.[4] JSW's history can be traced back to 1982, when the Jindal Group acquired Piramal Steel Limited, which operated a mini steel mill at Tarapur in Maharashtra and renamed it as Jindal Iron and Steel Company (JISCO).[5]
The Group set up its first steel plant in 1982 at Vasind near Mumbai. Soon after, it acquired Piramal Steel Ltd., which operated a mini steel mill at Tarapur in Maharashtra. The Jindals, who had wide experience in the steel industry, renamed it as Jindal Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. (JISCO). Jindal Vijayanagar Steel Ltd. (JVSL) was set up in 1994, with its plant located at Toranagallu in the Bellary-Hospet area of Karnataka, the heart of the high-grade iron ore belt and spread over 3,700 acres (15 km2) of land. It is just 340 kilometres (210 mi) from Bangalore, and is well connected with both the Goa and Chennai Port. In 2005, JISCO and JVSL merged to form JSW Steel Ltd.
JSW Steel has also formed a joint venture for steel plant in Georgia. The Company has also tied up with JFE Steel Corp, Japan for manufacturing the high grade automotive steel. The Company has also acquired mining assets in Republic of Chile, United States and Mozambique.

History[edit]
In 1994, Jindal Vijayanagar Steel (JVSL) was set up with its plant located at Toranagallu in the Bellary-Hospet area in the State of Karnataka, the heart of the high-grade iron ore belt and spread over 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land.[6] over a decade. It also set up a plant at Salem with an annual capacity of 1 million tonne. It is on the threshold of a major expansion plan of adding 3.2 million tons per annum to its at Vijayanagar Plant to achieve 11 MTPA by 2011. It has established a strong presence in the global value-added steel segment with the acquisition of a steel mill in US and a Service Center in United Kingdom. JSW Steel has also formed a joint venture for setting up a steel plant in Georgia. The Company has further acquired iron ore mines in Chile and coal mines in USA & Mozambique.The current manufacturing capacity of company is 18 MTPA. [7] In Aug 2014, it acquired Welspun Maxsteel Ltd in a deal valued at around 1,000 Crores.[8] JSW has already acquired 3 MTPA Hot Rolling Plant in Dolvi maharashtra ( earlier named Ispat Industries Ltd).
Facilities[edit]
Vijayanagar Works[edit]
India’s first 12 MTPA steel plant at single location, “the fastest growing steel plant in India”. The JSW Steel Vijayanagar plant is the first integrated steel plant to reach 12 MTPA capacity in a single location. It is the first in India to use the Corex technology for hot metal production.Now other steel plants are coping the same.
The first hot strip mill at Vijayanagar was commissioned in 1997. Since then it has grown exponentially and now has an installed capacity to produce 12 MTPA of steel. Located at a remote village Toranagallu part of under developed North Karnataka in the Bellary-Hospet iron ore belt of Karnataka, the fully integrated steel plant, is well-connected with both the Goa,Krishnapatnam,Mangalore and Chennai ports.[citation needed]
Unique features:

Regarded as the world’s Corex showpiece[citation needed]; it was the first Greenfield project in India and among the first in the world to have successfully used this technology to produce “green steel”
Houses India’s largest blast furnace and the widest hot strip mill
The only plant in India with pair-cross technology and twin-stand reversible cold-rolling mill
The highest productivity steel plant in India, producing 800-plus tonnes per person per annum
Recognized for its ‘zero-effluent discharge’ status; it reuses more than 95 per cent of process waste
Low carbon footprint as it recycles 96% of coke oven gas for power generation
Uses sophisticated ambient air control infrastructure beyond and has reduced gas flaring to lower levels.

Chairman's Desk






                  The India Steel Limited, Group's strength and the source of its success is our long-term relationship with our customers, suppliers, employees and associates. We strive to not only meet customers' expectations as they have grown accustomed to a standard of excellence from us, but exceed them in every way. We aim to continuously improve our plants, production capacity and service to keep up with and ahead of the industry. As a result, we are always expanding our product range and increasing volumes.
                

                  We bank on stainless steel as the resource of the future. It is an environmentally friendly, recyclable material, and hence light on natural resources as negligible fresh mining is required. The low maintenance, strength and long life of stainless steel make it the preferred material of choice in quality-conscious industries like construction, chemicals, food-processing, electronics and automotive parts.
                




                India is mature in the world stainless steel industry, with ever-increasing product-range
                & capacities. There is a growing pool of skilled labour and technical staff who are capable of managing metallurgical & process parameters of stainless steel. India Steel Works is poised at the forefront of the Indian stainless steel industry, and its strategic location is perfect for capitalizing on this. The plants, located just outside the thriving hub of Mumbai city, are close to the ports, perfect for international shipment, and at the hub of the Indian highway system for domestic transport.
              

                We believe that in staying true to our motto of "Inner Vision. Global Action" we can maintain our relationships with all our stakeholders, grow continuously, and match the world's best in stainless steel.

              At India Steel Works our goal is to achieve Zero Discharge at our plants, and keep our carbon footprint light.
            

              Factories are equipped with primary and secondary treatment systems to capture and clean the fumes generated during steel-making. The waste gases from the melting furnaces and convertor are dedusted in the primary treatment system, and any such gases that escape are captured through the secondary treatment system, which purifies them & finally emits clean air.
            

              Similarly, the fumes generated from the annealing and pickling processes are scrubbed and sent to effluent treatment plants. We have state-of-the-art effluent treatment facilities, which convert the chemical discharge into clean water to be recycled and used in the various processes. The dust generated from the extraction is sent to an independent & certified solid waste management facility for final treatment and disposal.
