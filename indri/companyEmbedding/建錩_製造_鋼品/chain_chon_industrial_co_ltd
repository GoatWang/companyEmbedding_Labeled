The most differences between 316 and 304 are the composition of nickel increased and add manganese in which to improve the acid and corrosion resistance; 316 could be used in more specific environment, such as strong acid and alkali chemical apparatus, construction of higher salinity regions or vessel, etc.SIZE CHARTGRADEAISI 304/316SURFACE2B/NO.4/HLNO.1WIDTH(mm)100012201250150015241000122015001524THICKNESS(mm)0.3mm         0.4mm★★★★★    0.5mm★★★★★    0.6mm★★★★★    0.7mm★★★★★    0.8mm★★★★★    0.9mm★★★★★    1.0mm★★★★★    1.2mm★★★★★    1.5mm★★★★★    2.0mm★★★★★    2.5mm★★★★★    3.0mm★★★★★★★★★4.0mm     ★★★★4.5mm     ★★★★5.0mm     ★★★★6.0mm     ★★★★8.0mm     ★★★★9.0mm     ★★★★10.0mm     ★★★★12.0mm     ★★★★LENGTH(mm)320~6000320~10000Last Update :
