Hyundai Steel Co., Ltd, or HSC (formerly known as Hyundai INI Steel, and before that, Incheon Iron & Steel Co., Ltd.) is a steel making company headquartered in Incheon and Seoul, South Korea, and a member of the Hyundai-Kia Motor Group. Established in 1953, it is the oldest steel making company in Korea.
Hyundai Steel is the world's second largest EAF steel producer. Hyundai Steel produces a wide variety of products ranging from its high quality H-beams to reinforcing bars. Currently, Hyundai Steel operates six factories: in the Incheon, Dangjin, Pohang, Suncheon, Ulsan provinces of Korea and in China's Chungdo province.
In addition to Hyundai Steel, the Hyundai-Kia Motor group includes steel companies such as, Hyundai Special Steel and BNG Steel Co., Ltd. (formerly Sammi Steel Co., Ltd.). Hyundai Steel uses the EAF process to manufacture steel while BNG is cold rolling mills.
Hyundai Steel, in 2004, had purchased the facilities of the defunct Hanbo Steel in Dangjin. They have taken the once rundown steel company and has refurnished and revitalised its facilities to make it one of the most efficient steel plants in Korea. Currently HSC is operating 3 blast furnaces at Dangjin. The total annual capacity of the company reaches 24 million tonnes per annum[2] and the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group will become the only car maker with an in-house steel mill to supply steel sheets for the production of automobiles.
