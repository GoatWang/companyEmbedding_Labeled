ÇEMTAÞ Çelik Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Þ.







History


     ÇEMTAÞ  is a joint stock company organised to operate on a land of 101 thousand square meters in the Bursa Organised Industrial Zone by the merge of industrialists, businessmen, small craftsmen and public entrepreneurs of Bursa city on 27.01.1970 as ,  “Arc Furnace based Qualified Steel Manufacturer “ aiming to manufacture steels in compliance with TS, DIN, AISI, SAE norms and as per specific orders. 
          
     At the very beginning,  number of founder partners were 863, capital amount was 
      15  TL. and as of today, after capital increases, it has approx. 5.000 partners in quantity and  100.975.680 TL. in capital. 
     ÇEMTAÞ, having put steel unit into force on 09.01.1972, applied ingot casting system in the electrical arc furnace possessing a capacity of 30.000 tonnes/year.
     In 1973, our corporation increasing its capital amount to 50  TL. proceeded to investment studies for rolling mill unit. 
     In 1976, upon increase of the company capital to 75  TL., its number of partners increased, as well, and in the year 1976, having completed the investment studies for rolling mill, first product of rolling was achieved at the end of this year. 
     In 1981, ÇEMTAÞ increased its capital amount to 150  TL. and when turned to year 1985, it proceeded to studies for modernisation and renewal of qualified remedying and dire strait removal and this time it raised its capital amount to 1.500 TL. 
     In 1986, the investments were completed, system of mould cast preventing  qualified steel production and spoiling product quality in the last years was left and turned to continuous casting system. So,  production capacity reached to 36.000 tonnes. 
     The administration requiring to be in line with century and to practise modern technology in ÇEMTAÞ re-proceeded to modernisation studies of Steel work when turned to year 1988.
 30 tonnes bottom tapping arc furnace
 30 tonnes ladle furnace
 30 tonnes  vacuum degassing unit 
 Automatic alloy addition system 
 Carbon wire injection unit
 Wire injection unit and 
 De-dusting unit.

     It proceeded to feasibility studies for investments of main unit.
     ÇEMTAÞ raising its capital in 1990 to 18.000  TL. gave acceleration to its investments and the first trial casting process was successfully achieved in November of  1990. 
     ÇEMTAÞ completed its investment by the end of year 1990 in a record time and increased production capacity of steel plant to 130.000 tonnes/ year.  
     In 1991, ÇEMTAÞ raised its capital to 57.600  TL. When turned to 1993, it proceeded to modernisation studies of continuous casting machine of  steel plant.  By means of this investment made under Incentive Certificate , the goal to manufacture steel products which possess specifications required for qualified steels on basis of a system assuring full automatic control, magnetic mixture and slow cooling by a fully closed flow without any human influence was realized.
     During the first half of May in 1995, firstly trial production and later  regular production with full capacity was started. 
     Since current steel production capacity increased in terms of qualified steel supply by the modernisation held in the steel mill, an inevitable   Investment for Modernisation and Enlargement of Rolling Mill was needed which would process by rolling of all billets produced in the steel plant, creating added value, and thus assuring to obtain more qualified products.
     ÇEMTAÞ increased its capital to 288.000 TL. in May of 1997 due to investment of rolling mill calculated to cost 3-3,5 million TL. Furthermore, on 16.06.1997, a meeting of Extraordinary General Committee was held which led to system of registered capital,and within the highest registered capital of 3.000.000, this capital was raised to 1.152.000 TL. in August and to 2.304.000 TL. in November of 1997. 
     Investment for modernisation of rolling mill realized by the incentive certificate on 18.12.1995 was completed by the end of 1998. Within the content of incentive certificate no.56331 of 16.06.1998, investment for environment protection in our plant was processed, which is completed with the de-dusting unit in the steel plant where the most developed technology was used in the first quarter of year 1999. 
     At the Ordinary General Committee for 1998 held on 23.03.1999, upper limit of our corporation’s Registered Capital raised from 3.000.000 TL to 6.000.000  TL, at the Ordinary General Committee for 1999 held on 23.03.2000, it was raised from 6.000.000 TL. to 16.500.000 TL, at the Ordinary General Committee for 2004 held on 29.03.2005 it raised from 16.500.000 TL. to 60.000.000 TL, at the Ordinary General Committee for 2007 held on 04.03.2008, it was raised from 60.000.000 TL. to 190.000.000 TL. The deadline to reach the upper limit of the registered capital has been  extended until the end of 2017 at our 2012 General Shareholder Meeting on March  22. 2013. Recent paid-up and issued capital of our corporation amounts to  100.975.680 TL. 
     Totally about 337 (31.12.2012) people are employed by our steel plant  possessing 153.149 tonnes/year steel production capacity and by our Rolling mill 
equipped with 228.157  tonnes/year capacity of rolling mill production.

     ÇEMTAŞ, is located on a covered area of 101.000 m2 in the Organized Industrial District of Bursa. 

     ÇEMTAŞ, can easily meet the changing requirements of domestic and foreign markets with its high technology and qualified manpower. 

ÇEMTAŞ is a joint stock company organised to operate on a land of 101 thousand square meters in the Bursa Organised Industrial Zone by the merge of industrialists, businessmen, small craftsmen and public entrepreneurs of Bursa city on 27.01.1970 as , “Arc Furnace based Qualified Steel Manufacturer “ aiming to manufacture steels in compliance with TS, DIN, AISI, SAE norms and as per specific orders. 

     At the very beginning, number of founder partners were 863, capital amount was 15 TL. and as of today, after capital increases, it has approx. 5.000 partners in quantity and 100.975.680 TL. in capital. 

     ÇEMTAŞ, having put steel unit into force on 09.01.1972, applied ingot casting system in the electrical arc furnace possessing a capacity of 30.000 tonnes/year.

     In 1973, our corporation increasing its capital amount to 50 TL. proceeded to investment studies for rolling mill unit. 

     In 1976, upon increase of the company capital to 75 TL., its number of partners increased, as well, and in the year 1976, having completed the investment studies for rolling mill, first product of rolling was achieved at the end of this year. 

     In 1981, ÇEMTAŞ increased its capital amount to 150 TL. and when turned to year 1985, it proceeded to studies for modernisation and renewal of qualified remedying and dire strait removal and this time it raised its capital amount to 1.500 TL. 

     In 1986, the investments were completed, system of mould cast preventing qualified steel production and spoiling product quality in the last years was left and turned to continuous casting system. So, production capacity reached to 36.000 tonnes. 

     The administration requiring to be in line with century and to practise modern technology in ÇEMTAŞ re-proceeded to modernisation studies of Steel work when turned to year 1988.

     ÇEMTAŞ completed its investment by the end of year 1990 in a record time and increased production capacity of steel plant to 130.000 tonnes/ year. 

     In 1991, ÇEMTAŞ raised its capital to 57.600 TL. When turned to 1993, it proceeded to modernisation studies of continuous casting machine of steel plant. By means of this investment made under Incentive Certificate , the goal to manufacture steel products which possess specifications required for qualified steels on basis of a system assuring full automatic control, magnetic mixture and slow cooling by a fully closed flow without any human influence was realized.

     During the first half of May in 1995, firstly trial production and later regular production with full capacity was started. 

     Since current steel production capacity increased in terms of qualified steel supply by the modernisation held in the steel mill, an inevitable Investment for Modernisation and Enlargement of Rolling Mill was needed which would process by rolling of all billets produced in the steel plant, creating added value, and thus assuring to obtain more qualified products.

     ÇEMTAŞ increased its capital to 288.000 TL. in May of 1997 due to investment of rolling mill calculated to cost 3-3,5 million TL.

Anfang der 70er Jahre wurde die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ in erster Linie als Stahlwerk gegründet, um so der damals in der Türkei aufgekommenen Nachfrage nach Stahl unterschiedlichster Güten nachkommen zu können. Aufgrund des hier erzielten Erfolges in der Produktion wurde innerhalb kurzer Zeit ein modernes Walzwerk für mittlere Querschnitte gebaut, wodurch das heutige Gesamtunternehmen entstanden ist.

     Die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ liegt im Industriegebiet Bursa („Bursa Organize Sanayi Bölgesi“) auf einer Fläche von 10,1 ha.

     Mit ihrer Erfahrung, der Anwendung der neuesten Technologien sowie dem Einsatz ihrer Belegschaft kann die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ, den sich verändernden Marktanforderungen sowohl im In- als auch im Ausland leicht nachkommen.
Die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ wurde am 27.01.1970 im Industriegebiet Bursa („Bursa Organize Sanayi Bölgesi“) auf einer Fläche von 10,1 ha durch den Zusammenschluss von Industriellen, Geschäftsleuten, kleinen Handwerkern und privaten Investoren aus Bursa als Aktiengesellschaft gegründet. Sie ist ein türkischer „Qualitätsstahlerzeuger, der mit Elektrischen Bogen Ofen arbeitet“ und erzeugt Stahl gemäß den Normen TS, DIN, AISI und SAE sowie als Auftragsfertigung. 

     Die Zahl der Aktionäre, die gleichzeitig Firmengründer sind, belief sich auf 863 und das Firmenkapital auf 15 TL; heute haben wir ca. 5.000 Aktionäre und unser Kapital beträgt nach mehreren Kapitalerhöhungen heute 100.975.680 TL.

     In der Fa. ÇEMTAŞ, die am 09.01.1972 ihr „Stahlwerk“ in Betrieb nahm, wurde das Ingot Gussverfahren in einem Elektrischen Bogen Ofen mit einer Jahreskapazität von 30.000 Tonnen durchgeführt.

     Mit der 1973 vorgenommenen Kapitalerhöhung auf 50 TL begann unser Unternehmen damit, Investitionen das „Walzwerk“ zu tätigen.

     1976 war das Jahr, in dem sich unser Firmenkapital auf 75 TL belief und sich die Zahl der Aktionäre erhöhte; im gleichen Jahr konnte auch die Walzwerkinvestition abgeschlossen werden und zum Jahresende konnte das erste Produkt das Walzwerk verlassen.

     1981 erhöhte die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ ihr Kapital auf 150 TL. Dann, 1985, begann sie mit qualitätsverbessernden Erneuerungs- und Modernisierungsmaßnahmen, die die entstandenen Engpässe beseitigten; hierfür hat sie diesmal ihr Kapital auf 1.500 TL erhöht.

     1986 waren dann alle Investitionen abgeschlossen. Das Ingot Gussverfahren, das in den vergangenen Jahren insbesondere die Erzeugung von Qualitätsstahl eingeschränkt und die Produktqualität gemindert hat, wurde eingestellt. Gleichzeitig ist das Unternehmen zum Stranggussverfahren übergegangen. Auf diese Weise erreichte die Produktionskapazität 36.000 Tonnen.

     1988 hat die Unternehmensleitung, die nicht hinter dem Fortschritt zurückbleiben und stattdessen im Unternehmen ÇEMTAŞ modernste Technologien anwenden wollte, erneut mit der Modernisierung des Stahlwerks begonnen.
• Elektrischer Bogenofen mit einer Kapazität von 30 Tonnen mit Abstich von unten

• Pfannenofen mit einer Kapazität von 30 Tonnen

• Vakuumanlage für die Entgasung mit einer Kapazität von 30 Tonnen

• Automatisches System, mit dem Legierungen hinzugefügt werden

• Kohlenstoff-Injektionseinheit

• Fülldraht-Einheit (Drahtinjektion) und 

• Staubabsaugeinheit


     Im gleichen Jahr hat das Unternehmen mit den Durchführbarkeitsstudien zu den Investitionen in die Haupteinheit begonnen.

     1990 hat die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ ihr Kapital auf 18.000 TL aufgestockt und so ihre Investitionstätigkeiten beschleunigt; im November 1990 wurde der erste Testabstich erfolgreich durchgeführt.

     Ende 1990 hat das Unternehmen Investitionen in Rekordzeit abgeschlossen; das „Stahlwerk ÇEMTAŞ konnte ihre Produktionskapazität auf 130.000 Tonnen pro Jahr erhöhen.

     1991 hat die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ ihr Kapital auf 57.600 TL aufgestockt, um dann 1993 mit der Modernisierung der Stranggussmaschine im Stahlwerk zu beginnen.

     Diese staatlich geförderte Investition ermöglichte die Erzeugung von Qualitätsstahl mit vollautomatischer Steuerung, ohne dass Menschen hätten eingreifen müssen. Gleichzeitig war die Schmelze vollständig geschlossen. Ebenso wurde das magnetische rühren sowie ein langsames Abkühlen gewährleistet. Durch diese Form der Stahlerzeugung wird das Ziel erreicht, ein Stahlprodukt zu erzeugen, das die für Qualitätsstahl geforderten Eigenschaften besitzt.

     In der ersten Hälfte des Monats Mai 1995 wurden zunächst Probeläufe gefahren, um dann auf normale Produktion bei voller Kapazität überzugehen.

     Aufgrund der Modernisierung des Stahlwerks und der Erhöhung der vorhandenen Stahlproduktionskapazität bei der Erzeugung von Qualitätsstahl wurde jetzt eine Investition für die Erneuerung und Modernisierung des Walzwerks notwendig, in dem alle im Stahlwerk erzeugten Knüppel gewalzt und bearbeitet werden konnten. Außerdem konnte hier Mehrwert erzeugt und neue und qualitativ bessere Produkte hergestellt werden.

     Im Mai 1997 hat die Fa. ÇEMTAŞ ihr Kapital auf 288.000 TL aufgestockt, da die für das Walzwerk zu tätigende Investition mit 3 bis 3,5 Millionen TL veranlagt wurde. Auf der am 16.06.1997 abgehaltenen Außerordentlichen Sitzung der Aktionäre Hauptversammlung wurde auf das System des „Eingetragenen Kapitals“ umgestellt. Im August 1997 wurde das Kapital auf 1.152.000 TL und im November 1997 auf 2.304.000 TL aufgestockt - innerhalb einer Obergrenze für eingetragenes Kapital von 3.000.000 TL. 

     Die Investition für die Modernisierung des Walzwerks, die an die Gewährung der staatlichen Förderung vom 18.12.1995 gebunden ist, wurde zum Ende des Jahres 1998 abgeschlossen. Im Rahmen der Gewährung der staatlichen Förderung (Dokument Nr. 56331 vom 16.06.1998) hat unser Unternehmen damit begonnen, innerhalb der vorhandenen Anlagen eine umweltschutztechnische Investition zu tätigen. Auf diese Weise konnte es diese Investition in ein Staubabsaugsystem für das Stahlwerk, das in dieser Hinsicht mit der neuesten Technologie ausgestattet ist, im ersten Quartal 1999 abschließen.

     Auf der am 23.03.1999 abgehaltenen Ordentlichen Sitzung der Hauptversammlung für 1998 wurde die Obergrenze für eingetragenes Kapital für unser Unternehmen von 3.000.000 auf 6.000.000 TL aufgestockt. Auf der am 23.03.2000 abgehaltenen Ordentlichen Sitzung der Aktionäre Hauptversammlung für 1999 wurde die Obergrenze für eingetragenes Kapital für unser Unternehmen von 6.000.000 auf 16.500.000 TL aufgestockt. Auf der am 29.03.2005 abgehaltenen Ordentlichen Sitzung der Aktionäre Hauptversammlung für 2004 wurde die Obergrenze für eingetragenes Kapital für unser Unternehmen von 16.500.000 TL auf 60.000.000 TL aufgestockt. Auf der am 04.03.2008 abgehaltenen Ordentlichen Sitzung der Aktionäre Hauptversammlung für 2007 wurde die Obergrenze für eingetragenes Kapital für unser Unternehmen von 60.000.000 TL auf 190.000.000 TL aufgestockt. Die Frist um die  obere Grenze des registrierten Kapitals zur erreichen wurde bis Ende 2017 bei unserer 2012 Aktionären Versammlung am 22. März 2013 verlängert

Zurzeit beträgt das eingezahlte und beschlossene Kapital unseres Unternehmens 100.975.680 TL.
