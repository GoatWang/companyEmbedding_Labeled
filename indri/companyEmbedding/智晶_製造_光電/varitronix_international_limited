Varitronix International Ltd.



Varitronix International Ltd.Established in 1978 by a group of academics from Hong Kong's universities, Varitronix Ltd. has grown to become one of the world's leading manufacturers of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD). A determination to provide a premium service, as well as a premium product has seen the company grow steadily to the point in 1991 when our associated holding company, Varitronix International Limited, was successfully launched on the Hong Kong stock exchange. 
From the outset Varitronix has been a research-driven company, working with customers to develop advanced LCD products for a broad range of markets,including sophisticated commercial, industrial, medical and military display products. These products range from simple LCD displays to complete turnkey assemblies for many of the worlds leading OEM manufacturers. The emphasis on providing products of the highest quality was instrumental in Varitronix gaining ISO 9001 certification in March 1995.Product line includes: Standard & Custom Graphic, Dot-Matrix, LCD Glass, Modules and Turnkey Systems. We offer the latest technologies in: Twisted-Nematic (TN), High-Twist (HTN), Super-Twist (STN), Extended-Temp. STN, Black & White Film-Compensated STN, Double STN, Guest-Host, Heilmeier Displays and Touch-Sensitive Screen.
