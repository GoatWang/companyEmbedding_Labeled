SSFC has a corporate vision of becoming a high tech PET manufacturer with sustainable growth and development. We have thus introduced and established manufacturing lines for key materials needed by the TFT-LCD industry, and committed ourselves to the developments of various optical films. We are working extensively with partners around the world in order to extend our value chain to secondary industries of optical films and optical film components, investing in the establishment of Ubright Optronics, Tacbright Optronics, and Shinbright Optronics.
Of these, Ubright Optronics Corporation has solid R&D and production teams with capabilities that include ultra-precise cutting, micro-replication technology, UV film formulation development, and optical designs. We shall continue to expand these technical foundations and dedicate ourselves to the development of new optronic components and products.
Shinbright Optronics Corporation is a downstream facility with precision film coating manufacturing lines equipped with wet-process machinery to give the final optical film product.
Tacbright Optronics Corporation is a producer and dealer of TAC (triacetylcellulose) optical films, a key upstream material for the development and manufacturing of liquid crystal displays (LCDs).

Abstract

‘Global and China Optical Film Industry Report, 2012’ of ResearchInChina chiefly
 covers the following:


1. Downstream market of optical film
 2. Optical film industry
 3. BLU industry and market
 4. Major players of polarizer, optical film for BLU and ITO film


 Optical film covers 3 categories: polarizer, optical film for BLU, and ITO
 film for touch screen. The total market scale is about USD 11.194 billion in
 2012, among which, the polarizer market scales about USD 7.728 billion, down
 2% from last year.


 Polarizer market shows very high concentration and stability, and top six
 major players occupy above 96% of the market. The top three players are Nitto
 Denko, Sumitomo Chemical and LG Chem, followed by Chi Mei Materials of Chi Mei
 Group, BenQ Materials of BenQ Group, and Samsung Cheil Industries of Samsung
 Group.


 The key for polarizer business lies in the supply of raw materials, mainly
 including TAC and PVA. TAC, also as a main material of film, is monopolized by
 Fujifilm and Konica Minolta, with market share of about 72% and 26%
 respectively. Since the new production line of Konica Minolta was put into
 production in 2010, the market share of Konica Minolta has increased rapidly
 to 26% from 19%. PVA is nearly monopolized by Kuraray. These upstream
 manufacturers are big enterprises with revenue of above USD 3 billion. TAC
 business accounts for about 5% of Fujifilm's total revenue. TAC and PVA are
 not main products of these manufacturers, therefore, these big manufacturers
 have the strength to reduce the prices and put pressure on new entrants.


 The market scale of optical film for BLU is about USD 2.938 billion in 2012,
 down 9.9% from 2011, mainly due to the drastic decline of DBEF sector. Optical
 film generally covers 6 categories:


1. Reflective Film, Reflector
 2. Diffuser Film
 3. Normal Prism
 4. Multi-Function Prism
 5. Micro Lens Film
 6. Reflective Polarizer, Dual Brightness Enhancement Film (DBEF)


 Early LCD BLU took CCFL as light source, and used four optical films,
 including two reflective films, one BEF, and one diffuser film. Combination of
 BEF and diffuser film, as current development trend, can reduce cost, decrease
 BLU thickness, and shorten BLU production process. In the wake of high LED
 price in early 2011, manufacturers reduced LED usage and adopted expensive
 DBEF to compensate for the deficiency caused by less LED usage. However, as
 the price of high-brightness LED slumped in the second half of 2011,
 manufacturers have increased LED chip usage or adopted high-brightness LED
 chip, significantly reduced DBEF usage, and substituted cheap micro lens film
 for DBEF.


 Because the threshold of BLU optical film business is very low, numerous
 manufacturers are faced with fierce price competition. Only by strengthening
 cooperation with upstream enterprises, can a manufacturer gain a stable
 foothold. PET film is a key material of BLU optical film, and is controlled by
 big petrochemical plants, such as Mitsubishi Plastics, Toray Industries,
 Teijin DuPont Films Japan, Toyobo, SKC, Toray Advanced Materials Korea, Kolon,
 Nan Ya Plastics, Shinkong Materials Technology, most of which are Japanese
 enterprises. Optical film performance depends heavily on raw materials.
 Another material of optical film is protection film, which is mainly
 controlled by Japanese manufacturers, such as Fujimori Kogyo, Osung Lst, Youl
 Chon Chemical, Sun A Kaken, Nitto Denko, Lintec. Japan is not only an
 electronic power, but also a chemical giant, and there is a gap between South
 Korea and Japan. The chemical industry of Taiwan region lags far behind South
 Korea.


 ITO film is mainly applied to touch screens. GFF and G1F touch screens need to
 use ITO film. The market growth rate hits 20% in 2012. GG, INCELL and ONCELL
 touch screens occupy the high-end market, but GFF and G1F touch screens, being
 cheaper and slightly thinner, though less transparent, occupy the mid and
 low-end market. Moreover, tablet PCs under 10-inch prefer G1F touch screens,
 such as Samsung Galaxy Tab and newest Apple iPad Mini. Japan's Nitto Denko has
 monopolized the market of ITO film for capacitive touch screen.
