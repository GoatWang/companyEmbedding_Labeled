 The MicroSmart PLC has a built in RJ45 serial port selectable by the user for either
            RS232C or RS485 communications. A plug-in cartridge adds an additional 
            RS232C/RS485 port. The serial port supports the Modbus User and RTU protocols. 


  
Replaceable Battery

 
 The MicroSmart PLC’s battery can be easily replaced. Warning of low battery level
            is provided both at the CPU via an LED, and through a special data register which can 
            be used to trigger an alarm on the HMI or send an email alert. 


  
Digital and Analog Cartridges solution

 
 Each analog cartridge has two analog I/O points, either two inputs or outputs.  Whereas digital cartridge has four inputs or outputs. This makes the MicroSmart FC6A an ideal solution for applications requiring minimal digital or analog I/O in a compact form allowing space-saving and cost effective. 


  
Easy to expand Communication Ports

 
 One communication cartridge can be added to the MicroSmart PLC 16 and 24 I/O
            models, and two communication cartridges can be added to the MicroSmart PLC 40 I/O 
            model. Each cartridge has one serial port. 


  
Up to 15 Expansion Modules without limitation

 
 Up to 12 expansion modules can be added to the MicroSmart PLC 16 I/O model, and up
            to 15 expansion modules can be added to the MicroSmart PLC 24 and 40 I/O models. 
            These modules can be of any type with no restrictions as to the number of analog and 
            specialty modules. 


  
HMI Module

 
 An optional HMI module can be added to provide operator interface. The HMI module can also accommodate an optional plug-in analog cartridge, and it has an integral Ethernet port. IoT capability is provided by custom web pages. Now you can create sophisticate and informational web pages using WindLDR built-in web page editor with drag & drop simplicity.

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]
