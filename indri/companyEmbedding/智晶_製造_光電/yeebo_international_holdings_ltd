Criminal Record

				We take a look at the sordid past of LCD maker Yeebo International Holdings Ltd, now under new management. The past presents a case study in criminal fraud and bad internal corporate governance. We also look to the future of the group, which was rescued by a textiles tycoon who last year saw shareholders reject his proposed systems integration investment priced at 59.1x earnings. Now, the company is cashed up with a new industry-related 34.7% shareholder. (27-Aug-2001)
