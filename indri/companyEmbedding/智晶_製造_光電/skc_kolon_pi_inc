■  Kaneka控告SKPI等公司聚醯亞胺薄膜相關專利侵權


一、訴訟案件概述
Kaneka Corporation（“Kaneka”）於2010年7月26日向德州東區地方法院遞狀，提起對SKC Kolon PI, Inc. (“SKPI”) 與SKC, Inc.（“SKC”）專利侵權訴訟請求，該案已於2011年4月21日移轉管轄至加州中區地方法院（California Central District Court）(如表一)；Kaneka於訴狀中，指出SKPI與SKC公司所「使用」、「製造」、「販賣」、「販賣邀約」、及「進口」之聚醯亞胺薄膜(Polyimide Films)產品直接與誘引(Induced Infringement)及輔助侵害(Contributory Infringement)該公司5項有關於聚醯亞胺薄膜(Polyimide Film)及其生產方法與過程之相關專利。

對於侵權產品部分，Kaneka要求最高三倍金額之損害賠償，以及初步(Preliminary)與永久(Permanent)禁制令等救濟方式。本案系爭專利主要涉及聚醯亞胺薄膜用於製造軟性電子電路(Flexible Electronic Circuits)並可用來製造軟性印刷電路、飛機電纜外層塗料、錄音磁帶塗層與超導體線圈線材塗層等產品。聚醯亞胺薄膜常與銅層結合，形成具軟性之覆銅箔層壓板，被廣泛應用於消費性電子產品如手機，電腦，數位相機和電動遊戲(Video Game)等。

                        二、系爭專利技術應用狀況
                        本次用來訴訟之最早核准的系爭專利US5,075,064 “樹脂薄膜生產方法及設備安裝”（“ Method and  Apparatus for Continuously Producing Resin Films and Installation Therefor”）於1991年12月24日獲證，而最新的專利US7,691,961 “聚醯亞胺薄膜及其應用”（“ Polymide Film and Use Thereof”）於2010年4月6日獲得核准，顯示該公司在該技術領域的專利布局已有相當長的時間。本訴訟之系爭專利主要關於聚醯亞胺薄膜及其生產方法流程，該薄膜具有良好的機械性能、電性能、化學穩定性以及很高的抗輻射能力、耐高溫和耐低溫特性，現已廣泛應用於航空、航海、太空船、火箭導彈、原子能、電子電器工業等各個領域, 依據其生產工藝的不同，應用範圍分為絕緣類和軟性電路板類，本案系爭專利主要應用於軟性電路製造領域。
三、訴訟歷史
                        另據資料顯示，Kaneka與SKC專利訴訟之爭始於2010年7月，由Kaneka向德州東區地方法院對SKPI與SKC提出專利侵權告訴，SKC隨後於同年9月向加州中區地方法院發動提起確認之訴(Declaratory  Judgment)的訴訟反擊。在專利案件中，確認之訴通常是請求法院確認專利無效、無侵權、或專利之不可執行(Unenforceability)。過去聯邦法院在判斷其是否有確認之訴的司法管轄權時，會考量專利權人的行為是否符合確認之訴的原告對訴訟有合理的疑慮(Reasonable Apprehension of Suit)。最近這場專利訴訟之爭，從法院延伸至美國國際貿易委員會(ITC)，Kaneka於2011年4月1日向對SKC提出侵權告訴，指出SKC所進口至美國的聚醯亞胺薄膜侵害Kaneka之專利技術，故要求ITC針對SKC所進口及販賣之聚醯亞胺薄膜產品提出ITC 337調查(337-2798)，並禁止產品輸入至美國的要求。 
四、公司簡介
                        (一) Kaneka Corporation
                        原告Kaneka Corporation(Kaneka)位於日本大阪市，其2010年全球銷售額達到約40億美元，其中美國銷售額占2億6千萬美元。除聚醯亞胺薄膜外，該公司並有設計、生產與製造液晶產品、磁性材料以及太陽能電池等。
(二) SKC Kolon PI, Inc. (“SKPI”) 和SKC, Inc.（“SKC”）
                        本案被告SKC Kolon PI, Inc. (SKPI) 是一家韓國公司與本案另一被告SKC, Inc.(“SKC”)公司屬於商業上的隸屬關係(Affiliate)。SKC總公司位於美國喬治亞州(Georgia)的Covington市。該公司成立於1960年，主要提供空氣採樣儀器和樣品收集服務，客戶覆蓋工業安全、環境安全與職業衛生與健康等領域。(1189字；表1)

SKC與Kolon為南韓老牌塑膠薄膜業者，從2005年起供應南韓業者聚醯亞胺(Polyimide；PI)薄膜。之後為了因應業界快速變化，2008年兩家公司的聚醯亞胺事業部門合併，成立SKC Kolon PI，以生產高附加價值聚醯亞胺薄膜為主，目前公司總部設在南韓京畿道安養市。在全球聚醯亞胺薄膜領域，日本的Kaneka與南韓的SKC Kolon PI，各以20%以上的市佔率，互爭龍頭地位。另外，日本東麗杜邦(Toray DuPont)與杜邦(DuPont)等也緊追在後。一般而言，聚醯亞胺薄膜可耐熱400度，也可承受零下269度的低溫，屬於高機能材料。最早應用在宇宙航空領域，近來隨著電子裝置產品發熱問題受到重視，應用範圍逐漸擴展到軟板和散熱片等領域。(范維君)
