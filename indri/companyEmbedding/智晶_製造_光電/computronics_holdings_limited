Computronics maintains a high inventory of component and sub assembled parts, ensuring the ability to efficiently manufacture products to suit project requirements and meet critical deadlines. All stock is managed by a fully computerised stock control system. This is an essential tool in maintaining accurate stock information and also aids in improving overall warehouse operation.
