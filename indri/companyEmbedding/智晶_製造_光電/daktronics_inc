These displays include red, green and blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in various combinations to form pixels. The electronic circuitry, which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each LED to provide a full color spectrum, thereby displaying video images in a range of colors. Variables in video displays include the spacing of the pixels (pixel pitch), the resolution of the displays (number of pixels), the brightness of the displays (nits), the number of discrete colors the display is able to produce (color depth), the viewing angles and the LED mount technology.The Company's LED ribbon board displays are customizable displays that accommodate curved and 360-degree installations. These displays are used for end zones, sidelines, encircling a stadium, outfields, concourses, stadium exterior or other linear applications. Its ProRail attachment system is combined with ribbon board technology to provide sight lines for fans. Its mobile and modular display systems are transportable and consist of individual LED video panels. These displays are used for touring shows and the events market.The Company integrates its display technology with architectural mesh to deliver a communication medium that provides a semi-transparent viewing experience within a building. These displays can be mounted over a solid facade or in front of windows resulting in a finished solution that is free from visible cabling and deliver a semi-transparent view. Its line of Freeform LED displays are architectural lighting and display products. The ProPixel freeform products use mountable LED elements to transform structures into visual landmarks.

Daktronics currently has its headquarters in Brookings, SD, with other facilities in Sioux Falls, SD, Redwood Falls, MN, Shanghai, China, and Belgium, along with more than 50 regional offices around the world.[1]
Services[edit]
Daktronics acquired Keyframe Inc., a video production and consulting company, in 2000.[7] Today, Daktronics Creative Services designs digital content in HD video, 3D animation and motion graphics, specializing in media networks and large-scale LED displays.[28]
Daktronics Sports Marketing[edit]
Daktronics Sports Marketing (DSM) specializes in raising advertising and sponsorship revenue for colleges, universities, high schools, municipalities and teams from all sports to fund new technology in sporting venues.[29]
Notable[edit]
Daktronics has been supplying scoreboards and video displays for the Olympics for several years. However, the Olympic Games often have contracts with larger corporations, such as Swiss Timing, so the Daktronics name is not often used.
Daktronics has been an influence in NBA rule changes in the 2000s. The company manufactured the first backboard light strips to comply with buzzer beater instant replay rulings, and in 2004, developed a see-through shot clock to improve spectator visibility.[30]
