LG Display ramps up OLED production to take on Samsung - LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LPL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»LG Display ramps up OLED production to take on SamsungJul. 25, 2017 10:40 AM ET|About: LG Display Co., Ltd. (LPL)|By: Brandy Betz, SA News Editor 
        LG Display (NYSE:LPL) announces plans to invest about $7B to boost its OLED production to make a stronger push into the market dominated by competitor Samsung (OTC:SSNNF, OTC:SSNLF).
               The investment, announced in an earnings report, will include two new production lines in Korea and one in China. 
               Some of the investment will go towards the production of large-size OLED panels. 
                  Samsung partnered with LG for the latter to provide the former’s LCD panels, which was meant to free Samsung up to focus on expanding its OLED production.   
               Apple has reportedly purchased panel production equipment to lease out and lessen the iPhone maker’s dependence on Samsung. 
LG Display shares are down 3.91%.

美國醫保體系改革議案通過以後，隔夜華爾街走強。因印度儲備銀行將官方利率意外提高25個基點，週一亞洲股市大多收低。印度中央銀行的舉措引發了人們對中國提早加息的擔憂。香港恆生指數下跌2.05%，韓國Kospi指數下跌0.8%。但滬市綜合指數微漲0.2%。日本股市昨天因公共假日休市，週二重新開市。

歷史[编辑]
LG Display（諺文：엘지디스플레이）是韓國樂金電子公司與荷蘭皇家飛利浦電子公司在1999年合資組成生產主動矩陣液晶顯示器（LCD）的公司。LG Display與三星電子為成為最大的液晶顯示器供應商而激烈競爭；2006年4月它們分別擁有22%市場份額。
該公司在南韓龜尾市與坡州市擁有七間生產工廠，在中國南京擁有一家模組裝配廠，並計劃在中國廣州與波蘭弗羅茨瓦夫興建兩間工廠。2006年8月18日，路透社報道，LG.Philips LCD決定不興建第8代面板工廠，改為興建5.5代的面板工廠；據LG Display副總裁Bock Kwon的說法，是為了集中生產更易獲利的桌上型與筆記本電腦LCD顯示面板。
2004年7月，LG Display成為獨立公司，並同時在紐約證券交易所（NYSE: LPL）與韓國證券交易所（KRX: 034220）上市。現時樂金擁有該公司37.9%股權，飛利浦擁有32.9%股權。2006年8月17日，華爾街日報報道，美林集團寄給客戶的一封電郵中指出飛利浦正為其LG.Philips LCD的股份尋找買家，其中包括日本松下電器。
飛利浦是歐洲最大的液晶電視生產商，樂金是韓國第二大生產商。2006年3月LG-Philips硏發出對角尺寸為100寸（約2.2米），當時最大的LCD面板。該公司尚未有發售使用100寸面板商品的計劃。LG Display現時生產Apple Cinema Display的液晶面板、戴爾Ultrasharp 2005FPW與30寸液晶面板。
2008年11月12日，LG Display和華映、夏普共同被美國判決違反反壟斷法，私下共同壟斷手機用螢幕的價格，共被罰款5億8500萬美金；其中LG Display被罰4億美金，為美國該類罪行中被罰款史上第2高。
截至2014年，LG Display在大型TFT-LCD市场实现了23.7%的市场占有率，位居世界第一[2]。

简介[编辑]
前身是LG Philips Display，由韩国乐金电子公司与荷兰皇家飞利浦电子公司两家公司合资组成，但飞利浦公司在2008年卖出所持股份，公司从此成为LG集团的子公司。
历史[编辑]
LG Display（谚文：엘지디스플레이）是韩国乐金电子公司与荷兰皇家飞利浦电子公司在1999年合资组成生产主动矩阵液晶显示器（LCD）的公司。LG Display与三星电子为成为最大的液晶显示器供应商而激烈竞争；2006年4月它们分别拥有22%市场份额。
该公司在韩国龟尾市与坡州市拥有七间生产工厂，在中国南京拥有一家模组装配厂，并计划在中国广州与波兰弗罗茨瓦夫兴建两间工厂。2006年8月18日，路透社报道，LG.Philips LCD决定不兴建第8代面板工厂，改为兴建5.5代的面板工厂；据LG Display副总裁Bock Kwon的说法，是为了集中生产更易获利的桌上型与笔记本电脑LCD显示面板。
2004年7月，LG Display成为独立公司，并同时在纽约证券交易所（NYSE: LPL）与韩国证券交易所（KRX: 034220）上市。现时乐金拥有该公司37.9%股权，飞利浦拥有32.9%股权。2006年8月17日，华尔街日报报道，美林集团寄给客户的一封电邮中指出飞利浦正为其LG.Philips LCD的股份寻找买家，其中包括日本松下电器。
飞利浦是欧洲最大的液晶电视生产商，乐金是韩国第二大生产商。2006年3月LG-Philips硏发出对角尺寸为100寸（约2.2米），当时最大的LCD面板。该公司尚未有发售使用100寸面板商品的计划。LG Display现时生产Apple Cinema Display的液晶面板、戴尔Ultrasharp 2005FPW与30寸液晶面板。
2008年11月12日，LG Display和华映、夏普共同被美国判决违反反垄断法，私下共同垄断手机用屏幕的价格，共被罚款5亿8500万美金；其中LG Display被罚4亿美金，为美国该类罪行中被罚款史上第2高。
截至2014年，LG Display在大型TFT-LCD市场实现了23.7%的市场占有率，位居世界第一[2]。
