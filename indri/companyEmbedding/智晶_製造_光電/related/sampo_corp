Company Description                    




                        Sampo Corporation traces its roots back to 1936 when Mr. M.P. Chen and his brothers founded Tung Cheng Tang Electronics Company, forerunner of today’s Sampo. In 1964, following a merger with Tung Hsin Electric Co., Ltd., the company changed its name to Sampo Electrical Appliances Co., Ltd. At that time, it manufactured and distributed electrical home appliances, such as black and white TVs and refrigerator. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Sampo’s base in Taiwan grew with the prosperous economy. In 1969, a technology cooperation agreement was entered into with Sharp Corporation of Japan for the production of color TVs. Sharp then became the largest single shareholder of Sampo ever since. In 1970, Sampo was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Four years later, the company changed its name to Sampo Corporation. During the late 70s and early 80s, Sampo continued to expand its production and distribution channels in Taiwan as well as establish liaison offices and branches overseas. As a leader in home appliance industry of Taiwan, Sampo created many new product milestones such as the introduction of Taiwan’s first microcomputer-controlled air conditioner (1979), microcomputer-controlled television (1984), and microcomputer-controlled refrigerator (1985). Another glorious record that Sampo made was the successful penetration of Sampo’s air conditioner into the tough Japanese market in 1987. In order to diversify its business, Sampo began importing and selling Chrysler automobiles in 1989 and Rover automobiles in 1993. By 1989, Sampo opened offices in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to oversee the sales and distribution of Sampo products. In 1993, Sampo became the first Taiwan consumer electronics company producing microwave ovens (Beijing) and washing machines (Tianjin) in Mainland China. Today, Sampo is one of Taiwan’s leading business groups. With three manufacturing facilities and numerous distribution outlets throughout Taiwan, four manufacturing facilities and distribution centers in the PRC, and affiliated businesses which provide synergy to Sampo’s core business operations, Sampo remains an industry leader.
