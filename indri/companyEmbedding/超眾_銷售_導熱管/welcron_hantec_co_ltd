공급하게 될 강릉 도시형생활주택의 조감도
플랜트·종합건설 전문기업 웰크론한텍(076080)이 강릉 영진리 도시형 생활주택 건설공사의 시공사로 선정되었다고 13일 밝혔다. 웰크론한텍의 이번 계약은 강릉 도시형 생활주택 건설공사의 시행사인 한국토지신탁과의 262억원 규모의 공사도급계약 건으로 총 공사비는 통신공사비 11억원을 포함해 총 273억원이다. 공사완료기한은 착공 이후 24개월이다. 현재 프로젝트 진행을 위한 건축인허가와 사업계획 승인이 완료 된 상태로 한국토지산탁이 개발신탁을 맡아 운영하게 된다.강릉 도시형 생활주택 건설 프로젝트는 강릉 영진리 일대 연면적 23¸230㎡부지에 지하 2층 지상 19층 규모로 근린생활시설을 갖춘 도시형 생활주택 298세대를 건설하는 공사로¸ 직선거리 100M이내에 영진 해수욕장이 위치하고 전세대 바다조망이 가능한 발코니를 갖추게 된다. 또한 인근으로 녹지가 풍부하고 유해시설이 없어 해변 휴양여건을 갖춘 휴양지 세컨하우스로 최적화된 입지로 평가되고 있다. 웰크론한텍은 지난해 11월 용인 타운하우스 ‘양지 포레스토리’의 시공사로 참여하며 기존 산업시설¸ 물류센터¸ 업무시설¸ 연구소 등 비주거부문 건설 중심에서 주택건설 시장으로 영역을 확대 했다. 양지 포레스토리는 한국자산신탁이 시행하는 개발신탁 사업으로 경기도 용인시에 공통주택 174세대와 커뮤니티시설¸ 휘트니스센터 등 부대시설과 도시가스 등 기반시설을 갖춘 대규모 테라스하우스 단지로 조성되고 있다. 2018년 11월 입주예정으로 올 2월 분양을 시작해 현재 93%이상 분양이 완료된 상태이다. 웰크론한텍 건설사업본부 관계자는 “시공사로서 위험 부담이 적은 개발신탁방식의 사업을 통해 민간 주택건설 분야의 실적을 확보해 나가고 있다”며¸ “이번 프로젝트 또한 성공적으로 수행해 주택건설분야에서의 입지를 강화할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다”고 말했다.
