We produce plastic injection moulds for the consumer electronics, household appliances, automotive and computer peripherals industries. MDF or "Tooling" involves the design and fabrication of the precision plastic injection mould, a steel tool made up of many operating mechanisms and parts ("tooling inserts") assembled together, and subsequently used in PPIM or sold directly to customers.
We believe that a good tool forms the heart of a good product. At Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd, we take pride in building a good tool right from the design stage to the mould assembly. That is why we use only state-of-the-art steel cutting machines in Jubilee Industries Holdings Ltd, such as Makino and Sodick. We believe that both a good hard ware and an excellent skill set are critical in every step to make a tool which we can be proud of.
We design and fabricate intricate and complex precision plastic injection moulds. In addition, we have the capability to fabricate precision moulds with high aesthetic finishing, and we are one of the best in surface polishing. Another of our key strength is in our ability to build double shot injection tool, which we have perfected the technology over many years. Apart from that, we also build complex engineering tools for some of the most stringent customers in the medical and automotive industry.
We have a dedicated team of professional program managers and designers who will study our customers' needs and part requirements, and go through a thorough DFM before proceeding with tool fabrication.  Our quality motto is to do things right the first time and to avoid unnecessary wastage.

	At Jubilee Industries, we are at the forefront of assimilating new technologies and knowledge. 

Jubilee Industries will be introducing a new moulding technology into our core business - Liquid Silicone Rubber (LSR) Moulding Technology. LSR commodities are in global demand and is been offered mainly by moulding industries on the other side of the globe. We are looking at bringing this technology to Asia-Pacific region to offer this service and commodity to Customers requiring it here.
LSR moulding process is in a way similar to that of normal plastic moulding but works on a different technology aspect. The major differences are in the processing of the raw material before injecting into the mould, the curing process and the handling method. 
There are 2 phases in preparation to incorporate LSR Technology into our business. The 1st phase requires the building up of the know-how in moulding technology for LSR moulding process which is already in progress. We will be ready to offer LSR commodities and services to customers by end 2012. The 2nd phase is know-how in mould fabricating technology for LSR moulds which will take place in early 2013. A LSR mould requires a much higher level in precision accuracy to mould LSR parts.
Please look out here for updates of our LSR progression status for your interest in this product offer.
