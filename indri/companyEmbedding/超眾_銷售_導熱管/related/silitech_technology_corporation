Silitek Malaysia was established in 1989 as a Silicone Rubber keypad manufacturer, but soon grew into a multi-million dollar company with 3 major divisions producing rubber keypads, printers & scanners and computer keyboards. In October 2002 Silitek Rubber Division was spun off from the Silitek Corporation to form what is currently known as Silitech Technology Corporation. While the computer peripherals operations were moved to China for strategic reasons, the rubber division has continued to thrive and has diversified into membrane and plastic products. The experience gained from the assembly of computer peripherals has enabled Silitech Technology to extend its services and become a one-stop integration service provider. Silitech is QS9000 & ISO14000 certified and working towards achieving TS2 (ISO/TS16949:2002) certification by 1Q/2004. Driven by the company common values of "Integrity, Focus, Quality and Innovation", Silitech strives for continuous quality improvement to go along with a well managed supply chain. Our global sales and technical support offices are available to service our customer base in a professional and timely fashion. Simply stated, our goal is to meet or exceed our customer?s expectations. To find out why the Fortune 100 companies rely on us for their switch applications,
