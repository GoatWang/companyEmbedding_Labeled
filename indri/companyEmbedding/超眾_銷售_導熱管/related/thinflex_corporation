History





Arisawa as business came into being in 1909 with the production of Battenberg lace, where it cultivated expertise that would later attain a new height with the epochal introduction of glass fiber. What followed were a string of novel materials from Arisawa featuring unheard-of properties, to which the company went on to apply innovative technologies. This process enabled Arisawa to build up coherent production systems and a unique technical edge integrating the "weaving, coating and molding" elements while consistently fulfilling customer needs.
Arisawa's current offerings include, among others, electronic materials for use in PCs, mobile phones, etc., industrial application structural materials (e.g. honeycomb sandwich panels for use in aircraft interiors), electrical insulating materials and display materials, all of which contribute to the development of various industries. We at Arisawa Mfg. Co., Ltd. have our mind set on opening a vista for the future as we remain proactive in our efforts to develop innovative materials.


* "CIC" stands for "Creation, Innovation and Challenge".

On the basis of the motto "Creation, Innovation and Challenge", we pledge to:
(ⅰ) offer new values and enhance customer satisfaction;
(ⅱ) explore latent needs to create new businesses;
(ⅲ) develop overseas operations and strengthen corporate structure through concerted efforts of the entire group; and
(ⅳ) ensure individual safety to achieve zero accident.

(ⅰ) We stand in each other's shoes and do what we think is the best for each other.
(ⅱ) We compare what we are today with what we were yesterday, rather than comparing ourselves with others.
(ⅲ) We deliver on our promise responsibly, once we have made it.

Arisawa pledges to supply the high quality product that meets the reliability and needs of the customer by standing in the customer's viewpoint.
