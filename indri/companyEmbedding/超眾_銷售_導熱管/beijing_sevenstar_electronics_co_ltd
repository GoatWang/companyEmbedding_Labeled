**Acquisition of SevenStar Electronics Ltd** 
	



	**SARTECH SUCCESSFULLY AUDITED TO MED SCH D** 
	- 18 JULY 2017

After 15 years of successful trading, I am pleased to announce the 
	acquisition of SevenStar Electronics Ltd by 
	sister company Sartech Engineering Ltd of 
	Redhill UK. 

From 1st April 2017, the business, 
	assets, products & approvals, IP and copyright of SevenStar will be 
	transferred to Sartech Engineering Ltd of Redhill UK. Sartech have been a 
	leading consultant and supplier to the Marine Safety Industry for over 25 
	years, are CIRM and RTCM members, and were closely involved with the 
	formation and initial equity of SevenStar in 2002, so they already have very 
	intimate knowledge of the SevenStar products and the Marine market. Sartech 
	have larger premises and more resources to apply to better satisfy the 
	changing dynamics of the marketplace, so the time is right to combine the 
	resources of the two companies. The SevenStar brand name will be retained on 
	the products. 

As a 
	result of this acquisition, all manufacturing operations will be moving to 
	Sartech's premises in Redhill, Surrey by 1st July 2017. There will be an 
	overlap period with the existing premises in Royal Wootton Bassett to 
	guarantee continuity of the manufacturing & sales operations and transfer of 
	relevant manufacturing approvals.

Sartech 
	are of course approved to ISO9001:2008 and are in the process of 
	transitioning to ISO9001:2015. 

Sartech 
	can be reached directly on 
01737 
	372670 and at 
info@sartech.com 

The existing email addresses will 
	initially be maintained as follows: 

sales@sevenstarelectronics.com   
	and 
 
	
colin.watts@sevenstarelectronics.com 


SevenStar manufactures a range of 
	marine safety & navigation equipment, most notably radar SARTs 

and AIS Transponders,  Combined GPS/AIS 
	aerials, AIS Receivers & custom transponders
And, of course, our best-selling
	SARTs are....low cost....low power....low lifetime 
	cost.......slimmest available.






        




Welcome 
	...
SevenStar Electronics
Ltd was formed specifically to provide high technology
solutions to some of the more pressing   safety, 
	 navigation and 
	 identification
      issues facing us today. We
aim to
      deliver best-in-class products using the latest proven design and
manufacturing technologies, and
 are fully approved to BS EN ISO 9001:2008.


	Our marine product range includes 
      AIS Transponders, 

AIS Receivers, 

Antennas
      and 
      SARTs.


	Our 
	    S.701 Marine 
 Search 
 And 
 Rescue 
 Transponder
      (SART) 
	was the first SART 
	that could be shipped as NON-HAZARDOUS goods,
      and is approved to EU MED 'Wheelmark' and the FCC. (It has also 
	received local approval in many countries.)  
      
SARTs
form a vital part of the mandatory safety systems applied worldwide to
commercial vessels as part of the GMDSS 

	(click the 'GMDSS' button at top of page for more info), and are now required equipment for liferafts on Ro-Ro
ferries. They are standard equipment on many ocean racing yachts, and are also now being fitted voluntarily to
private yachts and
other leisure craft. 



Our 
	
SeaTraceR
 
	Class B AIS Transponder, which services the field of 
 
	maritime safety, navigation and security, was one of the first AIS 
	Transponders 
	designed to the  
	
Class B 
	specification to be 

both  
	EU and USCG approved! 
	AIS is already 
	mandated for  SOLAS commercial and passenger vessels 
	worldwide in Class A form, and our 

SeaTraceR 
	Class B Transponder works 
	within this system, bringing its wide-reaching benefits to the leisure and 
	smaller commercial vessel market. 
	Our equipment is already in use in 
	many mandatory fit environments. 
 
	(Click on the 'AIS' button along the top of the page for more general info.)
 
	 
	 
We also produce a number of other transponders, including the 


      SkyTraceR 
	series of programmable


 Radar Tracking Transponders 
	
 (follow link on left side panel for more info). These devices 
	are used for enhancing the tracking and radar visibility of small objects, 
	whether they are waterborne or airborne, manned or unmanned craft, and has 
	the great advantage that you can turn them off for covert operation if 
	required.   
	We trust you will find the 
	details you want on our site - if not, please do not hesitate to contact us, 
	or any of our valued distributors via one of the routes shown.                      Contact Us=>
