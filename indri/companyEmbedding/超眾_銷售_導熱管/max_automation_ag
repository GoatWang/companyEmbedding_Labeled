Description:Miniature absolute singleturn encoder EAC50 series can withstand a higher axial and radial load with its reasonable and compact structure. The standard flange combined the clamping and synchronous flanges together, while leaving multiple types of pre-screwed holes for easy installation. The EAC50 series can be widely used in angular and positioning measurement, particularly in the textile industry.
