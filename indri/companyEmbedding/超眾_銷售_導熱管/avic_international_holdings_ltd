Corporate Profile
AVIC International Maritime Holdings Limited ("AVIC Maritime") (中航国际船舶控股有限公司), together with its subsidiaries, (the "Group") , is a member of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China ("AVIC") (中国航空工业集团公司) group of companies (the "AVIC Group").
As an active player in the marine and offshore industry,
AVIC Maritime strives to provide innovative and
integrated solutions optimized to meet customers’
needs along the entire marine business value chain. Our
extensive range of services includes shipbuilding project
management and consultancy (“M&C Services”), design
and engineering, shipbuilding (outsourced), ship trading
related businesses, as well as Engineering, Procurement
and Construction services.
AVIC Maritime’s track record in shipbuilding M&C
Services dates back to 1994 and has over the years,
established strong relationships with many reputable
ship-owners worldwide. Forging ahead with our
strategy to expand along the ship design, shipbuilding
and ship trading related businesses value chain, the
Group acquired a Finnish design and engineering firm,
Deltamarin Ltd (“Deltamarin”), in January 2013, to
enhance our ship design capability. Established since
1990, Deltamarin is a forerunner in naval architecture
and engineering, and an experienced developer of
profitable, sustainable and cost-efficient vessels. In 2014,
the company established a joint-venture company with
Deltamarin, Deltamarin Floating Construction Pte. Ltd.,
to provide engineering, procurement and construction
services.
Ranked 143rd among Fortune Global Top 500
corporations in 2016*, the Aviation Industry Corporation
of China Group (“AVIC Group”) is one of the largest
industrial groups authorized and managed by the
People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) Central Government,
with key business units such as defense, transport
aircraft, aviation engine, helicopters, avionics, general
aviation aircraft, aviation research and development,
flight test, trade and logistics, and asset management.
AVIC Maritime’s association with the AVIC Group gives
us the competitive edge of getting strong support from
major financial institutions in the PRC.
Led by an experienced and driven management team
with in-depth industry knowledge, coupled with our
ability to leverage on AVIC Group’s excellent business
relationships, strong fundamentals and global business
network, AVIC Maritime is well- positioned to be a
leading provider of integrated maritime services.
