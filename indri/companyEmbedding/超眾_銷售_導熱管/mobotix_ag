Overview

The MOBOTIX MxCameraSystem SDK is intended to support software developers of,
e.g., surveillance solutions and/or video management systems in integrating
MOBOTIX network cameras into their products. Typical integration tasks
here include

retrieval and decoding of MxPEG video/audio streams for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, converting, post processing or storing
	programmatically changing camera settings and parameters
	programmatically making use of camera events
	programmatically triggering signal output and other camera actions, as for
			example FTP transfers or the sending of mail messages

To assist in solving these tasks, MOBOTIX offers three different
levels of integration support providing the developer with varying degrees of
control. These levels are

 the Camera HTTP API
 the MxPEG ActiveX Component
 the Open Source MxPEG Decoding Library (C++)

and they will be discussed more thoroughly in the following sections.



The intended audience for the Software Development Kit are system integrators
and developers with a background in image compression. In order to reasonably
make use of the included source code, solid experience with C++ development is
required.


Please note that MOBOTIX AG's regular product support does not include
assistance in programming with the SDK's C++ library. However, feel free to
contact mxpeg-sdk@mobotix.com if you
have questions of this sort or regarding MxPEG in general.


What's New in Release 1.0.2
The sole purpose of this release is to publish an updated version of the MOBOTIX MxPEG ActiveX Component.

New MOBOTIX MxPEG ActiveX Component version 1.6.3.0

What's New in Release 1.0.1
The major changes clearly have been improvements to the included C++ library
package:

First off, there's been a change in functional scope. The package no
			longer contains any user interface and/or video display elements, but
			concentrates on the actual MxPEG decoding instead. Thus, the dependency on
			Qt has been eliminated. As another consequence the portable MxPEG Player
			application is no longer part of MxPEG SDK.
		
	Audio Support : The decoder interfaces have been extended in order to also
			hand decoded audio data over to the client application code for further
			processing. Note however that in order to actually hear anything, you will
			have to provide your own audio output routines for your specific target
			platform - a fact that is now also true for displaying video.
		
	As was requested by many customers, the package now also compiles under
			Microsoft Visual C++. At MX, we're working and testing with Visual Studio
			2005.

	We are currently migrating considerable parts of our codebase to a
			component oriented design, with the MxPEG SDK C++ package actually being
			a subset of it. As a result, the MxPEG SDK code has also been reworked and
			molded into components, and its infrastructure and interfaces have
			received a fair amount of streamlining in the process.
		
	The actual MxPEG decoder engine has grown more mature: it implements a
			larger subset of the JPEG stream specification including an additional
			subsampling mode (enabling it to also properly digest MJPEG streams coming
			in from certain Axis and MerritLiLin camera models), hands more frame
			parameters over to the client application and has an improved handling of
			error conditions.

Camera HTTP API

The HTTP API allows your software to interact with MOBOTIX cameras by
invoking special CGI programs via standard HTTP transactions
and by processing potential reply messages. The HTTP API is supported by all
MOBOTIX camera models and, among other things, can be used to

retrieve single camera images or continous MxPEG / MJPEG
			video streams via the HTTP protocol
	programmatically change camera settings and parameters
	programmatically make use of camera events
	programmatically trigger signal output and other camera actions, as for
			example FTP transfers or the sending of mail messages


Camera HTTP API

HTTP API documentation, reproduced from the camera's
						 online help.
Image retrieval /
						 streaming CGI documentation, reproduced from the camera's
						 online help.
Remote configuration CGI documentation,
						 reproduced from the camera's online help.




Note:
Please note that these API pages are not generic, but depend on the camera model and software version. It is thus highly recommended to open the HTTP API and CGI Parameters of the MOBOTIX Camera help topics on your camera to find the options that are available.

MxPEG ActiveX Component

The MxPEG ActiveX Component shipping with each MOBOTIX camera
can be used as a plugin in Microsoft Internet Explorer, thus
allowing for playback of live or stored MxPEG video streams in the web
browser, including audio if desired. MJPEG streams can be displayed as
well, but obviously without sound.


What makes the MxPEG ActiveX Component furthermore attractive in regard
to integration efforts, is that it can be integrated into 3rd party MS
Windows applications in order to

display MxPEG streams received fom MOBOTIX cameras in
			the ActiveX component's display window, optionally including audio playback
	display MJPEG video streams received fom MOBOTIX cameras
			in the ActiveX component's display window (no audio playback in this case)
	retrieve and decode MxPEG or MJPEG streams, handing
			the individual frame bitmaps over to the client application for further
			processing

MxPEG C++ Library
As part of the Software Development Kit, MOBOTIX releases a C++
library in open source form under the BSD License. It provides
MxPEG decoding to system integrators and runs on Windows, Linux and
Mac OS X.
System integrators are encouraged to incorporate the code in their own
software products. Since the sources are freely available, potential
shortcomings if they should be considered as such can be easily fixed, as
missing features for a given specific application scenario can be added.
By using the MxPEG SDK C++ library, application developers have the most
flexible access to MxPEG or MJPEG video streams coming in from
MOBOTIX cameras. In contrast to the ActiveX component described earlier,
due to their platform-independent nature, these classes can be used to build
applications that can be deployed on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.
The C++ library basically implements an object-oriented decoder
infrastructure allowing for the processing of

MxPEG streams, including video and optional audio
	MJPEG streams, video-only

In the typical case your client application will feed an MxPEG stream
into the decoder, and be then presented with a sequence of

 decoded video tiles, 16x16 pixels, three-byte-RGB
 audio blocks

all together with the necessary timestamp information for proper
resynchronization. Furthermore, entire frames can be dumped in raw RGB
or YUV formats, as well as they can be re-packed into individual single
JPEG frames.

To complete the package, there is also an optional Qt-dependent part
of the library that provides support for the aforementioned camera HTTP API by
implementing classes for comfortably performing HTTP GET transactions
with remote cameras.
Please note again that assistance in programming with the SDK's C++ library
is not included in MOBOTIX AG's regular product support. Note also that
solid experience with C++ development is required to reasonably put to use the
included source code.

MOBOTIX AllroundDual M15 Thermal Camera
The MOBOTIX M15-Thermal is equipped with a pre-installed thermal image sensor that detects vehicles and people in total darkness with extremely high accuracy. A second optical sensor module can be fitted to provide positive object identification for complete lowlight security. Automatic temperature alarms can be generated automatically with thermal radiometry (TR), which is vital to detect potential fire or heat sources. MOBOTIX thermal dual camera systems offer also thermal overlay to localize hot spots in the visual image to prevent bigger damages and fire.
Thermal: Detect Movement Around The Clock
High thermal resolution allows moving object detection up to 400 m/437 yards in total darkness and in all conditions such as smoke, dust, fog. No lighting required.
Optical: Identify Objects
The M15-Thermal dual-lens design allows for a secondary optical lens to be fitted for clear identification of facial features, clothing, license plate numbers, vehicle color etc.
Privacy Zone – Identification And Recognition On Event
Combined with MxActivitySensor, the camera automatically switches from thermal sensor to optical sensor, when an object moves into the pre-defined privacy zone. This ensures the identification and recognition of moving objects only when MxActivitySensor triggers an alarm.
Thermal Overlay
Hotspots can be visualized very fast by overlaying the thermal image on the optical image which helps to identify dangerous heat or fire sources. This technology can be used very efficiently in fire protection to localize potential origins of danger.

MOBOTIX FlexMount S15
With its unique fusion of dual sensor technology and flexmount design, the MOBOTIX S15 covers two areas at once and is virtually invisible. The S15 has been perfectly created for customized solutions or installations where standard camerassimply won’t fit.
Flexible Installation
The S15 core unit miniature size fits into tight spaces (ATMs, machinery, vehicles). The flexible 3 m/9.8 ft video cables make it a easy to create customized installations. 
Double Hemispheric = 360˚ Full Spherical Capture
This cost-effective solution can simultaneously capture and record two super-wide 360˚ fields of view, providing the same coverage as eight standard CCTV cameras.
Virtually Invisible 
With a diameter of only 50 mm/1.96 inch and available in both white and black, the S15 sensor modules blend in with any environment. Ideal for applications where standard-sized cameras are unsuitable.
Secure Two Areas With One Device
The two flexible video cables allow for coverage of two separate areas. Just one S15 can secure two separate rooms, an indoor and outdoor area and around corners.

Solutions With Added Value For The Retail, Transportation, Perimeter Protection And Industrial Sectors
MOBOTIX, in collaboration with Konica Minolta, has developed a new security concept that offers the best possible perimeter protection. The concept combines video and thermal technology from MOBOTIX in conjunction with the 3D laser scanner (3D LiDAR) from Konica Minolta. This combination of technologies makes it possible to better automatically analyze data collected from events. This provides the possibility to optimally limit events and represent them in three dimensions not only through the movement in the frames but also through defining distances between objects, object sizes and temperature. MOBOTIX will demonstrate how their solution, which features Point of Sale (POS) integration and camera-supported image and data analysis, is suited specifically for the retail sector. This solution provides valuable additional information regarding cash transactions. 
MOBOTIX also illustrates how the thermal radiometry and event logic technologies make it possible to reliably monitor temperature; with the ability to prevent possible dangers ahead of time by monitoring critical processes used in industrial applications and infrastructures. The security solution from MOBOTIX is excellent for mobile deployment thanks to its robust design, tried-and-tested hemispheric camera technology, decentralized recording system and event logic.

MOBOTIX Intelligent IP Video Solutions in Transportation and Mobility
The use of hemispheric technology in the MOBOTIX S15 provides effective coverage of the complete vehicle interior with just one single camera. Installed with the surround mount in the middle of the bus, the entire passenger compartment is secured without any blind spot. An S15 covers the complete area of the driver including entrance and outside. In addition, an external camera at the rear or front increases safety in and around the school bus. The consequent absence of moving parts and thus the guarantee of robustness, results in video solutions including recordings which are known as nearly maintenance free. Instead of traditional hard drives, which are considered problematic and expensive in automotive environments, industry-standard SD-cards are integrated directly in the camera to provide reliable storage. Automatic video archiving and connection to IoT (Internet of Things) can be easily implemented upon arrival at the bus
depot.
In order to ensure absolute reliability in mobile applications, even under extreme environmental conditions, S15 models of MOBOTIX have successfully passed the toughest certification tests. Simple installation, low space requirements and the absence of expensive, fragile recording devices result in a cost-effective security solution for any type of vehicle. The S15 model of MOBOTIX, providing a protected mountable camera housing with integrated flash memory, is resistant against shock, vibration and temperature variations. The ability to exchange the sensor module has proven to be cost-effective and practical, without having to dismantle the whole camera during transportation all recordings are maintained.
Smart and functional accessories enable the discrete operation to ensure passenger safety and protection against vandalism and
damage in transport vehicles. The behavior of passengers and drivers can be documented at any time. It is important to know the status of the bus or truck; whether it is within the predefined operational area or does an incident require the support of the nearest Police station. Based on the transmission of the latest video and GPS data, emergency personnel can be directed quickly to the required location.

Mobotix AG
Beside the professional VMS and video analysis software, MOBOTIX is known as an innovative producer of smart and autonomous IP cameras since the year 2000. From the beginning, cameras were equipped with CMOS sensors without any moving parts to improve backlight situations and longterm reliability. The camera itself runs the software for automatic event detection, alarm messaging, video analysis, direct NAS ring buﬀer storage and remote functions. Two-way audio with VoIP messaging and phone connectivity using the SIP standard is included in all MOBOTIX cameras. From the ﬁrst day, MOBOTIX cameras are produced weatherproof and IP66 protected with one of the highest quality standards. In 2015, a new range of competitive 6-megapixel indoor cameras for ﬂexible ceiling and wall-mount installations was launched. MOBOTIX is located near the highway A63 approx. 90 km south west of Frankfurt Airport in Germany.

Network Video Surveillance											Productsi25

The i25’s extremely compact dimensions – with a width of only approx. 14 cm – make this new camera the smallest and lightest MOBOTIX video complete system ever. The PoE-powered camera is quickly installed via an in-wall socket using just two screws. Standard features include a light-sensitive 5-MP day or night sensor, SD memory card, microphone and the latest camera software including MxActivitySensor. Optional functions such as a speaker, radar sensor, IO and MxBus connections as well as a vandalism-proof protective housing can be retrofitted.


	M15

The M15 is the weatherproof, robust successor to MOBOTIX’ successful dual camera, which features interchangeable sensor modules as well as the latest MOBOTIX system technology. As a result, it remains totally unique in terms of performance, functionality and design. The M15 Core module comes with VarioFlex mount, connection cables for sensor modules and network, and the front element. The sensor modules, which need to be ordered separately, are pre-focused at the factory and can be supplied in any desired combination of day or night sensors with lens choices from telephoto to wide angle.


	S15 ThermalThe flexible video cabling, weatherproof design and tiny footprint allows the two S15D thermal sensor modules to be installed into any location up to two meters away from a single S15D core unit. The advantage of using thermal sensor modules is that they can visualize heat radiating from vehicles and persons, for the purpose of accurate movement detection up to 400 meters away from the camera, even under the most challenging lighting and environmental conditions.MxActivitySensor

MxActivitySensor is a completely new Camera-Integrated Motion Analysis technology. It only records video or triggers an alarm if an important event actually occurs. Interference caused, for instance, by trees moving in the wind, shadows, passing clouds or snowfall is consistently ignored. This means that the numbers of false alarms, which are the biggest problem with motion detection softwares today, are reduced with over 90 % 


	T25M

T25M is a camera module for the MOBOTIX T25 IP Video Door Station. Capturing a super-wide 180° field of view, the T25M camera module captures everything wall-to-wall for secure viewing and recording. The Hemispheric image correction is handled by the camera, no external PC required. The in-camera image correction saves bandwidth by up to 70%.

Navigation: Companies >> MOBOTIX AG >> About MOBOTIX AGMicrosite+49 (0) 630 298 160www.mobotix.comContact companyAbout MOBOTIX AGMOBOTIX - German system manufacturer of Professional Video Management (VMS) and Smart IP CamerasIn 2005, MOBOTIX launched its first professional video management system which has seen thousands of installations around the globe, including high-security applications like prisons, airports and football stadiums. MOBOTIX systems have no restrictions in terms of number of users or cameras. The professional VMS and the video analysis are parts of the system offering and free of charge without any license fees. In addition, software updates are free via download and transform every MOBOTIX product into a future-proof investment with one of the highest returns on investment.







Since 2015, all MOBOTX cameras have used 6MP “Moonlight Sensor Technology“, which is very light sensitive and produces brilliant videos even in difficult low-light conditions without any motion blur.
Decentralised architecture increases reliability and reduces system costsMOBOTIX IP cameras have been known for their high-quality video performance and low bandwidth consumption thanks to their “decentralised architecture”. The cameras themselves execute video analysis & event detection internally, and manage their video ring buffer on a NAS or server by themselves. This reduces the workload of the VMS workstation and network dramatically. Network fluctuations or longer interruptions are compensated by an onboard video buffer (SD card). As a result, MOBOTIX video systems are very reliable and need fewer servers, fewer workstations and less network infrastructure than other brands. This reduces the overall system costs as well as power consumption and the total energy bill. Encrypted recording by the camera itself guarantees data security and privacy.







Decentralisation - a solution for the cloudMOBOTIX IP cameras have been optimised for remote applications and cloud-based technology. The cameras can reduce the bandwidth of the video by scaling the size and the frame rate. Image details are still available thanks to the onboard virtual PTZ functionality. The cameras store high-resolution video onboard and deliver on demand low- bandwidth live images and also low-bandwidth playback. Additionally MOBOTIX cameras can manage an event-driven video ring buffer via network or Internet. The live channel and the recorded video are highly secured because the video encryption is already done inside the camera.
MOBOTIX - Innovative German IP camera manufacturer since 2000MOBOTIX is known as an innovative producer of smart and autonomous IP cameras since 2000. From the beginning, cameras were equipped with CMOS sensors without any moving parts to improve backlight situations and long term reliability. MOBOTIX cameras themselves run software for automatic event detection, alarm messaging, video analysis, direct NAS ring buffer storage and remote functions.







Two-way audio with VoIP messaging and phone connectivity using the SIP standard is included in all MOBOTIX cameras. MOBOTIX cameras are weatherproof and IP66 protected with one of the highest quality standards. In 2015, a new range of competitive 6-megapixel indoor cameras for flexible ceiling and wall-mount installations was launched.MOBOTIX is located approximately 90 km south west of Frankfurt Airport in Germany.
