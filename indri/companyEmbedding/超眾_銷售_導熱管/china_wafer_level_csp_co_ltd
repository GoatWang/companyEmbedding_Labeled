Infinity Equity Capital Ltd.

                                    Infinity is an active manager which employs an investment strategy based on a growth capital value creation model, aiming primarily to invest capital into Israeli and Chinese companies with proven products and businesses that will benefit from additional capital and strategic partnerships.   They invest in companies in a variety of sectors including life science, software, semiconductor, industrial equipment, communications and security.The firm's core strategy is to invest in late-stage Israeli technology-related companies with parallel investments in Chinese operational businesses that license Israeli technologies, adjust them to the needs of the Chinese market and market them in China.Infinity aims to add value to late-stage Israeli companies which are selling products throughout the world by opening up the Chinese market to their products.  By investing in companies with strategic alliances, they are able to facilitate Israeli companies' entry in the Chinese market.  In addition, their relationships enable companies to develop production and manufacturing facilities in China that lower costs, raise profits and allow Israeli companies to better compete in global markets.The firm's Chinese business investments gain value in the opposite direction. Bringing technology products into Chinese businesses allows them to beat the competition in China with innovative product offerings.  Infinity believes that combining local Chinese businesses with foreign investors and leading technology creates value creation that leads to future exit opportunities in the form of IPOs, trade sales and M&As.
