Azlan announces new distribution agreement with Secret Double Octopus
                2017-07-31
Azlan, Tech Data Europe's infrastructure VAD division, has unveiled a pan-EMEA distribution agreement with Secret Double Octopus, a pioneer of keyless multi-shield authentication technology. Secret Double Octopus has developed a solution for the market that applies keyless authentication and identity protection for cloud, mobile, and IoT solutions. Secret Double Octopus' app helps companies to scale their network security and shift away from key-based authenticators, to a more secure keyless solution. With one tap, the authenticator app initiates a multi-shield authentication process for users in order to verify or reject the login attempt, payment or transaction.
David Harvey, director Security and Enterprise Networking Solutions at Azlan, says: "by bringing Secret Double Octopus into our vendor portfolio, Azlan enriches its security offering with an innovative solution that addresses customers' authentication challenges, is scalable and easy to deploy, and helps provide cost-effective security."
"For years, organizations have sought to educate employees about the importance of secure passwords and resisting phishing attacks, both of which have failed. It is time to replace the password", said Raz Rafaeli, CEO of Secret Double Octopus. "We are excited to expand our global footprint through this partnership with Azlan. We can offer the European market a strong authentication solution that will eliminate the need for passwords - a security vulnerability that accounts for two-thirds of data breaches."
Double Octopus products are available in the region through Azlan offices in Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

Exertis appoints Business Intelligence Manager 
                2017-07-31
United Kingdom: broadliner Exertis has appointed Jonathan Wagstaff to the newly created position of Business Intelligence Manager. Based in Basingstoke with a European remit, his role will help to identify trends in the technology market, including new technologies, significant new market players (vendors, customers, operators, and others) and the impact of these new technologies on the distribution space. He will report to Stephen Casey, Finance & Development Director at DCC Technology.
"I am delighted to welcome Jonathan to Exertis. Exertis has undergone a successful period of growth with several key acquisitions across the Group. Whilst we have a very strong technology proposition, it's important we continue to identify and translate market opportunities into actions that can benefit our business, and also the business of our vendor partners and reseller customers both in existing and new territories. Jonathan's experience in data analytics and how the channel operates is ideally suited to fulfilling the task of providing business intelligence that can enable us to take the right decisions to meet our Group objectives", said Casey.
Wagstaff joins from Context, a leading European data analyst company that tracks sales and pricing information from within the IT channel, where he managed EMEA wide data collection projects for major ICT vendors and had responsibility for the UK and IE distribution, reseller and retail panels. He was also instrumental in setting up Context's VR Research Group and PC Gaming category tracking. Wagstaff said: "having worked at Context, I appreciate the importance of interpreting data and identifying trends, and the value that business analytics can bring to companies when making critical decisions. Data is often called the new oil; as distribution rapidly evolves and margins feel pressure its importance has shifted. Exertis is one of the largest and most successful technology distributors in Europe and their ambition to grow profitably, whilst looking for new market opportunities based on sound business intelligence, was a challenge that appealed to me."
With degrees from Oxford and Johns Hopkins Universities, Wagstaff has been a regular contributor to IT trade titles on research matters and has spoken at many industry events including the Plug In To Exertis channel event in May. He has specialist knowledge of the UK ICT supply chain and the global VR, Smart Home, and PC Gaming markets.

Avnet Silica introduces cost-optimized MiniZed platform for embedded vision and industrial IoT systems
                2017-07-31
Semiconductor and embedded computing specialist Avnet Silica has introduced the compact and cost-effective MiniZed Zynq SoC development platform. MiniZed provides an entry-level development and demonstration platform for single-core Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC devices. This cost-optimized solution supports cloud connectivity and industrial IoT applications such as motor control and embedded vision. Showcasing the power of the Zynq-7000S SoC device family, which features a single-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor paired with 28nm Artix-7 based programmable logic, MiniZed represents the lowest cost entry point to the scalable Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC development platform. MiniZed's compact design – small enough to fit into a shirt pocket – features on-board connectivity through USB, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Peripherals can be plugged into dual Pmod-compatible connectors, the Arduino-compatible shield interface or the USB 2.0 host interface. User LEDs, a button and a switch allow for a physical board interface, while JTAG circuitry is incorporated onto the MiniZed base board. Tutorials use the on-board microphone as an example input to demonstrate how to easily implement filters and FFTs in the fabric. The on-board eMMC (8GB) provides convenient storage for the OS, files and logs. The MiniZed platform is supported by the www.minized.org community website where users can collaborate with other engineers also working on Zynq designs. It is available through Avnet Silica offices in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
