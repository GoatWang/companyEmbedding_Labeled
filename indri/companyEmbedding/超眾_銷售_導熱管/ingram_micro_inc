It sells products and services only to IT resellers, from manufacturers such as Acer Inc., Apple, Cisco, Brocade Communications Systems, Ruckus Wireless, Veeam Software, Google, Hewlett-Packard ("HP"), IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Samsung ... The company ranks 64th in the 2016 Fortune 500.

History[edit]




Softeurop logo 1989


In 1989 Ingram Micro, then called "Ingram Micro-D", was a subsidiary of the privately owned Ingram Industries group, took over the Belgian Softinvest and its three Softeurop subsidiaries active on the Belgian, the French and the Dutch markets from Brussels, Lille and Utrecht. This was Ingram's first foray outside the United States other than a few Ingram Industries subsidiaries. The company embarked on an active merge, acquisitions and foundation strategy in the European market.[citation needed]
In August 1993, Ingram Micro Belgium acquired Zaventem Electronic Dealer Distribution (Zedd) and much of its assets including the right to distribute Hewlett Packard products.[citation needed]
In July 2005 Ingram Micro purchased AVAD, LLC, a wholesale distributor for home automation and A/V gear.[3] It sold this subsidiary in July 2016.[4]
The Shared Services Center in Manila, Philippines, began operations in May 2009.
Ingram Micro built a presence in areas adjacent to its traditional distribution business, including enterprise computing, automatic identification and data capture (AIDC); point-of-sale (POS); managed, professional and warranty maintenance services; mobility; physical security; and consumer electronics.[citation needed]
Other ventures in 2014 included entry into cloud computing, or software-, platform- and infrastructure-as-a-service.[5]
In June 2014, Ingram Micro changed their logo and introduced a new tagline: “Ingram Micro helps businesses realize the promise of technology”.[6]
In December 2015, Ingram Micro acquired Odin Service Automation platform from Parallels [7] for $163.9 mln.[8]
In February 2016, Ingram Micro was acquired by Chinese listed company Tianjin Tianhai Investment, a subsidiary of mega conglomerate HNA Group, for $6 Billion. It was reported at the time that Alain Monié, Ingram's chief executive, would remain in place. Bharat Bhisé, indirect minority owner of HNA Group, as well as HNA Group director Tan Xiangdong, were also elected into the 7-men board directors of Ingram Micro.[9] The transaction reportedly made Ingram the biggest revenue generator for HNA Group. The strategic reason for the transaction was to better reach “business opportunities in emerging markets, which have higher growth rates and better profitability.” HNA Group's logistics and its presence in China was intended to help Ingram's growth.[2]
Notable employees[edit]
Former U.S. Congressman Chris Lee once worked at Ingram Micro.[10] A former member of the German-Turkish group Sürpriz who represented Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, Bülent Ural, currently works as a sales consultant for Ingram Micro's German branch.[11]

The 430EXII is the ultimate Speedlite for enthusiast DSLR photographers. Shorter recycling time (approx 20% shorter than the 430EX)offers users advanced speed capabilities, whilst silent recycling helps in discreet situations such as weddings. All settings can now be controlled via the camera's menu system (as well as the Speedlite) and the connectivity to the camera has been improved with a new quick-lock mechanism and metal foot mounting.
