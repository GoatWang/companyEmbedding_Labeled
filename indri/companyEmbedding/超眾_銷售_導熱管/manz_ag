Offer Profile
Manz AG in Reutlingen, 
	Germany, is a leading global high-tech equipment manufacturer. 
	Over the past 
	few years, the company has developed from an automation specialist to a 
	provider of integrated system solutions for the production of crystalline 
	silicon solar cells and thin-film solar modules, as well as the 
	manufacturing of flat panel displays. A new business area is the 
	development and manufacture of production systems for lithium-ion 
	batteries.











Product Portfolio
Crystalline Solar CellsThe conversion of sunlight into electrical energy is 
	carried out in solar cells, the core component of photovoltaic equipment. 
	The process of manufacturing this equipment includes a variety of steps – 
	from extracting silicon to manufacturing the modules. Within the value chain 
	of manufacturing crystalline solar cells, Manz AG focuses on the third 
	stage: the process of going from wafer to cell.
	Almost all of the world’s larger manufacturers use Manz systems for 
	manufacturing solar cells. Our core areas include:
	- Automation
	- Test & Inspection
	- Metallization Lines
	- Laser Processing Technology
	- Wet Chemistry
	- Vacuum Technology
	When developing new processes, our focus is on the economical manufacture of 
	solar cells. Doing so means Manz has a hand in increasing efficiency and 
	cutting costs in the field of photovoltaics. In conjunction with 
	high-performance image-processing systems, precise and fast robotic systems 
	allow for takt times of under one second with minimal breakage rates. With 
	throughput of 2,400 wafers per hour, our integrated 60 MW back-end line is 
	currently the fastest production line on the market for the metallization 
	(screen printing), laser edge isolation, inspection, and sorting of solar 
	cells.
	Within this third stage of the value chain, Manz AG’s products cover 
	approximately 70% of all investments made.
	
	PDF catalogAutomation - automation made by manzmore infoManz AG 
	offers economical in-line automation systems for the manufacture of 
	crystalline solar cells: These systems range from those that load and unload 
	processing machines to complete automation solutions with integrated buffer 
	systems and the ability to connect them to central manufacturing computer 
	systems. Precise and fast robotic systems connected with high-performance 
	image-processing systems ensure that breakage rates remain low while machine 
	availability remains high. With tact times of less than a second, equipment 
	with a total yearly output of up to 100 MW can be manufactured using only 
	one production line.
	The SpeedPicker is a new automation system which was specially developed for 
	the requirements of the solar market. 
	Compared to other systems in the market, the system is the most powerful in 
	terms of:
	- Space: 50 % reduction
	- After sales costs: 50 % reduction
	- Investment: 50 % reduction
	- Safe wafer handling with lowest breakage rates of 0.05%
	- 0.5% lower breakage rate than competitive products
	Manz’s standard systems include:
	- Loading and unloading of cleaning and texturing equipment
	- Loading and unloading of diffusion equipment
	- Loading and unloading of PSG etching equipment
	- Loading and unloading of anti-reflective coating equipment (the SiNA® 
	series, for example)
	- In-line box buffer systems with a capacity of up to 10,000 cellsTest & Inspection - quality made by manzmore infoTesting and measuring wafers and cells during 
	manufacturing is an important means of controlling the quality of 
	manufactured cells. Even the tiniest mechanical defects in the cells – such 
	as micro-cracks, for example – can have a negative impact on the efficiency 
	of the entire module or render it completely unusable. For the purposes of 
	quality control, Manz manufactures complete wafer testing systems, which are 
	used by wafer manufacturers for their end-of-line inspection and by cell 
	manufacturers for their receiving inspections. The testers and sorters are 
	characterized by their modular design and can be equipped with a variety of 
	testing and measuring systems:
	- Testing the wafer’s geometry
	- Testing for micro-cracks
	- Measuring the wafer’s level of contamination
	- Measuring the electrical resistance and carrier lifetime
	- Measuring the thickness of the wafers and the total thickness variation
	- Measuring the saw marks
	- Measuring bow and warp
	After further production steps, the cell-testing and -sorting modules in the 
	back-end area of the plant measure the various levels of quality and sort 
	each cell into the designated module class. The cell testers are suitable 
	for both end-of-line inspections after manufacturing cells as well as for 
	carrying out receiving inspections when manufacturing modules. The system 
	can be equipped with the following testing and measuring systems:
	- I/V measurement (sun simulator)
	- Measuring with electroluminescence
	- Front-side printing inspection
	- Back-side printing inspection
	- Color measurementMetallization - contacts made by manzmore infoMetallization – i.e. printing a conductive layer onto 
	cells – is an important process in the manufacture of crystalline solar 
	cells.
	In this area, Manz offers both high-output printing systems as individual 
	modules, as well as a complete back-end line. With a throughput rate of 
	2,400 cells per hour in a single production line, these tools have the 
	following integrated processes in addition to the actual printing process:
	- Automation/loading with integrated micro-crack inspection
	- Front-side printing with integrated printing inspection
	- Back-side printing with integrated printing inspection
	- Drying furnace
	- Firing furnace
	- Laser edge isolationCell tester and sorter with
	- I/V measurement (sun simulator)
	- Electroluminescence measurement (automated detection of micro-cracks, 
	process control)
	- Inspection of front-side printing
	- Inspection of back-side printing
	- Color measurementLaser Processing Technology - efficiency made by manzmore infoManz AG is working intensively on new methods to 
	increase both the efficiency of solar cells and throughput rates, while at 
	the same cutting solar cell manufacturing costs.
	To do so, Manz AG uses high-efficiency laser processes which can be used 
		to achieve this goal.
		To generate a selective emitter, Manz AG uses a laser-based procedure 
		developed by the IPE (University of Stuttgart Institute for Physical 
		Electronics). With this technology, using an additional laser-processing 
		step, the level of doping under the contact structure which is applied 
		in a later stage of the process is increased significantly.
		In conjunction with Manz’s HAP (high-accuracy printer), an increase in 
		the solar cell’s efficiency of up to 0.5% can be achieved. During the 
		development of these systems, Manz took steps to ensure that existing 
		cell production lines could be upgraded.
		Manz’s laser systems can also be used in other process steps:
		- Laser edge isolation
		- Laser drilling to generate back-contact cells such as MWT and EWT
		- Opening dielectric layersWet Chemistry - wet chemistry made by manzmore infoManz offers newly developed wet chemical solutions for 
	manufacturing crystalline solar cells. This includes the manufacturing 
	stages of cleaning, saw damage removal, texturing, phosphosilicate glass 
	removal, and one-sided etching processes. In this context, Manz uses 
	experience and expertise from Manz Asia, which has been focused on the 
	manufacture of wet chemical equipment for over 20 years. Manz Asia is the

	PDF catalogAutomation - thin-film automation made by manzmore infoManz can look back on a long, successful history of 
	providing automation solutions for the FPD industry. Our automation 
	solutions have now been on the market for 15 years. And Manz has been 
	successfully applying exactly this expertise to the field of photovoltaics 
	for many years. Our customers are the ones who can truly profit from the 
	benefits of this long-term experience: Manz has well-engineered, advanced 
	and innovative solutions at its disposal for handling glass substrates, 
	which are primarily characterized by the low level of maintenance they 
	require and their high level of process stability.
	The equipment’s low operating costs and high productivity – as a result of 
	low tact times and minimal breakage rates – both play significant roles in 
	contributing to a successful manufacturing process.
	Our automation solutions, which were developed, together with the Fraunhofer 
	Institute, especially for use in clean-rooms, have become a well-known and 
	established part of the photovoltaic industry over the past few years.
	- Handling of all major substrates for thin-film solar modules with 6-axis 
	robots
	- Buffer systems
	- Conveyor systems
	- Loading and unloading of trolleys
	Our newly developed concept of a central automation corridor for Fab 
	automation provides many advantages:
	- Saving of storage space due to „chaotic storage“
	- Higher flexibility: the central robot unit reaches every substrate 
	cassette very quickly. This leads to shorter cycle times.
	- Cost advantage: the enclosed cassette stations can be purged with inert 
	gas or dry air. This reduces the clean room class requirements for the 
	entire Fab.
	- The central automation corridor is modular and can be extended as 
	required. It can also be applied to different glass sizes.Scribing Equipment - Laser & mechanical scribing by 
	manzmore infoManz’s 
		scribing systems are optimized for the highest level of precision – for 
		every scribing process needed during the manufacture of thin-film solar 
		modules. And Manz’s equipment can be used for both high-precision 
		mechanical (P2, P3 for CI(G)S substrates) as well as laser-assisted (P1, 
		P2, and P3) scribing. During the manufacturing process, active tracking 
		(Manz’s Inline Precision Control System) allows dead areas to be reduced 
		by 150 µm–300 µm, a new milestone compared to other systems on the 
		market. Doing so significantly increases the efficiency of the solar 
		modules.
		Low operating costs are just one of the many benefits of Manz’s scribing 
		equipment. High throughput and maximum efficiency are valued by 
		long-term Manz clients. This is primarily the result of the parallel 
		processing, which allows tact times to be reduced while still 
		maintaining the high level of quality.
		Another notable characteristic, in addition to the high-precision 
		processes and the high quality of the products, is the equipment’s 
		sophisticated and flexible design. It allows the equipment to be easily 
		integrated in completely automated production lines.

	pieces of equipment delivered and installed, Manz Asia is one the largest 
	suppliers of cleaning and etching equipment for the FPD and PCB industry, 
	which gives the Manz Group access to extensive expertise in the field of wet 
	chemistry.
	Using this expertise, Manz has developed innovative wet chemical equipment 
	for manufacturing thin-film solar modules. This includes systems for 
	cleaning glass substrates and systems for pre-etching the TCO layer.
	Both systems are characterized by a number of benefits in comparison to 
	conventional equipment: Their compact size and modular design allow the 
	machines to be integrated into existing production lines efficiently and in 
	a way that saves space. Both glass-cleaning and TCO etching systems are 
	available for all common substrate sizes. It goes without saying that the 
	systems were designed for maximum throughput and productivity and that they 
	fulfill the highest demands of the PV industry. The systems’ well-engineered 
	design reduces the need for consumable parts and cuts operating costs.Laser Edge Isolation and Laser Cutting - 
	laser edge ablation made by manzmore infoAn extremely reliable laser edge ablation process is required to 
		manufacture high-quality thin-film solar modules. This process, which is 
		carried out prior to laminating the glass cover, ensures that the coated 
		glass is well isolated.
		Conventional methods of edge ablation, such as sandblasting or grinding 
		the edge, require a lower initial investment; however, due to their high 
		operating costs, they are less economical over the long term. In 
		addition, the edge ablation process using these methods has drawbacks – 
		such as reduced product quality and productivity.
	In comparison, laser edge ablation equipment from Manz has been a fixture on 
	the market for many years, and is well known for its extremely high level of 
	performance and reliability. Cutting rates of up to 60 cm²/s can be achieved 
	with these systems. During the laser edge isolation process, the glass is 
	neither damaged nor negatively affected. High process accuracy, cost 
	effectiveness, and low tact times are the decisive advantages of Manz’s 
	laser edge ablation systems, which can be used for all currently available 
	thin-film substrate sizes.Manz CIGSfabManz is the only 
	supplier of an integrated and fully-productive turn-key production line for 
	CIGS modules that generates profit.
