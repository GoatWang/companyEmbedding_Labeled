Supermicro Hyper-Speed Solutions with new Hyper-Turbo mode 







 Hyper-Speed Solutions
                Supermicro delivers world-record performance with its compute speed and memory bandwidth capabilities while providing enterprise class reliability for mission critical applications.  Built upon the X10DRU-X and X10DAX series motherboards, Supermicro is able to enhance the highest performance Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4/v3 (165W+) processors and DDR4 with its proprietary Hyper-Speed hardware acceleration technology, achieving application performance improvements up to 78% faster than the previous generation.
				X10 Hyper-Speed also introduces Hyper-Turbo mode, allowing more power to be delivered to the CPUs for intense workloads to maximize the CPU Turbo Mode frequency.  With the Low-Latency optimized SKUs, CPU frequency can be maximized indefinitely.  Without Hyper-Turbo, most workloads will see a drop in frequency within seconds.

List of memory tested at Hyper-Speed.  Low latency/jitter optimization guide here.

                





 Introducing Hyper-Speed Ultra: Industry's highest performance and most flexible server architecture
                New to the X10 generation is the Hyper-Speed Ultra platform, combining record-setting Hyper-Speed technology with the evolutionary Ultra system architecture, providing unparalleled flexibility, scalability, manageability, and serviceability.  In a dense 1U form factor, Hyper-Speed Ultra provides 4 Add-On Cards with GPU/FPGA support, while still being able to achieve 165W CPU support, and is targeted to Low-Latency Trading and High-Frequency Trading applications.  In a 2U form factor, expansion is increased to 6 Add-On cards with the ability to support 4 GPU/Xeon Phi cards, and is targeted to Remote Workstations, EDA license servers, and single-node High Performance Computing.
