The BE Semiconductor Industries cash flow statement is one of the three reports that the company generates every quarter.  While its important to look at the BE Semiconductor Industries debt position, the cash flow statement becomes equally important because public companies use accrual accounting.  For example, if a company sells a product which gets counted as BE Semiconductor Industries revenue  but does not convert to cash because it does not receive payment in the same quarter, it affects the cash position for that period.  BE Semiconductor Industries stock analysis shows positive net income cash flow of $83.18M for 2016.  This statement is important because profits alone cannot pay employees, or bills.  Cash is required.   BESIY decrease in investments stood at a negative value of $-12.41M for the latest 2016.
