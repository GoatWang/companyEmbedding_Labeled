Providing Total Semiconductor Business Based on Global Sales and Support Structures.
As a devices business unit, Marubun provides total solutions in the semiconductor business from marketing to technology support and delivery. Based on a business model that emphasizes close ties with customers at the point of contact between customers and suppliers, we strive for parts and materials procurement that provides benefits to our customers. We monitor customer product development trends and production plans and provide, in a timely manner, usefully technology information and support functions that anticipate the timing of this shift from design to commercialization. In addition, management structures made up of large-scale distribution centers and cutting-edge information systems achieve justin- time and stable supply of products. Marubun began importing and selling ICs immediately after their invention and in 1965 was the first company to successfully introduce integrated circuits to the Japanese market, playing a major role in the effective start of Japan's electronics industry. Based on this past performance and expertise, Marubun has become a trusted business partner.

Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
