IL CODICE DELLA PRIVACY - Dlgs 196/03
INFORMAZIONI GENERALI
Il Dlgs n. 196/03 tutela il trattamento dei dati personali delle persone fisiche e giuridiche.
Ai sensi dell'art. 4 del predetto decreto, "TRATTARE" I DATI significa svolgere operazioni, con o senza l'ausilio di mezzi elettronici o comunque automatizzati, riguardanti la raccolta, la registrazione, l'organizzazione, la conservazione, l'elaborazione, la modificazione, la selezione, l'estrazione, il raffronto, l'utilizzo, l'interconnessione, il blocco, la comunicazione, la diffusione, la cancellazione e la distruzione dei dati medesimi. Con l'espressione "DATI PERSONALI" il legislatore si riferisce ad ogni informazione relativa a persona fisica, persona giuridica, ente od associazione, identificati o identificabili, anche indirettamente, mediante riferimento a qualsiasi altra informazione, ivi compreso un numero di identificazione personale.
I dati personali devono essere trattati in modo lecito, secondo correttezza e devono essere conservati per il tempo strettamente necessario al raggiungimento delle finalità per cui sono stati raccolti.
Quanto ai principali soggetti richiamati dal Dlgs 196/03 possiamo sintetizzare come segue. Anzitutto si parla di INTERESSATO riferendosi alla persona fisica o giuridica cui si riferiscono i dati personali. Il decreto considera l'interessato come soggetto tutelato ed a tal fine gli attribuisce una pluralità di diritti (es. il diritto di ottenere informazioni relativamente ai dati ed ai trattamenti effettuati, il diritto di chiedere la cancellazione, la trasformazione in forma anonima ovvero il blocco dei dati trattati in violazione della predetta legge, compresi quelli di cui non è più necessaria la conservazione in relazione agli scopi per i quali i dati sono stati raccolti o successivamente trattati...).
TITOLARE DEL TRATTAMENTO è la persona, fisica o giuridica, responsabile del trattamento dei dati dell'interessato. Al titolare spettano le decisioni circa le finalità e le modalità del trattamento. Il RESPONSABILE DEL TRATTAMENTO è la persona, fisica o giuridica, designata dal Titolare del trattamento, mentre l'INCARICATO è colui che tratta effettivamente i dati cui ha accesso pur senza autonomia decisionale. Il GARANTE è l'organo collegiale super partes preposto al controllo della corretta applicazione della normativa, dinanzi al quale è possibile far valere i propri diritti in via alternativa all'autorità giudiziaria.

With almost 100 years of experience in powder
metallurgy, H.C. Starck is one of the leading high-quality providers of these innovative,
high-tech, high-performance metals.Their
unique properties make refractory metals all but indispensable in our modern world.
By developing and producing customized powder morphologies and high-precision blanks and components from the refractory metals tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, and niobium, H.C. Starck makes a significant contribution to enabling cutting-edge
developments in innovative high-tech industries.

Stark Industries (NYSE: SIA, NASDAQ: STRK, fictional), later also known as Stark International, Stark Innovations, Stark/Fujikawa, Stark Enterprises and Stark Resilient, is a fictional company appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The company is depicted as being owned and run by businessman Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, also known as Iron Man. It first appeared in Tales of Suspense #40 (April 1963) and was founded by Tony's father, Howard Stark. According to Forbes 25 largest fictional companies it had an estimated sales of $20.3 billion, ranking it at number 16.[1][2] In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Stark Industries has a logo similar to that of defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman[3] and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as SIA. During the press conference scene, Stark is seen entering a building that resembles the entrance to Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility. An airplane extremely similar to the Lockheed YF-22 stood as a statue in front of the Stark Industries facility, exactly like the prototypes on display at Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California.

H.C. Starck expects sustained recovery of core markets in 2017
Far-reaching cost reductions compensate part of decrease in sales in 2016Group annual sales at 688.4 million eurosNew corporate legal structure successfully implementedMunich, April 5th, 2017.
 H.C. Starck, one of the leading manufacturers of customer-specific 
powders and components made from technology metals and advanced 
ceramics, expects to see a sustained recovery of its core markets in the
 2017 fiscal year. During the past fiscal year 2016, sales were down due
 to the tough market environment and decreases in the prices of raw 
materials. With an overall value of 688.4 million euros, the annual 
turnover remained below the previous year’s figure of 815.2 million 
euros. As of December 31, 2016, the company had about 2,600 employees 
worldwide (2015: about 2,700).
