		Twitter Might BeTroubled, But it’s Still Undervalued

Befitting an industry that has become worth hundreds of billions of dollars in just ten years, the social media space has become a wee bit competitive. And as with any competitive industry, winners can become losers quicker than you can say “new paradigm.”

	Hello, Friendster! Goodbye, Friendster! Hello, MySpace! Goodbye, MySpace! Hello Twitter  (TWTR) ! Goodbye…

	Not so fast.

	Twitter had been looking pretty rough the last couple months. Growth was slowing significantly, and the stock was halved on major concerns that Twitter’s platform had committed the cardinal sin of social media: it had become passé. But passé doesn’t mean dead, and in fact Twitter still has room to grow.

	Dealing With a Sea Change in Online Communication

	As opposed to the open share-everything ethos of early Facebook  (FB)  and Twitter, social media usage is definitely trending towards selectivity and privacy. Think Snapchat and other “disappearing” messaging/social media apps. 

 

	But Twitter is still in the monetization phase, and there is little chance of the monumental, sudden collapse of Friendster and MySpace. While the stock did become overvalued, the correction was far too sharp, something we surmised on May 8, when we noted Twitter looked oversold at $31.96 a share.

	Shares got as low as $29.56, but that has, for the time being, proven to be the bottom. From those dark times, the summer started looking a lot sunnier for the microblogging service.

	Bring Out the Twitter Bulls

	Analysts have been tending to agree. On May 16 Wunderlich upgraded shares of Twitter from Sell to Hold. Hardly a ringing endorsement, but they certainly agreed that the stock was no longer a sinking stone.

	On May 28 Nomura was even more bullish, upgrading to Buy and reiterating a $43 price target, or a more than 30 percent premium on shares. Analyst Anthony DiClemente noted that Nomura “believed ‘enough is enough’ and that the current price offers investors a unique opportunity to own a now-underappreciated digital media asset."

	DiClemente’s argument for being optimistic on Twitter isn’t just about a market overreaction. He expects Twitter’s user monetization to eventually catch up to Facebook. Despite slowing growth, Facebook has been exemplary at getting users to stay on the site longer while better targeting ads, both recipes for success in social media.

	Twitter still has a litany of problems to work out: product diversification; user growth; simplifying the service to increase broad appeal. But for the time being, investors are willing to give Twitter the benefit of the doubt that while their brand might not be Snapchat, they’re certainly not ready to “get MySpaced.”

	On news of Nomura’s upgrade, shares of Twitter rose 10.64 percent to hit $33.76 a share.

Deals of the day- Mergers and acquisitions






22 February, 2016
























 (Adds Sysco, Cargill, Verizon, Ahold and Delhaize and Wirecard; Updates EFG International) Feb 22 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1500 GMT on Monday: 



    
    
    ** Sysco Corp  , the largest U.S. food distributor, said it will buy London-based food distributor Brakes Group from Bain Capital Private Equity in a transaction valued at about $3.1 billion to strengthen its presence in Europe.  ** U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill  said it had reached an agreement to sell its industrial chocolate production unit in Mannheim, Germany, to Dutch investment companies Nimbus and Varova. The price of the deal and the capacity of Mannheim's activities were not disclosed.

    ** Verizon Communications Inc  , the No.1 U.S. wireless phone provider, said it would buy XO Communications' fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion.  ** Retailers Ahold  and Delhaize  said they had proposed to sell a "limited number" of stores in Belgium in a bid to win regulatory approval from the country's competition authority for their merger.  ** German payment services payment provider Wirecard  said it had bought smaller Brazilian peer Moip Pagamentos SA from venture capital fund Ideiasnet SA  and management for 23.5 million euros ($26 million) in cash.  ** HSBC   has decided to retain its Turkish operations after the offers it received for the unit were deemed not to be in the best interest of shareholders, Group CEO Stuart Gulliver said in a statement.  ** EnQuest  and Cairn Energy  said they had acquired an additional 10.5 percent and 4.5 percent stake in First Oil in the North Sea Kraken field after the company put its assets up for sale.  ** EFG International  has agreed to buy Brazilian financial company Grupo BTG Pactual SA's Swiss private bank BSI for 1.33 billion Swiss francs ($1.34 billion) in cash and shares, a deal it hopes will propel it into the top five in Switzerland's crowded wealth management market.  ** China's Tsinghua Unigroup's $2.6 billion offer for stakes in three Taiwanese chip firms will undergo unprecedented scrutiny by a new government less friendly towards its giant neighbour, complicating the chance of success.  ** French media group Vivendi  has increased its stake in Telecom Italia to 22.8 percent, a regulatory filing showed, further strengthening its position as the top shareholder in the Italian phone group.   ** U.S. satellite imagery provider DigitalGlobe Inc  created a joint venture on Sunday with two Saudi Arabian organizations to develop a network of small satellites that will be eventually be able to revisit key areas of the globe 40 times a day.  ** Two years after it first flagged a sale, Australia's Victoria state threatened to bypass parliament to privatise the Port of Melbourne, the nation's biggest container port, if lawmakers could not agree to sale terms.  ** Bahrain's Batelco  has cancelled plans to sell Jordanian telecom operator Umniah, the former monopoly's chief executive told Reuters, citing market conditions as it instead aims to make acquisitions itself.  ** Sharp Corp  plans to choose between rival rescue offers as soon as Thursday, as a favoured bid from Taiwan's Foxconn continues to be challenged by a Japanese state-backed investment fund, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
