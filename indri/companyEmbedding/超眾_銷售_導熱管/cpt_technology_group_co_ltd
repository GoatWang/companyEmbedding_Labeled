CPT Drives and Power Public Co.,Ltd. – Hi-technology electronic products for electronic control system of factory










































































































Our History
More than 20 years ago, Thailand started industrialization from an agricultural society. Initially, many industries had production capacity only sufficient for domestic use in order to decrease imports. Afterwards, the industries started developing for export purposes but were hardly successful due to low production capacity and unreliable product quality caused by out of date machines and insufficient personnel skillful in efficient machine control.
At the same time, many industries in developed countries had focused in developing technology innovation through application of automation machinery in manufacturing process. In addition, the hot weather and humidity of Thailand caused unreliability to control the machines. Therefore, international technical support was necessary to solve problems and improve productivity resulting in high cost and delays due to the travelling.
CPT Drives and Power Public Company Limited (established in 1995), set up by an experienced Thai Engineering Team with sufficient expertise from well-known companies worldwide, with the aim to provide the same quality of technical support with affordable cost.
Presently CPT has developed into a public company providing a full-range of services and teams, including a design team and an engineer production team. With the strength of providing power and control modules combined with high quality products, CPT has been accepted by customers and has become the major provider in the Thai Industry. CPT has a proven record of winning tenders against worldwide companies in many projects not only in Thailand but also internationally.
Our Mission
Become the Leader in ASEAN
Our aim is to be one of the leaders in design and installation of machinery and electric control systems with respect to price, technology, quality and service. We also aim to improve and upgrade existing technology and inculcate innovation particularly in energy saving and automation production processes.

 
Sales Growth
Expanding to international markets, energy production and other target groups, through establishment of dealerships in Asian Countries.
In the near future, being part of the ASEAN Economic Community is unavoidable, leading to more opportunities and overall increase in market demand. The manufacturers’ competitiveness will be a major factor in market competition. Hence lower cost and more efficiency of production are urgent necessities for manufacturers. Therefore, modern technology in machine control will be an effective solution which is in line with CPT’s direct experience of implementing old machine upgrading and new machine control systems.

 
Product Innovation
Develop new high quality products to improve competitiveness by creating new assembly lines for high specification and to elevate the production process.
Due to rapid changes in technology, CPT has continuously researched and developed innovative solutions in order to conform with technology and product changes. As a result, CPT can offer the appropriate solutions to suit various aspects of clients’ requirements.
 
Team Development
Develop human resources by providing internal, external and overseas training to improve skills and knowledge.
With being in this area of business for a long time and with many experienced engineers, we are ready to provide training to customers in our office, in customer’s factory and facilitate on the job training.

Lee Ann Morgan

I have had business dealings with CPT since the beginning of 2002. The Management and staff of CPT are a professional and extremely pleasant team to have dealings with. 
CPT understand the customer requirements in Production industries, and will do out of their way to fulfill the needs of their customers. The knowledge provided by CPT will assist in guiding any students towards a successful future career. 
I would recommend CPT to any individual in their private capacity or an organisation that requires employees to be trained in a specific field, as I have experienced the excellent service that CPT has provided me for many years in the past and I'm convinced for many years still to come in the future.


Eric Botha
Quality Manager, McWade Productions (Pty) Ltd



It all started as a dream and CPT helped me realise that dream.  Studying at CPT is a motivation itself, it helped me distinguish myself amongst the rest and add value to both my life and my organisation.  I can only say “Thanx CPT, this was just the beginning”.


Aaron Maubane
Diplomat of the Year 2005



The CPT training interventions have laid a sounds foundation for further career development and promotional opportunities.  The learners / employees have learnt the benefits to approach business issues in most dynamic, structured and systematic way.  Since the inception of CPT interventions, I am proud to announce that 2 of our learners were offered promotions.


Vincent Molekoa
HR Training Manager, Assa Abloy



The measure of a successful development programme is not about the number of certificates obtained but in the added value that the individuals contribute to the business.  The CPT First Line Management programme has made a significant contribution to development and performance of young managers in the Cadbury PE business.


Peter Phillips
Manufacturing Capability Manager, Cadbury South Africa



I would like to thank CPT for the training given to the selected Interroll employees to date.  As management we can already see a difference in attitude towards the work and fellow employees of these students  A few changes in processess and material flow has already been implemented and more is in progress.  It is heartening to see what a difference it makes when people start to look outside the box and actually implement what they have been taught.  Keep up the good work.


Peet du Plessis
Production and Operations Manager, Interroll



I would like to extend Bandag Southern Africa’s appreciation to the College of Production Technology for their expertise and professionalism in training recipients for the manufacturing fraternity.  I have had the opportunity of interacting with a few of their lecturers and appreciate the vast knowledge together with their hands on knowledge of manufacturing.  We have had operators trained by this college who have become department team leaders because of their training knowledge.  We have used CPT for the past five years and intend using them to cater for our training needs in the future.


Jonathan David
Manufacturing Plant Director, Bandag South Africa



With one of our strategic initiatives to be a learning organisation, we are well on our way to realising this objective with the aid of CPT.

CPT does not teach the individual what to think, but rather how to think thus enabling self management on operator level, which brings a greater sense of responsibility and desire to take business forward.


Deon Adams
Ford Motor Company Port Elizabeth



We are pleased to inform you that the CPT Supervisory training provided to our learners was highly effective.  They have improved in terms of their attitudes, communication skills, leadership and responsibility.  The training was a real eye-opener to them and I would recommend others to attend it.
