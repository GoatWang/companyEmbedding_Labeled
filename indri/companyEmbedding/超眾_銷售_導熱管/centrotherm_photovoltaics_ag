centrotherm photovoltaics AG Wins Two iF Product Design Awards for Photovoltaic Key Equipment “c.FIRE“ and “GP ISO-TEST. Waf“
centrotherm photovoltaics AG has won two iF product design awards 2012 for its photovoltaic key equipment “c.FIRE“ and “GP ISO-TEST. Waf“. Both products, the “c.FIRE“ fast firing furnace and the wafer inspection tool “GP ISO-TEST.Waf”, impressed the international jury not only with their outstanding design but also with their functionality, innovation and environmental sustainability.

	The “c.FIRE“ fast firing furnace, in which the front and rear contacts are burned into wafers at high temperatures, is the latest generation of the established fast firing furnace and is characterized by its compact design. Besides this footprint, the installation and maintance systems have been further optimized in order to reduce the operating costs for solar cell producers. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that arise during the burning process were also taken into account: VOC treatment was fully integrated into the restructured housing, thereby enabling any solvents that are emitted to be fed back on a reliable and energy-efficient basis.

	The new “c.FIRE“ fast firing furnace also impressed a Taiwanese customer. Within a few weeks the equipment was installed, ramped-up and had passed the site acceptance test.

	The “GP ISO-TEST. Waf“ enables the quality control of wafers in the solar cell production. It monitors the insulation resistance between the front and rear side of wafers and enables contributes to the reduction of manufacturing costs in mass production. The design unifies cost optimized production and longevity.  

	„We are proud to have received this prestigious honor not only for our design but also for our technological and innovation strength“, commented Dr. Peter Fath, CTO of centrotherm photovoltaics AG. “At the same time this award is further motivation for us to continously optimize technology and equipment for the production of solar cells in order to increase cell efficiency and to make solar power even more attractive.“

	The iF product design award is one of the most prestigious industrial design awards and has been presented annually for nearly 60 vears.

BEWARE - Special Warning Notice about ExpoGuide and FAIRGuide
With the ongoing solicitations, SEMI would like to continue to alert you the two organizations soliciting internet Event Directory listing information in a misleading manner. The two organizations are Mexican based, ExpoGuide and Austrian based, FAIRGuide. This is an ongoing issue and is not related to the SEMICON Event Guide. Both the Expo-Guide.com and FAIRGuide are not endorsed or supported by SEMI Show Management. By submititing these forms, exhibitors are contracted into a three-year, non-retractable agreement with excessive fees.

Press ReleasePosted on November 03, 2009Centrotherm photovoltaics AGCentrotherm photovoltaics AG, based in Blaubeuren in southwestern Germany, is one of the world's leading technology and service-providers for the manufacturing of solar silicon and solar cells. The broad product range comprises key equipment and turnkey production lines for crystalline and thin-film solar cells. The product range is supplemented by engineering, reactors, converters and vent gas recovery systems for the manufacturing of solar silicon and equipment for the production of power Semiconductors. The company guarantees its turnkey customers key performance parameters such as production capacity, degree of efficiency and completion deadlines. The goal is to enable customers to achieve sustainable reductions in production costs, thereby making solar electricity competitive with fossil fuel sources. Already today, Centrotherm photovoltaic covers the major share of the solar value creation chain within its group of companies. The company's vision is that of a fully integrated solar factory combining all process steps, thereby allowing production and manufacturing costs to be further trimmed. Reducing costs per watt peak not only makes solar electricity competitive with fossil fuel sources, but also secures independence from state subsidies over the medium term. The company, which was founded as Centrotherm Elektrische Anlagen GmbH & Co. KG in 1979, commands over 30 years' experience in the photovoltaics sector. One of the company's particular strengths lies in its close integration of technology and process know how, which distinguishes all of its business areas. With its pilot plant at Blaubeuren in Germany, the company maintains a state-of-the-art research and development laboratory where process optimization and new technology is honed under virtually production-level conditions. centrotherm photovoltaics works together with the world's leading research institutions in order to further expand its position of technology leadership. The centrotherm photovoltaics group along with the parent company, comprises the following subsidiaries: GP Solar GmbH and GP Inspect GmbH with its focus on the solar cell area, centrotherm SiTec GmbH and Michael Glatt Maschinenbau GmbH as a center of expertise in the silicon area, centrotherm Thermal Solutions GmbH & Co KG as a specialist for thermal plant, and FHR Anlagenbau GmbH as a specialist for sputter systems used in the thin-film area. In October 2007, centrotherm photovoltaics celebrated its successful debut on the Regulated Market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt's Securities Exchange, which was followed shortly by its entry into the TecDAX stock market index. Today, the company employs over 1,100 members of staff, and operates in Europe, Asia and the USA. In the 2008 financial year, centrotherm photovoltaics achieved earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of approximately EUR 56 million on revenue of around EUR 375 million. Further information: www.centrotherm-pv.de  The structure along the solar value-creation chain:
