AstroTurf is a brand of artificial turf playing surface. The original AstroTurf product was a short-pile synthetic turf.[1] Since the early 2000s decade, AstroTurf has marketed taller systems that utilize infill materials to better replicate natural grass.[2] The prime reason to incorporate AstroTurf on game fields is to avoid the cost of laying and maintaining natural turf and to maximize hours of usage. Today AstroTurf is a member of the SportGroup, a family of sports surfacing companies.[3]

History[edit]




AstroTurf installation at Boston College's Alumni Stadium


The original AstroTurf brand product was co-invented in 1965 by Donald L. Elbert, James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright. It was patented in 1965 and originally sold under the name "ChemGrass." It was re-branded as AstroTurf by a company employee named John A. Wortmann after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome stadium in 1966.[4]
Early iterations of the short pile turf swept the major stadia, but the product did need improvement. Concerns over directionality and traction led Monsanto's R&D department to implement a texturized nylon system. By imparting a crimped texture to the nylon after it was extruded, the product became highly uniform.
In 1987, Monsanto consolidated its AstroTurf management, marketing, and technical activities in Dalton, Georgia, as AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1988, Balsam AG purchased all the capital stock of AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1994, Southwest Recreational Industries, Inc. (SRI) acquired the AstroTurf brand. In 1996, SRI was acquired by American Sports Products Group Inc. (ASPG).
While AstroTurf was the industry leader throughout the late 20th century, other companies emerged in the early 2000s. FieldTurf, AstroTurf's chief competitor in the early 2000s and today, marketed a product of tall pile polyethylene turf with infill. This third generation turf, as it became known, changed the landscape of the marketplace. Although SRI successfully marketed AstroPlay, a third generation turf product, increased competition gave way to lawsuits. In 2000, SRI was awarded $1.5 million in a lawsuit after FieldTurf was deemed to have lied to the public by making false statements regarding its own product and making false claims about AstroTurf and AstroPlay products.[5]
Despite their legal victory, increased competition took its toll. In 2004, SRI declared bankruptcy.[6] Out of the bankruptcy proceedings, Textile Management Associates, Inc. (TMA) of Dalton, Georgia, acquired the AstroTurf brand and other assets. TMA began marketing the AstroTurf brand under the company AstroTurf, LLC. In 2006, General Sports Venue (GSV) became TMA's marketing partner for the AstroTurf brand for the American market. AstroTurf, LLC handled the marketing of AstroTurf in the rest of the world.[7]
In 2009, TMA acquired GSV in order to enter the marketplace as a direct seller. AstroTurf, LLC focused its efforts on research and development, which has promoted rapid growth. AstroTurf introduced new product features and installation methods, including AstroFlect (a heat reduction technology)[8] and field prefabrication (indoor, climate-controlled inlaying).[9] AstroTurf also introduced a product called "RootZone" consisting of crimped fibers designed to encapsulate infill.[10] This product has been adopted by many professional organizations and colleges in the United States.[11]
In 2016, SportGroup Holding announced that it would purchase AstroTurf, along with its associated manufacturing facilities. The AstroTurf brand now operates in North America as AstroTurf Corporation.[12]
Product and installation timeline[edit]
1960s[edit]
1964

The Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, installs ChemGrass.[13][14]

1966

First major installation of AstroTurf (ChemGrass) at the Houston Astrodome indoor stadium for the Houston Astros. The infield portion was in place before opening day in April; the outfield was installed in early summer.

1967

AstroTurf is first installed in an outdoor stadium—Memorial Stadium at Indiana State University in Terre Haute.[15]

1968

AstroTurf manufacturing facility opens in Dalton, Georgia.[16]

1969

The backyard of The Brady Bunch house between the service porch and garage and under Tiger's kennel is covered with AstroTurf. According to script development notes, the installation firm hired by Mike to lay the turf was owned by his college roommate who had just started a landscaping business after returning from a combat tour in Vietnam with the 18th Engineer Brigade. However, in keeping with strict studio instructions no direct mention of the war in Vietnam ever appears in the script. The scene in which the installation takes place was ultimately cut and so never appears in the series.[17][18][19][20][21][22]

1970s[edit]
1970

The 1970 World Series is the first with games on AstroTurf (previously installed at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium), as the Reds play the Baltimore Orioles.[23]

The 1993 World Series was the fourth (and last) World Series to be played entirely on artificial turf, following those in 1980, 1985, and 1987, and the last to have any games played on turf until 2008.
