StantecView LargerStantec improves project coordination and collaboration with Revit® MEP, Revit® Architecture, and Revit® Structure software products.“Since adopting the Revit platform we’ve seen much more effective interaction among the disciplines during the design process—and significantly better coordination.” —Stanis Smith, Senior Vice President, Stantec The FirmFounded as a one-person engineering consulting business in 1954, Stantec has grown to become a world leader in the delivery of sustainable and innovative solutions to both public- and private-sector clients. Working from more than 100 locations throughout North America and the Caribbean, the firm’s 6,500 engineers, architects, and other employees provide a wide range of services, including planning; mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineering; architectural design; surveying; and project management. Over the years, the firm has won numerous honors, including, most recently, an international award from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Multiple Disciplines, One PlatformIn July 2006, Stantec adopted Revit® MEP building information modeling (BIM) software, an intuitive design tool that works the way mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineers think. “We adopted Revit MEP primarily because it suits our approach to integrated design,” says Stanis Smith, Senior Vice President at Stantec. Using the new software, MEP engineers can now collaborate effectively with the firm’s structural engineers and architects, who recently implemented Revit® Structure and Revit® Architecture software. A Shared Digital ModelAll of the Revit applications are all built on a common software platform, enabling the integration of key building disciplines in a shared building information model and allowing more effective communication and collaboration between all participants in the project delivery. “By working with shared Revit Architecture, Revit MEP, and Revit Structure models on our projects—the architects, engineers, and external consultants all have a clear, up-to-date vision of the project and we can all make better decisions faster,” says Bill Moore, Stantec’s Practice Technology Coordinator. The ChallengeOne of those projects was the Westin Kelowna Hotel in British Columbia, Canada. “It’s quite a large project—almost 250,000 square feet,” says Mikko Leppanen, one of the architects responsible for helping to spearhead Revit implementation at the firm’s Vancouver office. “It’s a 227-room, 20-story hotel that includes commercial retail units, a restaurant, a fitness room, commercial kitchens, a ballroom, and an outdoor pool.” The site also has an adjoining three-story parking garage. Historic Location“That makes it one of the larger, and more complex buildings to be located in the city of Kelowna,” says Leppanen. “And because the building is located in a historic part of the city, the design of the hotel had to fit into the existing historical context.” The SolutionTo perform the initial architectural work on the Westin project, Stantec used AutoCAD® software. “Then, in spring of 2006, Stantec initiated a pilot project for implementation of the Revit platform,” says Leppanen. “While continuing to use AutoCAD, the design team began to create a parallel building information model with Revit Architecture. Within a few months, the transition from AutoCAD to Revit Architecture was complete and the design team proceeded into late design development and working drawings completely in Revit.” Collaborate More EffectivelyRevit Structure greatly simplified collaboration with the external structural engineer on the Westin project. “The consultants at Glotman Simpson were very well versed in the use of Revit Structure,” says Leppanen. “That made collaboration easy.” Bypass 2D-Related ProblemsLater in the project, Stantec brought its own mechanical and electrical teams on board. “Revit MEP facilitated collaboration among all the teams on a single, fully coordinated parametric model, enabling us to deliver integrated solutions that bypassed the problems inherent in drawing-based technologies,” says Smith. Achieve Outstanding Coordination with Parametric Change Management“Revit is simply fantastic from a coordination point of view,” says Leppanen. “We were able to rely on a link between the architectural and structural models that enabled either team to make design changes with reasonable confidence that the other team’s model would be automatically updated.”Stantec also saw improvements in coordination on the 82,300-square-foot renovation and expansion of the Edmonton Art Gallery. “That was the first major project we undertook in Edmonton using Revit MEP,” says Clark. “We’re adding two floors onto the existing building and including some spectacular new architectural features.” Easily Model Vital SystemsThe team used Revit MEP to model the gallery’s state-of-the-art mechanical and electrical systems, including ductwork, visible storm water piping, and central plant equipment. The software was particularly valuable in helping the engineers quickly and precisely coordinate new duct and equipment locations throughout the gallery’s complex existing areas. Simplify Complex Design Challenges“Revit MEP absolutely helped us deal with the difficulties of blending the existing structure—and all of its underlying equipment and pipes—with the new additions,” says Mitchell. “It would have been a nightmare without the model. With the Revit MEP model, our understanding of the building is incalculably better. The way it helps us understand how the existing and new structures interrelate, and what impact the changes will have on the building systems is absolutely the greatest advantage it has provided us.” Build Better Working RelationshipsA better understanding of the project can also lead to better, more efficient working relationships among the disciplines. “Using the Revit model, we can now cut our own sections,” says Clark. “That gives us a much better picture of the building, and also cuts down on the number of requests we have to make for sections from the architects.” Create Stunning Walkthroughs“And because we used the software to create our own walkthroughs, I feel like I already know the building,” adds Clark. “It gives everyone a much better sense of how the end product will actually look to the occupants of the building. That’s tremendous, especially because it allows us to show the architects that we’re thinking aesthetically about their building—and not just about how the pipes work.” Analyze Earlier and More EffectivelyStantec engineers are particularly excited about the IES plug-in for Revit MEP. “We have a separate group that does a lot of building energy and performance analysis,” says Leppanen. “IES is their analysis software of choice.” Using the Revit-IES plug-in, engineers can quickly calculate heating and cooling loads from within Revit MEP—without tedious data reentry. Alternatively, they can import Revit model data directly into IES, and use the IES suite to carry out the full range of sustainable design analyses. “We believe that the Revit-IES plug-in will help us reduce the time it takes to model a project in IES .” Use BIM for Better DecisionsThis helps the firm venture into sustainable design in a way that it couldn’t easily do before. “The link between the Revit platform and the IES has the potential to provide us with a lot of energy analysis feedback very early in a project,” says Leppanen. “This feedback is critical in helping us to make better design decisions early on in the design process—when they have the most impact on the energy and sustainable performance of the building.” Build Sustainable SolutionsThe IES plug-in also helps the firm more easily achieve LEED certification. “An important part of our vision is to create solutions that conserve energy and reduce the need for scarce natural resources,” says Leppanen. “We have quite a few projects at various levels of LEED certification—from certified Silver to Gold. As a matter of best practice, sustainable design principles inform our projects, regardless of whether or not they will be LEED.” Easily Repurpose Design Data“One of the many reasons that I really enjoy working in Revit is that it takes very little effort to generate colored diagrams that illustrate information about the building, such as functional diagrams. Generating area calculations is also tremendously easy,” says Leppanen. “It’s just fantastic. Doing that using traditional design applications would take a huge effort. And when we need more ‘photo realistic’ images, we can always export data from the model into Autodesk VIZ.” Serve Clients Better“Our hope is that the Revit platform will let us continue to do the tasks we’re already doing—just more effectively,” says Leppanen. “In addition, there is the potential for us to offer a whole range of enhanced services that build on the Revit platform. For example, using the Revit model, we could easily provide quantity takeoffs or 3D images that would be very useful to our clients.” Exchange Information EasilyWhen working with external clients, Stantec engineers share files and information using the Autodesk® Buzzsaw® on-demand collaborative project management solution. “We have quite a large Buzzsaw site,” says Moore. “We’re using it on several major international projects, where we have to contend with multiple time zones, geographic separation of design teams, and vast amounts of data being manipulated and edited daily. Buzzsaw has virtually eliminated the need for us to ship CDs and DVDs. Not only is it much faster, but it’s also helped us cut communications costs tenfold.” AutoCAD Civil 3D Offers a Civil SolutionOther Autodesk products have helped the firm further increase efficiency. For example, several Stantec offices recently began migrating from AutoCAD® Land Desktop software to AutoCAD® Civil 3D® software, a comprehensive product for the design, analysis, and documentation of a wide range of civil engineering project types. “Civil 3D enables us to get things done much faster and more efficiently for our clients,” says David Kasha, Practice Technology Coordinator. “For example, we can look at more design alternatives, a lot more quickly, and also make late-stage revisions much faster.” Unify Design TeamsThe dynamic civil model at the core of AutoCAD Civil 3D also makes it easy to enforce CAD standards. “For example, if our Toronto office delivers a model to our Calgary office, and it’s not quite right—let’s say the styles are wrong—all we have to do is drag the correct styles from the Calgary template drawings into the new drawings,” says Kasha. “That’s a huge benefit to us in terms of worksharing.” The ResultSince adopting Buzzsaw, Civil 3D, and the Revit platform in some of the firm’s offices, Stantec has begun to expand implementation of the products across the enterprise. “We absolutely view these products as a potential competitive advantage as we move forward,” says Moore. ”They’re being taken very seriously within our organization. In fact, people in our other offices have begun looking for suitable Revit pilot projects for their own teams, and we also envision the entire company migrating to Civil 3D over the next two years.” Better, More Profitable Projects“Our Kelowna office is using Revit Structure on projects in conjunction with external architects,” says Moore. “Plus, in Regina, we’re working on a university project that involves both Revit Structure and Revit Architecture. One of the largest projects currently under way is in Toronto. Our office there is taking on three $100-million-plus health-care facilities—all using Revit Architecture.” Greater RecognitionRecently, Autodesk honored Stantec with the Revit BIM Experience Award for effective integration of the entire Revit BIM platform—with both in-house multidisciplinary groups and external project team members. The award also recognizes advanced implementation of Revit MEP for improved design coordination, informed design decision making, and integration with analysis applications. Pacific Alliance TechnologiesPacific Alliance Technologies of Vancouver, British Columbia, provided Stantec with training and implementation services for the Revit platform. “They are very knowledgeable,” says Moore. “We’d be hard-pressed to find a question that would stump them.”For additional information about these and other Autodesk products, visit www.autodesk.com/products.

Whether we are designing a commercial environment to enhance brand and drive revenue; a healthcare facility that is comfortable and supports healing; an educational or research space that sparks discovery; a transportation or aviation hub that gets you to your destination with a smile on your face; a hospitality space that makes you feel at home or a mixed use development that promotes a healthy balance of live-work-play, our goal is to apply our technical expertise and creativity to enhance everyday life. At Stantec, we’re interested in building stronger communities. How will we achieve that? We believe it will be through a focus on clients, creativity, and community.

What constitutes a rich design culture?
What drives us? Purpose, passion, and the power to affect change through design.

<p><b>Eric Weyant</b>: A culture of design really requires a lot of dialogue between people that are leading the firm and leading the direction of the firm as well as the ability to harness and take advantage of all the ideas that lots of people that work at the firm and participate at the firm have.</p>
<p><b>Amber Luther</b>: Every office seems to have their sort of uniqueness that allows them to develop their process and utilize that process on projects. When you start to use an interdisciplinary or interoffice team, that sort of evolves and becomes something entirely different.</p>
<p><b>Anton Germishuizen</b>: Design culture comes from leadership. It comes from youth. It comes from talent., and I think it comes from driving a strong dialogue in an organization on the subject.</p>
<p><b>Larry Weeks</b>: Today more than ever successful environments are multi-perspectival. I think the messy vitality that happens in places that are loved by people, that are successful and urban places – it's very difficult for one person to get that. I think the ways to get that is to entertain and nourish and fuel lots of voices coming together. I think that's one reason that we focus on lots of disciplines within our office. In fact, every individual in our office can work across these disciplines, so we speak with lots of voices.</p>
<p><b>Justin Perdue</b>: I think what's important in our healthy design culture is that you're always asking questions and you're never accepting what has been done before as the truth. You should always be looking for new ideas and making sure that you're doing it the right way, not just the way it's been done before.</p>
<p><b>Michael Moxam</b>: An environment where people feel that the dialogue around ideas is the most important thing in the office.</p>

<p><b>TITLE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Clarks Americas Headquarter Office<b></b></p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b></p>
<p>An expression of the Clarks brand, this workplace inspires creativity and fosters collaboration.</p>
<p><b>TRANSCRIPT:</b></p>
<p><b>Tammy Diorio:</b>&nbsp; Everything about what Clarks wanted to do was mix the old and the new to bring our heritage, but make it modern. We were in an old mill building. It was very industrial, which we liked, but as we grew we were very disconnected. That impacted how we could, uh, work together and collaborate. We were using a lot of space, but not very effectively. We didn't have a lot of open areas to gather and feel like one company. We made a strong effort to try to make this new building something that Clarks could be proud of and also bring Clarks into the future.</p>
<p><b>Steve Basque:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's all about that connection. The atrium brings people into the space and then we ascend up the stair, or you get off the elevator, and you can see work being done in all of the spaces around the atrium.</p>
<p><b>Tammy Diorio:</b>&nbsp; I think the biggest change is that our product was not displayed in the best way in the old building. We worked together to really develop new spaces to showcase the product and for the designers to design the product.</p>
<p><b>Steve Basque:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand craftsmanship of the product and the attention to detail was probably the most important thing that we've tried to focus on. That it doesn't have to be old to be crafted.</p>
<p><b>Steven Kelly:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understood Clarks history. You, you've got a shoe company that has been around for almost 200 years. They've got the highest grade technology available to you. They're still taking wood blocks and putting it on the wood lathe like they did 100 years ago and then machine by hand with files to perfection. So it's a great story that combined their history with their present with an eye to the future.</p>
<p><b>Tammy Diorio:</b>&nbsp; The employees have stopped me in the hallway just saying how much they love the building. They love the collaboration.</p>
<p><b>John Daine:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>For us, as the model makers, it's been a vast improvement. We've got the north light, which we didn't use to have. We used to have to close the light out with blinds because of the direct sunlight in the summer.</p>
<p><b>Patrick Grace:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a designer, what we need is definitely lots of natural light, which we are provided with here. It's nice that on each floor on each end there's a convenient little kitchenette that we all have access to with coffee. And it's great because you run into people that you may have had the opportunity to run into in the previous building. That has been a great, great change.</p>
<p><b>Donna Leung:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we've been working in this building for about six months, it really has reinvigorated everyone to work more closely together because the open nature of this building really fosters creativity and collaboration. We can go off into a little nook and come up with creative ideas, brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p><b>Gary Champion:</b>&nbsp;It's a really well thought out, well-designed building. Usually it takes some time to get familiar with the new surroundings, but when we walked in, it was immediate and you can see a significant difference in the way we operate our organization just by moving into this building. Terrific!</p>

<td width="475" valign="top"><p>Design is when you go to a project or a location and it tugs at your emotion.&nbsp; You walk in and you feel bound to the space and you can integrate into it. It’s an extremely hard thing to do but when you do it it’s really magical.</p>
</td>

</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>We know that our world is changing , I mean that’s the one constant that we have is that it will always change from what we have today. So in order to look at that future and look at that changing landscape, businesses need help from designers who are used to really looking out and creating a better future.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width="163" valign="top"><p>Christian Owens</p>
</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>That's what we're doing.&nbsp; We're designing for our communities. I think that’s what separates us.</p>
</td>

</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>It combines problem solving with thinking about everything from the client’s point of view, to the city, and the neighborhood and answering that question of “what is going to come and put all of those desires and dreams of all those different constituencies together in one place. So that others come and visit the building and say, ‘Wow. This is an amazing building.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>

</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>One thing that I think is really exciting about&nbsp; Stantec is it's a big A and big E.&nbsp; And this idea of architects and engineers working together is really exciting for me.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width="163" valign="top"><p>Anton Germishuizen</p>
</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>I think design has really come of age in the last 10 to 15 years as &nbsp;a tool to help businesses, enterprises, institutions come to grips with their challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width="163" valign="top"><p>Taryn Kinney</p>
</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>As designers, we just have that mindset, it's a problem-solving mindset.&nbsp; So businesses need that kind of thinking in order to continue moving the organization forward.</p>

</td>
</tr><tr><td width="163" valign="top"><p>Michael Banman</p>
</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>We’re part of a rich history, and we’re participating in that, we’re participating in building societies, in building communities if you will. And design excellence to me is projects that are significant enough to be remembered by the society that they’re built within, by the professions that we practiced within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width="163" valign="top"><p>Michael Moxam</p>
</td>
<td width="475" valign="top"><p>Every time I think about a project no matter how small or large, it’s about making the context, the community, the city that it’s in a better place.&nbsp; Yes, we have to solve the specific issues relative to a specific project but we have an opportunity in fact to extend beyond that and contribute in a huge way to the communities we’re in.</p>

                            We inspire and challenge preconceptions through our work, creating a culture of collaboration and purpose. The design of the built environment transcends physical form, shaping our lives, our communities, and influencing behaviors and interaction.

Our architects, interior designers and planners are with you every step of the way, from initial concept through design and construction to completion. Whether we are designing a commercial environment to enhance brand and drive revenue; a healthcare facility that is comfortable and supports healing; an educational or research space that sparks discovery; a transportation or aviation hub that gets you to your destination with a smile on your face; a hospitality space that makes you feel at home; or a mixed use development that promotes a healthy balance of live­work­play, our goal is to apply our technical expertise and creativity to enhance everyday life.

                            Transforming land into a residential or mixed-use community, or a public space with parks and trails, requires a mix of technical skill and creative vision, as well as insight into development. We merge this expertise to create value for our clients and community.

Our clients rely on us to optimize the potential of their land. Our engineers, surveyors, and transportation experts lay the groundwork for infrastructure so a community can run smoothly. Our environmental scientists restore and protect the environment. Our planners create designs using sound planning and knowledge of local regulations to navigate approvals. Our public participation experts engage stakeholders to build consensus. Landscape architects, commercial specialists, and architects design the facilities that attract and engage the public. 

Our approach to community development forms wildlife habitat, restores wetlands for future generations, and builds neighborhoods where bicyclists ride on trails and families picnic in parks. By creating unique spaces that respond to the land and the people who use them, we're bringing community to life.

                            As 2,500 environmental staff covering 20 technical specialties, we know what to look for. We know what's required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. 

Our passion for it drives our work. When we're gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we're helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we've made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site.

Whether it's preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team's got the environment down to a science.

                            Our engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) teams work throughout the thermal generation, renewable energy, and transmission and distribution markets providing customized solutions that suit our clients' needs. We determine the feasibility of power projects. We design solutions and get them built, and when the project becomes an asset, we help ensure it performs as planned through end-of-life.

Our capital cost estimates and detailed engineering and design services deliver maximum project value. Fusing local knowledge and technical expertise, our work produces power systems that are designed to meet more than technical project requirements, our designs suit your business needs.

We maintain the excellence of our designs into the project's development and beyond. Our procurement, construction and project management services are based on your specific business needs, and not a pre-determined protocol. Once built, our startup and commissioning services ensure that your project transitions into an asset seamlessly, ensuring your asset and business perform as planned

                            Projects, when successfully delivered, can strengthen your organization and the communities you serve. However, we all know that projects can be full of surprises—escalating costs, schedule delays, scope creep, or worse. But what if your project could be delivered without surprises?

Our community of program and project management specialists is passionate about achieving predictable project outcomes for our clients. By taking on projects as if they were our own, our business, technical, and project management experts work with you to strategize, plan, and implement projects that help you achieve your organization's objectives.

Our award-winning team has managed thousands of projects across all sectors—buildings like hospitals, airports, and entire university campuses; infrastructure like mass transit and water treatment facilities; energy and resource assignments like mines and wind farms. We know from experience that delivering a complex project without surprises doesn't mean there won't be challenges. But our creative approach to planning and controls can head off most problems and provide early warnings on the rest, meaning you can manage with confidence and without crisis.

                            A woman driving down the interstate to the airport where she'll board a plan to Chicago for a meeting. A teenager riding his bike over a major roadway by way of a multi-use path and pedestrian bridge. A man taking the train to visit his grandchildren. Different people, but with a shared goal: to get from Point A to Point B as quickly and safely as possible.

We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there—whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment.

And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn't equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day—because Stantec isn't just a company; we're people, with the same goals as everyone else—to get where we're going, safely and efficiently.

                            Transforming land into a residential or mixed-use community, or a public space with parks and trails, requires a mix of technical skill and creative vision, as well as insight into development. We merge this expertise to create value for our clients and community.

Our clients rely on us to optimize the potential of their land. Our engineers, surveyors, and transportation experts lay the groundwork for infrastructure so a community can run smoothly. Our environmental scientists restore and protect the environment. Our planners create designs using sound planning and knowledge of local regulations to navigate approvals. Our public participation experts engage stakeholders to build consensus. Landscape architects, commercial specialists, and architects design the facilities that attract and engage the public. 

Our approach to community development forms wildlife habitat, restores wetlands for future generations, and builds neighborhoods where bicyclists ride on trails and families picnic in parks. By creating unique spaces that respond to the land and the people who use them, we're bringing community to life.

                            As 2,500 environmental staff covering 20 technical specialties, we know what to look for. We know what's required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. 

Our passion for it drives our work. When we're gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we're helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we've made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site.

Whether it's preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team's got the environment down to a science.

                            A woman driving down the interstate to the airport where she'll board a plan to Chicago for a meeting. A teenager riding his bike over a major roadway by way of a multi-use path and pedestrian bridge. A man taking the train to visit his grandchildren. Different people, but with a shared goal: to get from Point A to Point B as quickly and safely as possible.

We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there—whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment.

And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn't equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day—because Stantec isn't just a company; we're people, with the same goals as everyone else—to get where we're going, safely and efficiently.

Our work—professional consulting in planning, engineering, architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, surveying, environmental sciences, project management, and project economics—begins at the intersection of community, creativity, and client relationships.  Since 1954, our local strength, knowledge, and relationships, coupled with our world-class expertise, have allowed us to go anywhere to meet our clients' needs in more creative and personalized ways. With a long-term commitment to the people and places we serve, Stantec has the unique ability to connect to projects on a personal level and advance the quality of life in communities across the globe.

                            Vapour extraction (also called vacuum extraction, soil venting, and in situ volatilization)                                                           




                          
                            Vapour extraction is an effective technique for in situ remediation of sites contaminated with hydrocarbons or other volatile chemicals. The technology involves the application of a vacuum to the vadose zone to remove the soil gases, causing evaporation and removal of the volatile compounds. It is accepted by regulatory agencies and has been a highly successful treatment technology for vadose zone soils. 

Two-phase vapour extraction, a variation on the basic technique, can remove soil gases, free product and contaminated groundwater. Its main advantages are achieving remedial objectives in situ within a relatively short time frame in a cost-effective manner. Also, in most cases, the technology can be applied using simple, reliable and readily available equipment with minimum site disruption.

                            Air dispersion modelling is the primary solution for determining atmospheric pollutant levels at points distant from a source, such as the impact of an industry on nearby residential areas.  The modelling involves knowledge of the pollutant source, geography and climatological conditions.  Models such as ISC2 for industrial sources like exhaust stacks and landfills or CALINE4 for traffic pollution are recognized by regulators as providing reasonably accurate predictions of pollutant concentrations.  

These programs combined have the capability of providing city wide air quality models, including all industries and accounting for traffic patterns.  With the correct information, air quality modelling can be performed anywhere, and relies mainly on the quality of the source information and computer capability.

                            Risk assessment is an evaluation process used to describe the nature and magnitude of the risk associated with exposure of human or ecological receptors to a potential hazard (i.e. chemicals or potentially hazardous activities).  Risk assessment typically involves: 1) problem formation (contaminant, pathway and receptor screening, development of a conceptual model of exposure); 2) data analysis (exposure and toxicity assessment); and 3) risk characterization (risk estimation, uncertainty analysis).  

Risk assessment can be either qualitative or quantitative, depending on the nature and extent of the potential hazard.  Risk management is the process of identification and implementation of appropriate measures to reduce or prevent potential risks.  As part of the risk management process, effective risk communication is essential to ensure that all affected individuals understand the nature of the potential risk, the possible effects and the importance of correct implementation of any risk management strategy.

                            In situ bioremediation involves the use of bacteria to naturally degrade dissolved hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater. The process requires creating the necessary environmental conditions to promote the growth of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. These bacteria can be either naturally occurring or added to the groundwater. The primary environmental factor which influences biodegradation is the availability of oxygen to promote microbial growth. In addition, nutrients can be added to further promote microbial growth where necessary.  

Oxygen can be delivered to the groundwater through a number of processes including: 
(1) injecting air into the groundwater (air sparging); 

(2) re-injection of groundwater which has been aerated on surface; and 

(3) injection of hydrogen peroxide into the groundwater. 

The particular method used depends upon a number of factors, including soil and contaminant characteristics. In situ bioremediation is an emerging technology which has successfully been applied to remediation of dissolved hydrocarbon contaminants under a variety of site conditions.

                            Vapour extraction (also called vacuum extraction, soil venting, and in situ volatilization)                                                           




                          
                            Vapour extraction is an effective technique for in situ remediation of sites contaminated with hydrocarbons or other volatile chemicals. The technology involves the application of a vacuum to the vadose zone to remove the soil gases, causing evaporation and removal of the volatile compounds. It is accepted by regulatory agencies and has been a highly successful treatment technology for vadose zone soils. 

Two-phase vapour extraction, a variation on the basic technique, can remove soil gases, free product and contaminated groundwater. Its main advantages are achieving remedial objectives in situ within a relatively short time frame in a cost-effective manner. Also, in most cases, the technology can be applied using simple, reliable and readily available equipment with minimum site disruption.

                            Air dispersion modelling is the primary solution for determining atmospheric pollutant levels at points distant from a source, such as the impact of an industry on nearby residential areas.  The modelling involves knowledge of the pollutant source, geography and climatological conditions.  Models such as ISC2 for industrial sources like exhaust stacks and landfills or CALINE4 for traffic pollution are recognized by regulators as providing reasonably accurate predictions of pollutant concentrations.  

These programs combined have the capability of providing city wide air quality models, including all industries and accounting for traffic patterns.  With the correct information, air quality modelling can be performed anywhere, and relies mainly on the quality of the source information and computer capability.

                            Risk assessment is an evaluation process used to describe the nature and magnitude of the risk associated with exposure of human or ecological receptors to a potential hazard (i.e. chemicals or potentially hazardous activities).  Risk assessment typically involves: 1) problem formation (contaminant, pathway and receptor screening, development of a conceptual model of exposure); 2) data analysis (exposure and toxicity assessment); and 3) risk characterization (risk estimation, uncertainty analysis).  

Risk assessment can be either qualitative or quantitative, depending on the nature and extent of the potential hazard.  Risk management is the process of identification and implementation of appropriate measures to reduce or prevent potential risks.  As part of the risk management process, effective risk communication is essential to ensure that all affected individuals understand the nature of the potential risk, the possible effects and the importance of correct implementation of any risk management strategy.

                            In situ bioremediation involves the use of bacteria to naturally degrade dissolved hydrocarbon compounds in groundwater. The process requires creating the necessary environmental conditions to promote the growth of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. These bacteria can be either naturally occurring or added to the groundwater. The primary environmental factor which influences biodegradation is the availability of oxygen to promote microbial growth. In addition, nutrients can be added to further promote microbial growth where necessary.  

Oxygen can be delivered to the groundwater through a number of processes including: 
(1) injecting air into the groundwater (air sparging); 

(2) re-injection of groundwater which has been aerated on surface; and 

(3) injection of hydrogen peroxide into the groundwater. 

The particular method used depends upon a number of factors, including soil and contaminant characteristics. In situ bioremediation is an emerging technology which has successfully been applied to remediation of dissolved hydrocarbon contaminants under a variety of site conditions.
