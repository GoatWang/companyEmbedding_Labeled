AmericaTowne® Tourism Development and Trade Centers provide unique one of kind communities for people in China to go spend their leisure time consisting of 50 unique USA small businesses, a 5 star hotel, 50 villas and a theme park all fashioned after the American way, business, and life style. Actual businesses, hotels, villas and theme parks found in the USA can be found in AmericaTowne® Trade Centers in China.Our VisionOver the next 10 years, with the support of USA Exim Bank, the private sector and the Chinese Government, we will meet demand by Chinese consumers for leisure and exports, by building 10 AmericaTowne® Tourism Development and Trade Centers across China at a Cost of $151 million per Center having a total direct investment of $1.5 Billion dollars. We anticipate each center to be located on 1,000 mu. We expect to commission the Zhou Brothers (the internationally known Chinese American artists) to create an original major sculpture identifying each Center and tying each Center to a theme that focuses on US and China culture and attributes from the surrounding Community. The Centers will create jobs and business opportunities in China and the USA. As a result of the USA based company and Centers, over 500 new businesses; 10 hotels; 500 villas and 10 theme parks will be created, employing directly and indirectly 36,500 people in China and the USA.It is expected that the USA based Company and Centers will generate over $1.5 Billion in labor income and have a direct total economic benefit of approximately $5 billion.

AmericaTowne® Tourism Development and Trade Centers provide unique one of kind communities for people in China to go spend their leisure time consisting of 50 unique USA small businesses, a 5 star hotel, 50 villas and a theme park all fashioned after the American way, business, and life style. Actual businesses, hotels, villas and theme parks found in the USA can be found in AmericaTowne® Trade Centers in China.Our VisionOver the next 10 years, with the support of USA Exim Bank, the private sector and the Chinese Government, we will meet demand by Chinese consumers for leisure and exports, by building 10 AmericaTowne® Tourism Development and Trade Centers across China at a Cost of $151 million per Center having a total direct investment of $1.5 Billion dollars. We anticipate each center to be located on 1,000 mu. We expect to commission the Zhou Brothers (the internationally known Chinese American artists) to create an original major sculpture identifying each Center and tying each Center to a theme that focuses on US and China culture and attributes from the surrounding Community. The Centers will create jobs and business opportunities in China and the USA. As a result of the USA based company and Centers, over 500 new businesses; 10 hotels; 500 villas and 10 theme parks will be created, employing directly and indirectly 36,500 people in China and the USA.It is expected that the USA based Company and Centers will generate over $1.5 Billion in labor income and have a direct total economic benefit of approximately $5 billion.

ATI Modular Technology Corp. and AmericaTowne, Inc. Agree to Plan of Merger 

Business by  - July 14, 2017November 30, -00010 




Raleigh, NC,  July 14, 2017 –(PR.com)– AmericaTowne, Inc. (“AmericaTowne”) and its subsidiary, ATI Modular Technology Corp., announced today that they have agreed to a Plan of Merger, which once closed, will result in a combination of their respective businesses into ATI Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation.
In anticipation of closing the Plan of Merger, AmericaTowne has amended its Certificate of Incorporation with Delaware disclosing an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 and a forward split of these shares on a one-to-four basis. ATI Modular has filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada changing the name of the company to “ATI Holdings, Inc.” and effectuating a fifty-to-one reverse stock split. These corporate actions, and more specifically the closing of the Plan of Merger is subject to certain actions reviewed and approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Plan of Merger was amended on July 14, 2017 to disclose the increase in authorized shares of common stock in AmericaTowne to 200,000,000.
AmericaTowne’s and ATI Modular’s Chairman of the Board, Alton Perkins, commented, “These actions are intended to consolidate the operations of AmericaTowne and ATI Modular, and reduce operational costs associated with being a publicly reporting company and increase shareholder value while we continue to build the business models of each respective company. Following effectiveness, ATI Holdings will be operating two separate but related businesses – furtherance of the AmericaTowne concept as set forth in its public filings, and expansion of its modular construction operations in China.”
