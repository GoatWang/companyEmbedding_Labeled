  20 January 2015 

  NAHL Group PLC 

  ("NAHL" or the "Group") 

  Trading Update 

  NAHL, the leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the Personal Injury market, operating under the National Accident Helpline brand, is today providing a trading update for the year ended 31 December 2014. 

  As highlighted at the interim results, the Group has continued to trade well during the second half and is expected to deliver strong underlying operating profits(1) for the year slightly ahead of current market expectations. 

  Revenue from continuing operations(2) for the full year is up 10.4% to GBP43.8m. This reflects robust enquiry growth of 15.3% as we continue to gain market share in the higher value sectors of non-RTA and medical negligence. 

  Cash flow has continued to be strong with the Group ending the year with net cash(3) of GBP1.2m, an increase of GBP3.2m from the first half.  The maiden interim dividend of 5.0p was paid on 31 October 2014 and the Group will announce a final proposed dividend in its forthcoming results announcement which will be paid in May 2015. 

  NAHL will announce its results for the year ended 31 December 2014 on 24 March 2015. 

  Russell Atkinson, CEO of NAHL, commented: 

  "Trading in our first financial year as a quoted company has been very encouraging.  Our enquiry growth reflects our strategy of gaining market share and we continue to focus our efforts on the higher value non-RTA and medical negligence sectors." 

 
 (1)   Underlying operating profits excludes pre-LASPO ATE 
        items, share based payments and one off items 
 (2)   Continuing operations excludes the demerged PPI Claimline 
        division and a legacy "after the event" (ATE) insurance

  Notes to Editors 

  NAHL Group 

  NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK legal services market. The core brand - National Accident Helpline ("NAH") was established in 1993 and since then the Group's business has grown to an industry leading position as an outsourced marketing services provider. As the nation's most searched for and trusted personal injury brand NAH, supported by its Underdog character, attracts around 240,000 consumer contacts per annum. The acquisition of Fitzalan Partners allows the Group to extend its reach into the conveyancing market using its skill set from its NAH business. 

  More information is available at www.nahlgroupplc.co.uk and www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk. 

  Chairman's Statement 

  I am pleased to report the Group's results for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 

  Summary of Financial Performance 

  NAHL has performed well, with revenue from continuing operations of GBP25.4m, up 15.0% (2014 H1: GBP22.1m), of which GBP1.5m relates to Fitzalan, our residential conveyancing lead generation business acquired in February 2015. 

  Revenue growth translates into an increase in underlying operating profit from continuing operations of 16.1%, up from GBP6.1m to GBP7.0m, with operating profit up 21.1% to GBP6.5m. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 12.5p, up 14.7%. 

  NAHL operates within the personal injury (PI) sector, through National Accident Helpline (NAH), and in the residential conveyancing sector through Fitzalan. Our model is highly cash generative, with a 95.5% (2014 H1: 94.4%) conversion of operating profit from continuing operations into cash. 

  Our balance sheet is robust and at the period end we had net cash of GBP3.4m (2014 H1: GBP6.9m), after paying cash consideration for Fitzalan, together with a small infill acquisition called Best Value Conveyancing, of GBP3.7m (out of a total acquisition price of GBP4.5m). Our balance sheet also shows non-interest bearing liabilities of GBP4.6m (2014 H1: GBP8.9m) relating to a legacy pre-LASPO ATE product, giving an effective adjusted net debt position of GBP1.2m (2014 H1: GBP2.0m) at 30 June 2015. 

  Interim Dividend 

  The Board has declared an interim dividend of 6.25p per share payable on 30 October 2015 to ordinary shareholders registered on 2 October 2015. 

  Business Review 

  NAH continues to deliver a strong operational performance, with enquiry growth up 9.4% in the period, with core PI enquiries up 5.8% and medical negligence enquiries up 23.9%, resulting in solicitor income increasing by 10.5%. These volume increases are pleasing, although we have experienced some increase in  marketing costs, primarily driven by advertising rates and increased online bidding in a competitive marketplace which has resulted in cost per enquiry (CPE)  rising by 1.0%. 

  NAH has gained further market share in the period reflecting the continued strength of our brand, and we continue to adapt well to changing consumer behaviours such as an increasing trend towards enquiries driven by social media. Whilst this type of case can be more challenging to convert into a running case for our Panel Law Firms (PLFs), coping with emerging trends is one of NAH's strengths and our conversion rate of clean leads to enquiries remains above 70%. 

  Our market continues to evolve, and law firms operating in the PI space are adapting to the maturing post LASPO marketplace. The financial robustness of our PLFs is critical to us and we monitor CPE very carefully. Where appropriate, we work closely with firms on case conversion so that the effective cost per running case is optimised. 

  Within NAH, we have responded to rising CPE by focusing on lead quality, the efficiency of our marketing commitments, and by building stronger PLF relationships. We have continued to enhance the number of key strategic long-term relationships we have within our panel with some of the larger players in the PI market, whilst managing carefully our concentration risk. We now operate with 56 PLFs of which 40 deal with core PI or medical negligence cases. 

  Our NAH brand continues to rank as the most trusted and recognised in the PI sector. Approximately 76% of enquiries are derived from higher margin non-RTA and medical negligence cases, which are more valuable to PLFs. 

  Revenue from the sale of products (medicals, insurance and costs), which are related to the various services required by PLFs to run a case efficiently, decreased by 8.2% in the period. This decline primarily relates to the Ministry of Justice led introduction of Medco in April 2015 which changes the way medical reports are sourced for soft tissue injuries in lower value RTA cases. However we are encouraged by the market penetration of our recently launched non-medical negligence ATE product.  Thanks to our continued focus on new products we can offer to our PLFs and ability to adapt to changes in the market, we expect continuing product revenues to stabilise in the second half of 2015 and return to growth during 2016. 

  Turning to Fitzalan, which provides residential conveyancing lead generation services to law firms and surveyors, we have been pleased with the progress since acquiring the business. We delivered a 21.4% operating margin on revenue of GBP1.5m. We expect this contribution to grow in the second half, as the leadership changes we introduced at the point of acquisition mature, and additional staff resources, coupled with new products, become established. 

  Outlook 

  The Group's second half trading has commenced well, and we expect to see further profits growth at NAH. We are managing closely the growth in enquiry volume, as external marketing costs per enquiry remain higher than previous norms. 

  We expect Fitzalan to contribute to the Group's results at an accelerating rate, and we are pleased with the acquisition and the performance of the conveyancing sector as a whole. 

  We continue to see and assess potential further complementary acquisitions in both PI and Conveyancing and believe the strength of our balance sheet alongside our market leading positions means the Group is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. 

  We enjoyed a strong first half, and for 2015 as a whole, we intend to deliver results at least in line with market expectations.

  Financial Overview 

  Revenue 

  Revenue from continuing operations increased by 15.0% to GBP25.4m (2014 H1: GBP22.1m).  Within this, the Fitzalan acquisition, completed in the first half, has added GBP1.5m of revenue (H1 2014: GBPnil). 

  Profitability 

  Underlying operating profit increased by 16.1% to GBP7.0m (2014 H1: GBP6.1m).  There has been a 21.1% increase in solicitor income profitability to GBP5.1m (2014 H1: GBP4.2m) supported by continued growth in the targeted enquiry sectors of medical negligence and non RTA. 

  Product income profitability saw a 9.5% decrease to GBP2.4m (2014 H1: GBP2.6m). In addition to declining products reducing in the post LASPO environment, continuing products saw a 7.6% decrease to GBP2.0m (2014 H1: GBP2.1m). Whilst the business continues to see the impact of new Medco legislation on its medical commissions, the Group has introduced a new ATE proposition which should reverse the medical income declines in 2016. 

  Fitzalan made an impressive start delivering GBP0.3m of operating profit in H1 for the 20 weeks of trading. The business has increased its staff numbers and has new office facilities in order to benefit from increased demand from its customers. The Group is confident of the ability to continue growing market share in the highly fragmented conveyancing sector through operational improvement and enhancing digital marketing. 

  The Group remains committed to maintaining cost controls and has delivered an improvement in the operating profit margin from 27.4% to 27.7%. The Group remains on track to achieve its annual target of c.30% operating profit margin. 

  One off items in H1 2015 of GBP0.2m are for costs relating to the acquisitions of Fitzalan and BVC, with share based payments of GBP0.4m the total of GBP0.6m compares to GBP0.7m in H1 2014. 

  Earnings Per Share 

  Basic and diluted earnings per share for the period were 12.5p and 12.3p respectively, (2014 H1:  8.5p and 8.2p or for continuing operations only: 10.9p and 10.6p). 

  Dividend 

  The Board has declared an interim dividend of 6.25p per ordinary share (2014 H1: 5.0p) which will be paid on 30 October 2015 to ordinary shareholders registered at the close of business on 2 October 2015. The policy to pay two thirds of its retained earnings each year, with one third of this at the interim stage, as a dividend remains the board's objective. The final payment is expected to be announced in March 2016 for payment in May 2016. 

  Cash and Balance Sheet 

  The Group had GBP1.2m of adjusted net debt at 30 June 2015 (2014 H1: GBP2.0m).  This comprised the following:

                                 ______    ______ 
 

  The net debt position is after GBP3.7m of cash paid relating to acquisitions. The improvement in the net debt position is as a result of continued strong cash flow performance from operating activities which delivered an operating cash conversion from continuing products of 95.5% (H1 2014: 94.4%) resulting in GBP6.7m of net cash inflows from operating activities (H1 2014: GBP5.7m). The Group would expect to continue to generate in excess of 90% of operating profit as operating cash flow.

  Notes to the financial statements 

  1. Accounting policies 

  Basis of preparation 

  Statement of compliance 

  The condensed set of financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2015 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU and the AIM Rules of UK companies.  It does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014. 

  This condensed consolidated half year financial information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 March 2015 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. 

  The half year condensed consolidated financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015 have not been audited or reviewed by auditors pursuant to the Auditing Practices Board guidance on Review of Interim Financial Information. 

  The condensed set of financial statements was approved by the Board of directors on 22 September 2015. 

  Use of judgements and estimates 

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected. 

  The preparation of the condensed set of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

  In preparing the condensed set of financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were of the same type as those that applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. 

  Significant accounting policies 

  The accounting policies used in the preparation of these interim financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015 are the accounting policies as applied to the Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. 

  Business combinations 

  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3. 

  Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the income statement. 

  Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. 

  Intangibles 

  Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 

  Cost or valuation 

  Intangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised at fair value, amortised over their estimated useful lives and subject to impairment testing. 

  Amortisation 

  Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: 

   --               Technology-related intangibles - 5 to 10 years 
   --               Contract-related intangibles - 5 to 10 years 
   --               Brand names - 5 to 10 years

  Bonus issue of Capital reduction shares

  Capital reduction 

  The amount standing to the credit of Company's share premium account in the sum of GBP49,532,649 was cancelled in full and the amount was recognised in retained earnings. 

  Following the approval by the company's shareholders of the resolutions in the Capital Reduction and the subsequent approval by the Court, the company's distributable reserves were increased by GBP66,461,000.

	Fitzalan Partners


The acquisition of Fitzalan Partners in February 2015 was the Group’s first move into an adjacent consumer legal services market. Fitzalan was founded in 2011 out of Fridays Property Lawyers and is an online marketing specialist targeting home buyers and sellers in England and Wales through its five web based platforms; Fridaysmove; In-Deed; Surveyor Local; Homeward Legal and BestValueConveyancing.com. Through these platforms, confirmed leads are generated for residential property services in England and Wales, and offered to Panel Law Firms (PLFs) and panel surveyors. Our reach and expertise has been further increased through the acquisition in January 2016 of Searches UK. 
Fitzalan Partners is expert in marketing to a large number of consumers, processing incoming enquiries through a full sales cycle, and converting these into confirmed instructions rather than the partially qualified leads typical of the rest of the market. The residential property panel firms prefer to concentrate on their core skills, and benefit from the expertise of Fitzalan Partners marketing and sales capability.
In the last financial year, Fitzalan Partners and Searches UK we have helped over XX,000 customers with their conveyancing or survey needs. 
Customers are attracted to the proposition due to the assurance provided in dealing with the company’s brands:

Highly competitive fixed fees on residential property transactions.
Enhanced service features such as Search Plus Protection and No Sale No Fee.
Quality assurance through a comprehensive PLF service level agreement.
Service mediation in the event of client complaints.
Advice and information on the conveyancing and surveys process.

Fitzalan Partners currently generates enquiries in the form of incoming calls, online call-back requests and specific leads generated by its web quote engines. Confirmed residential property instructions from consumers are then passed to one of over 360 PLFs, which pay Fitzalan Partners and Searches UK a marketing fee per instruction.
Additional revenue is generated through agreements that Fitzalan Partners has with related suppliers such as search and surveyor companies, who deliver peripheral services which facilitate the customer instruction. 
Fitzalan Partners' surveyor panel comprises around 150 firms of Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) qualified surveyors. The business markets Home Buyer Reports and Building Surveys to both buyers and sellers and provides its survey panel with a steady, controllable workflow, allowing them to plan their workload efficiently.
In 2016, Fitzalan Partners acquired Searches UK, established in 2008. Searches UK is a leading conveyancing search provider in England and Wales predominantly for residential property transactions. The Company acts as a service provider to solicitors and licensed conveyancers providing search information across six core product categories: Local Authority, Drainage and Water, Environmental, Chancel, Planning and Flood. Searches uses a nationwide network of search agents to provide the relevant search reports. In addition, they continuously explore the market for new product opportunities for clients that are reliable, innovative and assessable such as Lawyer Checker services, AML ID Checks, Indemnity Policies and Company Searches. The acquisition of Searches UK is a strong, natural complement to the existing Fitzalan Partners business and brings together expertise in the residential property sector dedicated to delivering quality customer service.

	Our Business


NAHL Group plc is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK personal injury market and the parent company of National Accident Helpline Ltd (NAH). We advertise through our core consumer brand – National Accident Helpline. Established in 1993, the Group’s business has grown to an industry-leading position as an outsourced marketing services provider. The NAH brand, marketing scale and in-depth expertise along with our Panel Law Firm relationships place the business in an enviable market position. 
NAH’s core business model is based on generating direct response contacts from consumers who have had a non-fault accident, establishing whether we think they may have a claim and connecting them to a specialist solicitor. Research suggests that claimants in the UK personal injury litigation market are often not comfortable contacting solicitors directly. We act as an informative but sympathetic intermediary between the consumer and the law firm. Our trained Legal Service Advisors can tell the consumer within minutes if they think they have a claim.
Through the strength and trust generated by the NAH brand and our Underdog character, created in 2010, we attract over 225,000 consumer contacts per annum either via website visits, inbound telephone contact or web-chat. NAH’s strategy is to continue to focus on higher value cases such as medical negligence and non-road traffic accident cases.
Using specific criteria, the contacts are filtered down by the NAH’s Legal Service Advisors and passed on to our approved Panel Law Firms based on geographic location or specialism of the case (these are Enquiries). Once an Enquiry has been transferred to a selected Panel Law Firm, the Panel Law Firm carries out a further risk assessment to decide whether to proceed with the claim or take no further action. The Panel Law Firm contracts directly with the claimant.
As well as Enquiry origination, NAH provides its Panel Law Firms with products that serve part of the legal process. The two main products are a new ATE (After The Event) insurance product (launched in April 2013 post LASPO) and medical assessments.
NAH is paid by our Panel Law Firms (the Panel Law Firm carries the risk on profitability and cash on the Enquiry), and by providers of ancillary products, including ATE and medical assessments, in consideration for the provision of such products and services. We are not paid by the claimant.
NAHL has three key competitive advantages:
i)             brand recognition and trust
ii)            marketing expertise
iii)           solicitor panel relationships
These competitive advantages have been developed over 20 years. The NAH brand has been built through more than £200 million of marketing investment since 1993 and, according to market research, ranks as the most recognised, most searched for and most trusted personal injury brand in the UK market. 
The incoming consumer contacts are generated as a result of NAH’s advertising and online activity. NAH does not cold call or cold text. We campaigned against nuisance marketing during the passage of the LASPO Bill through Parliament. A number of amendments were tabled which reflected our representations in our submissions to Parliament on 1 February 2012. We are regulated by the CMRU and were audited on 10 April 2017.

Notes to Editors
 
NAHL Group
 
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK legal services market. The core brand - National Accident Helpline ("NAH") was established in 1993 and since then the Group's business has grown to an industry leading position as an outsourced marketing services provider. As the nation's most searched for and trusted personal injury brand NAH, supported by its Underdog character, attracts around 240,000 consumer contacts per annum. The acquisition of Fitzalan Partners allows the Group to extend its reach into the conveyancing market using its skill set from its NAH business.
 
More information is available at www.nahlgroupplc.co.uk and www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk.
 
 
 
Chairman's Statement
 
I am pleased to report the Group's results for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
 
Summary of Financial Performance
 
NAHL has performed well, with revenue from continuing operations of £25.4m, up 15.0% (2014 H1: £22.1m), of which £1.5m relates to Fitzalan, our residential conveyancing lead generation business acquired in February 2015. 
 
Revenue growth translates into an increase in underlying operating profit from continuing operations of 16.1%, up from £6.1m to £7.0m, with operating profit up 21.1% to £6.5m. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 12.5p, up 14.7%.
 
NAHL operates within the personal injury (PI) sector, through National Accident Helpline (NAH), and in the residential conveyancing sector through Fitzalan. Our model is highly cash generative, with a 95.5% (2014 H1: 94.4%) conversion of operating profit from continuing operations into cash. 
 
Our balance sheet is robust and at the period end we had net cash of £3.4m (2014 H1: £6.9m), after paying cash consideration for Fitzalan, together with a small infill acquisition called Best Value Conveyancing, of £3.7m (out of a total acquisition price of £4.5m). Our balance sheet also shows non-interest bearing liabilities of £4.6m (2014 H1: £8.9m) relating to a legacy pre-LASPO ATE product, giving an effective adjusted net debt position of £1.2m (2014 H1: £2.0m) at 30 June 2015.
 
Interim Dividend
 
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 6.25p per share payable on 30 October 2015 to ordinary shareholders registered on 2 October 2015.
 
Business Review
 
NAH continues to deliver a strong operational performance, with enquiry growth up 9.4% in the period, with core PI enquiries up 5.8% and medical negligence enquiries up 23.9%, resulting in solicitor income increasing by 10.5%. These volume increases are pleasing, although we have experienced some increase in  marketing costs, primarily driven by advertising rates and increased online bidding in a competitive marketplace which has resulted in cost per enquiry (CPE)  rising by 1.0%.
 
NAH has gained further market share in the period reflecting the continued strength of our brand, and we continue to adapt well to changing consumer behaviours such as an increasing trend towards enquiries driven by social media. Whilst this type of case can be more challenging to convert into a running case for our Panel Law Firms (PLFs), coping with emerging trends is one of NAH's strengths and our conversion rate of clean leads to enquiries remains above 70%.
 
Our market continues to evolve, and law firms operating in the PI space are adapting to the maturing post LASPO marketplace. The financial robustness of our PLFs is critical to us and we monitor CPE very carefully. Where appropriate, we work closely with firms on case conversion so that the effective cost per running case is optimised. 
 
Within NAH, we have responded to rising CPE by focusing on lead quality, the efficiency of our marketing commitments, and by building stronger PLF relationships. We have continued to enhance the number of key strategic long-term relationships we have within our panel with some of the larger players in the PI market, whilst managing carefully our concentration risk. We now operate with 56 PLFs of which 40 deal with core PI or medical negligence cases. 
 
Our NAH brand continues to rank as the most trusted and recognised in the PI sector. Approximately 76% of enquiries are derived from higher margin non-RTA and medical negligence cases, which are more valuable to PLFs. 
 
Revenue from the sale of products (medicals, insurance and costs), which are related to the various services required by PLFs to run a case efficiently, decreased by 8.2% in the period. This decline primarily relates to the Ministry of Justice led introduction of Medco in April 2015 which changes the way medical reports are sourced for soft tissue injuries in lower value RTA cases. However we are encouraged by the market penetration of our recently launched non-medical negligence ATE product.  Thanks to our continued focus on new products we can offer to our PLFs and ability to adapt to changes in the market, we expect continuing product revenues to stabilise in the second half of 2015 and return to growth during 2016.
 
Turning to Fitzalan, which provides residential conveyancing lead generation services to law firms and surveyors, we have been pleased with the progress since acquiring the business. We delivered a 21.4% operating margin on revenue of £1.5m. We expect this contribution to grow in the second half, as the leadership changes we introduced at the point of acquisition mature, and additional staff resources, coupled with new products, become established. 
 
Outlook
 
The Group's second half trading has commenced well, and we expect to see further profits growth at NAH. We are managing closely the growth in enquiry volume, as external marketing costs per enquiry remain higher than previous norms.
 
We expect Fitzalan to contribute to the Group's results at an accelerating rate, and we are pleased with the acquisition and the performance of the conveyancing sector as a whole. 
 
We continue to see and assess potential further complementary acquisitions in both PI and Conveyancing and believe the strength of our balance sheet alongside our market leading positions means the Group is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities.  
 
We enjoyed a strong first half, and for 2015 as a whole, we intend to deliver results at least in line with market expectations.

Management Report
 
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK legal services market. The core brand National Accident Helpline was established in 1993 and since then the business has grown to an industry leading position as an outsourced marketing services provider. As the nations most searched for and trusted personal injury brand, NAH, supported by its Underdog character, attracts around 300,000 consumer contacts per annum. The acquisition of Fitzalan in February 2015 allows the Group to extend its reach in the conveyancing market using many of the skill set from its NAH business. 
 
NAHL has continued to show good growth in the core NAH business and has enjoyed strong performance from the Fitzalan acquisition which utilises our core competencies to extend the reach of the Group into broader legal markets.
 
Financial Overview
 
Revenue 
 
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 15.0% to £25.4m (2014 H1: £22.1m).  Within this, the Fitzalan acquisition, completed in the first half, has added £1.5m of revenue (H1 2014: £nil). 
 
Profitability
 
Underlying operating profit increased by 16.1% to £7.0m (2014 H1: £6.1m).  There has been a 21.1% increase in solicitor income profitability to £5.1m (2014 H1: £4.2m) supported by continued growth in the targeted enquiry sectors of medical negligence and non RTA.
 
Product income profitability saw a 9.5% decrease to £2.4m (2014 H1: £2.6m). In addition to declining products reducing in the post LASPO environment, continuing products saw a 7.6% decrease to £2.0m (2014 H1: £2.1m). Whilst the business continues to see the impact of new Medco legislation on its medical commissions, the Group has introduced a new ATE proposition which should reverse the medical income declines in 2016.
 
Fitzalan made an impressive start delivering £0.3m of operating profit in H1 for the 20 weeks of trading. The business has increased its staff numbers and has new office facilities in order to benefit from increased demand from its customers. The Group is confident of the ability to continue growing market share in the highly fragmented conveyancing sector through operational improvement and enhancing digital marketing.
 
The Group remains committed to maintaining cost controls and has delivered an improvement in the operating profit margin from 27.4% to 27.7%. The Group remains on track to achieve its annual target of c.30% operating profit margin.
 
One off items in H1 2015 of £0.2m are for costs relating to the acquisitions of Fitzalan and BVC, with share based payments of £0.4m the total of £0.6m compares to £0.7m in H1 2014.
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the period were 12.5p and 12.3p respectively, (2014 H1:  8.5p and 8.2p or for continuing operations only: 10.9p and 10.6p).
 
Dividend
 
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 6.25p per ordinary share (2014 H1: 5.0p) which will be paid on 30 October 2015 to ordinary shareholders registered at the close of business on 2 October 2015. The policy to pay two thirds of its retained earnings each year, with one third of this at the interim stage, as a dividend remains the board's objective. The final payment is expected to be announced in March 2016 for payment in May 2016.
 


 
Cash and Balance Sheet 
 
The Group had £1.2m of adjusted net debt at 30 June 2015 (2014 H1: £2.0m).  This comprised the following:

The net debt position is after £3.7m of cash paid relating to acquisitions. The improvement in the net debt position is as a result of continued strong cash flow performance from operating activities which delivered an operating cash conversion from continuing products of 95.5% (H1 2014: 94.4%) resulting in £6.7m of net cash inflows from operating activities (H1 2014: £5.7m). The Group would expect to continue to generate in excess of 90% of operating profit as operating cash flow.

Notes to the financial statements
 
1. Accounting policies
 
Basis of preparation
 
Statement of compliance
The condensed set of financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2015 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU and the AIM Rules of UK companies.  It does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014.
 
This condensed consolidated half year financial information does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 March 2015 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.
 
The half year condensed consolidated financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015 have not been audited or reviewed by auditors pursuant to the Auditing Practices Board guidance on Review of Interim Financial Information. 
 
The condensed set of financial statements was approved by the Board of directors on 22 September 2015.
 
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
 
The preparation of the condensed set of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 
In preparing the condensed set of financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were of the same type as those that applied to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
 
Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these interim financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015 are the accounting policies as applied to the Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
 
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration that is not classified as equity are recognised in the income statement. 
 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
 
Intangibles
Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
 
Cost or valuation
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are recognised at fair value, amortised over their estimated useful lives and subject to impairment testing. 
 
Amortisation
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
•               Technology-related intangibles - 5 to 10 years
•               Contract-related intangibles - 5 to 10 years
•               Brand names - 5 to 10 years

Geographic information
All revenue and assets of the Group are based in the UK.
 
Operating segments
The segments used in reporting by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), being the Board, and considered relevant to the business are segmented on a product basis. These segments are:
 
PI Solicitor income
Revenue from the provision of enquiries to the Panel Law Firms (PLFs), based on a cost plus margin model.
 
Products
Commissions received from providers for the sale of additional products by them to the PLFs.
 
Pre-LASPO ATE
Commissions received from the insurance provider for the use of ATE policies by PLFs. From 1 April 2013, this product was no longer available as a result of LASPO regulatory changes. Included in the balance sheet is a liability that has been separately identified due to its material value. This balance is commissions received in advance that are due to be paid back to the insurance provider. No interest is due on this liability.
 
Conveyancing
Revenue from the provision of lead generation services to law firms and surveyors in the conveyancing sector. Conveyancing revenue and operating profit relate to the amounts Fitzalan Partners Limited has contributed to the Group since the acquisition date. 
 
Other segments
Costs that are incurred in managing Group activities or not specifically related to a product.
 
One-off items and share based payments
Costs relating to the acquisitions of Fitzalan Partners Limited, Best Value Conveyancing and share-based payments (2014: Costs for the payment of employee bonuses relating to admission of the company to AIM and share-based payments).
 
PPI Claimline (discontinued)
Provision of claims management services focused on recovery of mis-sold payment protection insurance. This business was sold on 15 May 2014.


2. Operating segments continued
 
Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations
A reconciliation of operating profit to cash generation from operations for continuing operations has been presented below separately identifying net cash flows relating to continuing products (comprising cash flows associated with PI solicitor income, products, conveyancing and other segments), the pre-LASPO ATE product segment and cash flows within continuing operations that related to the PPI Claimline division, which is now discontinued.
 
One-off items have been separately identified for all periods.

10. Transactions with owners, recorded directly in equity
 
On 18 June 2015, NAHL Group plc carried out a capital reduction exercise. The steps required to complete the capital reduction have been included within the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity and have been further explained below:
 
Bonus issue of Capital reduction shares
The amount standing to the credit of the Company's merger reserve in the sum of £16,928,000 was capitalised by way of a bonus issue of newly created Capital Reduction Shares with a nominal value of £0.41 each; and
 
Capital reduction shares cancelled
The newly created Capital Reduction Shares were cancelled; the amount standing to the credit of the Company's share capital account in the sum of £16,928,000 was cancelled and recognised in retained earnings.
 
Capital reduction 
The amount standing to the credit of Company's share premium account in the sum of £49,532,649 was cancelled in full and the amount was recognised in retained earnings.
 
Following the approval by the company's shareholders of the resolutions in the Capital Reduction and the subsequent approval by the Court, the company's distributable reserves were increased by £66,461,000.


 
11. Share-based payments
 
The Group operates three employee share plans. 
 
SAYE plan
The SAYE plan is available to all employees. Options may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an employees' trust or by the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.
 
EMI Scheme
The EMI Plan provides for the grant, to selected employees of the Group, of rights to acquire (whether by subscription or market purchase) Ordinary Shares in the Company (Options). Options may be granted as tax-favoured enterprise management incentive options (EMI Options) or non-tax favoured Options.
 
LTIP
The LTIP will enable selected employees (including Executive Directors) to be granted awards in respect of Ordinary Shares. Awards may be granted in the form of nil or nominal cost options to acquire Ordinary Shares; or contingent rights to receive Ordinary Shares. Awards may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an employees' trust or by the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.
 
The terms and conditions of grants of share options to employees of the Group, in the shares of NAHL Group plc are as follows:
 
Grant date/employees entitled/nature of scheme                      Number of instruments       Vesting conditions            Contractual life of options

NAHL Group Limited today announces its intention to launch an initial public offering and placing of new and existing ordinary shares in the Company (the "Placing") and to apply for the admission of its ordinary shares to trading on AIM, a market of the London Stock Exchange plc ("Admission").
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK personal injury market, advertising through its core brand - National Accident Helpline. Having been established in 1993, the Group's business has grown to become the largest outsourced marketing services provider to the personal injury market - a market which is valued at approximately £3 billion in fees generated mainly by law firms. The Group's core business model is based on enquiry origination through direct response marketing, connecting claimants, who have been injured in non-fault accidents, with specialist law firms. Research suggests that claimants in the UK personal injury litigation market often have limited knowledge of how to seek legal redress and are not comfortable contacting lawyers directly. 
Through the strength and trust generated by the National Accident Helpline brand, and by the Group's Underdog character, created in 2010, NAHL is able to attract over 200,000 consumer contacts per annum either via website visits, in-bound telephone contact or web-chat.  These contacts are filtered down, using specific criteria, by the Group's own legal service advisers and passed on to the law firms on its panel ("Panel Law Firms") based on geographic location or specialism of the case (each an "Enquiry"). In 2013, the Group generated in excess of 70,000 Enquiries. NAHL is paid by its Panel Law Firms, and by providers of ancillary products, including after the event ("ATE") insurance and medical reporting, in consideration for the provision of such products and services. It is not paid by the claimants.
KEY STRENGTHS
 
·      Well recognised, trusted brand and supported by differentiated marketing, established through more than £200 million of media spend since inception
·      Strong financial performance supported by high cash generation and a robust  balance sheet
·      Strong relationships with Panel Law Firms established over a long period
·      Focused on the highest growth segments of a large and growing market
·      Barriers to entry resulting from its brand media spend, marketing know-how and Panel Law Firm relationships 
·      Experienced management team with proven ability to manage change 
·      Market leader which is well positioned to benefit from expected consolidation
 
FINANCIAL SUMMARY 
 
In the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group generated revenues of £39.7 million and operating profit of £9.8 million (excluding commission received from a discontinued ATE insurance product of £9.4 million). This profitability represented a 43 per cent. increase over the prior year. The Group has a historically high level of cash conversion, with net operating cash inflows of £10.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The directors of the Company ("the Directors") intend to adopt a progressive policy of paying dividends while maintaining a prudent level of dividend cover for the Group. Reflecting the Group's historically high cash conversion ratio, and assuming sufficient distributable reserves, the Directors intend to target a dividend of approximately 66 per cent. of retained profits in each financial year, including the year ending 31 December 2014.  The Directors propose to pay an interim dividend and a final dividend in respect of each financial year in the approximate proportions of one third and two thirds of the total annual dividend, respectively.  The first interim dividend payment is expected to be paid in November 2014 following the Company's 2014 half year results. 
Russell Atkinson, Chief Executive Officer of NAHL, commented:
"NAHL is a leading provider of marketing services in the UK personal injury market and we believe this is a natural time in our development to become a public company.  We have a long track record of consistent and profitable growth with a highly cash generative business model which we expect will deliver an attractive yield for investors.  The legislative changes that were introduced in April 2013 have been embedded and we believe an IPO will provide an excellent platform for the Group to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities that this legislation has created."

HISTORY OF THE GROUP 
National Accident Helpline was founded in 1993 by regional law firm Toller Hales and Collcutt LLP ("Tollers"), in order to assist accident victims in seeking compensation and redress for injuries suffered. The first years of existence saw a gradual increase in the breadth of advertising with the first national press adverts appearing in 1994 and the first UK-wide, commercial TV adverts airing in 1997.
As more legal firms saw the advantages of pooling resources and marketing their services through this new national brand, investment in advertising continued to increase. In 1998, the Group's call centre became fully operational, and in 1999, the Access to Justice Bill was passed, creating demand for "no win no fee" agreements.
In 2006, the Group became wholly independent from Tollers through a management buy-out backed by the private equity firm LDC.  In 2007, the Ministry of Justice formed the Claims Management Regulatory Unit (the "CMRU") in order to improve access to justice and promote the interests of consumers by regulating claims management companies and marketing service providers.  Inflexion, another private equity firm, invested in the Group in 2009. In 2010, the Group created the Underdog character as an advertising vehicle, particularly across digital media, to represent how NAHL's core consumer group feel about claiming against large insurance companies, institutions and businesses, and the potential for every consumer to access justice and compensation.
The UK's Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (2012) ("LASPO") was enacted on 1 April 2013. Prior to this, in 2012 Russell Atkinson and Steve Dolton joined the Group in order to manage the business through the period of regulatory change and develop the future group strategy. The Group has been operating its core model in the new regulatory environment for more than a year.
THE GROUP'S BUSINESS 
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK personal injury market, advertising through its core brand - National Accident Helpline.  Established in 1993, the Group's business has grown to an industry-leading position as an outsourced marketing services provider, with approximately £39.7 million of continuing revenues generated in the financial year ended 31 December 2013 and ongoing operating profit of approximately £9.8 million. The Directors believe that, taken together, the Group's National Accident Helpline brand, marketing scale and know-how and its Panel Law Firm relationships form a significant barrier to entry. 
The Group's core business model is based on enquiry origination through direct response marketing, connecting claimants, who have been injured in non-fault accidents, with specialist law firms.  Research suggests that claimants in the UK personal injury litigation market are often not comfortable contacting lawyers directly.  NAHL is an informative but sympathetic intermediary between the consumer and the law firm.  Through the strength and trust generated by the National Accident Helpline brand, and by the Group's Underdog character, created in 2010, NAHL attracts over 200,000 consumer contacts per annum either via website visits, inbound telephone contact or web-chat.  The Group has focused on higher value cases which are mostly not road traffic accidents.  
These contacts are filtered down, using specific criteria, by the Group's legal service advisers and passed on to its Panel Law Firms based on geographic location or specialism of the case.  In 2013, the Group generated in excess of 70,000 Enquiries.  Once an Enquiry has been transferred to a selected Panel Law Firm, the Panel Law Firm carries out its own risk assessment to decide whether to proceed with the claim or take no further action. The Panel Law Firm contracts directly with the claimants. 
As well as enquiry origination, NAHL provides its Panel Law Firms with products that serve part of the legal process.  The main two products are a new ATE insurance product (launched in April 2013 post LASPO) and medical assessments.
NAHL is paid by its Panel Law Firms and by providers of ancillary products, including ATE and medical assessments, in consideration for the provision of such products and services. It is not paid by the claimants.
NAHL has three key advantages over its competition: brand recognition, trust and marketing expertise which have all been built over 20 years.  The National Accident Helpline brand has been developed through more than £200 million of marketing investment since 1993 and, according to market research, ranks as the most recognised, most searched for and most trusted brand in the UK personal injury litigation market.
The incoming contacts are generated as a result of NAHL's advertising.  NAHL does not cold call nor cold text. NAHL campaigned against nuisance marketing during the passage of the LASPO bill through Parliament, and a number of amendments were tabled which reflected NAHL's representations in its submissions to Parliament on 1 February 2012.  NAHL is regulated by the CMRU and was audited on 13 February 2014.
After The Event Insurance
In the Directors' experience, consumers consider ATE insurance products as complimentary to a "no-win no-fee" service.  NAHL independently offers a range of products and services that support the Panel Law Firms in providing a service to claimants.  Since 14 September 2005, the Group has partnered with a leading AA rated insurance company to provide this product. 
Prior to the introduction of LASPO on 1 April 2013, ATE insurance protected the claimant in the event that the claim was unsuccessful, by providing cover against having to pay the defendant's legal fees and both parties' disbursements.  Following LASPO, the claimant is no longer liable to pay defendant's costs in an unsuccessful claim. However, ATE insurance is often integral to a "no win, no fee" agreement to cover the claimant's own disbursements, such as medical reports, court fees and barristers' fees.  In the event of a successful claim, claimants may now have to pay the insurance premium to the ATE provider at the end of the case otherwise the costs are absorbed by the insurance company.
Brand and marketing
NAHL is experienced at driving brand awareness and growth in quality customer generation in the UK personal injury market. According to research, in the UK personal injury market,  National Accident Helpline is the most trusted brand, the most searched for brand, the number one TV and online spender and has the number one click through rate to its website.  The Group has invested more than £200 million in marketing over the past 20 years, and its marketing spend for the year ended 31 December 2013 was approximately £23 million. This was funded entirely out of the Group's cash flow. 
Since 2010, the Group's consumer marketing strategy has focused around the Underdog character, which has differentiated it from its competitors and enabled effective linkage from its TV advertising to its website.  The Underdog character has been particularly successful in positioning the brand with consumers.  According to Adwatch in February 2014, approximately 40 per cent. of people surveyed remembered NAHL's TV adverts. According to research, the Underdog character sympathises with consumers who in NAHL's experience are often not comfortable contacting a lawyer directly. 
NAHL has considerable experience and knowledge of the advertising market and specifically how to market strategically, attracting the types of Enquiries that its Panel Law Firms find valuable. NAHL takes an integrated multi-channel approach to marketing, with the Group's brand being marketed across TV, online and social media.
According to independent tracking, NAHL is a market leader in terms of attracting online impressions (number of appearances in Google searches) and, according to market research, has the highest average position in terms of search results and click-through rates. The Directors believe that this market-leading position is primarily due to the strength of the brand combined with the management team's marketing know-how and search engine bidding strategy.
GROWTH STRATEGY
There are three key segments to the UK personal injury litigation market: road traffic accidents ("RTA"), Non-RTA and clinical negligence. NAHL is well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities provided by the two segments of the market that are growing strongly: non-RTA and clinical negligence. Approximately 72 per cent of enquiries generated by NAHL for its Panel Law Firms in the financial year to 31 December 2013 were in these faster growing non-RTA and clinical negligence segments. The Directors estimate that the Group's share of total claims registered with the Compensation Recovery Unit in the UK personal injury litigation market for the 12 months to 31 March 2013 were as follows: 1.7 per cent. for RTA, 12.0 per cent. for non-RTA, and 12.7 per cent. for clinical negligence. 
NAHL intends to focus on four key platforms for growth:
1.  Market share development
 
NAHL has a strong position in the higher value growth areas of the UK personal injury market, these being non-RTA and clinical negligence. The Directors expect these segments to grow further and by focusing resource on these areas NAHL expects to increase its overall market share. 
In addition, NAHL believes that further consolidation could occur as a result of non-compliant and marginally profitable claims management companies and marketing services providers leaving the industry. NAHL's strong market position makes it ideally placed to benefit from continued consolidation.
NAHL also believes that geographic opportunities exist to increase volume in specific regions, for example Scotland.
2.  Profit enhancement
 
NAHL has been developing closer relationships with a smaller number of Panel Law Firms. Working closely with these Panel Law Firms, the Group expects to develop a number of initiatives to improve overall profitability.
Initiatives such as electronic direct call transfer and enhanced data capture have been introduced since December 2012. NAHL believes that these initiatives could offer improved conversion rates for Panel Law Firms and, as such, should result in higher case profitability for Panel Law Firms over time.
In addition, NAHL expects that Panel Law Firms' case profitability analysis should facilitate tailored marketing activity to enable NAHL to actively target higher convertible work.
The Directors expect that the result of these initiatives will enable margin growth for NAHL, as the value of the services it provides improves case profitability for Panel Law Firms. 
3.  Product and brand extension
 
NAHL currently offers post-accident, pre-settlement services and products. However, NAHL is well placed to leverage the strength of its brand by extending into accident management services and other post-settlement support specialisms that should drive further commission revenue. 
NAHL is also actively developing a new enhanced medical negligence screening service that is expected to add value to its Panel Law Firms by cutting costs and complexity.
4.  Process outsourcing
Opportunities exist for NAHL to offer further services to its Panel Law Firms, which could enable them to reduce their costs and focus on high value legal activity.
Further growth opportunities
 
As the market consolidates there are likely to be opportunities to enhance earnings through targeted acquisitions. The Group has core skills in selling marketing services, and in particular pooled marketing services, to professional businesses. There is, therefore, the opportunity to expand this core competence by offering such services into other fields of professional activity. 
The Directors believe that these strategic opportunities offer NAHL excellent growth prospects.

The results reflect an excellent trading performance, both in terms of the Group's enquiry generation and our panel law firm strategy, which has seen us focus on large, robust, efficient firms.
 
As a result of the Group's highly cash generative business model and robust balance sheet, we have declared an interim dividend of 5.0p per ordinary share. 
 
The Group's market leading position and continued focus on the most attractive segments of a large and growing personal injury market means we are well positioned to benefit from opportunities to deliver further growth in revenue and profit. The momentum has continued to date in the second half and current trading is strong."

Notes to Editors
 
NAHL Group
 
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focused on the UK personal injury market, advertising through its core brand - National Accident Helpline. Having been established in 1993, the Group's business has grown to become the largest outsourced marketing services provider to the personal injury market - a market which is valued at approximately £3 billion in fees generated mainly by law firms. NAHL's core business model is based on enquiry origination through direct response marketing, connecting claimants who have been injured in non-fault accidents with specialist law firms.
 
More information is available at www.nahlgroupplc.co.uk and www.national-accident-helpline.co.uk
 
 
Chairman's Statement
 
I am pleased to report the Group's first set of results since the Company's IPO on AIM on 29th May 2014. These results are for the six months ended 30th June 2014.
 
Summary of Financial Performance
 
NAHL has made good progress, with revenue from continuing operations of £22.1m, up 6.0% (2013 H1: £20.8m). This translates into an increase in underlying operating profit from continuing operations of 25.8%, up from £4.8m to £6.1m.
 
Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations, before share based payments and one-off items, is £5.9m, and £5.7m after share based payments and one-off items. Earnings from continuing operations per share are 10.9 pence. During the period we demerged PPI Claimline Limited, resulting in a loss from discontinued operations of £1.0m.
 
NAHL's business model is highly cash generative, with a 94.4% conversion of operating profit from continuing operations into cash. As a consequence, the balance sheet is robust and at the period end we had net cash of £6.9m. Our balance sheet also shows non-interest bearing liabilities of £8.9m relating to the legacy pre LASPO ATE product, which we expect will be substantially repaid in 2015, giving an effective adjusted net debt position of £2.0m at 30th June 2014. We expect this position to be net cash positive by 31st December 2014. 
 
Interim Dividend
 
As announced at the time of listing, it is the Board's intention to adopt a progressive policy of paying dividends of approximately 66 per cent. of retained profits in each financial year reflecting the Group's high cash conversion ratio and strong balance sheet. We will pay our first interim dividend of 5.0 pence per share on 31st October 2014 to ordinary shareholders registered at the close of business on 3rd October 2014.  
 
Business Review
 
The results reflect a strong trading performance, both in terms of our enquiry generation and our panel law firm strategy. Enquiry generation has performed ahead of our expectations reflecting our market leading position and the effectiveness of our digital strategy and we have benefitted from excellent online lead conversion. The Group has maintained its advertising effectiveness in order to generate this enquiry growth and to support its market leading position, with new advertisements rolled out on national TV in the first half of the year using the Group's Underdog character. This supports National Accident Helpline's position as the most trusted and recognised brand in the sector. 
 
We have been well positioned to take advantage of market consolidation following the legislative changes implemented in 2013; this has seen a 41% reduction in the number of regulated claims management companies in the year to 31 March 2014. This, together with our sector leading brand awareness, has resulted in higher volumes being delivered to our panel law firms cost effectively. 
 
The Group continues to focus on the high growth and value opportunities provided by the two segments of the market that are growing strongly: non-RTA and medical negligence. Approximately 75% per cent of enquiries generated by NAHL for its panel law firms are in these fast growing segments.
 
Group enquiries increased by 10.6% compared to H1 2013 with similar growth in the higher value categories, non-RTA and medical negligence, driven by increasing awareness of the rights and options available to consumers who have been impacted. 
 
Revenue growth from enquiry generation (referred to as solicitor income) is up 5.9% on H1 2013.  With LASPO enacted on 1st April 2013, the comparative period straddles two regulatory regimes and we estimate the underlying rate of growth in enquiries in the post LASPO environment to be materially higher than in the pre LASPO period. 
 
Revenue from the sale of products (medicals, insurance and costs), which are related to the various services required by our panel law firms to run a case efficiently, was up 6.0% in the period and new products continue to perform in line with the Group's forecasts, including our ATE Benchmark product, which was launched in April 2013. Trials are ongoing in relation to a number of additional products under consideration, including an enhanced medical negligence screening service. Initial results have proved encouraging and we expect to provide a further update in due course.
 
Turning to our panel law firms, our strategy of focusing on large, robust, efficient firms continues and we are pleased with the way our enquiry growth has been managed by our panel firms. 
 
Outlook
 
We enjoyed a strong first half and our results demonstrate the importance and value of our well recognised and trusted brand, and the strength and expertise of our marketing strategy. We have continued to generate increasing numbers of high quality enquiries for our panel law firms.
 
The Group remains highly cash generative, supported by a strong balance sheet and we are delighted to be paying our first interim dividend. Our performance in the second half to date continues to be strong, driven by continuing high levels of enquiries as well as an increasingly efficient marketing strategy. We expect a positive out-turn for the year.

Management Report
 
NAHL is a leading UK consumer marketing business focussed on the UK personal injury market, advertising through its core brand - National Accident Helpline.  Since its establishment in 1993 the Group's core business model has been, and remains, based on enquiry origination through direct response marketing, connecting claimants, who have been injured in non-fault accidents, with the Group's panel law firms.
 
Through the strength and trust generated by the National Accident Helpline brand, and by the Group's Underdog character, NAHL is able to generate consistently high quality enquiries which are transferred to panel law firms.  NAHL is paid by these law firms and not by the claimant.  NAHL also receives income from providers of ancillary products which the panel law firms use to run their cases.
 
NAHL was admitted to AIM on 29th May 2014 and the interim financial results for the six months to 30th June 2014 are the Group's first set of results as a public company.  
 
Financial Overview
 
Revenue 
 
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 6.0% to £22.1m (2013 H1: £20.8m).  In addition, in the first quarter of 2013, revenue of £9.4m was generated in relation to commissions received for an 'after the event' ("ATE") insurance product. This product was no longer available in the same form following the implementation of LASPO and has therefore been separately identified.
 
Profitability
 
Underlying operating profit increased by 25.8% to £6.1m (2013 H1: £4.8m).  This is mainly due to a full six months impact of the Group's new pricing model for solicitor income introduced on 1st April 2013. Although the Group's income per enquiry has reduced from £490 to £470, reflecting better value enquiries delivered to our panel law firms, we have seen an overall 34.4% increase in solicitor income profitability to £4.2m (2013 H1: £3.2m).  With our product income profitability also enjoying a 9.4% increase to £2.6m (2013 H1: £2.4m), a continued firm control over administrative and other expenses as well as continually monitoring and controlling the mix of enquiries passed to the panel law firms, our overall operating profit margin from continuing items has increased to 27.4% (2013 H1: 23.1%) and we expect to deliver further improvement as enquiry numbers increase.
 
Two exceptional one-off items, being the payment of an employee bonus of £652,000 and the crystallisation of a contingent asset of £480,000, both related to the Group's admission to AIM and will not continue going forward.  Further details of these amounts are included in Note 4 to this financial statement.
 
Discontinued Operation
 
On 15th May 2014, the Group demerged its PPI Claimline division and its parent company Seebeck 62 Limited via a capital reduction of £1.5m.  This resulted in a loss on disposal of £0.6m which, along with associated losses in the period to 15th May 2014 and associated reorganisation costs / fees of £0.4m, produced a loss from the discontinued operation of £1.0m (2013 H1:  profit of £3.7m).
 
Earnings Per Share
 
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the period were 8.5p and 8.2p respectively in H1 2014, (2013 H1:  32.3p and 31.5p).  Basic and diluted earnings per share for continuing operations for the period were 10.9p and 10.6p respectively in H1 2014, (2013 H1:  23.3p and 22.7p).  The comparative figures for 2013 included income generated from a legacy pre-LASPO ATE product.
 
Dividend
 
The Board has declared an interim dividend of 5.0p per ordinary share (2013 H1: nil) which will be paid on 31st October 2014 to ordinary shareholders registered at the close of business on 3rd October 2014.  The Board intends to pay two thirds of its retained earnings each year as a dividend.  Of this, it is expected that approximately a third will be paid at the interim stage and two thirds at the final stage.  The final payment is expected to be announced in March 2015 for payment in April 2015.
 
Cash and Balance Sheet 
 
The Group had £2.0m of adjusted net debt at 30 June 2014 (2013 H1: £5.3m).  This comprised the following:

The Group was able to reduce net debt as a result of its continued good net cash flow performance from operating activities.  For continuing products, the Group generated £5.7m of operating cash flow (2013 H1: £4.7m) which represents 94.4% of operating profit excluding pre-LASPO ATE, share based payments and one-off items (2013 H1: 97.4%).  The Group continues to collect its solicitor income by direct debit in the month following invoice and therefore would expect this strong operating cash flow performance to continue.  The Group would expect to continue to generate in excess of 90% of operating profit as operating cash flow.

Notes to the condensed set of financial statements
1        General information
The half-year results for the current and comparative period to 30 June are unaudited. The comparative results for 31 December are taken from the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM document for which there is an accountants report.  The information for the year ended 31 December 2013 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Consumer Champion Group Limited group statutory accounts for 31 December 2013 have been reported on by the Group's auditor and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor was (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.  Consumer Champion Group Limited's statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 are available from the Company's registered office at 1430 Montagu Court, Kettering, Northamptonshire, NN15 6XR. The document relating to the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM is available from the Group's website at www.nahlgroupplc.co.uk.
Having made due enquiries the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed set of financial statements.
The condensed set of financial statements was approved by the Board of directors on 22 September 2014.
Basis of Preparation
Statement of compliance
The condensed set of financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2014 has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU and the AIM Rules of UK companies.  It does not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Consumer Champion Group Limited for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM document.
On the 14th May 2014, NAHL Group Limited acquired the shares of Consumer Champion Group Limited on a share for share for share basis resulting in no change in the ultimate ownership of the company. As a result of this the company has adopted the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in preparing these interim results.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the condensed set of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing the condensed set of financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were of the same type as those that applied to the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM Document.
Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM Document.

Geographic information
All revenue and assets of the Group are based in the UK.
Operating segments
The segments used in reporting by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), being the Board, and considered relevant to the business are segmented on a product basis. These segments are:
Solicitor income - Revenue from the provision of enquiries to the panel law firms, based on a cost plus margin model, (based on fixed fee for the period to 31 March 2013). 
Products - Commissions received from providers for the sale of additional products by them to the panel law firms.
Pre-LASPO ATE - Commissions received from the insurance provider for the use of 'after the event' policies by panel law firms. From 1 April 2013, this product was no longer available as a result of LASPO regulatory changes. Included in the balance sheet is a liability that has been separately identified due to its material value. This balance is commissions received in advance that are due to be paid back to the insurance provider. No interest is due on this liability.
Other segments - Costs that are incurred in managing group activities or not specifically related to a product and including share based payments.
One-off items - Costs for the payment of employee bonuses relating to admission of the company to AIM.
PPI Claimline (discontinued) - Provision of claims management services focused on recovery of mis-sold payment protection insurance. This business was demerged via a capital reduction on 15th May 2014.
2          Operating segments (continued)
Cash flows from operating activities - Continuing operations 
A reconciliation of operating profit to cash generation from operations for Continuing operations has been presented below separately identifying net cash flows relating to Continuing products (comprising cash flows associated with Solicitor Income, Products and Other segments), the Pre-LASPO ATE product segment and cash flows within Continuing operations that related to the PPI Claimline division, which is now discontinued. For the period ended 30 June 2014, one off items have also been separately identified.

3        Discontinued operations
The PPI Claimline division was acquired on 10 February 2011 and was classified as a disposal group for sale in the Placing and Admission to Trading on AIM Document as the company had committed to selling this division and expected to conclude a sale within the next six months. The related assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale in the year ended 31 December 2013, and therefore the statement of comprehensive income was restated for discontinued operations for all three years presented.  
On the 15th May 2014, the division was demerged via a capital reduction of £1,500,000 resulting in a loss on disposal of £563,000. This disposal did not change the ultimate control of the company.

4        One-off item
As a result of the admission to AIM process, income was realised on the crystallisation of an asset that was contingent on an exit event. This contingent asset arose as a result of the award of shares to employees by the Employee Benefit Trust ('EBT') under the EMI scheme creating loans repayable on exit. This income totalled £480,000. Under the trust rules this cash and any previously recognised cash in the EBT is required to be used for the benefit of employees. As a result, companywide bonuses were paid in recognition of the successful completion of the IPO. The costs of these bonuses have been included in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income as one-off items totalling £652,000. The £480,000 income received for the contingent asset has been detailed in note 5.

8          Share based payments
The Group operates 3 employee share plans:
 
SAYE plan
The SAYE plan is available to all employees. Options may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an employees' trust or by the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.
 
EMI Scheme
The EMI Plan provides for the grant, to selected employees of the Group, of rights to acquire (whether by subscription or market purchase) Ordinary Shares in the Company (''Options''). Options may be granted as tax-favoured enterprise management incentive options (''EMI Options'') or non-tax favoured Options.
 
LTIP
The LTIP will enable selected employees (including executive Directors) to be granted awards in respect of Ordinary Shares. Awards may be granted in the form of nil or nominal cost options to acquire Ordinary Shares; or contingent rights to receive Ordinary Shares. Awards may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an employees' trust or by the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.
 
During the 6 months to 30th June 2014, £47,000 has been recognised in the income statement in relation to these schemes.  This represents the charge for the period from 29 May 2014 to 30 June 2014 (2013: nil). During 2013 an EMI scheme was in place. This resulted in a £7,000 income which was recognised in the income statement.
 
9          Basic earnings per share




The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 June 2014 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of £3,474,000 (6 months to June 2013: £13,275,000, 12 months to December 2013: £9,458,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary share outstanding of 41,150,000.  As a result of the transactions relating to Company's IPO on 29th May 2014, the total issued ordinary shares have changed materially.  The directors have presented adjusted comparative periods to provide an EPS that gives users a useful comparison for basic and diluted EPS.

10         Financial risk management
The Group's financial risk management objectives and policies are consistent with those disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013. At 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2014 the Group held all financial instruments at Level 3 (as defined in IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures) and there have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.
11      Transactions with owners, recorded directly in equity
On the 29th May 2014, NAHL Group plc was admitted to trading on the AIM market. The steps required to complete this admission have been included within the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity and have been further explained below:
 
Issue of deferred share
A deferred share was issued at a premium resulting in the transfer of £50,000,000 from the merger reserve to share premium.NAHL Group plc declared a bonus issue to of a single deferred share of £0.0001 (a "Deferred Share") with a share premium £50,000,000. This transaction resulted in £50,000,000 of the merger reserve being transferred to the share premium account split pro rata between the different classes of shares.
 
Disposal of assets held for sale
The market value of the group of companies, headed by Seebeck 62 Limited, classified as held for sale was calculated as being £1,500,000 by the directors of the company. On the 15th May 2014, Seebeck 62 Limited was then demerged via a capital reduction of this value to the share premium account. A same day registration of the reduction of capital at Companies House has been made. Further details of the demerger can be seen in note 3.
 
Issue of new ordinary shares
On the 29th of May 2014, 1,150,000 new ordinary shares with a par value of £0.0025 were issued. These raised an additional £2,300,000 funds for the company. The fees relating to this transaction totalled £1,436,000. These costs have been charged as a reduction to share premium resulting in a net increase to share premium of £861,000 and share capital of £3,000.
 
Other transactions with owners
Included within other transactions with owners are the following transactions resulting in a net impact of £45,000:
·      Share capital has been reduced by £131,000. This is the result of £172,000 reduction in the par value of existing shares and the bonus issue of F shares increasing share capital by £41,000. The bonus issue occurred prior to merger where Consumer Champion Group Limited declared a 99 for 1 F share bonus issue to all shareholders using distributable reserves. There was then an F share 1 for 100 consolidation.
·      Acquisition accounting for the purchase also resulted in the removal of interest in own shares of £14,000.
·      Share premium has been increased to allow the £172,000 reduction in the par value of shares set off by the removal of £100,000 existing share premium as part of the acquisition accounting.
 
12      Related parties
