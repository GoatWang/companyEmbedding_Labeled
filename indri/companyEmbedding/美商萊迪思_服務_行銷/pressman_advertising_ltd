Enhancing brand value. Enriching client equity.


We are one of India's leading independent full service advertising agencies with wide capabilities
                                                      and a substantial reputation built over more than four decades. We provide advertising, design, 
                                                      media planning and buying, market research, digital and public relations services to hundreds of clients.





We believe that creativity for its own sake is fool's gold; it must be founded on sound overall strategy. 
                                                      If there's anything that distinguishes our style, its our stress on hard facts, simplicity and relevance. 
                                                      That's why we're unfailingly successful in our work.





We consider every angle before making recommendations, while keeping an eye on the budget.
                                                      Effective ideas needn't cost a fortune, as we have demonstrated time and again.





At Pressman, we don't just rely on conventional wisdom. We listen. We take time to understand the
                                                      clients' business and goals. And then we deliver in the most effective way using our wealth of
                                                      specialist knowledge and experience.





Our work is characterized by a determination to achieve excellence in our mission: creating competitive advantages for our clients, enhancing brand values and enriching client equity.

Brand / Product Advertising


We believe that enduring ideas are the key to successful communications. It was true when 
                                                            we started in the early sixties, it is true today and will be true tomorrow. So, everything we do, 
                                                            supports that thought. 





Pressman’s capabilities begin at the very inception of a brand: giving tangible form to the personality 
                                                            of the service or product.





Over the years, Pressman has been particularly successful in brand creation and promotion of products from organizations drawn from various sectors.





We make it our business to understand brands and products and what it takes to engage customers 
                                                            and consumers.  We have an enviable records in the art of developing ideas that work in our markets.








We are experienced at overcoming marketing challenges. We start with insights and use creative 
                                                            thinking to produce advertising that promotes our clients' brands. 





 Our creativity endeavours to capture consumers' attention by making them think and feel, and causes them to not only buy brands but buy into them.
