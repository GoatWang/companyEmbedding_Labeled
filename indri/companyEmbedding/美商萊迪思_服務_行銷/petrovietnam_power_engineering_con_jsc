Operations[edit]

In order to help pay for the costs stemming from the Deepwater Horizon explosion, BP plans to sell its stakes in gas and oil properties in Vietnam. It maintains joint ownership of such projects — Lan Tay-Lan Do gas field and Nam Con Son pipeline — with ONGC, PetroVietnam, and ConocoPhillips. Moreover, its partners will be given priority when purchasing its shares should Hanoi approve the transaction.[5] India has expressed interest in buying BP's assets to secure needed energy resources for its fast-growing economy.[3]
