Classified ads are a great way to list items, services, or properties for sale without creating an auction-style or fixed price listing. You can create a classified ad on eBay.com or on Close5 (formerly eBay Classifieds). Use eBay.com to let millions of buyers around the country see your listing, or choose Close5 (www.close5.com)  and focus your selling locally. The table below shows the benefits of each option:
