ChinaNet Online Announces Field Test Results of its New Intelligent Marketing Data Services System CloudX
Customer sales increased up to 6 times during Beijing Sakura Festival trial

BEIJING, May  11, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChinaNet Online Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:CNET) ("ChinaNet" or the "Company"), a leading B2B (business to business) Internet technology company providing online-to-offline (O2O) sales channel expansion, business strategies and marketing solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by utilizing data analysis and cloud computing technologies in the People's Republic of China, today announced that its self-developed business intelligent marketing data services system, CloudX, was installed and tested at 13 food and beverage stores for field testing during the Beijing Sakura Festival (the "Festival") in April with improvements 
in weekly sales of up to six times average.
The new CloudX system, set to launch officially in late May, collects and analyzes product sale numbers from stores and is analyzed by ChinaNet for suggested adjustments to product stock and inventory to improve customer sales. By utilizing CloudX in stores, ChinaNet can provide owners with sales analysis reports, including each single item's sales amount and period of time. In addition, by utilizing the combination of We-chat, customized mobile applications, on-line shopping platform and other mobile terminal channels, CloudX can help store owners effectively manage subordinate stores and simultaneously provide accurate marketing strategies to meet the demands of individual customers. Results from the month long trial showed 
that the new CloudX system successfully helped all 13 stores increase their average weekly sales revenues, with the highest store achieving six times revenues compared to its first week of sales during the Festival. The Beijing Sakura Festival lasts for one month. After the first week of data collecting and analyzing, ChinaNet instructed store owners how to adjust their inventory and products accordingly. In the second week and third weeks, all 13 shops' sales were up at least 2 to 3 times higher than the first week, with one store achieving six times higher sales. During the last week, the Festival suffered from poor weather, however sales were still higher than the first week. "The main purpose of this test was to analyze the capability of our CloudX system in helping stores 
increase their sales revenues, and we were very pleased with the results," said Mr. Handong Cheng, Chairman and CEO of ChinaNet. "Although these stores sell their single product at an average price of 20 RMB, they achieved total sales of 800,000 RMB during the Festival. We were especially excited to see one individual store increase its weekly sales by 6 times after using CloudX. The system was judged highly by store owners during the Festival. With these results, and after debugging and optimizing, CloudX will be officially launched at the end of May, adding to our growing ecosystem of SME products and services." About ChinaNet Online Holdings, Inc. The Company, a parent company of 
ChinaNet Online Media Group Ltd., incorporated in the BVI ("ChinaNet"), is a leading digital B2B (business to business) Internet technology company focusing on providing O2O sales channel expansion service for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurial management and networking service for entrepreneurs in China.

Baidu

                                     •  IT Consulting & Services                                                                             •  George Town, GT                                                                    

                                    Baidu was founded in 2000 by Internet pioneer Robin Li, creator of visionary search technology Hyperlink Analysis, with the mission of providing the best way for people to find what they’re looking for online. Over the past decade we have strived to fulfill this mission by listening carefully to our users’ needs and wants. To provide intelligent, relevant search results for the tens of billions of queries that are entered into our search platform every day, we focus on powering the best technology optimized for up-to-date local tastes and preferences. Our deep understanding of Chinese language and culture is central to our success and this kind of knowledge allows us to tailor our search technology for our users’ needs. Just to cite one example, we believe there are at least 38 ways of saying "I" in the Chinese language. It is important that we recognize these nuances to effectively address our users’ requests.

We provide our users with many channels to find and share information. In addition to our core web search product, we power many popular community-based products, such as Baidu PostBar, the world’s first and largest Chinese-language query-based searchable online community platform, Baidu Knows, the world’s largest Chinese-language interactive knowledge-sharing platform, and Baidu Encyclopedia, the world’s largest user-generated Chinese-language encyclopedia, to name but a few. Beyond these marquee products we also offer dozens of helpful vertical search-based products, such as Maps, Image Search, Video Search, News Search, and many more. We power these through our cutting-edge technology, continually innovating to enhance these services. Our new Box Computing Open Platform brings users deep-linked content and even applications they can use directly through their search box. We believe that Box Computing will dramatically improve people’s search experience and become ubiquitous across all Internet devices including computers and mobile platforms.

In addition to serving individual users, we also serve as a media platform for online marketing customers. Our business model is mainly based on a performance-oriented marketing platform for businesses to cost effectively reach relevant Internet users. We offer performance-based online marketing services and display advertisements through both Baidu organic websites and our affiliated websites (our Union business). Our affiliated websites lead traffic to us through integrating a Baidu search box into their sites and/or by displaying relevant contextual promotional links for our customers. The majority of our revenue is derived from performance-based online marketing services and our customers pay on a cost per click basis – that is, our customers only pay when their paid-link is clicked through and they get the “lead”. Our goal is to give our customers an online marketing platform that has a wide range of functions which they can use to meet their marketing needs and an extensive selection of tools for managing their accounts as well as data for analyzing and optimizing ROI.

To best serve our customers, our sales efforts consist of direct sales teams in first tier cities and third-party distributors in lower tier cities. This allows us to better penetrate each market and tailor our support and personal interaction based on customers’ needs. Today, our online marketing platform serves hundreds of thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and many branded multinational customers. The measurable ROI offered by our online marketing platform has made it one of the most effective marketing platforms for companies targeting the Chinese market. We will continue to strive to provide an extra level of value-added sales and customer service to address a wide range of customer needs. Our focus is to help the market continue to develop and educate the many companies who don’t understand the benefits of search engine marketing so that we can help them grow their businesses.
