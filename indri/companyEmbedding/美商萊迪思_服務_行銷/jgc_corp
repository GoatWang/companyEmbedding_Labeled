Cordoba/Spain


Summary


In the Cordoba Region of southern Spain, JGC operates two commercial solar thermal power plants that sell power to the Spanish grid. The plants, each of which has a capacity of 50MW (100MW in total), started operation in 2012. This is the first commercial solar thermal power project invested in by a Japanese company. Solar thermal power generation uses mirrors to concentrate heat from sunlight, then use the heat to create steam that can drive a turbine and generate electricity. Solar thermal power is drawing interest worldwide as a sustainable energy source, since it uses essentially no fossil fuels, and thus, generates almost no greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in sustainable energy, JGC hopes to make its own contribution to cutting down on green house gas emissions and mitigating global warming.

Summary


In October of 2008, JGC began a pilot project for purifying the water of Lake Tai in China’s Jiangsu province.  The lake had been experiencing rapid deterioration in water quality due to pollution.  The pilot project was a great success.  Inside of three weeks, using ozone-based technology, JGC purified lake water, which had been given the lowest possible water-quality ranking, into water suitable for drinking.

Between 2009 and 2012, through a cooperative development business model between the Japanese and Chinese governments, JGC conducted demonstration research for the purpose of building a water quality improvement system and promotion for Dianchi Lake in China’s Yunnan province, one of the most polluted lakes in China.  The water purification facilities included two purifiers, each with a processing capacity of 300m3/hour.  The volume of purified water totaled between 5 and 15 million cubic meters per year, and successfully met the equivalent of level III on China’s groundwater rating scale (water fit for drinking.)

Summary


In JGC’s proprietary sewage sludge-to-fuel conversion system, the sludge is first dried, significantly reducing its weight and volume.  Next, the dried sludge is converted into a high-value biomass fuel or feedstock with a water content of 10%.  Low-level waste heat can be used as a heat source for the drying process.  In Japan, JGC has constructed seven sludge-to-fuel facilities attached to cement plants and sewage sludge melting plants, and continues to perform operations and maintenance services for a portion of them.

Summary


Together with the Chinese company ACRE, JGC has received a contract to provide a technology of LNG production from coke oven gas (COG) to a coke manufacturer in China’s Shandong province. JGC has experience with this technology in Japan, but this is our first application of the technology in China.  China generates ten million tons of unused COG per year.  By converting this gas into LNG and municipal gas (SNG), a former waste product can be used for energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and greatly contributing to meeting the rising demand for natural gas.

Summary


Coal-fired power plants are one of the main sources of pollution from nitrogen oxides (NOx), which cause photochemical smog. JGC’s subsidiary JCG Catalysts and Chemicals has developed honeycomb structure NOx Removal catalysts, which effectively separate NOx from harmless nitrogen and water when reacted with exhaust smoke. JGC Catalysts and Chemicals has since marketed this new technology in Europe, the USA, Korea and China, and now 60% of the NOx Removal catalysts produced worldwide are manufactured using JGC’s technology. Our subsidiary in China is working to further expand business through catalyst feedstock procurement and supply to new licensees of the production technology.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are not only a source of noxious odors, but also create PM2.5 when they react with sunlight.  Because of this, the governments of many countries such as China are embarking on strict VOCs regulation.  JGC Group company, Nikki-Universal manufactures various kinds of catalysts.  One of their portfolios, oxidation catalysts destroy VOCs effectively in the air by the oxidation reaction.  These catalysts are in widespread use in Japan and overseas.

Summary


Sulfur contained in gasoline and kerosene is a significant contributor to sulfur oxide (SOx) pollution in the atmosphere, which causes acid rain. In response to tighter environmental regulations, JGC worked on developing desulfurization process technology for oil refineries, and has since performed engineering and construction work for many ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) plants. The necessary catalysts for the desulfurization process were developed and manufactured by JGC Group company JGC Catalysts and Chemicals, and they have been evaluated highly by many oil companies in Japan and overseas.

In Quzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, JGC conducted a business to capture and decompose HFC23, a greenhouse gas, emitted from a chlorofluorocarbon substitute factory owned by Zhejiang Juhua Co., Ltd and to acquire carbon credits. This was the first CDM project between China and Japan, and over the course of 7 years it has achieved emissions reductions equivalent to 40 million tons of CO2, making a large contribution toward mitigating global warning and meeting Japan’s emissions reduction obligations.

Summary


In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in partnership with Inner Mongolia Elion Jidong Cement Co., Ltd, JGC developed the world’s first CDM project based around a new technology for alternative feedstock for cement production.  This CDM project uses carbide residue (calcium hydroxide) left over from vinyl chloride production as a feedstock for cement production, instead of the conventional limestone (calcium carbonate).  This process not only enables leftover carbide residues to be put to good use, but the CO2 emissions released during the process are replaced with water vapor, meaning that the entire factory could make substantial cuts in its carbon emissions.

JGC performed engineering and construction services for a natural gas processing plant in Algeria’s In Salah region owned by Sonatrach, BP and Statoil.  The plant started commercial operation in 2004.  As an environmental measure, the CO2 contained in the feed gas was not released into the atmosphere, but rather a total of 1 million tons of CO2 per year were compressed and injected underground for storage.  JGC constructed a facility to compress and inject the CO2 2000 meters underground, into the peripheral layer of the gas field itself.

Summary


In partnership with the German company BASF, JGC has developed and commercialized a new process technology for CO2 capture and storage, called HiPACT®.  HiPACT® is a technology for recovering CO2 from natural gas and synthesis gas with high pressure, which can help to greatly reduce the energy and the cost of underground storage of CO2.  To demonstrate the applicability of the new technology to commercial facilities, JGC partnered with INPEX Corporation to install a demonstration version of the technology at INPEX’s Koshijihara plant in Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture.  Operations began in August 2010.   HiPACT® technology was used to recovery CO2 from the actual natural gas processed at the plant, on a scale of 40,000 tons per year.

Summary


In Khabarovsk, Russia, JGC is currently constructing a factory for greenhouse cultivation of vegetables, and simultaneously promoting a business for the production and sale of the vegetables grown at the facility. In Russia, consumer concern for the quality and safety of agricultural products is increasing, but a shortage of greenhouse agricultural facilities, particularly in the Far East region of the country, means that high-quality local vegetables are in short supply outside of the summer season. To address this, JGC has constructed a facility adapted to the local environment, to enable Japanese-style cultivation with a high emphasis on quality, providing consumers with local produce year-round. By offering solutions tailored to local needs, JGC is beginning to expand into agribusiness on a global scale.
