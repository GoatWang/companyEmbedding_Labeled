This technology has opened up a floodgate where innovative ideas can now be realized for our clients. It has further cemented our status as the leading advertising agency in South Korea as we continue to leverage technology to deliver the best solutions to our clients.Shane ParkHead of Interactive Division of CheilLeading Korean advertising agency Cheil Worldwide shows leadership in Multi Platform Advertising as it creates a “first of its kind” live streaming.
Customer Background
Cheil Worldwide Inc. is a global marketing and communications company headquartered in Seoul, South Korea and operates 29 networks in 25 countries. It is South Korea's largest advertising agency and was ranked 19th in the world by Advertising Age for 2010. Cheil offers marketing communications services including advertising, public relations, sports marketing, exhibition and display production, as well as the production of large-scale performance events. Cheil also operates a Communication Sciences Institute that publishes trend reports on the South Korean advertising industry.
Internationally, Cheil has carried out communications campaigns for Samsung Electronics. In 2009, Cheil acquired The Barbarian Group, a leading digital creative and marketing company to secure a strong foothold in digital marketing capabilities in the U.S. and beyond.
Solution
Cheil is leveraging the Brightcove platform to deliver first of its kind live streaming video content to Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad, Android devices, and the Web.
As part of this, Cheil is also taking advantage of Inlet Technologies Spinnaker™7100 to encode live streams and push content to Adobe® Flash® Media Server and HTTP streaming servers of Shinsegae Information and Communications, a South Korean Content Delivery Network vendor.
Key Benefits
With the success of the first of its kind live streaming, this event has opened up a new world of opportunities for Cheil Worldwide’s employees. What had started out as a tool for education and training for the internal Cheil use has seen enthusiastic take up with the organization’s clients, including Samsung Electronics, to deploy it as the core of their digital strategy globally.
Business Challenge
Cheil Worldwide’s i-division hosted a conference with a panel of five distinguished social network marketing experts for internal Cheil employees to learn how a traditional ad agency can leverage social marketing in the era of multi platform advertising.
With staff of more than 70, the i-division is the digital marketing department of Cheil Worldwide and is leading the charge for Internet and social media advertising.
The i-division wanted to reach out to as many employees as possible and not be limited by a physical location as they have several office locations in South Korea. Live streaming of the event was an option that needed to be investigated. Cheil contacted James Yoon of Brightcove who worked with them to deliver the live streaming event.
Business Solution
Brightcove enabled Cheil to deliver the first of its kind live streaming for this event, making content accessible across Apple and Android mobile devices and on the Web.
Brightcove’s support engineers provided real-time support throughout the event to ensure that the live streaming went smoothly. As a result, the live event was a major success, with different Cheil departments asking for more meetings to understand how to leverage Brightcove for their client’s digital and mobile campaign.

Future Growth with Brightcove
Thanks to the success of the first live event, Cheil Worldwide has decided to leverage Brightcove for the global Samsung account, which is the agency’s key account. This underscores the organization’s confidence in Brightcove’s solution and support.
Cheil has also leveraged Brightcove to showcase a mobile e-learning platform at a recent Human Resource forum for the Samsung Group companies, further evidence of the effectiveness of the Brightcove platform.

The Who is Who of design companies on Red Dot 21
The best design products of well-known manufacturers and design brands from around the world can be found on Red Dot 21 in the “Manufacturers” menu item. Hundreds of manufacturers from every corner of the globe have been included. Some are small or medium-sized businesses, some are start-ups, others are international, stock-market listed corporations. Despite all these differences, they have one thing in common, the ambition to offer their customers particularly well-designed products. They have all understood what Thomas J. Watson Jr., the one-time CEO of IBM, meant when he said, “Good design is good business.” These companies know that consumers are increasingly aware of quality, and they understand that design is an important criterion in purchasing decisions. Many firms have also realised that the design of a product says a lot about a company’s power of innovation, its quality performance and the benefit the customer derives from the product. That is why they make targeted investments in design and try in this way to differentiate themselves from competition.
Sustained design performance and powers of innovation
There are companies who manage to achieve this with particular skill, sustained design performance and powers of innovation over a long period of time. Every year, the Red Dot Award: Product Design recognises this and awards one of these organisations the honorary title “Red Dot: Design Team of the Year” for its sustained design performance and powers of innovation. In the past, the title has gone to, among others, Sony, Apple, Mercedes, Audi, Miele, LG Electronics, LG, Porsche, BMW, Pininfarina, Bose, Lenovo, Grohe, adidas, Hilti and Blackmagic Design. But smaller and less well-known design brands also achieve great things with their products and are worthy of your attention.
Take a look at the self-portraits of one or other of these manufacturers if a product is of particular interest to you. You will also find the business address and a link to the website, as well as information on further design products made by the same company.
