Company Overview

Compared to peers, relative underperformance last month is down from a median performance last year.


AECOM trades at a lower Price/Book multiple (1.54) than its peer median (1.94).


The market expects faster earnings growth from ACM-US than from its peers and also a turnaround in its current ROE.


ACM-US has relatively low profit margins and median asset efficiency.


Changes in annual earnings (relative to peers) are better than the change in its revenues (relative to peers), implying the company is focused more on earnings.


Over the last five years, ACM-US‘s return on assets has declined from about median to less than the median among its peers suggesting that the company’s historical competitiveness in operations is slipping away.


The company’s relatively low gross and pre-tax margins suggest a non-differentiated product portfolio and not much control on operating costs relative to peers.


Compared with the peers chosen, ACM-US has had faster revenue growth in prior years and a current P/E ratio that suggests faster growth in the future suggesting superior growth expectations.


The company is likely overinvesting in a business with only median returns.


ACM-US seems to be constrained by the current level of debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
ACM-US is debt-constrained.

With debt at a relatively high 50.34% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 32.95%), and interest coverage level of 2.04x, ACM-US seems debt-constrained.


All 7 peers for the company have an outstanding debt balance.

ACM-US has moved to a relatively high leverage from a Limited Flexibility profile at the prior year-end.

ACM-US‘s interest coverage has increased 0.59 points from last year’s low but is still below its four-year average interest coverage of 6.59.


While its interest coverage increased to 2.04x from 1.45x (in 2015), its peer median decreased during this period to 3.66x from 7.52x.


Interest coverage rose 4.46 points relative to peers. It is also below the 2.50x coverage benchmark unlike the peer median.


ACM-US‘s debt-EV has declined 5.11 percentage points from last year’s high but remains above its four-year average debt-EV of 38.15.


While its debt-EV decreased to 50.34% from 55.46% (in 2015), its peer median increased during this period to 32.95% from 23.00%.


Relative to peers, debt-EV fell 15.06 percentage points.
