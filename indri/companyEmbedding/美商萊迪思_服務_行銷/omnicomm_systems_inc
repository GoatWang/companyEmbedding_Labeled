OmniComm Systems, Inc., incorporated on November 19, 1996, is engaged in providing Web-based electronic data capture (EDC) and eClinical (eClinical) software and services that manage the clinical research process. The Company's EDC and eClinical software and service offerings (eClinical Products or eClinical Solutions) consist of TrialMaster, TrialOne, Promasys, and eClinical Suite. Its eClinical Products allows clinical trial sponsors and investigative sites to collect, validate, transmit and analyze clinical study data. Its eClinical Products are designed to offer clinical trial sponsors the ability to conduct clinical trials under multiple platforms. The Company also provides business process consulting services that focus on integrating EDC, and an array of eClinical Solutions and processes into the clinical trial process. The Company operates through the delivery of EDC Software and services to clinical trial sponsors segment.The Company's core product is TrialMaster, which allows organizations conducting clinical trials to collect and manage their clinical trial data over the Internet. Users at investigative sites, such as hospitals and doctor's offices can enter data into electronic forms that represent the study protocol, and the data is validated against a set of protocol-specific rules. TrialMaster has open application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow other clinical trial applications to send and receive data over the Internet. TrialMaster has an integrated electronic learning system, a set of standard reports and integrated ad-hoc reporting using business intelligence tool, LogiXML. TrialMaster allows the collected data to be extracted in a range of standard formats, such as database tables, comma-delimited files and SAS datasets.TrialBuilder is the tool, which the Company's customers and professional services staff use to model a clinical study. This includes the data collection forms, the data consistency rules and the visit schedule, as well as the workflow and security rules for accessing and managing the data. TrialBuilder is a multi-window application with a productive user interface that utilizes drag-and-drop functionality. TrialMaster Archive allows the Company to provide human and machine-readable copies of the data when a clinical study has been completed. The human-readable format consists of portable document format (PDF) files that represent the data exactly as it was displayed on the interactive Webpages. These are delivered to the client through compact disc (CD) in a read-only format. The TrialMaster Archive also includes an optional Submission Module, which creates a casebook containing PDF formatted copies of all case report forms (CRFs).TrialOne is a Web-based application, which provides real-time access to all study information, in particular trial sponsors and investigators are provided with information that allows for decision making. TrialOne is a software application suite that provides clinical trial site sponsors, study investigators and study monitors with several tools designed at making the overall Phase I operation. Phase I studies are used to conduct the first tests of new drugs or medical devices in humans. The key components of the TrialOne application include sample tracking, subject recruitment and screening, scheduler, direct data capture (DDC) and Ad Hoc reporting.TrialOne allows customers to automate their site's laboratory. Samples can be tracked and batched while alarms and information can be configured specific to each sample. Dispatch lists and labels are automatically produced for shipment of samples to the central laboratory. Data is then received back electronically into the TrialOne database. The TrialOne subject recruitment module provides necessary functionality for automating the collection and tracking of information involved in finding, screening and scheduling subject candidates for an early phase study. The scheduler module provides a mechanism for defining the study structure including a time and events schedule. The DDC module allows capture of real-time data for screening or study at data collection stations, bed-side or roaming. An integrated Ad Hoc reporting tool is available with wizard-driven report generation with drill-down reports that include interactive charts and graphs.The Company's Promasys is an integrated clinical trial data management and EDC system that manages data collection, data management and reporting process in clinical trials. Promasys supports the execution of good clinical practice (GCP) compliant clinical trials with the Study Life Cycle, the quality engine of the system that divides a clinical trial in over seven distinct phases. The WebCRF is a data entry interface that works through a Web browser. It allows enrolling and including subjects and entering trial data without the need to install Promasys' windows client component.The eClinical Suite is comprises a number of configurable modules that can be combined to provide a solution for capturing and managing clinical trial data based on specific client needs. The modules are eClinical Portal, eClinical Data Management, eClinical Data Capture, eClinical Study Conduct, eClinical Adverse Event Reporting and eClinical Autoencoder. The eClinical Portal is a gateway to various functions, data and reports. In eClinical Data Management, protocols are defined using libraries of reusable standard objects, such as codelists, data items, data modules, pages and edit checks. The eClinical Data Capture is an EDC module used by investigator sites and client personnel, such as data managers, statisticians and safety. The eClinical Study Conduct allows the clinical operations organization to manage the timelines, resources, budget, payments, clinical supplies, and key study milestones and metrics. The eClinical Adverse Event Reporting is based on industry standards for safety reporting, and it allows for the capture, review, reporting and global submission of both serious and non-serious adverse event cases. The eClinical Autoencoder delivers both automated and manual coding of adverse event and drug medication terminology using standard and custom dictionaries and configurable coding algorithms.The Company's services include hosting solutions, consulting services, customer support, training and the delivery of implementation services for Technology Transfer engagements, including installation, configuration, validation and training.

Promasys
An integrated clinical trial data management and EDC system
















Product Overview
Promasys® is an integrated clinical data management and EDC system that brings industry standard quality and efficiency to the data collection and data management in your clinical trials. Built on a history of innovation spanning 25 years and utilized in over 1000 clinical trials around the globe, Promasys has become the leading data management and EDC solution of choice to many of the world's leading academic, medical research and life sciences organizations.
“CHDR performs perhaps the most complicated pharmacokinetic-dynamic studies in the field and our studies produce a data flow that would be unmanageable without this system (Promasys). The change to the iPad product leads to immediate and considerable savings in staff costs that easily outweighs the acquisition cost. The smooth workflow from design of the database to the final publication is another feature we could not do without.” Adam Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Clinical Pharmacology and CEO, Centre for Human Drug Research
Efficient
Streamlining and increasing the efficiency in the clinical data management, data capture and reporting process is a cornerstone of Promasys. From end to end Promasys was developed to increase the speed of study start-up and data capture while virtually eliminating the need of IT or programming skills. Promasys is focused on ensuring high data integrity and quality controlled clinical trial conduct.
Mobile EDC
Promasys features an innovative iPad compatible EDC that brings secure mobile data entry and subject management to the clinical trials work floor. The Promasys iPad app delivers Promasys’ featured support for data quality and integrity and regulatory compliance on a mobile device, making it easier for research nurses and study investigators to enter and review data while at the point of care. Study monitors also benefit from the mobile capability of the Promasys iPad app: when doing source document verification tasks at the study site they can review the data in the database (with read-only access), look at the audit trail information of data items, raise and review queries and sign off data for review.
Flexible
Resource limitations pose a significant challenge for investigator initiated trials. Promasys is designed to meet these unique requirements. Protocol amendments and mid-study changes are efficiently and quickly applied, and consistency between the data capture tools and the database are always ensured. Promasys provides the right balance between control and flexibility.
Benefits

Affordable and versatile: efficiently run high quality clinical trials with maximum cost efficiency
Fast study build, no programming required; copy complete study design or just individual design items from templates or other studies; easily exchange study design between Promasys users (send as email attachment)
Set and forget access control; compliance with rules and regulations (GCP) ensured by the Study Life Cycle™, Promasys’ built in quality control engine; full audit trail on data items and on study design
The Promasys iPad app: fully functional, multilingual mobile EDC out of the box
Supports paper based trials with double data entry, paperless trials with full electronic data capture, or hybrid studies
Promasys gives the investigator ownership of the clinical trial data while maintaining data integrity: data of all studies in Promasys remain always accessible for review and export












“We look forward to working with OmniComm Promasys. Having worked with several commercial technologies over the past couple of years, we were impressed by the ease of operation of the Promasys system, and with the backing of an established company such as OmniComm feel that Promasys will go from strength to strength.” Carol Stillwell, Head of Data Management, Surrey CRC

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Innovation and Interoperability is the Focus of Version 4.2
Fort Lauderdale, FL, December 30, 2013 – OmniComm Systems, Inc (OTC: OMCM), today announced the production availability of Version 4.2 of TrialMaster, its flagship product for Electronic Data Capture (EDC). This new release includes hundreds of innovative productivity and functionality enhancements, including additional features for auto-redaction for faster and more efficient centralized and riskedbased monitoring, and major new features for exporting data utilizing OmniComm’s award winning Export Utility
“This is going to be a significant release for the industry.” said Kuno van der Post, SVP of Business Development, “The industry is changing rapidly with new regulations and guidance being released by the FDA. OmniComm has set itself apart by releasing new technology that not only accommodates these changes, but allows our customers to capitalize on the benefits from them. Moreover, our significant investment in R&D is paying off with our all in-house development team delivering this significant new release within the promised timeframe and budget.”
Within three years, companies will be required by the FDA to provide their final datasets in Study Data Tabulation Model (STDM) format. TrialMaster 4.2 has automated the mapping and transposition tools required to perform this work. “The return on investment for our customers is very compelling” said Keith Howells, SVP of Product Development. “For example, our fully automated SDTM data export utility means that within 24 hours of database lock you can have your data in SDTM format. This saves our clients significant amounts of time and money per study.”
TrialMaster 4.2 has also been engineered for high performance and stability. It is built on the latest Microsoft technology stack and supports the most modern and fastest browsers, including Internet Explorer 11, Firefox and Chrome. This means the product can support the largest and most complex clinical trials, while retaining its legendary ease of use.
“The focus of this release is clearly on innovation, but a significant amount of work has also gone into this release to ensure stability and optimal performance. There are a large number of stability and productivity enhancements that may not make headlines, but offer enhanced value to our customers. A complete new interface offering double data entry has been added to go along with the game changing new features,” said Stephen Johnson, OmniComm’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “Companies looking for a robust and full-featured EDC product will appreciate the best in class technology in TrialMaster 4.2.”
