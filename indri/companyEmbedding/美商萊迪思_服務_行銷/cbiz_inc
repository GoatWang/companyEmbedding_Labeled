AUSTIN, Texas, July 24, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- HomeAway, Inc. (NASDAQ: AWAY), the world's largest online marketplace for vacation rentals, now offers HomeAway Assure(TM), a CBIZ Insurance Program, the first insurance product tailored specifically for vacation rental properties featuring an online calculator that delivers a quote within five minutes.
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120215/DA53778LOGO)
Provided in partnership with CBIZ Insurance Services, Inc. (NYSE: CBZ), HomeAway Assure enables any U.S. vacation home owner, not just HomeAway® customers, to insure their property with a policy designed to cover the risks specific to vacation rentals not included in many second home insurance policies:

    --  Third-party liability coverage protects the homeowner against lawsuits
        or expenses associated with a renter suffering bodily injury while on
        the rental property.
    --  Property damage and replacement cost coverage for the home and its
        contents are offered at varying deductible rates.  This coverage extends
        to a home's amenities such as a swimming pool, watercraft or docks and
        piers.
    --  Business interruption coverage protects against the loss of rental
        income as a result of an unexpected disruption such as a house fire,
        natural disaster or other coverable incident that would render the home
        unable to rent.

In less than five minutes, vacation rental owners can determine their individual cost of HomeAway Assure coverage using the CBIZ online policy quote calculator tool at: http://www.cbizspecialtyinsurance.com/HomeAwayAssure.
"It is a common misconception among owners that their vacation rental homes are adequately covered by traditional second home insurance policies," says CBIZ Insurance Services Senior Vice President Scott Wolf.  "Where other second home policies fall short, HomeAway Assure will prove greatly impactful in the protection of vacation rental owners who can now receive comprehensive coverage for their homes."
"Vacation rental owners have such a strong, personal connection with their homes," says Brian Sharples, chief executive officer of HomeAway.  "It's important for us to offer an insurance product that helps protect our customers' properties and preserve the vacation experience they share with their guests."

While a Chief Technology Officer is responsible for the overall direction and guidance of the department, teams of various personnel are responsible for maintaining the company's day-to-day operations. The department can be divided into two teams including Infrastructure and Applications. 

The Infrastructure team oversees the maintenance of the company's IT infrastructure used to support its business operations. The department staffs personnel responsible for maintaining the company's security, telecommunication, database, and data storage infrastructure separated by region across the country.

The Applications team, like Infrastructure, is divided amongst the country's different regions. This team is responsible for the development, support, and implementation of the company's enterprise applications used to support its business operations. Personnel are staffed in Kansas City that is responsible for maintaining the company's HRIS environment.
