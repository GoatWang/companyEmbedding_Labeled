As a furnace operates and blows out air, it must at the same time return to it that same amount of air. A return air plenum is the ducting that is attached to a furnace for that return air to flow through, and is used as a central manifold for other return air ducting.
Your order will also include Alpine's exclusive free instructional video on DVD! Watch as a pro quickly assembles the return air plenum, and shows you how to do the same. You'll have all your questions answered as you see how fast and extrememly easy it is to put together. Plenum assembles in about 5 minutes.
NOTE: Return air plenums are only available for purchase with equipment orders- such as furnaces, heat pumps or air conditioners - since their packaging requires they be delivered on a pallet.

Variants
Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6T


The Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada, is one of the most popular turboprop aircraft engines in history.[4] The PT6 family is known for its reliability with an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 per 333000 hours since 1963,[5] 1 per 651,126 hours over 12 months in 2016.[6] Time between overhauls are between 3600 and 9000 hours and hot section inspections between 1800 and 2000 hrs.[7]
In US military use, they are designated as T74 or T101. The main variant, the PT6A, is available in a wide variety of models, covering the power range between 580 and 920 shaft horsepower in the original series, and up to 1,940 shp (1,450 kW) in the "large" lines. The PT6B and PT6C are turboshaft variants for helicopters.

Development[edit]
In 1956, PWC's President, Ronald Riley, foreseeing the need for engines with much higher power-to-weight ratio, ordered engineering manager Dick Guthrie to establish a development group to create a turboprop engine designed to replace piston engines. Demand for the Wasp radial engine was still strong and its production line's output was robust and profitable. Riley gave Guthrie a modest budget of C$100,000. Guthrie recruited young engineers from the National Research Council in Ottawa and from Orenda Engines in Ontario. In 1958, the group began development of a turboprop engine intended to deliver 450 shaft horsepower. The first engine was powered up and run successfully in February 1960.[1][8] It first flew on 30 May 1961, mounted on a Beech 18 aircraft at de Havilland Canada's Downsview, Ontario facility. Full-scale production started in 1963, entering service the next year. By the 40th anniversary of its maiden flight in 2001, over 36,000 PT6As had been delivered, not including the other versions.[9] The engine is used in over 100 different applications.
When de Havilland Canada asked for a much larger engine, roughly twice the power of the Large PT6, Pratt & Whitney Canada responded with a new design initially known as the PT7. During development this was renamed to become the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100. Turboprops such as the PT6 and PW100 may have a bypass ratio over 50,[10][11][12] although propeller airflow is slower than for turbofans.[13][14]
Design[edit]




Epicyclic reduction gears on Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 gas turbine engine.


All versions of the engine consist of two sections that can be easily separated for maintenance: a gas generator supplies hot gas to a free power turbine.[15] The starter has to accelerate only the gas generator, making the engine easy to start, particularly in cold weather.[15] Air enters the gas-generator through an inlet screen into the low-pressure axial compressor. This has three stages on small and medium versions of the engine and four stages on large versions. The air then flows into a single-stage centrifugal compressor, through a folded annular combustion chamber, and finally through a single-stage turbine that powers the compressors at about 45,000 rpm. Hot gas from the gas generator flows into the power turbine, which turns at about 30,000 rpm. It has one stage on the small engines and two stages on the medium and large ones. For turboprop use, this powers a two-stage planetary output reduction gearbox, which turns the propeller at a speed of 1,900 to 2,200 rpm. The exhaust gas then escapes through two side-mounted ducts in the power turbine housing. The turbines are mounted inside the combustion chamber, reducing overall length.
In most aircraft installations the PT6 is mounted backwards in the nacelle, so that the intake side of the engine is facing the rear of the aircraft. This places the power section at the front of the nacelle, where it can drive the propeller directly without the need for a long shaft. Intake air is usually fed to the engine via an underside mounted duct, and the two exhaust outlets are directed rearward. This arrangement aids maintenance by allowing the entire power section to be removed along with the propeller, exposing the gas-generator section. To facilitate rough-field operations, foreign objects are diverted from the compressor intake by inertial separators in the inlet.[16]

Operational history[edit]
In-flight shutdown rate was 1 per 127,560 hours in 2005 in Canada,[17] 1 per 333,333 hours up to October 2003, with 31,606 delivered engines flown more than 252 million hours.[18] The PT6 family logged 400 million flight hours from 1963 to 2016 while power-to-weight ratio was improved by 50%, brake specific fuel consumption by 20% and overall pressure ratio reached 14:1.[5]
Its development continues and while today its high-level configuration is the same as in 1964, P&WC updated the PT6 including single-crystal turbine blades in the early 1990s, and FADEC should be introduced. Its pressure ratio is 13:1 in the AgustaWestland AW609 tiltrotor.[19]
In response to the General Electric GE93, in 2017 Pratt & Whitney Canada will launch demonstration tests of engine core technology and systems for a proposed 2,000hp engine to replace the most powerful versions of the PT6.[20] Likely a development of the PT6C core, it would fit between the 1,750 shp PT6C-67C/E and the 2,300 shp PW100 family, and be ready to launch by the end of 2017 for an initial helicopter platform with a 10-15% reduction in brake specific fuel consumption.[21]
While lacking a FADEC, autothrottle can be installed as an aftermarket upgrade with an actuator, initially in single engine aircraft like a PC-12 and possibly in twin turboprop aircraft.[22]
Variants[edit]
Several other versions of the PT6 have appeared over time :

the Large PT6 added an additional power turbine stage and a deeper output reduction, producing almost twice the power output, between 1,090 and 1,920 shp (1,430 kW) ;
the PT6B is a helicopter turboshaft model, featuring an offset reduction gearbox with a freewheeling clutch and power turbine governor, producing 1,000 hp (750 kW) at 4,500 rpm ;
the PT6C is a helicopter model, with a single side-mounted exhaust, producing 2,000 hp (1,500 kW) at 30,000 rpm, which is stepped down in a user-supplied gearbox ;
the PT6T Twin-Pac consists of two PT6 engines driving a common output reduction gearbox, producing almost 2,000 hp (1,500 kW) at 6,000 rpm ;
the ST6 is a version intended for stationary applications, originally developed for the UAC TurboTrain, and now widely used as auxiliary power units on large aircraft, as well as many other roles.[23]

Quote: "When the bypass ratio is increased to 10-20 for very efficient low speed performance, the weight and wetted area of the fan shroud (inlet) become large, and at some point it makes sense to eliminate it altogether. The fan then becomes a propeller and the engine is called a turboprop. Turboprop engines provide efficient power from low speeds up to as high as M=0.8 with bypass ratios of 50-100."

Above 0.6 Mach number the turboprop in turn becomes uncompetitive, due mainly to higher weight and frontal area."
