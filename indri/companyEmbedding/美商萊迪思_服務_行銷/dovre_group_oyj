The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Espoo, Finland, 2015-01-30 08:00 CET (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
	
	Dovre Group Plc                 Press Release                January 30, 2015 at 9:00 am  

CHANGES IN DOVRE GROUP’S ASSOCIATE COMPANIES SARARASA

	Since 2012, Dovre Group has been a minority shareholder in SaraRasa Bioindo Pte. Ltd. ("Bioindo"). Bioindo is a pellet producer using sustainable waste materials. Dovre Group has also been a minority shareholder in SaraRasa Biomass Pte. Ltd ("Biomass"), a project development company based in Singapore.

	The owners of Bioindo and Biomass have agreed to simplify the structure of both companies, to widen the ownership base of Bioindo, and to relocate Bioindo’s existing pellet production line from Selat to Surabaya in Indonesia.

	Once the restructuring is complete:


		all current owners of Bioindo (Dovre Group, Finnfund, Biomass and Stahl Capital) will continue as shareholders of Bioindo

		Navdata Ltd, a Finnish company, will become a new shareholder in Bioindo

		Dovre Group will hold 28.9% of the shares in Bioindo

		Dovre Group will no longer hold shares in Biomass


	Surabaya, the new location of the pellet production line, offers better infrastructure, logistics and feedstock. After relocation, the production capacity will increase to 75 000 t/a, the production costs will decrease and the quality of the end product will improve. Bioindo plans to build a second pellet production line once the production line in Surabaya is in commercial operation.

	Dovre Group’s investment in Bioindo is not part of Dovre Group’s core business.
