LPL Financial offices by tvsdesign, Fort Mill – South Carolina


                            April 28th, 2017 by retail design blog                                            




tvsdesign has designed the offices of independent broker-dealer LPL Financial, located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The new campus for LPL Financial promises to represent a new, progressive model for corporate build to suit projects founded on a strategy of Inside-Out/Outside-In planning. Located on a 16 acre densely wooded site adjoining the new live/work/play village of Fort Mill, South Carolina, the new LPL campus is comprised of three slender 150,000 sf buildings with outboard service and elevator cores. Designed around net-zero energy goals, the core-free 25,000 sf floor plate configuration maximizes workplace natural light and views to the wooded setting for all employees.

Programmed as a campus for nearly 2,500 employees and visitors that promotes a healthy workplace lifestyle, the first phase shares a lakefront environment with the amenities of the Fort Mill new town and is connected to the greater Kingsley nature preserve’s network of jogging, biking and equestrian trails.
