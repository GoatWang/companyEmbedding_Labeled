In the Products and Services section of your business plan, you will clearly describe--yep--the products and services your business will provide.
Keep in mind that highly detailed or technical descriptions are not necessary and definitely not recommended. Use simple terms and avoid industry buzzwords so your readers can easily understand.
On the other hand, describing how the company's products and services will differ from the competition is critical. So is describing why your products and services are needed if no market currently exists. (For example, before there was Federal Express, overnight delivery was a niche business served by small companies. FedEx had to define the opportunity for a new, large-scale service and justify why customers needed--and would actually use--that service.)
Patents, copyrights, and trademarks you own or have applied for should also be listed in this section.
Depending on the nature of your business, your Products and Services section could be very long or relatively short. If your business is product-focused, you will want to spend more time describing those products.
If you plan to sell a commodity item and the key to your success lies in, say, competitive pricing, you probably don't need to provide significant product detail. Or if you plan to sell a commodity readily available in a variety of outlets, the key to your business may not be the commodity itself but your ability to market in a more cost-effective way than your competition.
But if you're creating a new product (or service), make sure you thoroughly explain the nature of the product, its uses, and its value, etc.--otherwise your readers will not have enough information to evaluate your business.
Key questions to answer:
 Are products or services in development or existing (and on the market)? What is the timeline for bringing new products and services to market? What makes your products or services different? Are there competitive advantages compared with offerings from other competitors? Are there competitive disadvantages you will need to overcome? (And if so, how?) Is price an issue? Will your operating costs be low enough to allow a reasonable profit margin? How will you acquire your products? Are you the manufacturer? Do you assemble products using components provided by others? Do you purchase products from suppliers or wholesalers? If your business takes off, is a steady supply of products available?
In the cycling rental business example we've been using, products and services could be a relatively simple section to complete or it could be fairly involved. It depends on the nature of the products the company plans to rent to customers.
If Blue Mountain Cycling Rentals plans to market itself as a provider of high-end bikes, describing those bikes--and the sources for those bikes--is important, since "high-end cycling rentals" is intended to be a market differentiation. If the company plans to be the low-cost provider, then describing specific brands of equipment is probably not necessary.
Also, keep in mind that if a supplier runs out of capacity--or goes out of business altogether--you may not have a sufficient supply to meet your demand. Plan to set up multiple vendor or supplier relationships, and describe those relationships fully. 
Remember, the primary goal of your business plan is to convince you that the business is viable--and to create a road map for you to follow.
The Products and Services section for our cycling rental business could start something like this:
***
Product Description
Blue Mountain Cycle Rentals will provide a comprehensive line of bicycles and cycling equipment for all ages and levels of ability. Since the typical customer seeks medium-quality equipment and excellent services at competitive prices, we will focus on providing brands like Trek bikes, Shimano footwear, and Giro helmets. These manufacturers have a widespread reputation as mid- to high-level quality, unlike equipment typically found in the rental market.
The following is a breakdown of anticipated rental price points, per day and per week:
Bicycle $30 $120
Helmet $6 $30
(Etc.)
Notes:
 Customers can extend the rental term online without visiting the store. A grace period of two hours will be applied to all rentals; customers who return equipment within that two-hour period will not be charged an additional fee.
Competition
Blue Mountain Cycle Rentals will have clear advantages over its primary competitors, the bike shops located in Harrisonburg, Virginia:
 Newer equipment inventory with higher perceived quality Price points 15 percent below the competition Online renewals offering greater convenience A liberal return grace period that will reinforce our reputation as a customer-friendly rental experience
Future Products
Expansion will allow us to move product offerings into new equipment sales. We will also explore maintenance and fitting services, leveraging our existing maintenance staff to provide value-added services at a premium price.
(And so on...)
***
When you draft your Products and Services section, think of your reader as a person who knows little to nothing about your business. Be clear and to the point.
Think of it this way: The Products and Services section answers the "what" question for your business. Make sure you fully understand the "what" factor; you may run the business, but your products and services are its lifeblood.
Now let's take a look at the next major section of your business plan: the Market Opportunities.

I bought a policy from them last year, and then I had to have a letter stating that they wi⋯⋯ll notice one of my additional policy insured before 30 days if the policy was to be cancelled. They gave me the letter. I renewed the policy from them again this year and also paid in full upfront but now they are asking a flat fee of $250 just for the letter. "A letter that states that they will notify the additional policy insured that they will be notified within 30 days if the policy is to be cancelled for any reasons, but I have already paid in full, and now they want a flat $250 fee for the same letter that I got last time without any charges". This is outrageous specially when you do this in a place where you guys have dominant monopoly for taxi insurance. 更多Nash Pillsbury · 2016年9月2日These guys are top-notch.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

                            about the business.

American Business Financial Services, Inc. Noteholders Litigation
Master File No. 05-232
In the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
Honorable Thomas N. O’Neill, Jr.
Heffler Claims Group was engaged as the claims administrator in the ABFS Noteholders Litigation for both the Notification and Claims Administration processes. This Settlement provided a fund of $16.7 million to pay claims of persons who, during the Class Period, bought or rolled over Notes issued by ABFS. ABFS filed for Bankruptcy owing Noteholders the principal and interest on their Notes. The firm assisted in the preparation and arranged for the printing of the Summary Notice and assisted in the preparation and mailing of the Notice and the Claim Form. Notice and Claim Forms were mailed to over 29,000 potential class members and the firm received over 14,500 claims. The firm reviewed each claim filed to ensure the accuracy of the claimed amounts, reviewed supporting documentation and defendants records, and calculated an allowed amount for each claim. A distribution was made to class members totaling over $11.8 million, which represented $365 million in principal and interest on outstanding Notes.
