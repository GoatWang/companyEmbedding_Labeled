		AMID's Chinese Company Report (CCR) provides information on the Chinese large public-traded corporations, large manufacturing producers, large financial companies or large service providers. In the two past decades, the Chinese industry has been growing at a fast pace.   The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China’s society and economy. China is one of the world’s major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world’s fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.  The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector’s economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products. This new study focuses on the company's business overiew, organzation structure, products and services, production locations, recent activities, and financail data

In 2016, fixed asset investment in the railway industry was CNY 801.5 billion. A total of 3,281 km of new lines were put into operation; construction started in 46 projects; investment increased by CNY 550 billion. By the end of 2016, total length of railway in operation was 124,000 km, including 22,000 km high-speed railway. In 2016, national railway undertook 2.65 billion tons of cargo. The freight volume of containers, commodity automobiles and bulks all broke record highs, increasing YOY by 40%, 53% and 25%, respectively. In 2016, the total value of logistics goods was CNY 229.7 trillion, increasing by 6.1% YOY. The growth rate was up by 0.3 percentage point over 2015. The total value of logistics goods kept stable while rising a bit. The total value of industrial logistics goods was CNY 214.0 trillion. Calculating by comparable price, it increased by 6.0% versus 2015 and the growth rate fell by 0.1 percentage points. The total revenue of the logistics industry was CNY 7.9 trillion, increasing by 4.6% over 2015. The total expenses of logistics goods was CNY 11.1 trillion, increasing by 2.9% YOY. The growth rate was up by 0.1 percentage points over 2015 but it was significantly lower than that of the value of logistics goods and GDP. In this report, 34 rail transport and logistics enterprises listed in A-share market in China are analyzed. The report is composed of two parts: the first part is enterprise profiles and the second part is the operation status of these enterprises in the recent decade (presently 2006 to 2016, we will update it to the latest as time goes by). The operation status is demonstrated from the following perspectives: (1)financial indexes, such as earnings per share, book value per share (BPS), sales per share, net cash flow per share, return on net worth and debt to asset ratio; (2) indexes on the income statement, such as revenue, operating profit, net profit and EBIT; (3) indexes on the income statement, such as revenue, operating profit, net profit and EBIT; (4) indexes on the balance sheet, such as liquid asset, fixed asset, current liability, non-current liability, capital reserve and shareholders' equity.
