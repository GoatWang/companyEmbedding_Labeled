History[edit]
Mattersight was founded as the Behavioral Analytics service line within eLoyalty, a call center consulting and technology services firm, by president and CEO Kelly Conway in 2006.[9][10][11] In 2011, TeleTech acquired the Integrated Contact Solutions unit of eLoyalty. The behavioral analytics unit launched as Mattersight Corporation.[12][13] In 2014, Mattersight was recognized by Customer Magazine for Product of the Year Award for the second consecutive year.[14][15] In 2013, the company raised $6 million through selling shares.[16]
Service[edit]
Mattersight provides a software-as-a-service using predictive customer analytics, speech analytics, and behavioral analytics technologies to analyze and improve contact center performance and agent interactions.[17] It uses a data analysis system that listens to the way customers respond on the telephone, analyzing communication patterns, grammar, word choice, tone, volume, pauses, and other communication metrics. Mathematical algorithms then interpret vocal features, compare them to their databases, and arrive at a personality profile for each customer, who is then matched with a service agent with whom the customer is most compatible.[18]

Predictive Analytics
Harness your untamed call center data to predict the perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of your customers






 Customers buy from companies because of their products, but often leave them because of their service. Mattersight® Predictive Analytics gives clients the peace of mind that service gaps, unhappy customers, and even upsell opportunities are automatically identified across every single conversation.
Our solution combines existing call center data with new interaction insights to assign a predictive score to each call. By capturing, analyzing, and decoding every second of the customer-agent conversation, Mattersight can automatically predict CSAT, NPS, customer effort, and churn.
By applying Mattersight Predictive Analytics to the call center, our customers have been able to:

Drastically reduce the need for (often inaccurate) customer surveys
Design proactive response strategies for at-risk customers
Improve business processes that create the most customer friction
Decrease customer attrition by as much as 33%

It's an IT company, so you're going to have some encroachment on your life, but on the whole it's truly excellent work/life balance. I can't imagine a more supportive employer.You're encouraged to pursue your work interests, even if they lead you to other teams. If you've got great ideas and effort, you can make a real impact no matter what level you're at or what team you work on.Great people to work with across the board.For being a small company, employment and org structure has been quite stable. Seems like my friends at big companies have way more layoffs and general instability than we do.Cool and unique proprietary technology. Lots of things to keep a scientific, technology, or data driven mind interested.Top level management very accessible and supportive. They're involved and in touch with the technical operating details of our business.ConsWaiting anxiously for our business to take off! I'm a bit jealous of IT companies that scale up big time.

Afiniti's partnership with and equity investment by McKinsey, combined with a highly successful practice of hiring top executives from prospects preceded Afiniti's announced IPO (purportedly valued at some $1.6 billion according to a VentureBeat article).Mattersight financials are public. Study them in comparison.Do you love commissions tied to black-box gainshare metrics? Do you feel most at-home near revolving doors where the great folks all escaped a micro-managing, temper tantrum throwing leader? Do you want each new customer you sign to be ripped away from you? Are you excited when few or zero colleagues exceed quota? Are you tired of having to fly away to Presidents Club in Maui, Spain etc...?Advice to ManagementNetwork heavily just in case.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Mattersight Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Mattersight 2017-07-29 11:50 PDT Join the Mattersight team See Our Latest Jobs Jun 27, 2017"Avoid"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Client Lead in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Client Lead in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Mattersight full-time (More than 3 years)ProsLow-level and middle-management employees are bright, well-meaning, etc.ConsCompensation (both structure and amount) are laughable.

Employees can start programs they are interested in such as a new Data Collaborative, Toastmasters and a book club. Big name clients. I've learned a lot about topics I'm interested in and been introduced to topics that I didn't yet know I was interested in.ConsThere is a very fast pace and you have to be willing to work hard.

The people I work with on a daily basis are friendly, smart, and hardworking which makes the cons almost bearable.ConsThe company leans on smart, recent college grads to make-up for a product that doesn't really work and has constant fire-drills. This company has been in business for 14+ years but still thinks of itself as a start-up. In reality it is a poorly managed organization that attempts to disguise this from the younger employees with free snacks, beer on tap, and a pingpong table. Do not be deceived. Your work will never be good enough despite many and varied attempts to go beyond what is asked of you and you will not receive adequate training or feedback to grow professionally. You're basically a blind rat that needs to run on the wheel faster and faster without any insight as to why this keeps happening.Advice to ManagementInvest in and communicate with your employees. Take an honest assessment of why the entire Marketing Department, many people from Service Delivery and Customer Success teams, and the smartest portion of Finance has left the company in the last 3-6 months. That should give a starting point to improving company culture and financial performance.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (10) Mattersight Response May 14, 2017 – Chief People Officer Hi - I completely agree with you that we have great people and we hate losing them! Unfortunately, we are a growing company in a competitive marketplace so we do lose some talented employees. Onthe upside, we have been able to attract and hire some very smart, talented individuals at the same time. To put in perspective, our 2016 voluntary turnover was 8.7% which is considered low by industry standards. From your other comments, we are clearly not getting it done in terms of communicating with you or supporting you in the ways you need. I would welcome a conversation if you're open to having one on how we can improve on this.

Also, the office is really nice and always stocked with great snacks.ConsMattersight is more or less a consulting company that tries to sell itself as a software company. The average tenure of the exec team is 15 years, so there isn't much tolerance for outside ideas. The problem is that, while the idea behind the company is really cool, there isn't a real product offering to support it. Most of the client deliverables are manually created powerpoint presentations. And they have never once turned a profit in the 68 quarters of their existence.Advice to ManagementThe exec team is staffed by old, white men. They should hire some leaders outside of that profile to grow their worldview.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Mattersight Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Mattersight 2017-04-02 09:41 PDT Apr 2, 2017 Helpful (4)"Professional"StarStarStarStarStarCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Mattersight full-time (More than a year)ProsI can't think of any pros.ConsToxic & untrustworthy culture.
