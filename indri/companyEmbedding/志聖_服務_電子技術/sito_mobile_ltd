SITO Privacy Policy
SITO, Inc. ("SITO") is a mobile advertising technology company. SITO provides this privacy policy to inform you how our proprietary technology processes information for individuals in the U.S. obtained via digital advertisers, website owners, App owners, and other businesses. This policy also outlines SITO's privacy practices on our corporate website, http://www.sitomobile.com.
SITO's Technology Privacy Practices
As explained below SITO's technology collects information about the location of mobile devices over time, and processes it to determine geographic-location segments that will be used to help make the digital advertisements consumers' see more relevant.
How do we collect information via our technology?
We do not collect information directly from individuals. We collect information from our partners, which are usually mobile advertising networks, mobile websites, supply side platforms and mobile apps. These partners deliver advertising onto your mobile device. In addition, we may collect some information directly from our advertisers or from third parties if required and provided by our advertisers.
What types of information do we collect via our technology?
Through our partners we may collect various types of information. For example, from the ad requests your device makes, we may obtain the latitude and longitude (i.e., lat/long) coordinates from one of our mobile app partners. In addition, we may obtain your device type, the identifiers associated with your mobile device, your mobile browser type, operating system, and IP address. We may collect this information over time and across websites, mobile apps, and devices. If requested by our partners, we may combine the information from the geographic-location segments with information obtained directly from customers or with information obtained from third parties on our customers' behalf. We may also supplement the information we collect via our technology with audience information from third parties, and we may use personally identifiable information ("PII") from third parties such as address and last name to match the data sets, but we do not use any PII directly for ad delivery and targeting purposes, and we do not merge the PII with our Geo-location segments or store this PII in our DMP or DSP.
What is Precise Location Data ("PLD")?
We use collected information to target and display advertisements that may be of interest to you. We may provide the collected information to our third party partners and agents to improve targeting, make and create offers, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, and to improve our systems and products.
Choice Mechanisms
If you do not want the information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads while you access the third-party applications of our mobile partners, we offer a number of choice mechanisms. Please note that none of our choice mechanisms will opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. Your opt-out choice will be applied only to the browser or device that has opted out.
In Ad opt-out - You may opt-out by selecting the Ad Choices icon within an advertisement targeted by SITO and following the instructions listed within the opt-out page.
Mobile Device Settings - If you'd like to adjust your setting regarding the use of precise location data by third parties such as SITO, you may do so via your device settings. SITO honors the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or " opt-out of interest based ads" (Android).
Submit your Device ID – Alternatively, you may send an email to opt-out@sitomobile.com including the IDFA or Advertiser ID of your device. Please allow up to seven days for your request to take effect. For devices where we see such a request has been made SITO will not longer use device information for the purposes of serving behavioral advertising.
Please note that these choice mechanisms won't impact previously collected precise location information that has been de-identified. Also, by turning off location-based services, you will lose all the benefits of those location-based services on your phone.



Why do we use the information?
We store and use information to develop geographic-location segments to help make the digital ads more relevant, and for ad delivery, analytics, and reporting purposes. We may also use the information to enhance our advertising and analytics capabilities, and to offer analytics and data enhancement services to our customers for their marketing and advertising purposes.
How do we safeguard your privacy?
We do not collect any PII via our technology that allows us to identify an individual directly such as email address or telephone number. In addition, our technology uses de-identification techniques such as pseudonymous identifiers associated with your mobile device to help safeguard your privacy. If we combine information collected via our technology with information we receive from third parties, we do not use any PII, such as address or last name, directly for ad delivery and targeting purposes, although it may be obtained by us in connection with such uses. We store any PII we receive from third parties separately from our Geo-location segment information.
Website Privacy Practices
Our website is primarily designed to provide information to our clients, which are typically businesses. SITO collects information from our website, www.sitomobile.com, when you choose to provide it to us, including but not limited to: name, address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send information about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on our website. We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry.
We may also collect information from visitors to this website, including your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer's operating system. We use this information to analyze traffic on our site and to improve our services.
Controlling the Use of Your Information
If you wish to not have your location information collected, you can turn off this capability in the settings of your mobile device. If you wish to not receive tailored advertising based on our services, you can opt-out by adjusting your advertising ID settings on your mobile device. We encourage you to read the help section of your mobile operating system to learn how to turn off the collection of location information or to opt-out from tailored advertising. You can also opt-out of our tailored advertising services by clicking the AdChoices icon in or next to the ads in which it appears or using your mobile device to go to our AdChoices mobile opt-out page. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. You can also turn off location settings on your device at any time to disable our collection and use of the location data obtained from your device. You will continue to receive generic ads and may receive tailored ads from other companies.
SITO adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and the Application of Self-Regulatory Principles to the Mobile Environment published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We honor the DAA's opt out mechanism for data collection and use in connection with mobile applications. To learn more about the DAA and your choices, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.
Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We do not rent, sell, or share PII obtained via our technology or our website with non-affiliated third parties without user consent. We may, however, share PII obtained from other sources with trusted third-party partners. These third party partners are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services as contracted for by and with SITO.
We may license information collected from our technology or derived therefrom, including geographic-segment information and information about the types of locations consumers visit over time, in order to provide our services. When providing our services to our customers, we do not provide any PII or precise Geo-location data to them.
We may disclose information about you to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a potential or actual successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of the information we have collected about you, as well as any choices you may have regarding your PII.
Information Security and Data Retention
The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented security measures to help protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of storage is 100% secure; therefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it does not guarantee absolute security.
Information Relating to Children
This Website and our products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to promptly remove that information from our records.
Data Transfers
Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided that information. When we transfer information we collect about you to other countries, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.  You consent to the transfer of personal information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy is subject to change. We will post any privacy policy change on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.  We will also update the effective date of the policy.

SITO Mobile, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SITO) Appoints CEO, Solidifies Top Management

Posted on July 21, 2017 by MissionIR 

After a recent shakeup, New Jersey-based SITO Mobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: SITO) has appointed a new CEO, COO, chairman of the board and board members to its management team, and it is back on track doing what the company does best, helping advertisers attract customers using mobile platforms.
SITO offers services in location-based advertising, a booming advertising sector that is growing faster than any other ad channel. The company’s technology allows advertisers to optimize their campaigns, better understand their audiences and increase ROI by utilizing always-on location, audience and behavior sciences (LABS) reporting. SITO Mobile offers real-time verified data to track ad campaign performance aimed at driving foot traffic to brick and mortar stores.
SITO announced in early June the election of Brent Rosenthal as chairman of the company’s board of directors. SITO Mobile is a technology-based mobile solutions provider increasing brand awareness, loyalty and sales through its mobile engagement platform.
Brent Rosenthal is the founder of Mountain Hawk Capital Partners, LLC, an investment fund focused on small and micro-cap equities in the technology media telecom (TMT) and food industries. Rosenthal also serves on the boards of directors of comScore (NASDAQ: SCOR) and RiceBran Technologies (NASDAQ: RIBT) and is an adviser to the board of directors of Park City Group (NASDAQ: PCYG).
“I am honored to be in the position of serving as chairman of the board of the company, and will work tirelessly with my colleagues on the Board to continue to build value for all of the Company’s stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees and customers,” Rosenthal said in a statement to Globe Newswire (http://dtn.fm/JG4wo).
Rosenthal joins new board of directors members Michael Durden, Itzhak Fisher, Thomas J. Pallack, Matthew Stecker and Thomas Thekkethala. On June 30, the company announced that Thomas J. Pallack and Mark Del Priore had been appointed as the company’s CEO and CFO, respectively. William Seagrave was named SITO Mobile’s COO.
“Tom, Bill and Mark are proven leaders with a broad range of experiences that are uniquely suited to the future of SITO’s business,” said Rosenthal. “We are thrilled to be working closely with them for the next phase of the company’s growth.”
Pallack has more than 30 years’ experience in sales, operations, finance and business development with global tech companies such as Oracle and Ariba. He co-founded SBV solutions, a software sales company, and has served as CEO and head of sales since 2005.
Seagrave previously directed sales, product and market strategies for global tech companies including Cisco, Oracle, Intel, and Baxter. He has extensive experience.
“The people and product offerings at SITO provide a strong foundation for growth and expansion,” Seagrave said in a press statement for Globe Newswire. “The business is well-positioned for its next stage of development in the technology landscape.”

SITO: An Investment In Location-Targeted Mobile Advertising - SITO Mobile, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SITO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»SITO: An Investment In Location-Targeted Mobile AdvertisingFeb.22.17 | About: SITO Mobile, (SITO) GrowthHunter Long/short equity, tech, oil & gas, commoditiesSummarySITO Mobile has had a rough couple months - down 63% since October and as much as 11% on Monday.Despite 2016 challenges, company is well positioned in growing Location-Targeted Mobile Advertising Market.Valuation is compelling given future growth prospects and TubeMogul comparison.Overview SITO Mobile, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SITO) operates a mobile location-based advertising platform serving businesses, advertisers and brands. The Company's main offering is SITO Location-Based Advertising, which uses geo-fencing technology and big data to deliver high-value display and video ads to likely buyers within a certain radius of advertiser's locations. Over the past few months, the company has had its fair share of headwinds. After posting lower-than-expected 3Q16 results due to a seasonally weak advertising period, the company pre-released disappointing 4Q2016 revenue figures in January despite management previously guiding towards a seasonally strong fourth quarter given the holiday season. To compound these issues, the market reacted negatively to the news that the CEO resigned last Friday, sending the stock ~8% lower as of midday Monday to $2.10/share, ~63% below the October high of $5.60. Given the recent performance under the former CEO, I have believed a new CEO would be necessary and at these levels the stock is attractive. 

 Source: StockCharts.com Strong Product in Growing Market Fortunately for shareholders, the company has a differentiated product in an advertising market niche that is projected to grow significantly for the foreseeable future. As seen in the table below, total US Location-Targeted Mobile Ad Spending is expected to grow from $11.3B in 2016 to $26.7B in 2020. As a percentage of total US Mobile Ad Spending, Location-Targeted spending is expected to increase from ~38% to ~43%, reflecting its increased importance as part of the overall US Mobile Advertising mix.
 

 Source: eMarketer As one of the early movers, SITO Mobile is using its demand-side and data management platforms to build a increasingly large presence in the location-based mobile advertising space. The company's in-house platforms reportedly collects and analyzes over 5 trillion data points/month (device ID, location data, time information etc.), then uses that data to connect advertisers to publishers and automatically bids on in-app advertisements on consumers' mobile phones based on their specific profiles and location. The company calls this "following the digital breadcrumbs" to target the right audience and deliver ads to the right people, at the right time. 

 Source: Company Presentation SITO's platform, proprietary data and analytical tools allow companies target only those consumers most likely to be interested in their product or service, at the time and place when they are most likely to buy. As a result of the company's unique customer-targeting data and analytical platform, SITO boasts relatively strong Click-Through Rates ("CTR") in key industry verticals versus industry averages. 


 Source: Company Presentation Although many companies have attempted to provide location-targeted mobile advertising tools, according to eMarketer, many marketing professionals have historically cited their inability to measure success as the reason they have held back spending in the space. 

 Source: Statista When it comes to measuring the success of their location-targeted campaigns, this is where SITO sets itself apart. SITO's Verified Walk-In product lets marketers see not only if customers clicked on the ad sent to their mobile device, but more importantly if they then went to the store and made a purchase. This ability, allows SITO customers to optimize their platform in real-time. 

 Source: Company Presentation When combined with the precise audience-targeting capabilities of the SITO Platform, the VWI component is attracting increased attention from agencies and brands and should continue to give SITO a competitive advantage in the industry. Valuation After the 63% share price decline over the last few months, shares of SITO are trading at 1.14x TTM Revenue, down from ~3.25x during September 2016. 


 Source: YCharts.com Given the growth outlook for the location-based mobile advertising industry as a whole and the quality of SITO's offering, there are high expectations for the company's revenue growth over the next few years. 

 Source: simplywall.st Based on consensus estimates, it is expected that the company will generate $54M of revenue and $11.15M of EBITDA in 2018. Although I believe this is conservative given the level of location-targeted mobile advertising expected in the United States alone, even at these conservative levels the stock is cheap. Based on a P/S (2018E) multiple of 3.5x, the company should trade for $9/share. Second, based on the recent industry acquisition of TubeMogul by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which was priced at 15x EV/EBITDA (2018E), SITO should be trading close to $8/share. 

 Source: Internal Model Given the recent departure of the CEO, which I believe could be a turning point for the company and the low bar set by 3Q2016 and 4Q2016 performance, I see shares in the company rebounding over the next few months at any sign of sales momentum or an announcement of an industry veteran CEO taking the helm. Downside Risks As with any technology company, SITO is vulnerable to another company developing a new technology that more effectively attacks the mobile advertising market. Second, should SITO be unable to regain sales momentum the company may need to issue equity to pay down debt, resulting in dilution for existing shareholders.
 Finally, if larger players in the mobile advertising arena (Google, Facebook etc.) decide to compete in the location-targeted industry, it would force me to reevaluate my opinion of SITO's growth prospects. Summary Following a 63% decline in its share price since September, an investment in SITO Mobile seems to represent an attractive risk/reward opportunity. The company is well-positioned in the growing location-targeted mobile advertising industry, with data on millions of mobile users and a superior product that enables advertisers to more efficiently target their advertisements and track campaign performance. Given the growth prospects for the company and its relatively low valuation, I believe if SITO can reignite its revenue growth after two disappointing quarters, shares could significantly appreciate to ~$8/share over the next 12 months.
