Debian 9 and MySQL: Watch Out!

MySQL and Debian 9 “Stretch”
Debian 9 (“Stretch”) was released on June 17, and we congratulate the Debian community on another iteration of a central Linux distro.
Now, the Debian release team some time ago decided not to ship MySQL as part of the distro, instead replacing it with one of the downstream forks. The MySQL team is absolutely committed to making sure that the vast MySQL user base can continue to use Debian as a platform, and we are directing a lot of attention to making sure that MySQL works well on Debian and that our Debian packages and online repos provide everything a Debian user expects. In short: MySQL as a product is advancing rapidly, and so will the experience of using MySQL on Debian.
A somewhat unexpected, late change in Debian 9 may cause those MySQL users who upgrade directly from Debian 8 to 9 to have their MySQL installation yanked out and replaced with something else. So beware: if you want to stay on MySQL and not run the risk of things changing under your feet, you may need to take a few extra steps before you upgrade.
Below, we’ll give advice on the most common scenario, where you have MySQL installed on Debian 8 and you want to go to Debian 9 and continue to run MySQL.
Upgrading to Debian 9 and keeping MySQL
First and foremost: if you installed MySQL from the official MySQL repos at repo.mysql.com you are fine. No need to worry, since your MySQL installation will be untouched by the Debian upgrade.
On the other hand, if you installed MySQL from Debian’s own package repos and then go ahead and upgrade to Debian 9, Debian will simply yank out MySQL and forcibly replace it with a different database system, with no advance warning. To stay with MySQL, you should switch from the Debian 8 native MySQL (5.5) packages to packages from the official MySQL repos (5.6 or newer). In general, this is advisable for several reasons, among them the fact that all GA and pre-release versions of MySQL, together with a wide range of MySQL clients, tooling and utilities, are all readily available and completely up-to-date in the official repos.
Now, proceed as follows:

Enable the official MySQL package repos as described at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/. We recommend choosing the upgrade to MySQL 5.7, which is at the time of writing the latest GA of MySQL and which contains a huge range of new features and optimizations compared with the Debian native 5.5; with 5.6 also being a good but somewhat less recent alternative.
Switch to the official MySQL packages by running apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade.
Go on to upgrade to Debian 9 by replacing all “jessie” entries with “stretch” in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list, then…
Run apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade

The end result should be a Debian 9 system which will have your MySQL installation intact.
Other scenarios
As we mentioned above, if you have MySQL (from the native Debian 8 repos) on your Debian 8 system and just upgrade directly to Debian 9, you get forcibly migrated off MySQL. Even though the replacement claims full compatibility with MySQL, there are no guarantees. This in turn means that if you want to move back to MySQL afterwards, there are also no guarantees, the reason being that MariaDB may have introduced settings or structures that are incompatible with MySQL. So while a move back to MySQL will in most cases work, be aware that there are risks involved.
Another type of scenario would be that you:

do not have MySQL installed on Debian 8 and want to upgrade to Debian 9 and run MySQL, or…
you want a clean install of Debian 9 and then want to run MySQL on it

In both those cases, you should first install or upgrade to Debian 9, then carry out step 1 above (enable the official MySQL repos), then do apt-get update, and finally apt-get install mysql-server.
As you can see from this posting, Debian made some late and surprising changes in the Stretch end game. Of course, Debian’s decisions are theirs to make, we just hope that the advice we’ve given here will save users from getting seriously confused and possibly get caught out by having their MySQL install yanked out from under their feet. Many of the gotchas here are unfortunately beyond our control, but do let us know in the comments section below if there appears to be stuff we could do to further reduce risks for MySQL users going to Debian 9.

 Michael Quartermaine(Current CEO)(Also see Current personnel)



ELQ International, or Edward Louis Quartermaine International, (formerly ELQ Industries and ELQ Enterprises) is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Port Charles. Owned by the wealthy Quartermaines, it is one of the largest businesses in the region.
It is a rival company with nearby Chandler Enterprises and Buchanan Enterprises.


History

    Edward in his office at ELQ. (1986)  
In 1978, Edward Quartermaine arrived in Port Charles having followed his son, Alan, and brought his family company ELQ. In 1980, Laura Baldwin received a job as a secretary for Edward at ELQ. Edward also enlists Luke Spencer to assist him and his niece Alexandria, in searching for the Ice Princess, the world's largest uncut diamond. It was working for Edward at ELQ, where Luke and Laura, finally realized their feelings and couldn't live without each other. 
In 1984, Edward discovers what it is like to be broke when his daughter-in-law Monica and her new flame, Sean Donely, organize a hostile takeover. Sean leaked word of a merger between Donely Enterprises and the Cassadines. Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt decided to sell the family stock and invest it all. Monica had second thoughts and tried to warn the family that the merger was a fake but they didn't listen and the Quartermaines lost everything. However Edward's wife, Lila Quartermaine, manages to make their fortune back with a new business called Pickle-Lila. Monica's husband Alan later faked his death to get back at Sean and his wife. Sean being faced with a murder charge, finally returned the Quartermaines' money. 
When Edward was presumed dead in 1988, he left all his assets to his grandson Ned Ashton. Alan, tried to keep Ned and his sister Tracy from getting their greedy hands on ELQ. He appealed to the board members to vote his way and Ned did the same thing. To be fair, Ned offered Alan a test: Each one of them would invest $2 million, and the one who got the bigger return would get ELQ. The tug of war continued, with Alan and Tracy taking turns running the company, resigning, letting the other one take over, and resigning again. Alan finally turned the reins over to Tracy once and for all in order to stop his then wife Lucy Coe from constantly nagging him about ELQ. Ned was then named the new CEO.
In 1990, Tracy's former beau David McAlister, wound up murdered with Tracy as the prime suspect. She asked Scott Baldwin to defend her which he only agreed to do, after he was granted the position as General Counsel at ELQ.
In 1991, ELQ was taking losses that concerned the Quartermaines but Ned assured them that a ship called the “SS Tracy” was docking with machinery that would revitalize their cannery and rebuild the Quartermaine money. However an environmental group called the Greenbelts was rallying to protest the arrival of the ship which they claimed was carrying unsafe chemicals. The ship exploded in route to dock and Ned was furious as he suspected the ship was sabotaged. Following this, Alan and Monica realized neither Ned nor Tracy could run the family business and hired Paul Hornsby to save ELQ. However Paul was part of a drug cartel that simply wanted Tracy's stock shares. A few months later when Edward was revealed to be alive, he and Ned are successful at getting ELQ back after blackmailing Paul into handing over his shares of ELQ.
In 1996, Sonny Corinthos invests in ELQ; Jasper Jacks also gets a spot on the ELQ board. Neither of these makes Edward happy, especially when Jax teams up with Tracy to take over ELQ. Ned's wife Lois was especially angry when Ned resumed his post as CEO of ELQ to help fend off Tracy and Jax.

    Founder and former CEO, Edward Louis Quartermaine  
In 1998, Edward promises his grandson A.J. the CEO position at ELQ if he can bring A.J.'s son Michael home to the Quartermaines. If A.J. succeeds, Ned will be out of a job. Edward is forced to eat his words when A.J. is able to bring Michael into the Quartermaine fold by marrying Michael's mother, Carly. A.J. threatens to leave with his new family if Edward doesn't fork over the CEO position. So, A.J. is appointed CEO, and Ned leaves, telling Edward that he will not come in and save the family again, especially when the whole thing blows up in his face.



In 2000, Edward kicks A.J. out of the CEO position when he learns that A.J. has burned down Sonny's warehouse, and for losing Michael. With ELQ without a CEO (Ned will not come back), Edward makes an odd move in courting corporate raider Jasper Jacks. Edward hopes that Ned will swoop in to save the company like he had done previously when Jax tried to buy out ELQ, but Ned remains true to his promise of not returning. Edward has a stroke of luck when Jax forgets about ELQ to go after a drug company to obtain medication for Lila's distant cousin Chloe Morgan from Helena Cassadine. Jax sells his shares of ELQ, which had come from A.J. and Tracy, to Edward. Edward then takes over as CEO of ELQ.
In 2001, Edward is outraged when he is voted out of the CEO position in favor of his granddaughter Skye Chandler-Quartermaine. Later that year when Jax sells controlling interest of ELQ to Lila, Edward hopes she'll make him CEO again. But, Lila tells him that he will be co-CEO with Skye. Edward has no choice but to accept Lila's decision.
When Edward fakes a stroke in 2002, Lila, uncertain of Edward's chances of a recovery, appoints Ned CEO of ELQ. Ned intends to use ELQ to go after mobster Sonny Corinthos, much to Edward's dismay.

In 2003, A.J. once again gets his chance to run ELQ when he becomes CEO after Ned is falsely accused of rape. However, A.J. later empties the Quartermaines' bank accounts and leaves town with Lydia Karenin, leaving Edward to step in as CEO once again. Skye is later booted off the ELQ board by Edward after learning that she is in fact not a Quartermaine.
When the ELQ-owned Port Charles Hotel burns down thanks to faulty wiring, Edward wants to take responsibility for the fire, but Tracy convinces him that it will be best for ELQ if he remaines quiet. While Edward recoveres from a heart attack that nearly killed him, Edward's grandson Justus Ward convinces Edward that he should act senile to avoid responsibility for the fire. Tracy takes advantage of the situation and goes after ELQ. Eventually, an arson report relieves the family of responsibility for the fire, and a battle for control over ELQ breaks out between Tracy and Edward with Tracy's son Dillon holding the deciding vote. Dillon is forced to side with his mother, and Tracy is named CEO.
In 2005, Tracy's husband Luke agrees to help Tracy maintain her position as CEO of ELQ for three months, which will be long enough to solidify the position. When it is time to vote for the new CEO of ELQ, Luke doesn't support his wife, and she loses out to mobster Lorenzo Alcazar.
In 2006, ELQ faces several lawsuits, after producing faulty condoms which cause the pregnancies of Elizabeth Webber by Edward's grandson Jason Morgan and Luke's daughter Lulu Spencer by Dillon.

    Edward with former CEO Tracy Quartermaine at ELQ. (2012)  
In 2011, Edward pitches the idea of having Michael intern at ELQ. Jason tells him that Michael already has a job working for Sonny, but it is up to Michael to make the decision. Not giving up, Edward offers Michael's girlfriend Abby Haver a well-paying job at ELQ, under the provision that she gets Michael to work there alongside her. Edward is delighted when Michael accepts his offer, much to Sonny and Carly's dismay. Abby enjoys her work at ELQ, but Michael does not feel the same way and quits shortly after.
Later, Tracy reaches out to Edward when mobster Anthony Zacchara threatens to inform the authorities and the Soleito family that she had secretly funneled her ex-husband Gino Soleito's money into ELQ years before.


In 2012, Edward dies and wills 60% of his stock to his living grandchildren (currently 10% each to A.J. Quartermaine, Skye Chandler-Quartermaine, Dillon Quartermaine, Ned Ashton, Jason Morgan [even though he was missing and presumed dead at the time]); 30% to his living great-grandchildren (currently 5% each to Michael Quartermaine, Lila Rae Alcazar, Brook Lynn Ashton, Maya Ward [her mother Faith was never mentioned as to whether she inherited or is deceased], Danny Morgan and Kiki Jerome [although she's not biologically a Quartermaine, she is thought to be]); and 5% each to Edward's daughter-in-law Monica Quartermaine and the long-time Quartermaine maid Alice Gunderson. Edward's daughter Tracy Quartermaine does not inherit any stock, only the last jar of her mother Lila's Pickle-Lila relish, and Tracy mentions that Edward's son Jimmy Lee Holt had been written out of their father's will years before.
A.J. wants to be CEO of the company. He has voting support from Michael, Skye, Lila Rae and Monica. Tracy has voting support from Dillon, Ned, Brook Lynn, Maya and Alice. Both sides are tied at 41%, initially making Sam Morgan the deciding factor. She has controlling interest in Jason's and Danny's shares. She decides to split her shares to make both sides at 50%. To break the tie, secondary common shareholders (initially non-voting) have the deciding vote. It turns out that Lucy Coe, former daughter-in-law of Edward, has 1% that Edward didn't get back before he passed away. After Tracy agrees to the terms to underwrite The Nurses' Ball, lets Lucy move in to the Quartermaine Mansion and makes Lucy co-CEO of ELQ with her, Lucy gives her support to Tracy. (1-10-13)
Soon after becoming co-CEO, Lucy has a psychotic break and is confined to Ferncliff Asylum after attacking police detective John McBain believing that he is vampire Caleb Morley. A.J. and Michael then obtain proof that Tracy had funneled mob money from her deceased husband Gino Soleito through ELQ, and blackmail her into resigning and naming A.J. CEO. (1-28-13)

    Tracy with former CEO A.J. Quartermaine at ELQ. (2013)  
The government seizes the assets of ELQ, and this prompts AJ and Tracy to fight for control. Tracy then remembers that she inherited her mother's Pickle-Lila relish, which gives her the idea to save the company by marketing the relish for sale again. Meanwhile, A.J., Michael and the newly-hired Duke Lavery have the same idea, and both sides scramble to find the recipe to the relish before the other. A.J. has GH lab tech Ellie Trout identify the ingredients for the recipe, and Tracy steals the recipe. She gives orders to mass produce the relish so that she can revitalize the company and vote A.J. out as the CEO with the assistance of the mystery Quartermaine heir.


While talking to his ex-wife Carly Jacks, A.J. suspects that she possibly knows about another Quartermaine heir due to her reaction when he mentions that they know all the heirs. Carly, however, won't give him any information. A.J.'s cousin Ned was listening in, and tells his mother Tracy about this.
Tracy then asks her ex-husband Luke Spencer to ask his niece Carly for information about the heir, but she only knows that the previously-unknown grandson of Edward, Robert Frank, had mentioned to her years before that he had a daughter named Lauren. Tracy then hires private investigator Damian Spinelli to find Lauren Frank for her.  Tracy is forced to sign over ELQ to AJ for enbezzling mob money into ELQ. However, Damian Spinelli defects to AJ's side when he decides to not betray his girlfriend, Ellie Trout, a second time.  Tracy hires Luke to track down Lauren Jerome (Franco's percieved daughter) and AJ has Spinelli track her down as well.  Luke gets to Franco's illegally adopted mother's place first and she decides to side with Tracy.  She gives Spinelli an address to a woman that woman's father had a debt to repay Luke.  Spinelli talks to the woman and wastes time there, while Luke is talking to Ava Jerome (Lauren's mother).  Luke reveals to Spinelli that it was indeed him that sent Spinelli on the wrong path and he assumes that Luke found Lauren.  AJ and Tracy go on The Chew to have a battle of the condiments.  The food experts on The Chew, various personnel, and even AJ's girlfriend Elizabeth get food poisoning, thanks to Robert "Franco" Frank who was responsible.
With Franco now revealed to be alive and the reveal of Kiki Jerome is Franco's daughter, the grandchildren now each have 10% of stock and 5% goes to each of the great-grandchildren. Tracy decides to try to go through with the takeover and summons a shareholder's meeting due to her majority of shareholders (with her original 42.5%, and Ava Jerome's proxy of 10%).  Diane Miller presides over the shareholders meeting and helps with the online voting for shareholders not present (like Ned, Dillon, Maya, etc).  It was thought that Tracy would win with Franco's shares with Ava voting giving Tracy 52.5% and Kiki Jerome aligning with AJ due to the fact her mother and her "aunt" called a corporate meeting. The vote is taken and it's revealed that AJ Quartermaine as of now retains his position as CEO with the 52.5%/47.5% (with a 5% shareholder flipping over to AJ's side). Alice Gunderson, a 5% shareholder, flipped over to AJ's side.  AJ makes Alice a "honorary Vice President and head of security" then kicks Ava and Tracy out of his boardroom.  

     
Connie Falconeri then overhears Sonny and Morgan Corinthos talking to each other about Kiki not being Franco's biological daughter. Connie, trying to save her paper The Press from going under, wants to break the story, so she goes to her friend Tracy for help in getting proof. Tracy lets Connie into Ava and Franco's bedroom, where Connie finds Kiki's birth certificate, which lists Silas Clay as the father. Connie prints the story Kiki not a Q on the front page of the paper the next morning, letting the whole town know that the ELQ vote was invalid since Kiki didn't have the right to vote since she is not a Quartermaine and therefore not included in Edward's will.
Without Kiki being a stockholder, Edward's living great-grandchildren are back to having 6% each, instead of 5%. The new percentages add up to a 50-50 tie between A.J. and Tracy. Tracy then goes to Lucy to secure her 1% of the non-voting stock, which she needs to be the tie breaker. Lucy gives Tracy her 1% and breaks the tie.


Tracy once again became CEO and A.J. went back to drinking soon becoming a prime suspect in Connie Falconeri's murder. After A.J. was murdered by Sonny Corinthos, Fluke started taking an interest in ELQ wanting to use it to fund his drug operation. When Fluke wanted to marry Tracy to gain control of ELQ, Ned Ashton became suspicious because of Luke's pass misdeeds. Ned gained even more suspicion when he and Michael discovered Fluke was making passes at Kiki Jerome. Fluke succeeded in marrying Tracy forcing Ned and Michael to quickly convince the other stock holders to remove Tracy as CEO. Not wanting the position to leave the family Michael stepped in and Tracy vowed revenge. While acting as CEO, Michael hired his brother Morgan Corinthos to oversee ELQ's waterfront restoration project. According to Michael, ELQ had been working with the community to revitalize the area, building new high rises and restoring homes such as the Brownstone.
Nikolas stole ELQ stock and became the CEO.
In 2016, Jason became the majority share holder (controlled 50.5%) after blackmailing Nikolas. He then decided to give Michael back the company and then he gave the rest of the shares back to the original owners as Edwards will stated.
