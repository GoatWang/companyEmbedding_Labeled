History[edit]
Altair was established in 1985. In 1990, HyperMesh was released. In 1994, Altair receives IndustryWeek's "Technology of the Year" award for OptiStruct.[5]
During the 2008 economy crisis, Altair started a program to offer free training on its product for unemployed persons in Michigan.[6]
In September 2010, Altair purchased a 136,000-square-foot (12,600 m2) Annex Facility in Troy, to initially house Altair’s subsidiary ilumisys, Inc.
In September 2011, Altair ProductDesign unveiled BUSolution, a hybrid hydraulic bus.[7][8][9]
Corporate acquisitions[edit]

In July 2008, Altair acquired the Italian company that produces the "solidThinking" software.[10]
On October 28, 2010, Altair announced their impending acquisition of SimLab Corporation. [11]
In early 2011, Altair acquired ACUSIM Software, with their CFD Solver, AcuSolve.[12]
In June 2014, Altair acquired EM Software & Systems – S.A. (Pty) Ltd and its international distributor offices in the United States, Germany, and China, with their electromagnetic simulation software, FEKO.[13][14][15]
In July 2014 Altair acquired Visual Solutions, Inc in order to enter the embedded market which was previously dominated by the MathWorks.[16]
In September 2016, Altair acquired Solid Iris Technologies, creator of "Thea Render".[17]

Envision 4.0 brings data analytics for IoT, industrial analytics and embedded BI to new heights

      TROY, Mich., Feb. 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- solidThinking
      announced today the general availability of Envision
      4.0, the newest feature release of the company's data
      analytics platform. Several new functions have been added to
      offer a complete set of capabilities required for
      Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Analytics.























      “The 4.0 release is feature-rich across the board, making
      Envision more capable, refined and easy to use.  Users
      will immediately see an enhanced user experience,” said
      Yeshwant Mummaneni, Sr. Vice President
      Analytics. “In addition, with version 4.0 we focused
      on strengthening the platform with core enhancements that
      include Smart Joins, Targeted Filtering and
      Multi-Level Aggregations. We are really excited to
      deliver to our customers and partners the most comprehensive
      cloud BI platform yet.”
    

      “Envision 4.0 is a significant release for us as a partner,”
      said Brian Lassiter, Milsoft Utility
      Solutions. “With 4.0 and its real time data refresh,
      our utility clients now have the option to visualize
      dashboards showing current outage locations, dispatched
      crews, customers affected, and more relevant KPIs, all in one
      view and in real time.  In their business, it is
      imperative to know what is happening right now.”
    

      Visit http://Envisionbi.com/4.0 for
      images, videos, and more information about the latest version
      of Envision.
    

Key updates in the Envision 4.0 release
      include:



Smart JoinsTo help business users
        easily combine data from multiple sources, Envision 4.0
        introduces Smart Joins to combine multiple data sources
        without the need to understand the nuances of classical SQL
        joins. This powerful capability of joining multiple fact
        tables along multiple dimensions will allow users to plot
        metrics from multiple data sources on a single chart.



Multi-level AggregationIn addition
        to the standard aggregation/rollup (SUM, MIN, AVG, STD,
        etc.) functions, advanced aggregation capabilities enable
        user to roll data to level “A” using a certain aggregation
        function, and then further rollup to level “B” using a
        different aggregation function. The aggregation dimension
        path is intelligently picked up from the charts'
        aggregation levels to further simplify usage.



Real-timeEnvision’s real-time data
        refresh via user specified refresh time interval or via a
        Rest API notification support several IoT use cases. This
        real-time experience is expanded to enable a collaborative
        realization of analytical projects by a team. The changes
        to the reports, dashboards and charts are synced up in
        real-time across all active authors and viewers.



Refinements to User
        ExperienceEnvision offers comprehensive BI
        capabilities in an extremely easy-to-use solution. It has
        one of the fastest data to dashboard experiences, with the
        fewest amount of clicks. This experience is further refined
        with new context-sensitive chart properties and n-level
        deep Undo/Redo stack. This release also features
        Bookmarks – providing users a shortcut to most commonly
        used combination of dashboard filters, and the ability to
        share these bookmarks. Finally, the new Targeted filtering
        allows users to link measures/metrics with dashboard
        filters providing fine grained control on how and what
        aspects of charts and dashboards react to certain
        filters.



Admin Tools and ConnectorsEnvision
        is packed with Enterprise features. Envision 4.0
        strengthens the cloud, on-premises and embedded
        capabilities required by Enterprises and ISVs. These
        capabilities include the ability to schedule reports,
        receive notifications upon data refresh, additional O-Auth
        based authentication option, big data support for Apache
        Spark and SalesForce.com connector. This release also
        enables authoring capabilities of Envision in Embedded
        mode. A comprehensive redesign of user, data, services,
        security and app management makes admin tasks easier.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
