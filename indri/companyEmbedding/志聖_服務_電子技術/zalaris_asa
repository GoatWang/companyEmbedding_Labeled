Why my account is limited to only few analytic runs? 

								To execute equity pricing pattern simulations, real time valuations, recommendations, instant reporting, and portfolio analytics such as mean-variance optimization takes huge amount of 
								computing resources. Since we are a small company we cannot afford to have
								hundreds of servers in our cluster. To be fair to all of our users with free accounts, 
								we have restricted analytics execution to few times.  Please upgrade 
								your account to be able to remove usage restrictions and unlock all the features and tools used by professional money mangers.
								
I don't want to upgrade at this time. Are there any other options? 
	
								Yes, just show us your support and love and we will temporary re-enable the content.

Remaining true to its traditionally strong Humboldtian ethos, the University of Helsinki places heavy emphasis on high-quality teaching and research of a top international standard.[6] It is a member of various prominent international university networks, such as Europaeum, UNICA, the Utrecht Network, and is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities.

Corporate Social Responsibility


Zalaris engage stakeholders, provide opportunities for local business, create employment opportunities, invest in AKTIV Against Cancer and is committed to minimizing the impact of our business and service processes on the environment.



Equal Rights
Zalaris shall be a professional workplace with an inclusive working environment and respect the International Labor Organization’s fundamental conventions.
Zalaris aims to be a workplace free from discrimination. No direct or indirect negative discrimination shall take place based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, language, religion, employee representation, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
Zalaris’ personnel policy is based on equal pay for the same work. This means that women and men receive the same pay for the same position, given all other applicable circumstances are the same. Zalaris ASA will continue to strive for gender balance in the Group’s management and board of directors.
Zalaris aims to provide the physical environment necessary to not exclude the participation of persons with physical disability from performing the business’ various functions.
Life Work Balance and Healthy Life Style
Zalaris wishes to make it possible for employees of either gender to combine their work and private life, and therefore offers leave arrangements, home office solutions and part time positions and other flexible work arrangements to support this.
We organize company programs to motivate our colleagues to stay physical active at the same time as we support the foundation AKTIV Against Cancer who promotes physical training for cancer patients. 
Zalaris believes that through locating our service centers outside high pressure areas – where our presence is noticed and welcomed – we can combine good business with good environmental practice enabling people to work where they want to live. Our secure centralized IT infrastructure – powered with green renewable hydro power based energy – enable us to rapidly establish cost effective service centers independent of where the end customer is located.
Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) – Policy
The long-term business success of Zalaris depends on our ability to live our values of “Service Excellence, Quality Focused Processes and Employees – our key assets”. We want to continually improve the quality of our services while contributing to a positive working environment for our people. Zalaris requires the active commitment to and accountability for Health and Safety from all employees and contractors. Line management
has a leadership role in the communication and implementation of, and ensuring compliance with, these policies and standards.
We are committed to:

Protect, and strive for improvement of health, safety and security of our people at all times with the goal to eliminate HS related accidents;
Set HS performance objectives, measure results, assess and continually improve processes, services and product quality, through the use of an effective management system;
Work with management, employees and employee representatives to create a positive physical and psychological work environment that maximizes the motivation and teamwork for all impacted people;


Plan for, respond to and recover from any emergency, crisis and business disruption;
Develop services that can help our customers monitor and action HS issues;
Communicate openly with stakeholders and ensure an understanding of our HS policies, standards, programs and performance.

Environment
Pollution of the external environment as a result of Zalaris’ operations is limited. Zalaris’ environmental impact is for the most part linked to energy consumption, travel and waste from office activities. One of Zalaris’ environmental measures is to centralize all IT Operations in a centralized infrastructure concept hosted in energy efficient data centers powered by green renewable hydro powered energy.
Further, Zalaris has limited paper consumption through the introduction of web and mobile based solutions for customers for viewing of pay slips and reports and thus reducing printing of paper. At the same time we have implemented printer systems where documents are not printed unless the user logs in to pick up the printed document.
The Group’s environmental initiatives focus on using organized recycling schemes for obsolete IT equipment, reducing travel activities through the increased use of teleconferencing and web meetings as Lync, and responsible waste management.
All employees have a mandatory obligation to consciously observe the environmental impact of work-related activities, and to select solutions, products and methods that have a minimum
impact on the environment. This is described in our Code of Conduct.
Business Ethics
Zalaris’ Code of Conduct is an integral part of our formal governance regime. The Code defines the core principles and ethical standards that form the basis on how we create value. The Code applies to Zalaris ASA and any subsidiary in which Zalaris, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the voting shares. It also applies to members of the Board of directors, managers and other employees as well as those acting on behalf of the company.
The Code of Conduct does not apply directly to the company’s business partners. However, Zalaris does not want to be associated with business partners that do not have appropriate ethical standards. Everybody associated with Zalaris shall comply with the rules and guidelines. Whereas failure to perform can be excused, we can never compromise on our integrity. This is the way we shall conduct business in Zalaris and the way we shall create value for our customers, investors, staff and anyone benefiting from the services we provide.
The Code of Conduct is reviewed annually, and further details can be found in our annual report.
