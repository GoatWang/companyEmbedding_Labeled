AMN: Healthcare Back In Vogue ?


AMN has consolidated since Sep 2015 as the high flying techs and high beta stocks were running out of the gates.
The market risk has evaluated since then and defensive sectors like healthcare should be slowly inching its way back into vogue.

Look for an entry at current levels with SL at recent key support @ $34.71.
A break below key support implies that the ...

Trendline/SR for AMN


For those that believe in Trend lines, this could be an interesting one. A former IBD beauty queen is back down to support(??) here. Could be worth a shot long with fairly tight stop below $28 for a decent risk/reward trade.  Btw, first TradingView idea, so I may need to modify this if the chart doesn't come through correctly (Weekly only).
