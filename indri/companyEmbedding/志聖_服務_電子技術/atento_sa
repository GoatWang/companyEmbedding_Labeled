Company Overview

Considering peers, relative underperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a lagging position.


Atento SA’s current Price/Book of 1.53 is about median in its peer group.


The market expects ATTO-US‘s earnings to grow at about the same rate as its chosen peers and also does not seem to expect much improvement in its below peer median returns.


ATTO-US has relatively low profit margins and median asset efficiency.


Changes in annual earnings (relative to peers) are better than the change in its revenues (relative to peers), implying the company is focused more on earnings.


ATTO-US‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years has trailed the peer median and suggests the company might be operationally challenged relative to its peers.


The company’s relatively low gross and pre-tax margins suggest a non-differentiated product portfolio and not much control on operating costs relative to peers.


While ATTO-US‘s revenues in recent years have grown faster than the peer median, the market gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median suggesting that the market has some questions about the company’s long-term strategy.


The company’s relatively low level of capital investment and below peer median returns on capital suggest that the company is in maintenance mode.


ATTO-US seems too levered to raise additional debt.
