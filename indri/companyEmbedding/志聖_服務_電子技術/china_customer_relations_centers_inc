P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.99      Net Money Flow ($)  -2,532    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

					Full Description



China Customer Relations Centers, Inc., incorporated on March 6, 2014, is a business process outsourcing (BPO) service provider focusing on the complex, voice-based segment of customer care services, including customer relationship management, technical support, sales, customer retention, marketing surveys and research for certain major enterprises in the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Company's customers are the provincial subsidiaries of various telecommunications carriers in the PRC. It also provides outsourcing services to its clients whereby they can lease its employees to work at their offices. The Company operates its business through contractual arrangements between its subsidiary, wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE) and its variable interest entity, Shandong Taiying Technology Co., Ltd (Taiying). Its line of services includes Inbound Customer Care Service and Outbound Customer Care Service.Inbound Customer Care ServiceThe Company's inbound customer support service offers answering service hotlines in China, round the clock. Contacts are initiated primarily by inbound calls from customers on a range of topics dealing with customer enquiries regarding services and billings, directory assistance, account and service changes, password reset/appeals, product and service inquiries, hotel reservations, airline ticket purchases, customer retention and customer complaints. Customer retention programs are programs where the customer calls to cancel service. In the latter case, its customer service associates are trained to attempt to resolve the customer's issue and convince the customer to keep their service with the particular provider. In addition, it initiates sales calls, primarily to existing customers of its clients, for retention and loyalty programs, and in some cases unsolicited calling for customer acquisition. Taiying operates under licensing and revenue sharing agreements with the provincial subsidiaries of China Mobile and China Telecom for its inbound calling service. For inbound customer care service, fees are charged based on either number of calls (a fixed charge per interaction) or predetermined seats charges (weekly charges, or monthly charges per seat).Outbound Customer Care ServiceThe Company provides outbound cold calling services, such as selling color ring back tones (CRBT), wireless news service, daily weather service and other Mobile value added service (MVAS) to targeted wireless subscribers. Through market segmentation, customer trends and analysis of customer attrition rates, the Company generates revenue by making targeted outbound cold callings of subscribers. The Company creates and manages a range of MVAS products for China Mobile or China Telecom, as the case may be, and markets them to mobile phone users through the Company's call centers under the China Mobile or China Telecom brand, as the case may be. The provincial subsidiaries of China Mobile and China Telecom compensate its company for selling their products and managing their revenues by splitting the subscription fee according to a pre-determined formula for enrolling each subscriber. For outbound cold calling services, fees are charged based on the success of marketing the product and service upon subscription.The Company competes with CM-Tong, Meiyin, Boyue, Asiainfo, 95Teleweb and Poicom.
