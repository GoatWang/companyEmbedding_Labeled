History[edit]




Alliance Data headquarters in Plano, TX






Alliance Data headquarters in One Legacy Circle located at 7500 Dallas Parkway in Plano, TX


Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.[3]
In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million.[4] The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.[5]
In May 2007, Alliance Data and The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans for Alliance Data to be acquired by The Blackstone Group.[6][7] In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.[8][9]
Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998.[10][11][12]
Businesses[edit]
Alliance Data Card Services[edit]
Card Services is a provider of integrated credit and marketing services including private label, co-branded and commercial credit card programs. Alliance Data Card Services manages over 135[13] card programs for retail brands such as Victoria’s Secret, J.Crew, Eddie Bauer, Buckle, HSN, Pottery Barn and Pier 1 Imports.[14]
In 2011, Alliance Data, in partnership with NICE Systems, was honored with the Operational Leadership Award for its customer care centers by Ventana Research.[15]
Alliance Data Card Services maintains two banks to manage the funding and receivables for its clients' credit programs. In September 2012, the banks rebranded their names from WFNNB (World Financial Network [National] Bank) and WFCB (World Financial Capital Bank) to both operate under the Comenity name, as Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, respectively.[16]
LoyaltyOne[edit]
LoyaltyOne, located in Canada, provides loyalty marketing programs for North American brands in the retail, financial services, grocery, petroleum, travel, and hospitality industries.
Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate;[17] Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.
Hewitt Associates named LoyaltyOne in their "2014 List of the 50 Best Employers in Canada."[18]
Epsilon[edit]
Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting and creative services, among others.
Ad Age has ranked Epsilon among the top marketing services firms and direct marketing agencies for several years, and Epsilon has the distinction as being the Top US Agency From All Disciplines and Top US CRM/Direct Marketing Agencies for 2012.[19] [20][21][22] It sends billions of permission-based emails every year.[23] Acquired by Epsilon in 2011,[24] Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois[25] with locations in the United States and Canada. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing (“HMI”) group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million.
In March 2011, Epsilon detected unauthorized access to its email database, resulting in the theft of email addresses of its clients' customers.[26][27][28]
In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.[29]
Because of Epsilon’s growth over the past several years, the company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.[30][31]
In March 2014, 60 Minutes interviewed Bryan Kennedy, chairman and CEO of Epsilon, as part of its segment, The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information.[32]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data.[33] In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of 50 client companies were stolen.[33] The company quickly notified people of the breach.[34] In June 2011 company executives were called before congress.[35]

Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.

At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.
