Market Share Versus Profits

Compared to the same period last year, TEFN-IL‘s change in revenue was close to the amount of its change in earnings.  It remains to be seen how the rest of its peer group’s results will turn out and if TEFN-IL‘s performance is a sign of any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector.  Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 3.48% and earnings by 83.88% compared to the previous period.

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s earnings growth was influenced by year-on-year improvement in gross margins from 25.82% to 33.63% as well as better cost controls.  As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) rose from 7.31% to 16.31% compared to the same period last year.  For comparison, gross margins were 29.20% and EBITDA margins were 9.87% in the last reporting period.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
TEFN-IL‘s year-on-year change in operating cash flow of -28.27% is around its change in earnings.  This suggests that there are likely no significant movement in accruals or reserves for managing earnings this period.

Margins
The company’s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from 5.95% to 15.16% and (2) one-time items. The company’s pretax margins are now 12.81% compared to 2.52% for the same period last year.
