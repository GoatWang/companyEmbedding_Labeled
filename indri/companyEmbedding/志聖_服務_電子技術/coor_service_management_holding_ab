About Coor
 







        Coor - a leading FM provider in the Nordics
    

            Coor is a leading provider of IFM and FM services in the Nordics, offering all the facility management services necessary for a company or public body to work smoothly and effectively.
        


Coor possesses specialist competence in workplace services (soft FM), property services (hard FM) and strategic advisory services. Coor’s customer base includes large corporations and small enterprises operating in the private and public sectors. Coor assumes substantial responsibility for its actions in relation to customers, employees, suppliers, the environment and wider society.
Coor’s sales are some SEK 7,500 m (rolling 12-month basis), and it has some 6,500 employees (FTE).
Coor's service portfolio - integrated, bundled or single services
Coor's service portfolio is delivered as single services, bundled services or as integrated facility management (IFM) depending on customer needs. Coor has the broadest offering on the market, and has capability to deliver a wide range of services - from solutions in administration, logistics, operating staff restaurants, providing hot drinks, conferencing solutions and cleaning, to property management, technical security solutions, energy optimization and workspace optimization. Coor has a total portfolio of some 100 services. However, Coor's primary strength is tailoring, developing and leading support service functions in new, more effective ways. By bundling different services from all or some of these service segments, Coor can offer unique, effective and flexible solutions that create business benefit for customers. Coor calls this intelligent service—Service with IQ.
Geographic segments
Coor conducts operations primarily in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, but also in Belgium, Estonia, Poland and Hungary. Its largest market is Sweden (incl. operations in Belgium, Poland and Hungary), with this business generating 56% of total net sales in the financial year 2016. The Norwegian operation generated 29%, while Denmark and Finland (including operations in Estonia) provided 9 and 6 % of net sales respectively.
