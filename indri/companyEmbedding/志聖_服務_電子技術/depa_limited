DDS Singapore is a specialist company poised to be a significant player offering a comprehensive fit-out suite, including turnkey and retro-fitting services, to new and existing hospitality and commercial projects.Analysts are bullish on the construction sector in Singapore, which is at the implementation stage of multi-year projects announced in 2006.An estimated S$54.4 billion ($39.4 billion) of committed projects up until 2010 are to be scheduled for construction.  filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsGeneralAlso In GeneralDefence exhibition IDEX starts with a bang 					Business Gallery Airshow aerial acrobatics over SpainFiat 500 celebrates 60th anniversary 					Business	Videos 	PlayWhat you can buy with $24.5 million in DubaiAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success  FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures01Top 10 online purchases in UAE0211 steps to starting a business in UAE 0310 best-paid executives in UAE  	PlayWhat you can buy with $24.5 million in DubaiJul 07, 2017	PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing successNov 24, 2016	PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturingOct 25, 2016	PlayEmirates opens SkyPharma in DubaiSep 18, 2016 13ImagesAirshow aerial acrobatics over SpainAug 01, 2017 8ImagesMassive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 10ImagesSony Playstation E3 show draws crowdsJun 13, 2017 13ImagesMohammad launches Marsa Al Arab projectMay 15, 2017CurrenciescurrenciesAgainst USDAgainst BHD Against EUR Against GBP Against PHILIPINE PESO Against SAR Against OMR Against QAR Against KWD Against AED  Value% ChangeAs on  Most Popular on Gulf NewsKhalifa issues new Tax Procedures LawQatar’s Haj call like ‘declaration of war’Baby aborted after illegal sex on yachtIndians told: Don’t job hunt on visit visasStaff flee with Dh6.5m from Dubai exchange5 most in-demand jobs in UAE todayLifeguard raped woman in Al Quoz, court hearsApplying for UAE visa never more comfortableUAE, allies agree 9 Qatar plane routes  CloseRecommended For YouQatar offers residency to prevent expat exitPUBLISHED ON Aug 03, 2017
