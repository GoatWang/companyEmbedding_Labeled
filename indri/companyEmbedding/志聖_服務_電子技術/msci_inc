Microsat Systems Canada Inc. (MSCI) is Canada’s leader in the design, development and delivery of cost-effective, adaptable Multi Mission Microsatellite Buses (MMMB) capable of hosting a wide variety of remote sensing, communications, scientific and military payloads.

We are committed to the future sustainability and transparency of the financial markets.  We create innovative products and services that allow our clients to make more informed investment decisions.

MSCI is a proud signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.

Our History  Our long history has allowed us to build extensive databases of proprietary index, risk and ESG data, as well as accumulate valuable historical market data, which is difficult to replicate and provides us with a substantial competitive advantage.     Timeline    1969   MSCI was a pioneer in developing the market for global equity indexes. We began licensing our first equity index products in 1969.          1998   We were incorporated in 1998 and until we became a public company in November 2007 our only two shareholders were Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International. We became a fully independent, stand-alone public company in May 2009.          2004   In June 2004, we acquired Barra, a provider of portfolio risk analytics tools that launched its first risk analytics products in 1975. This broadened our product range beyond index products. Barra also owned FEA.         2010   In June 2010, we acquired RiskMetrics Group, a leading provider of risk management and governance products and services. In addition to this core product line, RiskMetrics owned Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS), a pioneer in the development of policy-based proxy voting recommendations. We sold ISS in April 2014. RiskMetrics also owned the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA), Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. and KLD Research and Analytics. We sold the CFRA product line in March 2013. Innovest and KLD Research are now known as MSCI ESG Research. Through MSCI ESG Research, we provide our clients with research reports and analytical tools covering environmental, social and governance investment criteria.           In July 2010, we acquired Measurisk, a provider of risk transparency and risk measurement tools for hedge fund investors. With our clients demanding increasing levels of transparency from their hedge fund managers, this acquisition helped us develop a broad platform and set the standard for analyzing and reporting hedge fund risk. Measurisk’s products are now part of our hedge fund risk transparency offering.       2012   In November 2012, we acquired real estate performance measurement group IPD. The acquisition of IPD expanded MSCI’s multi-asset class offering by facilitating the integration of private real estate assets into our models, as well as adding a family of real estate indexes to MSCI’s suite of equity indexes.        2013   In January 2013, we acquired InvestorForce, a leading provider of performance reporting tools to the institutional investment community in the United States. The InvestorForce offering enables us to provide consultants with integrated, daily monitoring, analysis of and reporting on institutional assets.        2014   In August 2014, we acquired Governance Holdings Co. (GMI Ratings), a provider of corporate governance research and ratings to institutional investors, banks, insurers, auditors, regulators and corporations seeking to incorporate ESG factors into risk assessment and decision-making. This acquisition enhanced our existing platform of ESG research and tools, allowing us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of ESG products and services to our clients.     2015 In October 2015, we acquired all of the assets of Insignis, a leading provider of daily automated collection, aggregation and management of financial data. We believe this acquisition will help us further automate the collection and integration of data across our risk and performance management platforms.                  Valuing Diversity and Inclusion  We are a global organization but we work as one team. The Company recognizes and values the diverse backgrounds and unique skill sets of all of us. MSCI is committed to developing a diverse workforce and maintaining an inclusive environment for every individual.                                            Back to Top

ABOUT MSCI
MSCI is a leading provider of research-based, mission critical investment decision support tools for investors globally, including asset managers, banks, hedge funds and pension funds. We offer a range of products and services including indexes, ESG research, and portfolio risk and performance analytics.
The MSCI Indexes are used as benchmarks for over US$ 9 trillion in funds (including retail and institutional, actively and passively managed). Over the years, MSCI Indexes have become the market reference connecting the owners of the assets, the manager of the assets and the traders of the assets. MSCI Index data is used on a daily basis by most Pension Plans, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Fund Managers, Private Banks, Insurance Companies, Custodians and Broker Dealers. 
The main use case for the MSCI Indexes is fund/portfolio benchmarking. To serve this, we provide a number of electronic Benchmark Data packages that are sold to clients as yearly subscriptions. This business line represents about 2/3rd of the Index run rate.
In addition to benchmarking, the MSCI Indexes are used as the basis for various types of Indexed funds (institutional, separately managed and retail funds), ETFs, over-the-counter delta-one swaps, structured products and exchange-listed Futures and Options. In each of these product categories MSCI holds a very large and growing global franchise. For this business, MSCI charges bps on the AUM (or per-trade fees on trading products). This business line represents about 1/3rd of the Index run rate.

About the MSCI Index Business in Asia
Our market position in Asia is very strong. 
The vast majority of off-shore investments in equities are benchmarked to a MSCI Index, with flagship names such as MSCI Kokusai, MSCI World ex Australia, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI AC Asia ex Japan and MSCI China A. As a consequence, our Benchmark Data subscription business is strong and growing.
Relatively speaking, in Asia, the use of MSCI Indexes to serve indexed funds, ETFs and derivatives is relatively under-developed as compared to other regions, which is an area for further investments. However, more positively, the region’s adoption of Factor (Smart Beta) investing is on par, if not slightly ahead of the other regions. 
Some of the main structural trends affecting our Index business in Asia are a) the rapidly growing investment management industry, b) the gradual reduction in home-bias in asset allocations, c) the growing importance of China equities d) the adoption of passive investments and e) the adoption of factor investing. In each of these areas, MSCI is well positioned to capture the business upside.
POSITION OVERVIEW AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
The goal is for MSCI to become the leading, most profitable and most influential index provider in the region. We are ambitious, profitable, and ready to make the material investments needed to achieve this goal. 
We are a small sized team with entrepreneurial flair. While various internal functions, such as Client Coverage, Research and Operations share the same ambition and will always operate cohesively, the Asia Head of MSCI ETF/Passive business will be accountable to lead in two specific areas;
1. egional ETF/Passive business strategy and market share growth 


The MSCI ETF/Passive Business Head will lead the licensing strategy process by clearly defining the fund managers with whom we want to expand our relationships, the right fund line-up for each country, the right fees and the right marketing support needed (i.e. the 4 “P”) to grow the business (P&L).


In order to define our strategy, this person will be responsible to clearly define our approach to each client segment, based on the investors’ use-case and their competitive choices. A strong understanding of these demand-drivers will be the foundation to guide our actions and investments, for example identifying product gaps, client coverage gaps and the competitive positioning our Indexes. 


More specifically, the licensing of product providers will be done through a strong cooperation between this person and our generalist coverage teams in each Asian country (including HK, China, Australia, Japan and India). Whereas the account management and relationship will be led by Client Coverage, this person is responsible to making regular product ideas presentations to our clients and ensure that our franchise is fully maximized, whether through locally listed or offshore listed MSCI based financial products.


On occasion, the ETF/Passive Business Head will be called upon to solve a specific client problem and/or to support a client specific business opportunity (for example, more complex licensing and fee negotiation, competitive issues).


2. Point person to the product teams within BlackRock and iShares in Hong Kong


This person will be the main point person with our leading client, BlackRock / iShares in Hong Kong. As such, this person will hold very regular sessions with Product groups to develop and license new indexes as well as helping communicate the benefits of our indexes through their client’s Sales and Marketing channels. This will for example include being occasionally the MSCI spokesperson at their client events


This person will need to be a trusted and senior partner with BlackRock and iShares, able to discuss both broad ranging topics and specific product ideas. Importantly, this person needs to treat any client information as highly confidential.


NECESSARY SKILLS


Strong analytical skills to grasp the important market dynamics in each country (e.g. asset pools, market players, competitors, regulation) and be able to factor these in the competitive business strategy. In particular, understanding the Institutional vs. Retail investor behavior as well as the competitive dynamic of the local asset management industry will form important foundations to our strategy and plans.


Be extremely effective in working within a team so as to be able to initiate, motivate, coordinate and support the multi-functional internal resources (e.g. Client coverage, Research, Operations, Compliance, and Finance)


Strong business judgement and analytical skills to address our opportunities and challenges in a rapid and highly effective manner.


Able to regularly present our product campaigns to clients, and, our business strategy, plans and results to senior management


DESIRED EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS:


10+ years of work experience with a strong understanding of the Asian fund management and ETF category.


Proven track record in business management, ideally within a business or product management role in a leading asset management firm.


Team-player with the maturity and presence to make an impact with clients and with senior management.


Advanced degree, preferably an MBA from a highly regarded institution.


Mandarin is preferable, but not a pre-requisite. Strong mastery of English is however necessary.

History[edit]
In 1968, Capital International published indices covering the global stock market for non-U.S. markets. In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes.[6] By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank and Standard & Poor's.[7] After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed.[7] In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra.[8] In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI.[9] This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007.[10] The divestment was completed in 2009.[11] The company is headquartered in New York City.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
MSCI formally acquired both RiskMetrics Group, Inc.[13] and Measurisk[14] in 2010, as well as Investment Property Databank in 2012.[15] In 2013 MSCI acquired Investor Force from ICG Group (formerly Internet Capital Group) in 2013.[16] In August 2014, MSCI acquired GMI Ratings.[17]
Indices[edit]
The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969 and include MSCI World[18] and MSCI EAFE.[19] Initially, the company used eight factors in developing its indexes: momentum, volatility, value, size, growth, size nonlinearity, liquidity and financial leverage.[20]

History[edit]
In 1968, Capital International published indices covering the global stock market for non-U.S. markets. In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes.[6] By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank and Standard & Poor's.[7] After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed.[7] In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra.[8] In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI.[9] This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007.[10] The divestment was completed in 2009.[11] The company is headquartered in New York City.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
MSCI formally acquired both RiskMetrics Group, Inc.[13] and Measurisk[14] in 2010, as well as Investment Property Databank in 2012.[15] In 2013 MSCI acquired Investor Force from ICG Group (formerly Internet Capital Group) in 2013.[16] In August 2014, MSCI acquired GMI Ratings.[17]
Indices[edit]
The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969 and include MSCI World[18] and MSCI EAFE.[19] Initially, the company used eight factors in developing its indexes: momentum, volatility, value, size, growth, size nonlinearity, liquidity and financial leverage.[20]
