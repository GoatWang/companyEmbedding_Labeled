More...Did you know ?Multiples charts provide an effective way to quickly analyze a company's valuation over a period of time, and compare it against the valuation of another company, a personal list, or a market index. About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
