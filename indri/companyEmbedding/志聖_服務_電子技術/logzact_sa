C3 session
Warehouse in contemporary supply chains


 

New organisational and technological solutions in warehouses are a response to the varying role of a warehouse in contemporary supply chains. Warehouse is no longer a place serving solely the storage of goods. Comprehensive operations forming added value are presently taking place in the warehouses of today. Modern equipment is an essential component of warehouse infrastructure, having an active impact on how fast the flow of goods is in supply chains. The tendency to invest in warehouse automatics and autonomous devices is becoming visible. The growth of e-commerce sector forces operators and warehouse owners to search for improvements in the area of equipment and processes occurring therein. Greater attention in warehouse facilities is presently paid to energy-efficient and environment-friendly solutions.
