New partnership establishes industry-leading solution in the United States for managing absence, leave and disability through day-one notifications
SAN DIEGO, CA, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Morneau Shepell (TSX: MSI), a market leader in human resources technology and absence and disability services, today announced that it has selected Presagia's absence compliance engine to support Morneau Shepell's Abiliti™Absence solution. This integrated solution offers clients an industry-leading user experience to manage absence, leave and disability, and includes more than 450 U.S. federal, state and municipal leave policies, in addition to the ability to add organization-specific leave policies such as personal, medical and paid family leaves. This helps organizations improve efficiencies and demonstrate compliance.








In a report on trends in human resources, Morneau Shepell found that 64 per cent of employers do not track the cost of casual and incidental absence. To help solve this issue, Morneau Shepell provides a unique, fully integrated approach to managing absence, leave and disability, which includes comprehensive "day one" notification option. The system fully supports real-time absence notification from all causes, as well as the ability to track various banks of time, such as paid time off, paid family leave, sick and safe time off, vacation and numerous other items in a single place. 
Recognizing the need to provide innovative tools to better engage employees and employers, Abiliti™Absence is accessible around the clock to notify and track absences from work through a mobile app, interactive voice response, call center and web portal. Abiliti™Absence's powerful dashboarding delivers real-time reporting, analytics and improves overall management of absence, leave and disability. 
"We are pleased to partner with Presagia, as it is the industry's most trusted source of knowledge and technology for leave management compliance," said Zahid Salman, Executive Vice President, Morneau Shepell. "By incorporating Presagia's compliance engine into Morneau Shepell's Abiliti™Absence technology platform, we are able to now provide the same level of industry leading absence management solutions in the United States that we currently provide in Canada."
This solution is currently available for demonstration. For more information on Morneau Shepell's Abiliti™Absence solution, visit: morneaushepell.com.
