Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, London and Paris – 27 July 2017 – Euronext today announced the launch of the Morningstar® Eurozone 50 IndexSM and Morningstar® Developed Markets Europe 100 IndexSM on Euronext. The launch of the new European indices for blue chips follows the signing of a strategic agreement with Morningstar announced in March 2017 to develop a series of derivative products based on Morningstar indices.
The indices developed by Euronext and Morningstar aim to provide different investor profiles (asset managers, brokers, ETF issuers, banks and trading desks) with equity beta indices that can be used as benchmarks and for investable product creation. The new indices are positioned as a competitive alternative to Europe’s existing offerings and are part of Morningstar’s Open Indexes Project, which delivers a portion of Morningstar’s global equity indices for no cost to the investment community for benchmarking purposes. The indices come with an innovative business model offering:

Free daily index performance data and constituent holdings on a monthly basis
A competitive licensing fee for investment product creation
Limited fixed fee levels to license the indices for bank structured product creation

The agreement with Morningstar to deliver new European indices is part of Euronext’s “Agility for Growth” strategy aimed at diversifying and strengthening its index offering in Europe. 
The indices launch will be followed by Euronext’s launch of Futures contracts on the two new European indices in Q4 2017.

Launch of LiquidShare, the European blockchain fintech for SME post-trade 



 





Paris – 11 July 2017 –  BNP Paribas, CACEIS, Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Euronext, S2iEM and Société Générale with the support of Paris EUROPLACE announce the creation of the European fintech venture LiquidShare. This new independent startup is the fruit of a partnership launched by its shareholders in June 2016 to develop a post-trading blockchain infrastructure for the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) market.
LiquidShare is a dynamic and innovative company which core objective is to improve SME’s access to capital markets, improving the transparency and security of post-trading operations using blockchain. With the financial support of its shareholders, the company aims to develop and operate a post-trading infrastructure that will serve these companies specifically. Eventually, the solution aims to reduce transaction costs.
LiquidShare will be set up shortly in a Parisian incubator where it will employ various profiles to implement the platform. The startup will be led by Thibaud de Maintenant, who is named Chief Executive Officer of the company. In close cooperation with its large institutional partners, Thibaud de Maintenant will combine functional and technical expertise with innovative solutions to work towards the company’s goal.
At the launch, he commented: “With the launch of LiquidShare, we will use the great potential of the blockchain technology to become a key player in the post-trade industry. Supported by shareholders across the European financial market ecosystem, this initiative is the first of its kind.”
In addition, Anthony Attia, Managing Board member of Euronext, is appointed Chairman of the Supervisory Board of LiquidShare.
LiquidShare harnesses blockchain technology that consists of a virtual ledger that assembles data for shared distribution between many different users. This technology has the potential to dramatically simplify the chain of post-trade operations, guaranteeing and facilitating the consolidation of securities registers, all while enabling a higher speed of execution with real-time settlement at T+0.
Appendix –
