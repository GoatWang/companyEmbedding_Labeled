Acquisitions
Principal acquisitions since 2001
In December 2002, Wincanton acquired P&O Trans European from The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for a debt-free consideration of approximately £152.5 million.  This acquisition enhanced Wincantons presence in the UK market and also provided a Pan-European platform for future growth;In December 2004, Wincanton acquired MidiData from Sirva Inc for a debt-free consideration of £7 million.  This strengthened Wincantons position in the specialist high tech logistics market, particularly in Germany;In October 2005, Wincanton acquired the principal French operations of Premium Logistics (Premium) from the Giraud family for an initial debt-free consideration of 22 million and up to 6 million payable subject to the financial performance of Premium in the period to 31 December 2005, which is yet to be finalised.  In addition, Wincanton acquired an additional 7.5 million of certain assets leased to Premium by the vendor.  Premium has strengthened Wincantons logistics capabilities in France providing a broader coverage.In October 2006, Wincanton acquired Lane Group Plc from private shareholders in the UK for a consideration of £2 million plus the assumption of £6m of debt, to expand its two-man home delivery network in the UK.In October 2006, Wincanton acquired RDL Holdings Ltd (RDL) from private shareholders in the UK for an initial debt-free consideration of £22 million and up to £5 million may be payable subject to the financial performance of RDL in the period to 31  December 2007.  This acquisition provided Wincanton with the capabilities to become a major logistic provider in the UK building products sector.In November 2007, Wincanton acquired Swales Haulage Ltd ("Swales") from private shareholder for a debt-free consideration of £5.3m, to further strengthen its position in the UK building services market.In January 2008, Wincanton acquired the container logistics operations of Hanbury Davies Ltd ("Hanbury Davies") for an initial debt-free consideration of approximately £25.0m. Up to a further £2.5m may be payable subject to the financial performance of Hanbury Davies in the period to 31 March 2008. Hanbury Davies is one of the UK market leaders in the provision of container logistics services and will strengthen Wincanton's position within the fast-growing container logistics market, complementing the Group's developing global transport capabilities and further expanding the service offering to existing customers.In April 2008 Wincanton acquired HeBo GmbH ("HeBo"), a specialist provider of logistics services to the High-Tech industry in the North Rhine-Westfalia region for an initial debt-free consideration of 2.9m. A further 0.5m may be payable subject to the financial performance of HeBo in the year to 31 March 2009.  The acquisition enhances the service capability of Wincanton's High-Tech logistics activities and reinforces its position as a leading operator in this specialist sector in Germany.In May 2008, Wincanton acquired Product Support Holdings Ltd ('PSHL'), a leading provider of logistics solutions to defence and aerospace markets, for an initial debt-free consideration of approximately £27.0m with up to a further £3.0m payable subject to the financial performance of PSHL in the period to 31 March 2009.  The acquisition will give a strong presence in the defence and aerospace logistics markets and further diversify the Group's blue-chip customer portfolio with names such as Honeywell, AugustaWestland and BAE Systems.In October 2008, Wincanton acquired the Koblenz-based warehousing and transport specialist businesses ELI-Transport GmbH and ELI-Lagerhaus GmbH (ELI) for an initial debt-free consideration of approximately 12m. Up to a further 3m may be payable subject to the financial performance of ELI in the period to 30 November 2009.  Wincanton will also enter into a lease with the vendors for the operational properties in Koblenz. The acquisition provides a strong, profitable base for Wincantons German road network in an important geographic region and strengthen its groupage capabilities. The road network in Germany operates from 42 locations and provides both a platform for domestic distribution and a gateway for international transport flows for Wincanton's contract logistics and intermodal customers.In November 2008, Wincanton acquired CEL Group, a major container logistics provider in the UK, for an initial debt-free consideration of approximately £19.5m with up to a further £4.5m payable subject to the financial performance of CEL Group in the period to 31 August 2009.  CEL provides UK wide container haulage, storage and maintenance services with operations at all the major UK ports.

Wincanton plc is one of the United Kingdom's foremost logistics companies paying focus on three vital markets: warehousing, fleet management, and supply chain systems. The company's warehousing procedures comprise 52 automated and no automated frozen and ambient temperature warehouses throughout United Kingdom, varying from 1,500 square meters to 30,000 square meters en masse of which half of these warehouses is temperature-controlled services, representing almost 250,000 square meters in the company's overall working capability of almost 800,000 square meters. The company's Fleet Management operation administers a task force of nearly 4,000 tractors and 5,000 trailers, nearly 40 percent of which are undeviatingly possessed by Wincanton. Apart from having a milk carrier for the Milk Marketing Board and others, Wincanton now offers temperature-controlled, fluid, bulk, and dry freight supply services for consumers varying as of Air Products and BP Castrol, to Dairy Crest, Heinz, and Texaco, and various United Kingdom's major grocery retail groups. Wincanton's Supply Chain Systems operation proposes IT and related services for task force optimization, warehouse management systems, customer-systems interfaces, and further logistics and warehousing systems. Wincanton was the division of UNIGATE, renamed UNIQ in 2000, prior to being demerged as a self-governing, widely listed company in 2001. Wincanton is headed by Chairman Victor W. Benjamin and, given that October 2002, CEO Paul Bateman, formerly of the Tesco supermarket group. Bateman's rendezvous was seen by many as a sign that Wincanton aims to extend its U.K.-centric operations onto the European mainland.
Uni gate Offshoot in the 1920s
Labeled for its locality in the town of Wincanton, renowned for its racetrack, Wincanton map outs its beginning back to the early years of the food distribution corporation Unigate Plc. While that company, which altered its name to Unique in 2000 after detaching its dairy dealing, decided to break up its supply and logistics operations into two divided, publicly listed entities, Wincanton plc was commenced as an independent company with a catalog on the London Stock Exchange. Though, Wincanton had long given that recognized a name for itself as one of the United Kingdom's leading logistics companies.
Unigate started operations in the 1880s when Brothers Charles and Leonard Gates possessed their father's store in Guildford, Surrey, which was initially a grocery store, with strong liquor and beer sales. The Gates brothers put coffee and tea sales prior to deciding to leave liquor sales altogether going up to now as to decant their existing stock into the street. In its place, the Gates brothers determined to go into the dairy business, adding up a milk divider and adopting the name West Surrey Dairy in 1885. That firm grew into West Surrey Central Dairy Company, with creameries situated all the way through England and Ireland by the spin of the century.
Distribution operations having unprocessed milk from the farms to the company's dairies and from the dairies to its customers rapidly became a part of the company's business. West Surrey began totaling other products, for instance, powdered milk, which led to the creation of its Cow & Gate brand in 1908. After going public in 1917, the firm altered its name to Cow & Gate Co. in 1929.
By then, the company's allocation operations had developed to an adequate balance to create a committed distribution subordinate, which was opened in Sherborne, Dorset, in 1925. In 1927, that company was moved to one of Cow & Gate's locations in Wincanton, where it became identified as Wincanton Transport & Engineering. Wincanton's early permission was to offer continuance services for Cow & Gate's dairy operations and its increasing distribution fleet. Cow & Gate's sustained expansion, particularly as the company became a foremost manufacturer of infant formulas, led Wincanton to expand its operations to embrace running the company's warehouses as well.
The Logistics of Growth in the 1970s
Cow & Gate combined with United Dairies, a chief manufacturer of dairy products in the United Kingdom to create Unigate Ltd. in 1959. Under Unigate, the Wincanton subordinate saw its position grow up, as it grew into a full-grown engineering and shipping business responsible not only for sustaining Unigate's expanding operations, but also for increasing its own expansion outside of Unigate. A chief development came with Wincanton's own diversification, as it added a fleet of tanker trucks and began transporting milk for the public Milk Marketing Board. Those processes led the corporation into other areas of liquid transport, together with fuel transportation. in the meantime, Unigate's expansion into the trade division, as it developed a number of trade brands, including the Kibby's supermarket chain, an association of Uni-Wash Laundromats, and a succession of clothing shops, boosted Wincanton's own warehousing and circulation operations.
Wincanton began to expand into a full-grown logistics faction in the 1970s, mainly with the accumulation of temperature-controlled warehousing operations all through that decade. By then Wincanton had been divided into its two components, Wincanton Engineering Ltd. and Wincanton Transport Ltd. The final, which took over the distribution task force, began providing temperature-controlled warehousing for a mixture of intermediary manufacturers and distribution groups. This doings became one of Wincanton's vital specialties, as it developed its skill in the design and building of warehouses, the formation of mechanized warehouse systems, and warehouse management. Wincanton also developed proficiency in temperature-controlled distribution, forming its Wincanton Chilled Distribution division.
Unigate, which had been increasing its own expanded variety of businesses together with the Casa Bonita chain of Mexican restaurants in the United States, and poultry dispensation works through Turner's Turkeys and JP Wood contributed to Wincanton's expansion through a sequence of acquisitions in the mid-1980s. In 1985, the firm tacked on Arlington Motor Holdings, bought for £10.5 million, and added Colchester Car Auctions the following year, as Wincanton built up the task force supervision part of its increasing logistics business.
Unigate added Job's Fast Food Distribution in 1987. In 1988, the business paid £10 million to obtain four new companies Commercial & Trailer, which focused in tractor-trailer sales; North Shropshire Motor Auctions; Rydale Truck & Coach; and Southern Bros allowing Wincanton to amplify its purchasing authority. By the start of the 1990s, Wincanton had been situated itself as one of the United Kingdom's foremost fleet management groups.

By now demanding for headship in the UK and Ireland, Wincanton also aims to be among the privileged in every of its selected markets in Continental Europe. The Group's existing existence athwart Europe is an aggressive advantage in an industry which remains disjointed, with large numbers of small operators and an extremely partial number of Pan-European service providers.
The European market is Wincanton's chief geographic center, its dwelling market. It is a market of 460 million consumers. It has an extensive built-up and retailing infrastructure and major national, cross-border and international flows of raw materials, refined products and services. It is this supply chain flows that Wincanton copes on behalf of consumers. This is a geographic market in which Wincanton has a foremost existence and which offers extensive opportunities for potential expansion.
Wincanton has a well-built portfolio of consumers across Europe, together with many of the world's main retailers and manufacturers.

Strengths and weaknesses
The road-haulage business is a significant part of the freight-transportation structure in the UK. In 2006, the quantity of goods lifted by road in Great Britain by goods vehicles registered in Great Britain and weighing over 3.5 tones amplified by 3.7%, to 1.81 billion tones, while the volume of goods moved by road rose by 2%, to 155.8 billion tones kilometers.
The market consists of three main sectors: own-account allocation, contract distribution and shared-user allotment. Together, contract allocation and shared-user supply are known as public haulage or `hire and reward' haulage and make up the largest sector in terms of both goods moved and goods lifted. Though, crosswise the review period (2002 to 2006), own-account distribution confirmed a somewhat upper velocity of expansion.
Road transport is focusing on more official issues than roughly any other industry. Recently introduced legislation distressing the industry covers areas such as drivers' hours and working time, the use of macrographs, record keeping, health and safety, employment law, environmental law and corporate manslaughter legislation. Further legislation to come into strength in 2008 and 2009 includes the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence and the Low Emissions Certificate, which will influence haulers inflowing the London Low Emission Zone (LEZ).
The chief haulers and logistics companies require providing their clients with logistics networks that are ever more worldwide in a process, and this is contributing to an enduring wave of consolidation and fusion movement among the leading suppliers.
Key Note predicts that the volumes of goods moved and lifted by highway in Great Britain will maintain to increase between 2007 and 2011, both showing steady, albeit modest, rates of growth. The main factors affecting the market over the estimate time will be the force of the UK economy; the optimism of the UK manufacturing and trade sectors; the price of diesel petroleum (mainly concerning its cost elsewhere in Europe); all-purpose operating conditions; technical advances; and antagonism from overseas haulers.
Core competences

Strategic objectives
Extension into new divisions and new services, both organically and through acquirement, is altering and renewing the Group's portfolio of activities. Wincanton is considering long-lasting opportunities in its offered activities, but also productively supplementing these opportunities throughout development in newer industries and services, such as assembly, home delivery, records management, recycling, container supervision and foodservice. These activities by now signify some 20 per cent of the contract contribution, previous to central overheads, of Wincanton's business in the UK & Ireland. Numerous these businesses have been changed to a new business division, Emerging Solutions, to guarantee that these behaviors obtain the suitable level of operational and tactical focus and distribute their higher growth potential for the Group.
The ongoing force of the Group's existing businesses and customer relationships was again confirmed by the fact that some 70 per cent of the new business won in the year in the UK & Ireland, and above 65 per cent of the new business won by the Group overall, was awarded by existing consumers.
Restructuring of Wincanton's supervision structures and the re-focusing of its strategic priorities have also been features of the year in Mainland Europe. Wincanton's operations in Germany are beginning to profit from the considered and tactical initiatives of its appreciably strengthened management group. Wincanton's activities in France and the Benelux countries have been created into a new Western Europe business division, and the superior team in this region has also been reinforced with highly-experienced workforce in vital functions. In Central & Eastern Europe, Wincanton's regional Managing Director has introduced new country heads in both Hungary and the Czech Republic.

In respect of Mainland Europe Wincanton believes that additional growth will be made and are encouraged, for instance, by the strong action being taken to develop the performance of the German road network.
Wincanton operates in extremely competitive markets and the current economic outlook is vague, but Wincanton's maintain to have self-reliance in Wincanton's capacity to build further on the achievements of current time. Wincanton's aim is for 2008/09 to be a further period of growth for the Group, confirming Wincanton's place as a European leader in its segment.
Recent changes & policies
Wincanton's idea is to expand its variety of subcontracted services, lengthen into more industry sectors and boost its geographical attains. This needs a merge of crude expansion and attainment, which has seen the trade double in size over the past few years. Alteration is unvarying. Wincanton's Business Alignment Team has been vital in serving it understand, not only the precedence of the IT function's internal consumers but also exterior customer priorities. And as Wincanton harmonize its present business replica with infill acquisitions and endeavor into new geographies it ensures that Wincanton has a reliable and suitable model for our IT organization.
One of Wincanton's vital projects is the "One Wincanton" program which assists to distinguish it from the opposition. It focuses on Wincanton's internal customs, but also four 'operating principles', which Wincanton calls the "Four Pillars", which are equipped brilliance, customer intimacy, product leadership and value.
Operational brilliance seeks to bring nonstop enhancement within Wincanton's operating processes. Group IT helps to product headship by budding and supporting the logistical products and services provided to Wincanton consumers.
Most likely the hardest region to deal with from an IT perspective is significance because Wincanton is running a bequest estate. If Wincanton was starting from scratch it'd have much decreased costs. Wincanton has a revolutionize program to educate the business so that it maintains to get the support it needs.
Wincanton has freshly drafted its Group Environmental Strategy following a year long program of research and planning.

IT can help in numerous key areas and Wincanton has a three-year roadmap of priorities.

This, together with other power decrease initiatives in Wincanton's data centers, will appreciably decrease its power utilization.

When Wincanton virtualized that server environment and migrate onto a new, single warehouse management system application we will reduce down to around 20 servers. The power, support attempt and space savings this will deliver will more than disburse for the transition costs concerned in migrating to the new strategic solution.
