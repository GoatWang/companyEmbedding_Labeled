R.VINE VOICEon August 9, 2013Verified PurchaseI placed my order for this new LEGO Architecture Studio set the first day it was available (good thing too, as it looks like Amazon sold out in less than a week). And I've been waiting a week to get my hands on it. Now I've got the whole week-end to play with it.OK, I know what most people want to hear...What is in the box:1210 LEGO pieces (and no, I haven't actually counted them - yet) in 16 plastic bags. Two clear plastic trays each with four sections (each section is 2 3/4" x 5" x 1"). And the "Create your own architecture" book, which is 271 pages (8" x 7 1/4" x 1) - printed on fairly heavy paper stock.The book was the first thing I pulled out and started browsing. Haven't read it completely through - but it appears to be a brief but well laid out introduction to architecture, as well as a guide for getting starting with building things with the LEGOs. Lots of pictures and lots of drawings. There are also a number of tips to get different effects using some of the special pieces in the set - like making windows look inset into a wall. I can say that I will definitely be spending some time going through this book.Given the number and variety of pieces you get with this set, there should be enough combinations to make just about anything that I can imagine. But, keep in mind - this set isn't intended to build large scale models like the other sets in the Architecture series - it's to explore shapes and design layouts.  Also, while there are a number of pieces that will allow you to add a bit of detail to what you build - this set is more for creating a conceptual design. Except for some clear transparent pieces, the whole of the set is white pieces. There are 1,210 pieces in this set - but a lot of them are small pieces. I plan on buying at least a couple packs of the black & dark gray 1x1 bricks just to be able to add a little contrast when I need it.To end, I would like to remind people that the box of this set states that it's for ages 16+. I would not recommend buying it for someone younger. Well, not unless they have some interest in architecture. This is the set that I would have wanted back when I was a kid - but that's me.LEGO Architecture StudioRead more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFantastic Lego SetByRocko Aon August 28, 2013Verified PurchaseThe Lego Architecture Studio set is by far one of the most mature sets Lego has produced to date. Consisting of only white blocks of all sizes, clear "glass" blocks, and an idea book, this set is meant to help foster creativity and drive the builder towards new, innovative constructions. The book is a wonderful overview of architectural ideas throughout the ages and is worth a few reads. I wish it had a brick separator, but that's my only complaint.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsMy daughter loves this set!ByNarsilon January 3, 2014Verified PurchaseMy 15 year old daughter's favorite legos are the buildings, the houses and such. We got her this set for Christmas and she has been reading through the very thick book and trying out the various building techniques to get differing results. I wish it came with more pieces, though. You can build a wide variety of structural elements but nothing very large.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsvery nice!ByRoman Frolovon April 27, 2014Verified PurchaseThe set is very nice - pure creativity in a box :-)Me and my girlfriend (who is an architect) - we enjoy it a lot! The book, the peaces - everything is top quality.Only one thing disappointed us - the "pinkish" color of the peaces. I don't know why, but LEGO made some of them "clear bright white" and some of them "milky white". Most of the time you don't notice it, until direct sunlight falls or until you connect two differently colored peaces.But otherwise it's the coolest toy I every had!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSo many pieces, but a good Lego set overallByG. Wuon November 22, 2013Verified PurchaseThis is an amazing set for people that are looking to dig into architecture. Be warned that this is not a traditional Lego set and that it does not include building instructions. The kids (~10 years old) have only had this for a week and were overwhelmed with all the pieces. It might be a little much considering the set also says it's for 16+, but they're still having a blast with it. I plan to spend some time with them and try to build some model houses.Read more0Comment|

This do-it-yourself Architectural Studio is a one-of-a-kind (Buy two of these) LEGO fun set.  Why?  You can create Architectural structures of any kind with these pieces and teaches you shapes, concepts and more!!  A real must for Achitectural students studying aesthetics and design theory.

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the white is not as pure white as I expected and doesn't match up to other Lego I have, it is visibly off white. The book is fantastic.Read more0Comment|

Made for any adult who grew up with Legos.  Gave this to my son for his birthday.  He just started building without referring to any book or directions. I would love to buy one for myself but this is a stretch of the budget. Searching two months to find this.  Sold out through Lego co. so I found it on Amazon.  Payed a bit more than original price but this lego set is worth every penny.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Building Sets from Amazon.comIntroduced early in life, the love of learning can last for years and years. The building sets from Amazon.com help girls and boys learn how to set goals, plan ahead and overcome challenges. You’ll be amazed at the things kids can think of and then create using even the simplest building blocks. 
From advanced LEGO sets to larger and simpler DUPLO blocks and Megabloks, we have something perfect for every age level. Build castles, pillboxes, racecars, barns and more. Building sets never get old, you can always take old creations apart and keep building and rebuilding an infinite possibility of machines, buildings and vehicles. 
If you want a little more direction, Amazon.com offers plenty of specific building sets to recreate the Space Needle, the Empire State Building, the Guggenheim Museum, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater, and more. It’s a great way to study modern architectural design and engineering while having a blast. The completed building sets of local land marks look great on office desks or at home.   
We have building sets for almost anything you can imagine, including Ferris wheels, roller coasters, the White House, Transformers, spooky graveyards and scenes from your favorite adventure movies. Our Tegu blocks also make a great office desk toy to help you decompress before or after difficult meetings. These building blocks are made with just magnets and high-quality natural woods; they’ll look beautiful lying around when they’re not in use.

Building sets can begin a lifelong hobby of construction and engineering. They help you develop reasoning and planning skills that are invaluable to your daily life. If you’re looking for a way to spend more time with your kids, building sets could be the perfect solution.

				PHILOSOPHY

Design is the arrangement of a series of goals into tangible forms. Kono Designs communicates concept through function and materiality.

The essential principles of design overarch all its disciplines, from architecture and environmental design, to product and graphic design. The essence of design spans every sphere of life.

When design unites the twin goals of improving life and business practice, it engenders beauty and crosses the boundaries of time to take on a life of its own.




				PROFILE

Born and raised in Japan, Yoshimi Kono studied architecture in Tokyo. He was a chief designer with Shigeru Uchida at Studio 80 in Tokyo and later became partner at Vignelli Associates in New York.

He founded Kono Designs in January 2000, a practice active in architecture, interior design, corporate identity, graphics and product design. Examples of his work have appeared in numerous national and international publications including Abitare, Interni, Domus, Casa Vogue, Hinge, Interiors, Interior Design, and ID Magazine. He has won several awards including the 2001 Kitchen & Bath Business Product Innovator Awards for Hardware, the 1994 DDA award from the Japan Display Design Association, the 1994 and 1997 Award of Excellence from the Japan Sign Design Association, the 1995 Award for Best Design from the Japan Typography Association, the 2001, 2005 and 2011 Nikkei New Office Award from the New Office Promotion Association, the 2011 Promotion Award from Japan Facility Management Association and the 2013 Architizer A+ Awards.
