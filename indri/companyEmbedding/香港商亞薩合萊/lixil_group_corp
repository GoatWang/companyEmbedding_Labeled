Shaping the Future of Faucets, One 3D Layer at a Time
For a designer, there is nothing more exciting than being asked to remove all constraints, ignore all the conventions, and explore new frontiers offered by a cutting-edge manufacturing technique ― in this case: 3D printing.






Bathed in Culture and Tradition
It is said that the Japanese love to bathe. From places to cleanse the body and mind, to spaces where people have gathered to socialize and recuperate, Japan's bathing culture and baths have developed in a unique way...







LIVING CULTURE

LIXIL's history can be traced back over 100 years to when its predecessors first combined a fixation for design and color, a passion for craftsmanship, and an understanding of the properties of clay to produce one of Japan's first ceramic tiles for the home.

The gravity of the situation has elevated the topic to the top of the global agenda. Last year, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the problem with Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates during talks over a climate change deal...







LIXIL's AQUA CERAMIC makes bathroom stains a thing of the pastOct 21, 2016
One hundred years is a long time, by any measure. During the century ahead of us we can expect countless unforeseen events to occur. By the same token, we can take comfort in the knowledge that certain things will not happen. Anyone who has purchased one of LIXIL's latest SATIS model lavatories, for example, will not have needed to worry about it staying clean during those 100 years...

HERITAGE & INSPIRATION     AMERICAN STANDARD   Inax   Tostem   Sunwave   Toex       PHILOSOPHY     LIXIL WORLDWIDE     WHY LIXIL              AMERICAN STANDARD     American Standard has been providing homes with quality bathroom products for over a century. Every product is sourced with the best raw materials, equipped with the latest technology and manufactured in state-of-the-art facilities. This means American Standard products are fixtures of beauty and functionality that will last you for years to come.        our milestones    January 8th, 1872    The Beginning   John Pierce buys a tinwork shop in Massachusetts for $2,800..  John Bartlett Pierce         1875    Arrott And Torrance Form Standard Manufacturing Company   Two Irish immigrants, James Arrott and Francis Torrance, bought a bankrupt kitchenware factory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and begin making cast-iron water closets, washstands and bathtubs. They named their new company Standard Manufacturing.       1892    WOOLLEY LEADS MAJOR MERGER BETWEEN THREE COMPANIES   New general manager Woolley helps facilitates merger between Michigan Radiator, Detroit Radiator and the Pierce Steam Heating Company. The new company is called American Radiator Company       1897    AMERICAN RADIATOR PURCHASES BRITISH COMPANY   American Radiator purchases Britian's Ideal Boiler Company. The company manufactures round cast-iron boilers as well as sectional and square boilers.       1899    American Radiator Corners Heating Market   By consolidating many smaller, independent radiator companies, American Radiator bought virtually the entire heating equipment industry under the American Radiator name with the assistance of legendary financier J.P. Morgan. This leads AR to become the world's largest supplier of heating equipment.       1899    More Mergers   Out of the merger between Ahrens & Ott Manufacturing, Dawes & Myler Manufacturing and six additional smaller firms, Standard Sanitary Manufacturing is formed. Ahrens becomes president.       1899    Going Public   Both Standard Manufacturing Company and American Radiator become public companies.       1901    CREATION LEADS TO DOMINATION   After creating a one-piece bathtub, Standard Sanitary becomes the largest supplier of plumbing goods in the world       1904    Standard Manufacturing Opens Showrooms   Standard Manufacturing opens showrooms to augment its consumer and trade advertising.       1913    Standard Sanitary Purchases Company   Standard Sanitary acquires the Great Western Pottery Company.       1921    Arcola Radiator Boiler   The Institute of Thermal Research, founded by Woolley during the war, creates the Arcola Radiator Boiler which could heat every room in a house and use alternative fuels to coal and oil.  Clarence Woolley         1929    Acid Resistant Enamel   Due in part to the creation of acid resisting enamel, Standard Sanitary breaks with tradition and shows how the bathroom could be both beautiful and utilitarian. Fixtures and furniture were now offered in more stylish and colorful options.       1929    Standard Sanitary Introduces The 'Standard' Electric Dishwasher   The 'Standard' Electric Dishwasher and Sink combination offers many state of the art features in kitchen appliances. The dishwasher washes and rinses dishes with clean hot water while the sink is made with the new acid-resisting enamel. It also comes with a whipping device for eggs and cream and a garbage container.       1929    TWO GIANTS MERGE   American Radiator and Standard Sanitary merge to become American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corporation. It takes another 10 years for the two companies to fully integrate       1934    Neo-Angle Bath Is Introduced To The Public   The Neo-Angle bath became the top choice of builders when it was introduced.       1946    AR & SS BEGINS COATING BATHTUBS   AR & SS begins coating hot iron bathtubs with enamel. This is done when a worker pounds the enamel with a rawhide hammer to make sure it adheres to the iron tub.       1948    A NEW NAME   Showing that the two companies are beginning to see themselves as one, American Radiator & Standard Sanitary begins to refer to itself as American-Standard.       1960    AMERICAN-STANDARD UNVEILS 'PUSH AND PULL'   The 'push and pull' faucet gives a modern look to bathrooms and kitchens.       1965    SKID RESISTANT BATHTUB IS INTRODUCED   The skid resistant bathtub is introduced in response to consumer demands for better safety.       1980    CERAMIC DISC VALVE TECHNOLOGY IS INTRODUCED   American Standard patents its ceramic disc valve technology which keeps faucets drip-free with smooth handle performance for a lifetime of use.       1983    Established in Indonesia   Established PT American Standard Indonesia.       1984    ESTABLISHED IN KOREA   Established Hua Mei Sanitary Ware Co.Ltd, the first plant in China Established American Standard Korea Inc.       1987    AMERICAST® IS INTRODUCED   Americast® is introduced as a lightweight enameled alternative to cast iron for bathtubs and kitchen sinks. The new material provides the durability of cast iron without the weight.       1992    PORCHER JOINS AMERICAN STANDARD   Porcher, Inc., a French-based company, joins American Standard's family of plumbing products. This union opens up new product collections of luxury European designs.       1994    ESTABLISHED IN VIETNAM   Established American Standard Vietnam Inc.       1994    AMERICAN STANDARD GAINS STRENGTH IN CHINA   American Standard becomes the largest foreign producer of toilets and faucets in China.
