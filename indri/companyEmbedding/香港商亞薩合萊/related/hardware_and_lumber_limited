M&N Hardware is a family-operated business that has been thriving since 1999.  At inception, the company had only two (2) full-time employees, with a limited product range to service the residents of Hope, St. Andrews and a few surrounding communities.  After the first year in business and a growing client base the company decided to increase its product range to fully serve, not only, Hope and the rural communities but the entire island.
In 2012, the company continued expanding its business by adding additional products and services, and manufacturing equipment which is housed and operating in its newly state of the art building adjoining to the current premises. Today M&N is recognized as the: “ONE-STOP SHOP FOR HARDWARE AND BUILDING MATERIALS” for best prices, free island-wide delivery, choice, style and superior customer service.  Providing service to over 1000 customers per year, through its walk-in retail store and offers the convenience of home delivery for bulky, high valued items.

About



For as long as Jamaicans have owned homes, they have longed to improve 
them, through remodels renovations and decoration. Additionally, with 
the proliferation of cable TV, TV shows such as "Extreme Makeover", "Trading Spaces" and "Design on a Dime",
Jamaicans are rolling up their sleeves on weekends in an attempt to 
have their homes looking like a classic TV masterpiece! We at Rapid>True Value
pride ourselves on always staying ahead of the curve in the game of 
one-stop shopping and will fulfill your project requirement all under 
one roof!!

How we came about

In 2004, Hardware & Lumbe inherited Jamaica's leading hardware/home improvement retail brands of 
Rapid Sheffield, H & L True Value, Carib Enterprise and Colour 
Choice. H & L set out to consolidate its market position, with the 
objective of creating a universal brand for its fourteen retail stores 
islandwide.


On October 1, 2005, H&L True Value stores were re-branded, and the company formally introduced its new retail identity RAPID TRUE VALUE to Jamaica.

Lumber, paint, hardware, plumbing, lawn and garden supplies, 
	electrical supplies, lighting fixtures, windows, doors, sanitary ware, 
	stationery, house wares and appliances all under one roof. 
We offer the latest in kitchen and bathroom trends. 
Our fabricators are professionally trained to fabricate or refurbish your residential/commercial kitchen or bathroom with Wilsonart surfaces available in laminates or Gibraltar solid surfaces. 
Our Fabrication Department is ready and able to supply and install 
	the kitchen of your dreams - just come in to any of our stores, make 
	your choice from the wide range of Wilsonart laminates or Gibraltar solid surfaces, choose your counter top and cabinet designs, and we will do the rest!

attention to details, quality that outlasts, affordable prices and 
service that keeps projects going like clockwork. We will continue to
