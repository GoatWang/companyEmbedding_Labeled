Mercor offer is enriched by another new product. It is a flexible roll-up door mcr EBR with fire resistance class EI 120. The maximum dimension of this fire partition is 15 x 6 meters.

"Products which combine a couple of qualities essential for the user, such as e.g. high fire resistance class, optimum space management, simple assembling of fire partition in the wall, advanced mechanical resistance, and - last but not least - an acceptable price, are more and more wanted among our customers", Ms Beata Zgrajka, Commercial Manager, Department of Fire Partitions at Mercor SA, says. "Flexible roll-up door, a brand-new item in our portfolio, is the result of the attempts to meet such market expectations ", Beata Zgrajka, adds. 

mcr EBR 120, i.e. flexible roll-up door, has acquired a technical approval from the Building Research Institute in Warsaw in June this year. From the functional point of view, the product combines the best qualities of two products from our fire partitions portfolio: it is as reliable as the steel-armour roll-up door and almost as lightweight as the draft curtain made of special fabric.

"mcr EBR is a new-generation proposal which, if required, may substitute our mcr Rollfire steel door and mcr Profire curtain. The new product offers the guarantee of fire resistance and insulating integrity according to EI 120 Class, i.e. up to two hours; simultaneously, it is definitely lighter than a steel product and less expensive, which is essential for our customers ", Beata Zgrajka, recapitulates.

It is worth mentioning that the customers have been interested in this novel solution since its opening presentation. On the day mcr EBR was commercialised, it had already found its way to several investment projects, among them a new Nanotechnology Centre building at the Gdansk Technical University, a building designed by Arch Deco, a famous Gdansk-based design studio.
