Environmental Chemicals Management
The MISUMI Group views protection of the environment as a key management issue, and is steadily advancing environmental efforts.
Against the background of the European Union's RoHS Directive restricting the use of hazardous substances, the green procurement efforts of our domestic and overseas customers are gradually spreading in the market. At the MISUMI Group, we conduct examinations to determine the quantities of chemical substances contained in machine parts, and have established a management system for the non-use or reduction of regulated substances.


Environment-Conscious Products

Interest in reducing the environmental load is increasing globally, and the MISUMI Group is also experiencing a stronger interest on the part of our customers in environment-conscious products. One example of our response to such customer needs is our non-halogen-type cable (electrical wiring). Non-halogen-type cable does not produce harmful halogen gases even when the cable is incinerated upon disposal, and its use is expected to grow in the future. We currently carry not only the MISUMI brand product, but also VONA products, so our selection continues to expand.
The MISUMI Group will continue to make efforts to expand its product lineup as the use of environment-conscious products become more popular.


Environment-Friendly Products (examples) : Non-halogen-type cable (electrical wiring)




Managing Environmental Chemical Substances

Controls over environmental chemical substances are tightening each year under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in Europe and similar directives in China, as well as REACH in Europe. The MISUMI Group recognizes that compliance with RoHS is an important factor in a customer’s product selection and is responding accordingly in the marketplace. As such, the MISUMI Group has been testing product contents on the basis of RoHS and REACH, and discloses RoHS directive compliance in our catalogs and on our website.

Green Procurement Guidelines

MISUMI has formulated Green Procurement Guidelines to observe the legal restrictions and other requirements concerning environmental chemicals and to help build up a recycling society, and we are advancing green procurement activities. By preparing Green Procurement Guidelines and continuously striving to improve our environmental preservation and environmental chemicals management activities, we seek to eliminate environmental chemicals from our products. We ask our customers and business partners for their cooperation with these efforts.

MISUMI USA is a subsidiary of MISUMI Corporation, established in February 1988.[1] MISUMI USA is known for providing fixed and configurable components for the manufacturing industry,[2] and is headquartered in Schaumburg, IL.[3]

History[edit]
MISUMI Corporation was founded in 1963 under the name MISUMI Shoji Co., Ltd. In the early years of its founding, the company focused primarily on the sale of electronic equipment and bearings, as well as press die components.
Throughout its first 25 years, MISUMI Corp continued to establish regional presences across Japan. In order to better-serve the American market, MISUMI Corp established a subsidiary, MISUMI USA, in February 1988.[4]
Current Business Model[edit]
Today, MISUMI USA supplies over 16 million different configurable components for assembly automation in the automotive, appliance, semi-conductor, medical, and packaging industries, with over 30,000 products available for same-day shipping.[5] MISUMI promotes that it bears no minimum order requirements or set-up charges, allowing greater flexibility in ordering for small companies and individuals.[6] MISUMI USA is known for its QCT (Quality, Cost, Time) model, fulfilled by catalog sales of standardized products, along with piece-by-piece production of customizable products.[7] MISUMI has operated under the leadership of Co-CEOs, Tadashi Saegusa and Masayuki Takaya, since June 2002.[8] Beginning that year, the new management implemented a series of reforms including the following:

Discontinuing Diversified Business Model: MISUMI chose to return to its core business of precision mechanical industrial components for die-and-mold and factory-automation applications only, and cut ties with all subsidiaries that did not align closely to this core practice.
Expanding Overseas: To extend the QCT model abroad, MISUMI began building out infrastructure including sales offices, logistics centers, and manufacturing sites in each new market entered.
Acquiring SUGURA SEIKI: In acquiring this development and manufacturing company, MISUMI brought manufacturing in-house.[9]
Delegating Authority Across the Organization: In 2007, MISUMI brought the concept of “small is beautiful” to its operating companies, organizing its business into small autonomous teams responsible for sales, product development, manufacturing, and sales.

Currently, MISUMI is aggressively pursuing sales and operating income records year over year, in conjunction with continued global expansion and partnerships across industry verticals.[10] MISUMI USA consists of a local suppliers network including Sugura USA in Addison, Illinois, along with its own distribution centers near Chicago O’Hare Airport and in Torrance, CA.[11]
In November 2012, MISUMI acquired the Dayton Lamina Corporation, a company known for press die components, with brands including Dayton Progress, Lamina, Danly, IEM, and Lempco. Beginning August 2015, Dayton Lamina began the manufacture of MISUMI Brand die components in Ohio.
As of 2017, MISUMI operates 24 Manufacturing facilities, 13 Distribution Centers, and 61 Sales Offices around the globe.
Environmental & Social Contributions[edit]
MISUMI’s products are compliant with the European Union’s RoHS Directive, restricting the use of hazardous substances. As innovations in green production, MISUMI has developed equipment cables with superior oil and heat resistance, as well as combined terminal blocks and components. As part of a green procurement initiative, MISUMI also mandates that its suppliers comply with a strict set of guidelines, including a chemical substances survey and report.[12] In January 2014, MISUMI embarked on an initiative to enhance workplace safety by introducing a new nitrogen gas spring to the North American market.[13]
MISUMI offers a University Partnership program which provides discounts and sponsorships to students in the United States and Canada for senior design and competition projects. This program began in 2012 and is currently active in over 50 colleges and universities.
Beginning in 2016, MISUMI became a Silver Level Supplier for FIRST Robotics, an international high school robotics competition.
