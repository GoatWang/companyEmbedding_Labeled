Providing Solutions for the 4 Most Critical Production Site Needs




 







We make your competitive edge stronger.
In step with globalization, high productivity rivaling factories in emerging countries is in demand. With the focus now on enhancing the efficiency, centralized management and production flexibility of production sites at home and abroad, the demand for equipment utilization rates at overseas production sites is growing.
			At MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, we propose tools and parts for realizing shorter processes in the product development cycle from the initial development phase. In production process phases, we support greater production site visibility and propose current status analysis. We then share any frontline issues with customers, provide data offering hints at how to improve and innovate, and propose engineering for achieving these changes, thereby contributing to a stronger competitive edge for our customers. 






 







In pursuit of customer trust and satisfaction.
Guided by “Trust” as our corporate philosophy, we pursue customer trust and satisfaction, working hard to showcase the kinds of functions customers have come to expect, always with their perspective in mind. To put this philosophy into practice, we developed an ISO 9001 management system within the Engineering Division, and promote ongoing improvement activities.
			To continue to provide high-quality finished products, MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES conducts its own proprietary audit of manufacturers. Additionally, to help improve quality, we do everything from providing performance and durability evaluation equipment at the initial development phase to providing tools for determining current status and improvement activities during the production phase.  






 







We promote activities for reducing environmental load. 
With balance between the environment, companies and people in mind, every member of our workforce takes action to ensure MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES is a company that protects the natural environment vital to all of us and earns society's trust through environmental protection activities. 
			Our contribution spans many areas. For initiatives designed to reduce customers' environmental load, we propose basic materials at the product development phase and inspection systems for development evaluation; furthermore, during the production phase, our efforts include proposing devices for energy efficiency and rationalization, ways for efficient energy usage, as well as the collaborative development of recycling systems.  






 







Safety takes priority above all else.
Safety is the highest priority before all else. We recognize proposing and providing products and services that function safely and can be used reliably as our responsibility, and take action together with customers guided by this directive. 
			When it comes to construction work, we promote a smooth construction process by establishing a system for managing safety, sanitation and environmental impact, moving from the start to conduct risk assessment and head off potential disasters, accidents and environmental pollution. By creating safe customer workplace environments and introducing new technologies in line with future considerations, we propose the creation of even safer facilities. 






 



 






Strengths Supporting Our Business Model






Building Proprietary Systems and Knowhow Supporting Japanese Manufacturing Domestically and Globally




 
Over many years in business, MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES has built a strong record of success through relationships of trust cultivated with many of Japan's best-known companies. We view the experiential knowledge and confidence gained in the process as assets that are now major strengths. Ultimately, our expertise and firsthand knowledge-backed by the solid relationships of trust we have built-are the sources of the high-added-value solutions that MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES delivers.
 
 





Trusted Supplier Network






MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES has sophisticated functions that place it in the top class of trading companies in FA electrical machinery. We have a powerful pipeline with many of Japan's best-known FA equipment makers, with a structure in place capable of supplying an array of outstanding products from some 2,000 companies. Beyond the delivery of these products to production sites, we boast unbeatable product capabilities and a handling scale that enable MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES to meet every conceivable client need, including inspection and analysis equipment for R&D divisions. 


 









Boasting the Industry's Largest Engineering Team





Boasting the Industry's Largest Engineering Team 
Since our founding, we have leveraged deep experience and results over our long history to build a base of advanced technologies that can answer all production site issues and needs. The engineering team supporting our technological capabilities has a structure in place that, when development, design, manufacturing, SE and SI are combined, proudly gives it the largest scale in the industry. 







Supporting Japanese Manufacturing Worldwide





MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIESs flexibly strengthens, enhances and enlarges its network in line with customer needs. Today, we are opening bases outside of Japan in the U.S., the U.K, Chin and Thailand. We have organic ties to each base, allowing for meticulous attention to customer needs as we robustly support customers in the launch of overseas production sites and facility expansion and establishment. 






 





1-Day Delivery to Meet Strict Customer Delivery Schedules






With “fast” and “accurate” as basic policies in distribution, we help shrink manufacturing lead times at production sites and reduce procurement costs. Our distribution center in Nagoya, Japan, plays a central role here. All goods for delivery are first consolidated at the distribution center. Through collaboration with logistics centers in every region of the country, we deliver ordered products to customers across Japan, making “1-Day Delivery” a reality. Furthermore, we build distribution service systems, and take steps to enhance both distribution quality and service efficiency.  


 









In-house Production Sites for Meeting Customization Needs






Beyond the sale of FA equipment in use at customers’ manufacturing facilities, another trait of MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES is engineering functions that upgrade these systems and meet customer needs. To take these engineering functions to an even higher level, our in-house design and manufacturing departments take the lead in the development and manufacture of processes and special products tailored to individual customer needs, and the development of proprietary brand products with functions and quality not found in general-use products. These and other advantages set MEIJI ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES apart as even more distinct.
