Overview
On overseas subsidiaries
Having previously operated only in Japan, Trusco Nakayama Corporation established TRUSCO NAKAYAMA CORPORATION (THAILAND) LIMITED in February 2011 and TRUSCO NAKAYAMA CORPORATION (INDONESIA) LIMITED in September 2015. In recent years, Japanese companies have established important production bases in Thailand and Indonesia. These countries are very attractive markets for Trusco Nakayama Corporation, whose mission is to do everything it can to contribute to the development of manufacturing.
The business of these overseas subsidiaries is wholesale, which is the same as our business in Japan. They supply products to the market through our distributors. Their basic strategy is the same as our strategy in Japan: promptly deliver the products needed at manufacturing sites. The subsidiaries in Thailand and Indonesia have inventory, and are enhancing their product lineup and system to deliver products as quickly as possible.
We are building a system to ship products ordered and products to replenish stock at a high level of frequency. Through this system, products are procured from local suppliers and from shipments by air and by sea from the distribution center of Trust Nakayama Corporation, the parent company. In our day-to-day operations, we support manufacturing by shipping the necessary goods in the quantities needed, when they are needed.
Markets in Thailand and Indonesia
Thailand possesses important production bases in the auto industry and the electronics industry. However, given the rising labor costs and labor shortage, the manufacturing facilities in these industries are expected to be moved to neighboring countries. Manufacturers will likely maintain their main production bases in Thailand, supplementing their production with production in neighboring countries. We expect Thailand to play a central role in the region.
In Indonesia, manufacturers, especially auto manufacturers, are extremely eager to establish facilities. However, there are few production tool dealers with inventory in Indonesia. In this environment, we believe that we will be able to contribute to the development of manufacturing in the country, making the most of the logistics system that we developed in Japan.
At manufacturing sites in Thailand and Indonesia, inventory management and the calculated placement of orders are challenging tasks, and there is growing demand in these countries to ship the necessary goods in the quantities needed, when they are needed. These countries present untapped markets we find to be very attractive.

With a focus on the automobile industry, the subsidiary is expanding its business in Thailandﾕs fast-growing manufacturing field based on experience developed in Japan. As with Trusco Nakayama in Japan, the Thai subsidiary aims to become a company that proves useful to Thai monozukuri manufacturing based on the cornerstones of catalogue publication, inventory retention and distribution systems.
