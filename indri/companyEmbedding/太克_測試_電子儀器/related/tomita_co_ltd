We do contribute to all over the world by unique technology & product,
      from Naruto regional origin in Japan.


























In 1893, Tomita Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. became the first company in Japan to manufacture magnesium carbonate from seawater. Since then, we have been contributing to the development of the inorganic chemical industry in Japan through our efforts in Research & Development and through our technological innovation, based on our philosophy:

Better Products, Healthier World

We have become a major manufacturer of mineral salts by supplying pharmaceutical raw materials such as injectable APIs, antacids, and excipients in addition to food additives for mineral supplements. Moreover, in the last two decades, we have also become the leading manufacturer of dry granulated dialysate.

For advanced formulation design, we have developed original products such as high liquid absorbency and multifunctional calcium silicate, and high quality calcium products for biomaterial, and, introduce these products to the global market.

      Looking to the future, based on our philosophy, we will endeavor to contribute to the world’s health, and human society, by continuing to provide high quality products and services.
