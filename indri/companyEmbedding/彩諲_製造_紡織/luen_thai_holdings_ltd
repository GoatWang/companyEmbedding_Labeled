The Group is principally engaged in the manufacturing and trading of apparels and accessories, the provision of freight forwarding and logistics services and real estate development. 
Performance for the year:
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group’s production volume decreased by approximately 18.0% to 91 million units of apparel and accessories while the Group’s revenue (including continuing operations and discontinued operations) amounted to approximately US$992,807,000, representing a year-on-year decrease of 10.8% or approximately US$120,644,000. 
Business Summary:
Segmental Review
Apparel and Accessories businesses represented the Group’s most significant source of revenue, which accounted for approximately 67.7% and 30.0% respectively of the Group’s total revenue for the year under review.  
Continuing Operations
During the year, the Casual and Fashion Apparel Division (including the previous Life-style Apparel Division and excluding the business of retail sales and trading of apparel and accessories) recorded a segment profit of approximately US$5,587,000 as compared to a segment profit of approximately US$6,014,000 in 2015. The decrease in segment profit is mainly due to the write off of intangible asset amounted to approximately US$7,145,000 as mentioned above. 
The Sweaters Division has reported a segment loss of approximately US$1,134,000 for 2016, representing a decrease of approximately US$4,799,000 when compared to that of 2015, which is mainly due to the decline in revenue and the impairment loss and write off of intangible assets amounted to approximately US$3,348,000 as mentioned under the section headed “Result Review”. 
The Accessories Division (excluding the business of footwear manufacturing) has reported a segment profit of approximately US$14,395,000, representing a decrease of approximately US$2,865,000 when compared to the corresponding last year. The decrease was due mainly to the start-up losses of computer bags in Cambodia. 
Discontinued Operations
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the result of the Group from discontinued operations was principally derived from the following non-core businesses. 
(i) Retail sales and trading of apparels and accessories
The business of retail sales and trading of apparel and accessories was commenced in late 2015, which incurred a loss of approximately US$5,768,000 for the year under review.   
(ii) Footwear manufacturing
The business of footwear manufacturing recorded a loss of approximately US$5,584,000 for the year under review, representing an increase of approximately 86.6% over 2015. 
(iii) Logistics
The Group’s freight forwarding and logistics services recorded a segment profit of approximately US$3,663,000 for the year under review, representing an increase of approximately 21.8% over 2015. The net profit of the freight forwarding and logistics services after minority interest is approximately US$3,610,000. 
(iv) Real Estate
Real Estate Division represents our real estate project jointly operated with Sunshine 100 Real Estate Group Co., Limited in Qingyuan, China. For the year under review, the Real Estate Division has reported a segment profit of approximately US$1,048,000, representing a decrease of approximately US$275,000, as compared to a segment profit of approximately US$1,323,000 for the last corresponding year. 
(v) Disposal Properties
For the year under review, the disposal properties recorded an immaterial net loss of approximately US$63,000. 
Prospects:
The operating environment of the manufacturing industry would remain challenging. Facing the tough retail environment and the challenge of the growth of online stores, most of the Group’s  customers including brands and department stores are struggling. Brands are under significant pressure of reduction in costs and inventory while looking at shorter lead time and lower cost of production. As a manufacturer, investment in vertical setup, smart factory and performance fabric could be a possible solution to these challenges. The Group is investing into the Group’s  “future factory” in Cebu with focus on innovation, automation and integrating waterless fabric dyeing technology to shorten the Group’s  delivery lead time and enhance the Group’s competitiveness going forward. 
With the joining of new Directors with innovative ideas and different business views in February 2017, the management is now reassessing and reviewing the existing operations and simultaneously exploring new business opportunities. For the apparel manufacturing, the Group has invested in a printing factory in the Philippines which can shorten the Group’s  delivery lead time and hence enhance the Group’s competitiveness in certain print related apparel production. 
The Board also believes that after the disposal of non-core businesses and focusing on its core businesses, the Company will be gaining momentum and moving towards a promising future. The Group  will unceasingly search for various investments and business opportunities that fit in the Group’s  new business strategy so that the Group  can bring benefits to the Company for its sustainable growth and strive to increase the return of the Group’s  shareholders.   Information from the financial statements of listed companiesLast Update: 2017/07/07             Related News        LUEN THAI (00311.HK) Buys 5% Remaining Stake in Sweater Mfg Subsidiary with US$1.65M     LUEN THAI Tan Cho Lung Succeeds as CEO      LUEN THAI (00311.HK) Annual Net Profit US$18.47M; Final Div US0.254 Cents      LUEN THAI Changes CEO      LUEN THAI Offeror Receives Acceptances for 74.5% Stakes; Public Float Below Min.
