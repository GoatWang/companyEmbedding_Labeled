Hemmers-Itex

The principal Hemmers-Itex warehousing and office facility is in Nordhorn in the west of Germany, very close to the Dutch border. In addition, the Company has a Chinese subsidiary based in Shanghai.
The Company offers its customers a comprehensive range of fabrics of all qualities, and including both basic and fashion items. The customer base has traditionally been retailers and small wholesalers of fabrics destined for use in apparel or furnishings. In recent years the Company has successfully diversified, and an increasingly high proportion of sales are now to European manufacturers of ready-made items.
A particular strength of Hemmers-Itex is the detailed knowledge of Far-Eastern textile manufacturers that has been accumulated over the years, enabling the Company to source product that matches the exacting quality and price requirements of the competitive market in which it operates.
