Cool Electronics Tips & Terminology Electronic gadgets will sometimes come with confusing technical specifications... and you may need to understand these to be able to compare similar gadget products. Here are some common ones you will find in our gadgets category that will help you when shopping for the best electronics gadgets: mAhmilli amp hours - the capacity of a rechargeable battery. The bigger the number, the more powerful and long lasting the battery. SD Card / Micro SD CardThis is the standard memory card you use with your camera or phone. The the case of the much smaller Micro SD (also known as TF). If the product says SD card slot it will take any SD card you already own. Pay attention to max GB size compatibility if you are using very big storage SD cards. iOSThis means Apple's Operating System for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Appliances which are compatible with iOS Apps will work with all those products. Car charger/car power socketAll vehicles have that standard "cigarette lighter" power socket. With this you can plug power cables into your car gadgets. It's a standard 12V on all vehicles so don't worry about compatibility. If you are charging/powering many electronic appliances from one car socket, buy a good car accessory power splitter.

Don't worry about electrical power compatibility One of the most commonly asked question is about mains electrical compatibility. Every American has experienced the frustration of trying to use 110V chargers overseas. and having concern when plugging into 240V mains sockets. So a lot of customers wonder if "Chinese" electronics are somehow on a strange foreign system that is not compatible. Well, not at all - first of all, the whole of China is on standard 220-240V mains electricity. It also uses EU and UK type plugs everywhere. Although we would not go so far to say electrical plugs in China are standard - much like many other things here.  All Chinavasion devices with mains power adapters will work in all countries. And Chinavasion offers all mains charger cables in EU plug type, and we provide you a free travel plug adapter for USA, UK, or Australian standards. According to your delivery order address. All our adapters are capable of working in both 110V and 240V regions (auto switching) unless indicated otherwise. We can offer further customization of power adapter and plug types on electronics for bulk wholesale buyers on inquiry. What influences gadget prices? When comparing prices on electronic gadgets you may find similar products with different price points. The most common reasons for this are that newly released, tech items will usually be more expensive than lower specification or older products. Bigger screens, more connectors, wireless capabilities, bigger storage, batteries, and extra accessories are mean higher prices. Which is good news if you are a business retailer or drop shipper seeking value to promote when reselling these Chinavasion products. Keep up with the latest technology gadgetsChinavasion aims to add new products to the catalog each working day. Keep an eye on our New Products page for the latest gadget releases. You can subscribe to our newsletter to make sure you never miss a big launch.  Chinese gadget manufacturers are constantly closing the gap between big brand technology firms. Matching them in component quality, device speed, and quality of materials. You can look at a lot of Chinese electronics as copies. Another way to see it is that they are learning and catching up with how to produce the best electronics gadgets and quality devices.  Another trend is that more Chinese-born brands are starting to develop and increase a diverse range of new tech gadgets. China is one of the fastest developing countries in the world. It is home to many chip manufacturers so there's a real entrepreneurial and creative atmosphere. This has seen the rise and rapid development of all kinds of new tech, such as 3D video glasses, drones, 3D Printers, camera equipment and laser gadgets.

Advice for new gadget sellers If you are a retailer or drop shipper of electronic gadgets, you may need to consider selecting good titles and description keywords to attract customers. Remember people may be searching for gadget and gift keywords as well as specific product names. Don't be afraid of adding titles and keywords that match the bargain shoppers. Although we suggest that you point out the reliable quality of Chinavasion products. One more thing to remember is that geeky gadgets can give rise to technical questions before sales. As a good seller, you should answer your customer's questions promptly. To help you do this it is a good idea to get samples of what you are selling. Then you can familiarize yourself with the new technology.  Finally, it is worth mentioning that if you are advertising health devices or baby products you may need to make some clear disclaimers.
