Business Review:
Brand management
In 2016, the overall sentiment in the retail market remained sluggish. While consumers demanded for higher quality, they tended to choose products with lower prices. The Group continued to make good use of its multi-brand strategy and allocated internal resources flexibly. The Group leveraged the strengths of various brands while consolidating its signature brand, EMBRY FORM, to meet the needs of different consumers. The Group strategically cultivated the professional men’s underwear brand IVU and the affordable while fashionable brand IADORE. Both brands gained further market share in the respective target markets amid difficult business environment. Sales of the two brands recorded growth of 9.51% and 10.45%, respectively. 
The Group promoted and advertised its brands and products actively to enhance brand equity. During the Current Year, the Group participated in the 25th China International Fashion Fair, in which it showcased the excellent craftsmanship of EMBRY FORM, including the brand’s 3D cutting, seamless designs and motif art. During the China International Knitting Trade Fair (Autumn/Winter), EMBRY FORM staged the “Romantic Holidays Fashion Trend Show”, showcasing the products of EMBRY FORM, FANDECIE, IVU and LIZA CHENG, which enhanced the overall image of the Group’s brands and strengthened the influence of the brands. FANDECIE, the Group’s young and energetic lingerie brand, cooperated with a young girl group to film a music video, so as to boost its social media exposure and to reach more young consumers, which laid a better foundation for long-term brand influence. 
To cater for online shopping and needs of consumers in China, the Group constantly focused on enhancing the image of its brands on the internet during the Current Year, with a view to raising brand awareness and laying a solid foundation for its e-commerce business. In terms of online sales, the Group continued to concentrate on sales of both promotional and online exclusive products. The Group also closely monitored the changes of customer needs and market trends and developed the e-commerce market prudently. 
Sales network
In response to consumers’ cautious spending and the weak retail market, the Group focused on enhancing operating efficiency during the Current Year. The Group appropriately adjusted its retail outlets by closing or relocating stores with lower efficiency so as to enhance the overall efficiency of its sales network. As at 31 December 2016, the Group had 2,067 retail outlets in total, including 1,877 concessionary counters and 190 stores. During the Current Year, there was a net decrease of 149 retail outlets of the Group. Meanwhile, the Group’s products were also available for sale through different online platforms so as to reach out to more potential customers on the internet. 
Product design, research and development
Faced with increasingly severe market competition in the underwear industry, the Group committed to upholding high quality standards and continued to devote resources to the design, research and development of new products. The Group highlighted the characteristics of its various brands through innovation and improvement in patented designs to meet varying consumer needs. 
During the Current Year, the Group launched a variety of well-received new collections, including: EMBRY FORM’s “Sicilia Series” 「( 西西 里系列」) and “Slender and Elegant Series” 「( 纖姿雅韻系列」); FANDECIE’s “Simple Life Series” 「( 簡單生活系列」) and “British Image Series” 「( 英倫倩影系列」); COMFIT’s “Thin Cotton FIT Series” 「( 薄 棉FIT系列」) and “Seamless 3DSeries II” 「( 立體無痕II系列」); E-BRA’s “Simple Geometric Series” 「( 極簡幾何系列」) and “Fresh and Comfortable Cotton Series” (「清新舒棉系列」); IADORE’s “Floral Series” (「花香淺唱系列」) and “Blossom Series” (陌上花開系列); LIZA CHENG’s “Sweet Encounter Series” (「香遇系列」) and “Gorgeous Lace Series” (「傾城蕾絲系列」). 
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had 8 invention patents, 38 utility model patents, and 2 appearance design patents registered in China and/or other parts of the world. 
Production capacity
Over the years, most of the products were manufactured by the Group. Through the flexible deployment of manpower and machine capacity, the Group quickly responded to market demand and rapid changes in consumer preferences. The Group currently has three production bases located in Shenzhen, Jinan and Changzhou respectively. The Group has continued to examine the changes in consumption trends and regularly reviewed capacity allocation to achieve a better operating efficiency. 
The Group’s automated supply chain logistics facility which comprises an intelligent warehouse at the production base in Jinan, Shandong province commenced its trial production on 1 December 2016 as scheduled. With this facility, the Group hopes to enhance the speed of delivery and increase the deployment flexibility of resources.  
Awards
During the Current Year, various brands of the Group, namely EMBRY FORM, FANDECIE, COMFIT and LIZA CHENG were awarded “Annual Charity Award of China’s Underwear Industry”, “Annual Brand Equity Award of China’s Underwear Industry”, “Annual Innovation Award of China’s Underwear Industry” and “Annual Advancement Award of China’s Underwear Industry” respectively in China (Shenzhen) International Brand Underwear Fair. Meanwhile, the Group was also awarded the honour of “Best Market Influence” in China International Knitting Trade Fair, recognising the Group’s achievement in enhancing brand awareness of underwear enterprises in China. 
During the Current Year, the Group was granted the “National Excellent Enterprise with Foreign Investment — Excellent Tax Payment and Turnover Award” again by China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Shenzhen Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment. In addition, the Group was awarded with “Shenzhen Mayor Quality Award — Encouragement Award” and honoured as “Enterprise of Optimal Efficiency” by the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government and Zhangqiu Municipal People’s Government respectively, and was honoured the title of “Top 100 Garment Enterprises in China” by the China National Garment Association. EMBRY FORM was rated as the “Shenzhen Top Brand” by the Shenzhen Top Brand Evaluation Committee for four consecutive times, and was accredited by the Hong Kong Brand Development Council and the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong as the “Hong Kong Top Brand” for ten consecutive years. 
Prospects:
Looking ahead to 2017, uncertainties over the global economic and political environment linger. The overalleconomic outlook will hinge on various factors including Brexit progress, US President Trump’s external tradepolicy and the pace of interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. China’s manufacturing industry and export tradeare facing competition from emerging economies in Southeast Asia, while the depreciation pressure on Renminbicontinues. It is expected that the investment climate and consumer sentiment will remain cautious. The retailindustry has to pay close attention to the market and respond carefully. However, economic growth in China willremain stable. Supply-side reform will result in improved quality of consumer goods. Consumption channels willbe broadened through online retailing while consumption level will be raised on the back of China’s acceleratingurbanisation, thereby driving continued growth in China’s consumption in the long term. 
As a major brand operator in the lingerie industry in China, the Group remains cautious about its business outlookwhile closely monitoring the market conditions and adopting prudent and flexible development strategies toaddress the upcoming challenges in the market. 
In view of the uncertainties in the market, the Group willfocus on enhancing sales efficiency by planning its salesnetwork strategically. The Group will remain prudent inintegrating sales network, closing underperforming retailoutlets and adjusting the proportion of stores andconcessionary counters according to the businessenvironment and consumption level in the market and indifferent regions. The Group expects a negative growth inthe number of retail outlets in 2017. Despite the decreasein the number of net openings, the more optimal salesnetworkwill improve the overall operational efficiency inthe longterm. On the other hand, along with thecompletion of the intelligent warehouse by the end of2016, the logistics procedures of the Group are expectedto be more flexible. The Group is expected to achievebetter overall operational efficiency and the pricecompetitiveness of the Group will thereby be enhanced. 
While maintaining its price competitiveness, the Group isalso constantly committed to upholding high qualitystandards. Therefore, the Group will continue to devoteresources to product design and development and enhance its innovation capabilities in order to cater forvarious consumption levels and meet the diverseconsumer needs for product design, functionality andmaterials. 
As China’s economy becomes more developed,consumers are paying more attention to the safety ofproducts and materials. In this regard, the Group willcontinue to capitalise on its expertise in tailoring anddesign to offer healthy products of aesthetic quality. 
Despite a tough retail environment, the Group can stillstand out at the time of adversity by leveraging on itssolid business foundation, multi-brand strategy,innovative product portfolio and uncompromisingproduct quality. The Group will continue to expand itstarget customer base while securing the existingcustomers. The Group will implement and reviewbusiness strategies from time to time in a prudentmanner to foster long-term and steady business growth,lay a solid foundation for the retail industry’s futurerecovery and generate satisfactory returns to itsshareholders.   Information from the financial statements of listed companiesLast Update: 2017/07/14             Related News        EMBRY HOLDINGS 2Q Sales Up 4%; SSS Posts Single-Digit Increase      EMBRY HOLDINGS (01388.HK) 1Q Overall Sales Falls 3% YoY     EMBRY HOLDINGS Annual Net Profit Down 51.18% to HK$98.402M; Final Div HK4.3 Cents      EMBRY HOLDINGS 2016 Sales Down Over 10% YoY      EMBRY HOLDINGS Warns FY Net Profit to Fall               SITEMAP Back to the top ▲         AASTOCKS.com - Mainpage   Products  Market  - HK Indices - World Indices - China Indices - Real-time Futures - Top 20 - Industries - HK Index Constituents - H-shares (All) - Red-chip (All) - GEM (All) - ETF    - ETF Overview   - ETF Details   - Leveraged / Inverse ETF   - Predefined Screener   - ETF Search   - ETF Comparison   - ETF Education   - ETF Commentary  - Company Announcement - Short Selling - Research Report - Company Dividend - Result Announ.
