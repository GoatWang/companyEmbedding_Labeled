Chinese Tristate Holdings Acquires Italian Fashion Brand CP Companyroberto ceccarelliLifestyle & Luxury0 Comments 0

International holding company Tristate Holdings Ltd. listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, announced the acquisition of the famous Italian brand CP Company, owned by FGF Industry since 2010.
The goggle jacket is probably the most iconic C.P. Company design, based on the jackets worn by drivers during the famous Mille Miglia races
Peter Wang, president and founder of the Tristate Holdings Ltd. said that his admiration for the Italian brand dates back to the early 1980s when, in search of a type of clothing that would fit the characteristics of a perfect British style, he came across an “original remake” of the classic trench coat made by a brand still unknown to him: CP Company.

Tristate Holdings Ltd. will maintain the existing core product team: creative directors Paul Harvey and Alessandro Pungetti, product director Stefano Polato, under the direction of President Massimiliano Tosi, former President of Napapjiri and Marketing Director Lorenzo Osti, new shareholder and the company founder’s son.
