China Dongxiang (Group) Co., Ltd. ("China Dongxiang" or "the Company"; stock code: 3818, together with its subsidiaries the "Group") is a leading international sportswear brand enterprise based in China. The Group is primarily engaged in the design, development, marketing and wholesaling of branded sportswear in China. Since 30 May 2006, China Dongxiang has owned all rights to the internationally recognised Kappa Brand in the PRC and Macau. 
In April, 2008, as a new chapter in its multi-branding strategy China Dongxiang announced the acquisition of Phenix Co., Ltd.("Phenix"), which mainly owned and managed KAPPA and PHENIX brands in Japan. As a result China Dongxiang is enriching its regional brand portfolio and extending product types to help develop the China ski and outdoor fashion markets. The Company's aim is also to further enhance its current R&D techniques and ability to integrate Japan PHENIX's strong design and R&D capacity as well as relevant talents. Ultimately they want to provide a solid platform for KAPPA and other brands' long-term development in China. 
These days, China Dongxiang's major products convey an active, fashionable and youthful image and are warmly welcomed by China's fast growing, affluent consumers.

China market - KAPPA
Brand History
First established in 1916, the Kappa brand started to garner market recognition in Europe during the 1960s and 1970s and before long became one of the most renowned names for casual sportswear in Europe. Since then, the world has been enchanted by the lifestyle represented by Kappa products, so vividly identified by Omini, its unique logo featuring a back-to-back couple.
Through China Dongxiang ("the Group"), Kappa landed in China in 2002 to embark on an amazing journey of phenomenal growth in this populous nation. In May 2006, the Group acquired the brand ownership of Kappa in Mainland China and Macau to secure complete autonomy in all aspects of the brand's operations in these markets, such as product development, marketing, sales organizations and channel strategy, allowing it to devise comprehensive, market-oriented development plans. In April 2008,the Group secured the entire interests of Kappa in Mainland China, Macau and Japan following its acquisition of PHENIX, then owner of the Kappa brand and PHENIX brand in Japan.
Brand Positioning
After more than a decade of soul-searching and development efforts, Kappa has further cemented its strong foundation in China. Today, Kappa continues to carry that unmistakable sporting gene but, on top of that, it has positioned itself as a brand for the fashionable sportive lifestyle with the concept of "rebellious, passionate and outgoing." It targets young consumers who are enthusiastic about pop culture, discerning about the quality of life, eager to explore new ideas and happy to show off their personalities.

It requires rigorous practices in product quality and design to give substance to the concept of "rebellious, passionate and outgoing." Kappa products are developed on the basis of various aspects in pop culture. On top of the basic sporting gene, a diverse range of trendy elements are incorporated in the designs. In addition, more emphasis has been put on consumers' experience and the creation of overall styles through product matching, in order to develop unique, in-fashion products that meet the aesthetic standards and demands of the trendy.
Brand Marketing
Kappa is unique also in its marketing approach which seeks to promote the pop culture and shape the trendy lifestyle. More emphasis has been put in promoting the brand in the dimension of pop culture through in-depth crossovers with the entertainment, music and art professions, so that pop culture is seamlessly blended into the products and their marketing.
