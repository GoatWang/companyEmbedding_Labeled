5.0 out of 5 starsIntense, puts emphasis on amazing chorusesByKindulason November 27, 2012Divinus took longer to grow on me that some albums, as a Two Steps and Audiomachine fan; at first at felt it was good, but clearly there was good reason I don't hear about them as much as TSFH and Audiomachine and their ilk. In truth, though, their style just took a little bit of getting used to. In the end, I realized that I held this album in as high regard as any - in fact, I think I spent more time listening to it that albums to almost any other of the genre. They have some of the most epic choruses around - songs like Darkest Hour, Salvation and Flame, Ashes, The Eleventh Hour - some of the best choruses I've heard in the genre, once you get used to the style. Maybe it helps that put their choruses so far in the foreground, giving it proper emphasis. Their lighter stuff is less impressive (though still good) - Healing of the Nations, Name above all Names, Eye of the Beholder - but those are few and far between, and for the most part Divinus offers incredibly intense, deep epic music. They typically stick to the "Start slow, then get intense, then add super intense epic chorus for the finale." Once you get into the songs, however, the similar formula is of little consequence, and the biggest problem really is that we could use more chorus, especially in Elohim which is just too short, with a mere 21 seconds of amazing chorus.So, if you like epic contemporary classical, you should really consider this album. If you're a fan of epic choruses in paticular, this is a must have.

3.0 out of 5 starsHalf way there...ByRed Rogerson June 30, 2012I thought this music would be a bit heavier due to the overall look of the album cover and the names of the tracks. However it is mostly composed of lighter near epic music that never really seems to go all the way. If they would have had a heavenly "lighter" picture on their album cover I think it would have perfectly conveyed the music within.The music is never whimsical, but it really isn't dramatic or heavy either in an epic music sense. I would say that it is more background mood music as it never has seems to have the highs that accompany the epic music we are all accustomed to. It gets really close on some tracks and then immediately tones itself back down. I would say ultimately the album is a cross between new age mood music? with some light epic overtones thrown in here and there.A little too weak for me on all accounts, but if that sounds good to you then this might be what you are looking for.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsEpic movie trailer musicByAnna Erishkigalon September 6, 2012Format: MP3 Music|Verified PurchaseI listen to epic movie trailer music to aid the creative process when I write.  Usually I pick one song that has the 'feel' of the chapter I will be writing that day and then put it on softly in the background on auto-repeat to help me visualize the action in that scene.  This album has provided the fertile ground for quite a few chapters and scenes in two different books.Their is a light Islamic feel (not overwhelming) to some of these pieces, conjuring up images of a lonely desert, an open landscape, a journey, loneliness, an epic journey.  Many pieces have a melancholy feel, as though an obstacle needs to be overcome.  In most cases, the score is evocative of a solution to a problem.One piece is evocative of a native American tribe performing a shamanic ceremony.  A few others are light and inspirational.And then there are several REALLY GOOD 'evil bad guy' pieces.  Anybody who has ever written a good villain knows you need all the help you can get crawling into the bad guys head.  Whether writing your villain, the high school bully, you are hosting a haunted house for Halloween and want background mood music beyond the tired old haunted house soundtracks, or you just want to put on some kick-butt music at the gym to pump some iron, you will find what you need here.And if you just want to play the whole album and listen to orchestral scores the way that NORMAL people listen to their music, it is quite enjoyable.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Taking into account the cover art and the names of the songs, this album diverges from typical epic fare in that it appears to be intended to tell a specific story (Heaven versus Hell); unlike other cinematic-style albums, which tend to possess self-contained songs that generally have nothing to do with each other, Divinus is more like a complete soundtrack for a movie that doesn't exist. In that regard, the story is told in the music if you care to hear it . . . but you have to hear the WHOLE album to grasp the full story. That's not to say there aren't individual songs you can love and build unique imagery around, for they do hold up under scrutiny, but I think something will be lost if you try to look at the songs ONLY as separate entities and not also as the unit they are.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.
