About Us
At the Asia Botanicals Group of Companies we love everything about medicinal and aromatic herbs, in particular tropical herbs, oils and spices that grow here in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. For the past 20 years we have been pioneering research, such as on the herb Tongkat Ali and growing these herbs in the jungles and farms of Malaysia and researching their ethnobotanical and pharmacological uses. This has led to the development of professional herbal products sold in more than 1,500 pharmacies, supermarkets and health food stores in Malaysia and with overseas agencies in Japan, China and Hong Kong under our Rainforest Herbs® brand, such as our best-selling TONEX Tongkat Ali Capsules.
We also specialize in "Own Brand" product development and manufacturing and have worldwide OEM customers. Our team of experts headed by Australian Medical Herbalist Benjamin Drewe contribute their extensive experience to projects involved with herb growing and edible garden landscaping as well as in providing specialized corporate and individual health training and consultancy. Ben found his passion for herbal medicine more than 30 years ago while a teenager working on a herbal permaculture farm in Australia. His studies in herbal medicine took him to Asia shortly after where he has lived and studied the ethnobotany and traditional medicine of India, China, Indonesia and Malaysia and incorporated their medicinal plants into his modern herbal products.Our brands:Please visit our websites by clicking the links below: Rainforest Herbs® Main Site  For detailed information on our full product range & articles Rainforest Herbs Facebook   Rainforest Balance Store  Our online store to purchase all our products in Malaysian Ringgit (RM) Biohealth Products  Our Biohealth Range of specialty herbal teas & products Coconut Oil Malaysia  Everything about incorporating Coconut Products into your diet  Fuel Human Performance  Our online store to purchase in USD & China / Hong Kong Office Cafe Jamu  How to make your own Jamu and Jamu beauty products Rainforest Herbs Malay  Laman web bahasa Melayu (Under Development){C}Holistic Health TrainingWe provide regular articles and talks on many areas of herbal medicine and natural health and can tailor our programs to your specific requirements.

TROPICAL HERB GARDEN DESIGN
What's more satisfying than being able to pick fresh tropical herbs and spices from the garden for cooking the evening meal or collecting herbs for a medicinal tea!


TROPICAL HERB CULTIVATION
Knowing which herbs are commercially viable to grow in the tropics is essential to a successful herbal business. Obtaining organic certification allows for a value added offering.


CREATING AN EDIBLE GARDEN
An investment in an edible garden with multiple organic herbs, fruits and vegetables is the best investment we can make for our family's health and peace of mind.


WATER & RELAXATION GARDEN FEATURES
Putting the herbal / edible garden landscaped features together with esthetically pleasing water features and stone / natural materials creates a true healing environment.

ANAKKU 
 



"Anakku" is a name synonymous with every parent's pride and joy and is defined simply as my child. It is a home-grown brand that has become so widely accepted it is now a household name. Anakku celebrated it's 30th anniversary in Malaysia in 2003, signifying a commitment that had endured in providing the best in baby-care products. 

            Anakku's wide range of baby products, built on a strong, solid foundation of premium quality, safety and reliability, are found in most department stores and major retail chains as well as having it's very own boutiques. 

            Anakku understood that caring for a baby is more than merely having comfortable and lasting attire. With the expansion of the company it also ventured to include a more comprehensive product range by introducing fashion-wear for babies and toddlers, feeding equipment, toiletries, diapers, accessories, strollers, playpens and more.

DISNEY BABY
 



Disney merchandising began in 1929 when Walt Disney was approached by a businessman interested in placing Mickey Mouse on the cover of a children's writing tablet. Since then, the Disney brand has extended to merchandise ranging from apparel to toys and even cutlery and is a trusted name across the globe. Under the Disney Baby brand, parents and babies can be assured of experiencing the best of a legacy that has brought joy to millions of children with an adorable range of apparel, toiletries, feeding baby bottles, bottle brushes and teats.


FIRST CARE Â 
 



It all started with the vision to provide innovative, quality travel gear with a distinctive edge. The very first First Care outlet started as early as the 90's. From then onwards the brand continued to grow at a rapid pace. We have formed partnerships with successful international retailers and sell in high profile department stores.

            Throughout the years, we have kept to our promise of only providing the best for our customers. Our emphasis has always been in providing quality and safe products. Our extensive collections include strollers, car seats, booster seats, playpen, high-chairs & travel systems with plans to further extend into other possible categories.

              Our strong mix of distinctive quality product; marketing expertise; strong customer focus; enthusiastic people and up-to-the-moment technology has created a unique brand... a brand that is the leader in its market. The loyalty we receive from our customers makes the hard-work so worthwhile. Our company continues to grow and we are well aware none of it would have been possible without their support.

HELLO KITTY
 



Hello Kitty, created in 1974, was originally marketed only to young girls. In the 1990s the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teenagers and grown-ups as a retro brand.
Since then Hello Kitty product range has expanded to cover baby apparel, accessories, feeding bottles, wipes and travel equipment.
