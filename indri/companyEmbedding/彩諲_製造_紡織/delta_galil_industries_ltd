Business as usual for Israel’s clothing industry


just-style.com 
 | 1 Aug 2006


The Israeli economy has long withstood acts of terrorism and war, and clothing companies are keen to reassure customers that the current conflict is no different.

just-style.com 
 | 3 Jan 2006

We can now,” quality is something we’ll probably never see again. Or want to. Mike Flanagan believes that things can only get better.

just-style.com

just-style.com 
 | 16 Jun 2003


Is survival without collaboration an option for fashion? No, say leading innovators Delta Galil and TAP Group, arguing that true collaboration is built around joint planning for the entire supply chain, eliminating duplicated processes and sharing risk with the aim of creating continuity and sustainable value for everyone.
