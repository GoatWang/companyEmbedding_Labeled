Introducing Driver Matic.  In May 2007, PC Pitstop announced a revolutionary technology called Driver Matic.  
						Driver Matic allows the installation of a driver with the click of a button.  Prior to Driver Matic, all drivers had to be installed differently and required significant user involvement.  Now with Driver Matic, a PC can have up to date drivers automatically.  
						Driver Matic has been integrated into both PC Matic and Driver Alert 2.0.  Driver Matic finally has made it simple and easy to keep your drivers up to date.  Only at PC Pitstop.
To find the latest driver for your computer we recommend running our Free Driver Scan.
Find out how to make your computer faster by running our Free Performance Scan.


Tips from the PitCrew

If a hardware device isn't functioning properly, or if a program or game that you're installing states that it requires newer drivers, a driver update will be in order. 
Also, with many wireless adapters it is important to stay current as updates often contain security fixes. A driver update may also improve stability and performance, or may fix issues with games, programs and power management.
New drivers can unlock additional features for a device that may not have been available before. If you receive notification from a program or a manufacturer that a newer driver is available, it would be a good idea to check the release notes and see what’s different than the driver you’re already using.

ASMedia SuperSpeed USB host controller ASM1042 passes USB-IF certification and may bear the SuperSpeed USB Logo

Press release [Tuesday 31 May 2011]
ASMedia Technology Inc., which is the first USB 3.0 host controller company to be certified by USB-IF for its SuperSpeed USB Host controller product - ASM1042 received USB-IF certification, first again among all the Taiwan IC vendors.ASMedia Technology Inc., currently headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, founded in 2004, being a subsidiary of ASUS group, and highly focused on developing PCI-e and USB 3.0 and SATA 6G related chipsets and controllers, whose products have been widely adopted among worldwide clients, continues to provide leadership in the SuperSpeed USB market through these achievements. "ASMedia Technology Inc. had accumulated precious and comprehensive experience from SuperSpeed USB product development and field support to customers. Furthermore, we leverage such exclusive experience to the design of host as well as other device products; with these advantages, we are going to provide our customers with complete SuperSpeed USB solutions with the best quality," said Weber Chuang, the Associate VP of Technical Product Marketing Department.The certification process is thorough and comprehensive, it includes combination of hundreds of testing types and proposals covering from USB 3.0/2.0/1.1 CV tests to electrical test and advanced power management and compatibility test with more than 150 legacy and SuperSpeed USB devices, some of them are even not yet on the market. The ultimate goal of such complex test and certification procedures is purely to minimize functional and compatibility issues to help ensure end user confidence while they consider adopting SuperSpeed USB solutions. Additionally, the new guideline from Microsoft will require the host adopted by system implementers to be certified by USB-IF before it could pass the WLK 1.6 test. (Note: Microsoft has announced that it would be mandatory for a system with built-in USB 3.0 host to have a USB-IF certified TID to pass WLK 1.6 logo testing starting from June 1, 2011) "No doubt that ASM1042 has excellent compatibility. In addition, they also support isochronous transfers for multi-media applications as well as Battery Charging 1.2, which enables you to charge your smart phones more quickly. Moreover, for Gamers, ASM1041 and ASM1042 could support asynchronous clocking mode which means you could overclock your system to gain extreme performance without being limited with USB 3.0 implemented.""Certification reaffirms that ASMedia is definitely capable of delivering high quality USB 3.0 products and services to worldwide customers with affordable pricing," said Chewei Lin, the CEO of ASMedia Technology Inc..""The USB-IF is excited to witness the continued momentum and success of SuperSpeed USB, and the growing number of certified SuperSpeed USB products helps ensure a seamless experience to consumers worldwide ," said Jeff Ravencraft, President & COO, USB-IF. "We are excited to have ASMedia deliver certified USB 3.0 host controllers to the industry that have met USB-IF certification requirements.""MCCI is pleased that the ASMedia ASM1042 host controller has achieved USB-IF certification, as we support ASMedia's host controller drivers with our software stack" said Terrill Moore, CEO, MCCI. "Certification gives consumers and manufacturers confidence in their USB product purchases."To increase the rate of SuperSpeed USB adoption and acceptance, ASMedia plays an important role in providing high quality products and services with reasonable pricing. ASMedia Technology Inc. is making sure that more end-users could enjoy the fascinating and awesome SuperSpeed USB experience, especially through the ASM1042 series.The ASM1042 two-port USB 3.0 controller, supports USB 3.0 isochronous transfer, Battery Charging 1.2, Asynchronous clocking mode and low power architecture.Welcome to HAYTT Taipei, visit ASMedia Technology's exhibition room #1020 - #1021 for the up-to-date USB 3.0 products and applications.ASMedia Technology website: http://www.asmedia.com.tw/Chewei Lin (left, VP of ASUS group and CEO of ASMedia Technology Inc.) attended the SuperSpeed USB DevCon, held in March 2011 by the USB-IF in Amsterdam, as one of the Keynote speakers, accompanied by Weber Chuang(right, AVP of Technical marketing department).Photo: company

Introducing Driver Matic.  In May 2007, PC Pitstop announced a revolutionary technology called Driver Matic.  
						Driver Matic allows the installation of a driver with the click of a button.  Prior to Driver Matic, all drivers had to be installed differently and required significant user involvement.  
						Now with Driver Matic, a PC can have up to date drivers automatically.  Driver Matic has been integrated into both PC Matic and Driver Alert 2.0.  
						Driver Matic finally has made it simple and easy to keep your drivers up to date.  Only at PC Pitstop.
To find the latest driver for your computer we recommend running our Free Driver Scan.

Tips from the PitCrew

If a hardware device isn't functioning properly, or if a program or game that you're installing states that it requires newer drivers, a driver update will be in order. 
Also, with many wireless adapters it is important to stay current as updates often contain security fixes. A driver update may also improve stability and performance, or may fix issues with games, programs and power management.
New drivers can unlock additional features for a device that may not have been available before. If you receive notification from a program or a manufacturer that a newer driver is available, it would be a good idea to check the release notes and see what’s different than the driver you’re already using.
