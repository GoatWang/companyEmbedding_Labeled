[February 24, 2016]


Rubicon Technology, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter 2015 Results of Operations


 Rubicon Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:RBCN), a leading provider of sapphire 
 substrates and products to the LED, optical and semiconductor 
 industries, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter 
 ended December 31, 2015.
 

 The Company reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.5 million, lower than 
 the prior quarter revenue of $5.3 million due to a temporary decline in 
 wafer sales and weaker sapphire demand for two and four-inch core sold 
 into the mobile device and LED markets. Wafer revenue declined from $2.1 
 million in the third quarter to $0.9 million in the fourth quarter, but 
 the Company expects wafer revenue to rebound to or exceed the level of 
 third quarter wafer revenue in the first quarter of 2016 driven by 
 growth in six-inch PSS wafer sales. Additional growth in the wafer 
 business is expected in the second quarter.
 

 Excess sapphire capacity and fluctuations in inventory levels in the LED 
 and mobile device supply chains continues to depress pricing in the 
 sapphire market. The Company limited the amount of two and four-inch 
 core sold in the fourth quarter due to the particularly challenging 
 pricing.
 

 Bill Weissman, Rubicon's CEO, said, "There continues to be excess 
 sapphire capacity in the market. However, we are working with developers 
 of some very interesting potential new applications for sapphire which 
 fit particularly well with Rubicon's unique set of sapphire knowledge 
 and capabilities."
 

 The Company also continues to work on developing its optical sapphire 
 business and expects to move two new technologies into production later 
 this year, its LANCE technology which produces large rectangular windows 
 for defense and commercial applications, and its SapphirEX coating 
 technology.
 

 Mr. Weissman continued, "We are on track to complete our LANCE crystal 
 growth deliverables this year producing windows as large as 36" x 18" x 
 2" which are unprecedented in the market. We also expect to move 
 SapphirEX into production later this year and we are pleased with the 
 initial interest in that product."
 

 The Company's GAAP loss per share was $0.49 for the fourth quarter as 
 compared with $1.84 in the third quarter. Non-GAAP loss per share, which 
 excludes charges and accruals as detailed in the reconciliation of 
 non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measures near the end of this 
 release, was $0.38 in the fourth quarter and $0.29 in the prior quarter.
 

 The Company continues its focus on improving cash flow. Mardel Graffy, 
 Rubicon's CFO commented, "Building a consignment inventory for a key 
 wafer customer and limiting core sales in the fourth quarter resulted in 
 an increased use of cash in the period but improving cash flow remains a 
 top priority. We are implementing changes that we expect to reduce wafer 
 costs over the next several months and expect cash flow from operations 
 to improve."
 

First Quarter 2016 Guidance


 The Company expects revenues to increase to between $4 and $5 million in 
 the first quarter with increased wafer revenue, particularly from 
 six-inch PSS wafers, and an increase in four-inch core sales. GAAP loss 
 per share is expected to be between $0.24 and $0.28.
 

Conference Call Details


 Rubicon will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on 
 February 24, 2016 to review the fourth quarter 2015 results and the 
 first quarter outlook. The conference call will be available to the 
 public through a live audio web broadcast via the Internet. Log on 
 through the Investor Relations section of Rubicon's website at http://ir.rubicontechnology.com. 
 An audio replay of the call will be available approximately two hours 
 after the conclusion of the call. The audio replay will remain available 
 until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on March 2, 2016, and can be accessed by 
 dialing (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088 (international). Callers should

Non-GAAP Disclosures


 In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the Company 
 has provided non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP loss per share for the 
 third and fourth quarters of 2015. The Company's management believes 
 that providing these non-GAAP financial measures better enables 
 investors to understand and evaluate the Company's historical and 
 prospective operating performance. The non-GAAP measures exclude the 
 impact of certain non-cash charges which are described in the footnotes 
 to the table below. Management excludes these items because they believe 
 the impacts do not reflect expected future results and that their 
 exclusion aids in the comparison of the Company's current results with 
 past and future operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures may 
 have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be 
 considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's
