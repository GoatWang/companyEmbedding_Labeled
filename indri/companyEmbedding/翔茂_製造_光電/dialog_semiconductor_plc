Dialog Semiconductor Plc.: Dialog Semiconductor Enters Gallium Nitride (GaN) Market with First Integrated Devices Targeting Fast Charging Power Adapters (news with additional features)
 
25.08.2016 08:00
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SmartGan(TM) DA8801 providing monolithic integration of GaN power FETS
 
together with analog drivers and logic in an optimized, highly efficient 650V half-bridge design
 
London, United Kingdom - August 25, 2016 - Dialog Semiconductor plc (XETRA:DLG), a provider of highly integrated power management, AC/DC power conversion, solid state lighting (SSL) and Bluetooth(R) low energy technology, today announced and is demonstrating its first gallium nitride (GaN) power IC product offering, using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation's (TSMCs) 650 Volt GaN-on-Silicon process technology.
 
The DA8801 together with Dialog's patented digital Rapid Charge(TM) powerconversion controllers will enable more efficient, smaller, and higher power density adapters compared to traditional Silicon field-effect transistor (FET) based designs today. Dialog is initially targeting the fast charging smartphone and computing adapter segment with its GaN solutions, where it already enjoys more than 70 percent market share with its power conversion controllers.
 
"The exceptional performance of GaN transistors allows customers to deliver more efficient and compact power adapter designs that meet today's market demands," said Mark Tyndall, SVP Corporate Development and Strategy, Dialog Semiconductor. "Following our success in BCD-based power management ICs (PMICs), as an early GaN innovator, Dialog once again leads the commercialization of a new power technology into high-volume consumer applications."
 
GaN technology offers the world's fastest transistors, which are the core of high-frequency and ultra-efficient power conversion. Dialog's DA8801 half-bridge integrates building blocks, such as gate drives and level shifting circuits, with 650V power switches to deliver an optimized solution that reduces power losses by up to 50 percent, with up to 94 percent power efficiency. The product allows for a seamless implementation of GaN, avoiding complex circuitry, needed to drive discrete GaN power switches.
 
The new technology allows a reduction in the size of power electronics by up to 50 percent, enabling a typical 45 Watt adapter design today to fit into a 25 Watt or smaller form factor. This reduction in size will enable true universal chargers for mobile devices.
 
"As Dialog's strategic foundry partner for power management ICs for many years, we are delighted to have expanded our relationship to collaborate closely in bringing our GaN process to the mainstream consumer market for high volume applications," said Maria Marced, President of TSMC Europe. "Dialog's first GaN product delivers on the promise of GaN while bringing the integration to a higher level."
 
The DA8801 will be available in sample quantities in Q4 2016. More information on the DA8801 may be found here:  http://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/DA8801

Dialog Semiconductor Launches New SSL LED Driver



 Dialog Semiconductor plc (FWB:DLG), a provider of highly integrated power management, AC/DC power conversion, solid state lighting (SSL) and Bluetooth(R) Smart technology, today debuted its innovative solid state lighting (SSL) LED driver platform designed to deliver the ultimate in dimmer performance and compatibility with an ultra-low bill of materials (BOM) cost for next-generation LED bulbs. The first LED driver from this new platform - the iW3688 - delivers smooth, flicker and shimmer-free dimming supporting the widest range of phase-cut dimmers. It also enables manufacturers to drive down the manufacturing cost of LED bulbs by using Dialog's patented integrated digital control technology to eliminate more than 20 components, including the external bleeder circuit.

 The iW3688 single-stage LED driver is designed for applications up to 20W, including A-style, BR, candle, GU10 and PAR bulbs and T8 LED tubes, as well as external lighting ballast drivers. It uses Dialog's patented intelligent digital dimming control technology to provide exceptional compatibility and performance with the most challenging TRIAC and digital dimmers, while Dialog's patented sophisticated digital algorithms enable integrated active biasing for high performance dimming at a lower cost compared to conventional external bleeder circuits.

 "Dialog invented digital adaptive control LED driver ICs to optimise SSL luminaire performance and to drive the cost of LED lighting down to an affordable price point for mass consumer adoption" explains Davin Lee, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Power Conversion Business Group at Dialog Semiconductor. "Our innovative iW3688 LED driver platform once again raises the bar and extends our lead in wide dimmer compatibility, exceptional dimming performance and ultra-low BOM cost - sophistication and performance that can only be achieved with digital control."

 TRIAC dimmers require a minimum load current to maintain forward conduction. This is a problem for highly efficient, low-power LED bulbs since they may fail to draw enough current through the TRIAC to clear the holding current threshold, resulting in flicker and shimmer in dimmable LED bulbs. Many low-power bulb designs address this issue by using an external bleeder circuit to draw extra current through the TRIAC while it is conducting. However, the disadvantage is these bleeder circuits require additional external components and dissipate additional power inside the bulb, significantly raising the internal temperature and shortening the LED bulb operating lifetime.

 The iW3688 eliminates the cost of up to 20 external components in the bulb design, including as many as 10 required for the external bleeder circuit, and instead uses Dialog's integrated digital algorithms that modulate primary FET switching to draw extra current during dimming. This ensures the input current continuously stays above TRIAC biasing thresholds during forward conduction, eliminating the need for an external bleeder circuit. The iW3688 further reduces BOM costs by simplifying the EMI filter circuit and integrating the current sink, switching and VCC charging circuits. Additional savings come from the iW3688's advanced IC power management and voltage sensing, which allow the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf inductors.

 The iW3688 integrates Dialog's patented over-temperature protection (OTP) de-rating technology to address LED bulb lifetime issues caused by excessive heat. OTP technology monitors the temperature inside the sealed SSL bulb and seamlessly dims light output if the temperature rises above a safe operating threshold, then restores brightness as temperature falls. This results in cooler operation, avoids exceeding the temperature rating of the electrolytic capacitors, and helps ensure a predictable and safer bulb operating life.

The DA9318 series delivers 98% efficiency in fast-charging applications, minimizing heat dissipation  London, United Kingdom - June 27, 2017 - Dialog Semiconductor plc (XETRA:DLG), a provider of highly integrated power management, AC/DC power conversion, charging, and Bluetooth(R) low energy technology, today unveiled the DA9318 series, the company's latest power converter ICs for its recently launched family of high efficiency charging products. The DA9318 delivers far greater fast charging efficiency, addressing the increasing demands on charging batteries for today's latest smartphones. Together with Dialog's RapidCharge(TM) AC/DC power conversion chipsets, the DA9318 converters complete Dialog's wall-to-battery solution and provides breakthrough efficiency in high-voltage direct charging. A crucial advantage of the DA9318 series is its outstanding high efficiency of up to 98 percent, minimizing power and heat dissipation, making compact consumer applications safer. Unlike existing direct charging topologies, which use low voltage and force the full charging current to run over the cable, the converters high efficiency allows for a 6 A charging current to be achieved over a standard 3 A USB cable. This simultaneously doubles power and drastically reduces costs by up to 35 percent for fast-charging applications. There are two variants of the product, the DA9318L provides up to 8 A and the DA9318M variant provides up to 10 A charging current to support 35 W and 44 W of charging power, respectively. The innovative, patent-pending concept is the first of its kind in the marketplace, and is well-suited to address the design challenges associated with the increased capacity batteries seen in today's smart devices. With batteries in smartphones approaching upwards of 4,000 mAh to provide longer battery life for greater computing power, manufacturers are increasingly looking for advanced solutions to deliver efficient, safe fast charging with low heat dissipation. The DA9318 variants include comprehensive safety and protection features to guarantee end-to-end system safety, from the travel adapter to the smartphone battery. "Dialog's technological leadership in fast charging has allowed us to launch the first-of-its-kind power converters with the DA9318 charger series" said Udo Kratz, Senior Vice-President and General Manager, Mobile Systems Business Unit, Dialog Semiconductor. "Combined with our iW656 USB-PD power adapter interface IC, Dialog now offers a complete wall-to-battery solution with breakthrough efficiency and impressive cost savings for fast charging. What's more, our increased efficiency and more than 18 integrated safety features keep heat dissipation down and enable safer consumer applications." More information on the DA9318L and DA9318M is available at www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/da9318. Dialog will also showcase both DA9318 variants at its customer Charger Day events to be held on June 27, 2017 in Shenzhen, China, and June 29 in Taipei, Taiwan.

Diversifying our product portfolio
Dialog is successfully diversifying its product portfolio and customer base, focusing on key adjacencies. This includes:



PrimAccurate™PrimAccurate™ – the world’s first digitally controlled AC/DC power converter, which enables faster smartphone/tablet charging and was developed by iWatt, which Dialog acquired in July 2013. The company also offers a range of innovative Solid State LED lighting ICs.
, SmartPulse™SmartPulse™ – which uses DECT ULE to provide interference-free connectivity for smart home appliances with ceiling to cellar reach and the option of voice control.
, SmartBond™SmartBond™ – the world’s smallest and most energy efficient Bluetooth Smart SoCs for app-enabled smartphone accessories, wireless mice/keyboards and Smart TV remote controls, which is also available from Murata as part of a wireless module to speed time-to-market for developers.
, SmartWave™SmartWave™ – a Multi-touch IC (MITC™) that uses in-glass infrared technology to nearly halve the cost of touch for Ultrabook™, notebook, All-in-One PCs & monitors in comparison to capacitive-based solutions and is being used by the ODM Wistron.
, Flickerless™Flickerless™ - Utilizes a two-stage conversion approach by first detecting the type of dimmer, if any. Then the input voltage is passed through a chopping circuit, which provides the correct impedance to match the dimming circuit and therefore helps to improve the Power Factor of the overall circuit.
, BroadLED™BroadLED™ - Adaptive Switch Mode technology, reduces wasted power by 60%, while maintaining better than 2% channel-to-channel matching, enabling higher integration of drivers and the possibility to implement local dimming for large LCD displays in HDTVs.
, AccuSwitch™AccuSwitch™ - The integration of the patented digital control circuit, offering high output accuracy and a reduced component count through proprietary primary-side feedback technology, with a high voltage transistor allows for an overall solution that saves valuable real estate in home and industrial electronics.
, SmarteXite™SmarteXite™ - Supporting multiple dimming interfaces, including digital dimming via a simple main on/off switch, and the Ledotron™ digital dimming protocol and toggle-switch based dimming. Using a standard I2C digital interface, it serves as a powerful frontend for wireless communication modules like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or ZigBee.
