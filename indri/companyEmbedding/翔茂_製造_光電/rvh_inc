Causes[edit]
While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure.[1] It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling.
While LVH itself is not a disease, it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart.[2] Disease processes that can cause LVH include any disease that increases the afterload that the heart has to contract against, and some primary diseases of the muscle of the heart.
Causes of increased afterload that can cause LVH include aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency and hypertension. Primary disease of the muscle of the heart that cause LVH are known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, which can lead into heart failure.
Long-standing mitral insufficiency also leads to LVH as a compensatory mechanism.
Diagnosis[edit]
The principal method to diagnose LVH is echocardiography, with which the thickness of the muscle of the heart can be measured. The electrocardiogram (ECG) often shows signs of increased voltage from the heart in individuals with LVH, so this is often used as a screening test to determine who should undergo further testing.
Echocardiography[edit]
Two dimensional echocardiography can produce images of the left ventricle. The thickness of the left ventricle as visualized on echocardiography correlates with its actual mass. Normal thickness of the left ventricular myocardium is from 0.6 to 1.1 cm (as measured at the very end of diastole. If the myocardium is more than 1.1 cm thick, the diagnosis of LVH can be made.
ECG criteria[edit]




Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities as seen on ECG


There are several sets of criteria used to diagnose LVH via electrocardiography.[3] None of them is perfect, though by using multiple criteria sets, the sensitivity and specificity are increased.
The Sokolow-Lyon index:[4][5]

S in V1 or V2 + R in V5 or V6 (whichever is larger) ≥ 35 mm (≥ 7 large squares)
R in aVL ≥ 11 mm

The Cornell voltage criteria[6] for the ECG diagnosis of LVH involve measurement of the sum of the R wave in lead aVL and the S wave in lead V3. The Cornell criteria for LVH are:

S in V3 + R in aVL > 28 mm (men)
S in V3 + R in aVL > 20 mm (women)

2


QRS duration ≥0.09 sec

Delayed intrinsicoid deflection in V5 or V6 (>0.05 sec)

Other voltage-based criteria for LVH include:

Lead I: R wave > 14 mm
Lead aVR: S wave > 15 mm
Lead aVL: R wave > 12 mm
Lead aVF: R wave > 21 mm
Lead V5: R wave > 26 mm
Lead V6: R wave > 20 mm

Treatment[edit]
The enlargement is not permanent in all cases, and in some cases the growth can regress with the reduction of blood pressure.[7]
LVH may be a factor in determining treatment or diagnosis for other conditions. For example, LVH causes a patient to have an irregular ECG. Patients with LVH may have to participate in more complicated and precise diagnostic procedures, such as imaging, in situations in which a physician could otherwise give advice based on an ECG.[8][9]

Product Description
Savan RVH-600 Non-Toxic Water Soluble Rust Inhibitor
 
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: SAVAN RVH-600 is a non-toxic water soluble rust inhibitor developed specifically for the use in wire EDM machines that unlike other rust inhibitors works independently of the electric conductance of the dielectric fluid.
 
DIRECTION: SAVAN RVH-600 should be used as a 0.5% solution. Thus, 0.5 l of SAVAN RVH-600 have to be mixed with 100 l of water. The solution should be added to the machine in small portions while it is running. The concentration must be monitored and complied with. This can easily be done with a hand held refractometer available from EDM SALES & SUPPLIES, INC. It is important that no acideous fluids get mixed in with the solution. If your water turns black after a few days you should change your dielectric. This effect is due to the excellent cleaning characteristics of SAVAN RVH-600. It will only happen once and will also help to eliminate troublesome residue which collects in the machine.
 
FURTHER CHARACTERISTICS: SAVAN RVH-600 does not contain any toxic or harmful ingredients, it is 100% biodegradable, does not have any dermatological effects, and can be easily disposed. There are no reactions with ion-exchange resin. Due to its independence of the dielectric fluid’s electric conductance work pieces can stay in the water for a long time without any threats of corrosion.
 
STORAGE AND HANDLING: The product should be stored between +10ºC and +50ºC. In order to prevent biological deterioration, the dielectric‘s temperature should be kept below 25°C.
