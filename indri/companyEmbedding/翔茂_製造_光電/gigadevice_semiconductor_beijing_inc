			GigaDevice Introduction 
			

GigaDevice, the leading provider of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices, is the fabless company engaged in advanced memory and related chip design in Mainland China established in 2005. GigaDevice provides a wide range of high speed and low power NOR Flash memory products. Since 2007, GigaDevice has been accredited by SGS ISO9001 and ISO14001. More than 55% employees are in research and development segment, which assures our products the leading position in competition. The members of GigaDevice management team have rich working experience in famous memory companies in Silicon Valley US, Korea and Taiwan. GigaDevice has developed the 1st SPI NOR Flash, the 1st SPI NAND Flash, the 1st series of ARM® Contex™-M3 32-bit general-purpose MCU products, the 1st SRAM and the 1st GigaROM product in China. GigaDevice currently produces a wide range of SPI NOR Flash, SPI NAND Flash and MCU in embedded, consumer electronics, and mobile communications domain.
GigaDevice operates a manufacturing model with strong relationship with foundry partners, assembly and testing house. GigaDevice believes that close foundry model overwhelms the old IDM model as the capital investment and size of the top tier foundry is much bigger than small and medium size of IDM. New equipment and rapid growing 12” inch capacity from our foundry partners are key factors in our competitions in technology and manufacturing cost and capacity.
