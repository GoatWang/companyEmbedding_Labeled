Trend
The Challenge of IoT
From self-driving cars to factory robots, TE engineers are imagining new ways of connecting our world through IoT-enabled machines.




















Transforming Connectivity with Conductive Plastics
Conductive plastics provide a lighter, less expensive connectivity solution for next-generation electronics.
















The Future of the Electric Car is Here
From intelligent charging cables to high-voltage contactors, advances in electric vehicles are improving the path to autonomy. 













Trend
Smart-City Strategy
The decreasing cost of connectivity is enabling municipalities to integrate critical systems. To succeed, they need a clear vision for building a smart city.












Advanced connectivity can help you build more robust technological architectures. In data centers, our STRADA Whisper connectors transfer data at 25 Gigabits per second (Gbps), scalable to 56 Gbps. In factory machines, our ARISO Contactless Connectivity connects signal without disruption – and without a physical connection. In electric cars, our integrated sensor assemblies and transmission harnesses safely put more power into primary systems and subsystems. In commercial aircraft, our small, lightweight interconnects and high-density sensors enable higher bandwidths and speeds in critical systems. With connectors, sensors, and more from TE Connectivity (TE), you can build technology that helps make the world safer, sustainable, productive, and connected.











Application
Power Connectivity
TE provides innovative products for evolving vehicle architectures in order to protect power and serve signal needs.














Application
Server Solutions
Extend a server’s reach and reduce its power consumption, while increasing speed and density in any configuration – blade, rack mount, or sleds.














Application
Motor Connectivity
Motors today are increasingly compact, yet house more functions. Learn how TE enables motors to operate under highest possible demands.

New TE Product
Reflow Capable Connectors
Engineered for high-performance reflow soldering of PCB assemblies, our reflow capable universal MATE-N-LOK connectors and Economy Power headers are designed to withstand high temperatures associated with reflow soldering. These are used in appliances, HVAC equipment, security systems, industrial machinery, and elevators and escalators.






















New TE Product
0.5mm Fine Pitch Hermaphroditic Connectors
This type of board-to-board connector offers a hermaphroditic design that mates to itself, reducing inventory product mix with consolidated part numbers and components. There is only one part number for the header and receptacle, which saves time and cost associated with qualifying new parts.





















New TE Product
DEUTSCH Lightweight Bulkhead Feedthroughs
These high-power connectors offer a lightweight method of connecting electrical power through an equipment bulkhead. Based on MIL-DTL-38999 mounting footprints, these are up to 50 percent lighter than existing TE standard male terminal feedthroughs.

全車系符合第5期廢氣排放環保標準。
全車系符合環保署噪音管制標準。
表列數值為標準值未含容許公差。
規格配備以實車為準。
本型錄所登錄之市區油耗及非市區油耗測試值均係在控制溫度及溼度的實驗室，不受外界天候及路況的影響，並依規定的行車型態在車上空調系統不作動的情形下，於車體動力計上行駛測得，故各車型油耗測試值相對而言較為客觀。
民眾在道路上開車時，因受天候、路況、塞車、使用車上空調系統等因素影響，實際每公升汽油於道路上可行駛的公里數一般而言低於本型錄所登錄之測試值。

If the weather is your hair’s worst enemy, TRESemmé Climate Control Finishing Hair Spray offers day-long protection from the elements, while curly girls will love the definition they get from TRESemmé Curl Locking Finishing Spray for gorgeously groomed coils. Or, when you’re rocking a style that needs serious security, TRESemmé Two Extra Hold Hair Spray offers maximum hold, eliminating frizz and loose strands for a flawless-looking finish.

TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Flexible Hair Spray is also fantastic at controlling frizz, smoothing the way for sleeker hairstyles that feel softer – simply hold hair spray over your finished style 10-12 inches away for long-lasting hold with natural movement.

Whatever your style, make sure it stands up to all the day brings with professional hair sprays that help control, define, and protect.

„An outside look has helped us raise the quality of our work to a world-class level.“





















We care


Showing respect for others – that is in many respects the task we have set ourselves. For that reason we are committed to helping current and future generations as much as we can.










A tradition of commitment


Ever since the company was established, Siegwerkers have assumed responsibility for a range of causes that goes beyond their actual work. That includes a generations-old tradition of providing assistance to the weakest members of our society – children and teenagers. In line with our corporate social responsibility policy we regularly support projects that benefit young people.
After all solidarity is a value that keeps society cohesive and allows it to shape its own future. That also applies to the cohesion of different regions and cultural environments around the world.

From our start in October 1959, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) awarded Alpha contracts to produce jackets for American service members, including iconic styles such as the N-3B parka and the MA-1 flight jacket.  For the next 40 years Alpha would go on to produce a variety of jackets for the DOD including the M-65 field coat, ECWCS parkas and trousers, and test production runs for items in development. In the 1980s the company started efforts in the commercial market. Today, Alpha Industries is known around the world for its high-quality, military-inspired outerwear. We continue to produce the classic military silhouettes that are core to our heritage, as well as modern innovations in style and function.

Making sustainability the everyday standard



















We aim to be a leader in sustainability in the financial industry. This requires us to focus on the long term and to work to provide consistent returns to our stakeholders.

Our key program in this regard is UBS and Society – a cross-divisional umbrella platform covering all our activities and capabilities in sustainable investing and philanthropy, environmental and human rights policies that govern client and supplier relationships, managing our own environmental footprint, as well as our firm’s community investment.
