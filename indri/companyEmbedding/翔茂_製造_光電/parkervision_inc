(GlobeNewswire) - ParkerVision, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRKR) (ParkerVision), a developer and marketer of semiconductor technology solutions for wireless applications, announced today that it will begin taking orders for Milo, its new distributed Wi-Fi system for consumers, by the middle of August. Milo delivers the combination the company believes consumers are looking for in affordability without compromising performance. Milo will initially be available for purchase at Amazon.com, as well as the Milo online store at milowifi.com.
Designed for scalability, Milo systems provide whole home Wi-Fi coverage for small and large residences alike, eliminating dead-zones and slow data rate areas while adding coverage in difficult to reach locations. In field tests, users, including those with state-of-the-art Wi-Fi routers, benefited by Milos unique capability for adding new wireless coverage areas while not duplicating existing coverage that was already working well.
ParkerVision CEO Jeffrey Parker stated, We are excited for the launch of the Milo Wi-Fi product line. Milo has been designed for broad appeal to home and small office users who want reliable Wi-Fi everywhere without the investment of hundreds of dollars. Todays consumers continue to add Wi-Fi enabled devices such as phones, tablets, cameras, thermostats, doorbells, lights, power sockets, televisions, and more. Reliable distributed Wi-Fi is essential to enjoying the benefits of the internet-connected home and is at the core of one of todays greatest new markets; the internet of things and smart homes.
Mr. Parker continued, Current consumer Wi-Fi solutions for spotty coverage include either poorly made and ineffective extenders and repeaters or expensive mesh networking devices. Milo is an affordable solution that is perfect for small and large homes alike. With Milos cloud-based self-optimization and a US-based team of customer service representatives, our commitment is to ensure every Milo user can achieve the benefit of Wi-Fi everywhere.

The office remarked it was making the change due to concerns that the current rules were putting patent owners at a disadvantage.ParkerVision, Inc. · 2016年3月11日 · ParkerVision, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRKR) (the "Company") announced today that on March 9, 2016, IPWatchdog.com, a leading intellectual property law blog, published a guest article co-authored by three prominent attorneys calling for amicus briefs in support of ParkerVision's recent petition to the Supreme Court of the United States.   The article was co-authored by Donald Dunner, partner at the law firm of Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner; Thomas Goldstein, partner at t⋯⋯he law firm of Goldstein & Russell; and Douglas Cawley, partner at the law firm of McKool Smith.  The full article can be found at http://www.ipwatchdog.com/…/supreme-court-patent-…/id=66878/. These attorneys have represented, and continue to represent ParkerVision in its patent infringement action against Qualcomm Incorporated, which resulted in a jury verdict in October 2013 awarding ParkerVision approximately $173 million.  The jury verdict was subsequently overturned by the district court in 2014, and the district court's decision was affirmed by the Federal Circuit in 2015. ParkerVision filed a petition with the Supreme Court on February 29, 2016 raising the fundamental issue of the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial and protection of jury verdicts from "unduly intrusive appellate review."  The guest article explains, "In this case, the roles of courts and juries are front and center. The Federal Circuit has been dismissive of jury findings. This case presents an ideal opportunity to reverse this trend." http://ir.parkervision.com/releasedetail.cfm… 更多ParkerVision, Inc. · 2016年1月26日 · Our board member Rob Sterne is honored by Law360 as a top 25 iconic lawyer who made an indelible mark in the IP area.

This unconventional story began in 1980, when a company called Parker Electronics was started by a son and his dad based on an idea. Jeff, the son, watched his Dad, Ed, spend years in the somewhat sleepy air conditioning equipment business. As the advent of the computer chip ⋯⋯was starting to find its way into all kinds of uses, they believed this new computer chip technology could move the air conditioning industry into the future. So they started Parker Electronics to develop computer chips, or semiconductor chips, for use in air conditioning control systems.

A: Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair acts and unfair methods of competition involving imports, and provides that the importation or sale of infringing goods in the United States is unlawful. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the Act) amended Section 337 to make it easier and less expensive for domestic industries to prove a violation of Section 337 by showing that imported articles have infringed their ⋯⋯US patents and other federally registered intellectual property (IP) rights like trademarks or copyrights. Q: What is the ITC? A: The US International Trade Commission (ITC or Commission) is an independent, quasi-judicial Federal agency that administers certain US trade laws which provide US industries with a means to prevent unfair competition from imported goods, including Section 337 violations. There are six Commissioners, and about 400 agency employees. Q: What constitutes a violation of Section 337? A: To prove a violation of Section 337, the complaining party (also called the complainant) must establish (1) unfair competition or an unfair act, e.g., patent infringement, (2) importation, sale for importation, or sale after importation into the United States of the accused products, and (3) the existence of a domestic industry relating to the products or IP in question. In an investigation in which the alleged unfair act is not the infringement of a US patent or other federally registered IP rights, a complainant also must prove injury from the alleged unfair act.
