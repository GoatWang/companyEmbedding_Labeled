(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Overview  Resonant is a late-stage development company creating innovative filter designs for radio frequency, or RF, front-ends for the mobile device industry. The RF front-end is the circuitry in a mobile device responsible for analog signal processing and is located between the device's antenna and its digital baseband. We use a fundamentally new technology called Infinite Synthesized Networks(R), or ISN(R), to configure and connect resonators, the building blocks of RF filters. Filters are a critical component of the RF front-end used to select desired radio frequency signals and reject unwanted signals. We are using ISN to develop new classes of filter designs.  We believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of delivering our solutions to the market. Our target customers make part or all of the RF front-end. We intend to retain ownership of our designs, and we expect to be compensated through license fees and royalties based on sales of RF front-end modules that incorporate our designs. We do not intend to manufacture or sell any physical products or operate as a contract design company developing designs for a fee.  We are currently developing our first design, a duplexer, for our first customer, a leading manufacturer of RF front-ends for mobile devices. Duplexers are two filters combined into a single component which simultaneously selects both transmit and receive signals. Our customer has an option to license our duplexer design at already agreed-upon royalty rates upon completion.  We recently delivered a completed duplexer design to the customer for consideration. Our design does not meet all the specifications in the development agreement, however, we believe our design delivers competitive performance and is competing with other products. The customer is evaluating our design, and there is no assurance that it has acceptable performance and therefore will be used. Even if it has acceptable performance, there are a number of other considerations influencing the customer's decision whether to use our design, many of which are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our design will be selected by the customer for use in its products.  On March 9, 2015, we announced a development project with a second customer for the design of our next single-band RF filter. The goal of the project is to develop a new duplexer design for our customer to market to RF front-end manufacturers and mobile device OEMs. The design, which is estimated to take less than a year to develop, is intended to replace a BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filter with a less expensive SAW (surface acoustic wave) filter. The customer has not committed to use the resulting design and terms for a license have not been finalized.  We were founded as Resonant LLC on May 29, 2012 (our inception date). We commenced business on July 6, 2012 with initial contributions from our founders and Superconductor Technologies Inc., or STI. The founders contributed $200,000 and agreed to work full-time without pay until we secured adequate funding. STI contributed a patent portfolio, software, equipment, temporary office space and an early version of the development agreement with our first customer.  The founders loaned us an aggregate of $200,000 during the first quarter of 2013, and we issued a series of warrants to the founders in connection with these loans. We refer to the founder loans as Bridge Loans and the founder warrants as Bridge Loan Warrants. We repaid the Bridge Loans in the second quarter of 2013.  We changed our form of ownership from a limited liability company to a corporation in an exchange transaction on June 17, 2013. The founders exchanged all of their units and warrants of Resonant LLC for common stock and warrants of Resonant Inc. STI exchanged all of its units of Resonant LLC for a $2.4 million subordinated convertible note of Resonant Inc., or Subordinated Convertible Note. The Subordinated Convertible Note was scheduled to mature on September 17, 2014, was interest free, was secured by all of our assets and was subordinated to our senior convertible notes.  Table of Contents  We closed our first financing on June 17, 2013. We issued $7.0 million of senior convertible notes, or Senior Convertible Notes, in a private placement. The Senior Convertible Notes were scheduled to mature on September 17, 2014, bore interest at 6.0% per annum and were secured by all of our assets.  We paid MDB Capital Group, LLC, or MDB, which served as placement agent, a commission of $700,000 and issued it warrants to purchase 208,763 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the Financing Warrant. We also issued MDB on June 17, 2013 warrants to purchase 222,222 shares of common stock for business consulting services, which we refer to as the Consulting Warrant.  We closed our initial public offering, or IPO, on June 3, 2014. We sold 3,105,000 shares of common stock (which includes the exercise in full by the underwriter of its over-allotment option) at a price of $6.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, of $16.2 million. Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "RESN" on May 29, 2014, our IPO Date. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a registration statement relating to these securities on May 28, 2014.  MDB acted as the sole underwriter for our IPO. Simultaneous with the funding of the IPO, we issued the underwriter a 5-year warrant to purchase 310,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. The warrant is not exercisable until November 24, 2014 (180-days from the date of the underwriting agreement). We refer to this warrant as the Underwriting Warrant.  Our Senior Convertible Notes automatically converted into 2,087,667 shares of common stock effective upon the completion of the IPO. We paid in cash the accrued interest of $404,000. Similarly, our Subordinated Convertible Note automatically converted into 700,000 shares of common stock. There was no accrued interest on this note. The shares issued on conversion of the Senior Convertible Note were subject to a 180-day lockup that expired on November 24, 2014, and the shares issued on conversion of the Subordinated Convertible Note are subject to a 12-month lockup expiring May 28, 2015.  We have earned no revenue since inception, and our operations have been funded with the initial capital contributions and debt. We have incurred accumulated losses totaling $21.2 million from inception through December 31, 2014. These losses are primarily the result of research and development costs associated with commercializing our technology, combined with start-up and financing costs. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for commercialization of our technology on a continuous basis because our business model involves developing and licensing custom filter designs.  Our consolidated financial statements contemplate the continuation of our business as a going concern. However, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a new business. We do not yet have the ability to earn revenue and have incurred significant losses from operations since inception. At December 31, 2013 and 2014, we had an Accumulated Deficit of $11.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively, and cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014 we had $8.0 million in short-term investments.  Plan of Operation  We plan to commercialize our technology by creating filter designs that address the problems created by the growing number of frequency bands in the RF front-end of mobile devices. First, we plan to develop a series of single-band surface acoustic wave, or SAW, filter designs for frequency bands presently dominated by larger and more expensive bulk acoustic wave, or BAW, filters. Second, we plan to develop tunable filter designs that replace multiple filters. In order to succeed, we must convince RF front-end suppliers that our filter designs can significantly reduce the size and cost of their products.  We plan to pursue filter design projects with potential customers and other strategic partners. These types of arrangements may subsidize filter design costs, as well as offer complementary technology and market intelligence and other avenues to revenue. However, we intend to retain ownership of our technology, designs and related improvements. We expect to pursue development of multiple designs for multiple customers, and grant each customer a royalty-bearing license to a specific design with some limited period of exclusivity.  Table of Contents  We are using the net proceeds from our IPO for product development to commercialize our technology, research and development, the development of our patent strategy and expansion of our patent portfolio, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our anticipated costs include employee salaries and benefits, compensation paid to consultants, capital costs for research and other equipment, costs associated with development activities including travel and administration, legal expenses, sales and marketing costs, general and administrative expenses, and other costs associated with a late-stage, publicly-traded technology company. We anticipate significantly increasing the number of employees this year. However, this is highly dependent on the nature of our development efforts and our success in commercialization. We anticipate adding employees for research and development, as well as general and administrative functions, to support our efforts. We expect to incur consulting expenses related to technology development and other efforts as well as legal and related expenses to protect our intellectual property.  The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of progress of our commercialization and development efforts, actual needs with respect to product testing, development and research, market conditions, and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies. In addition, we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we do not have plans for any acquisitions at this time. We will have significant discretion in the use of any net proceeds. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that our technology will be accepted, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable. We believe our current cash and investments of approximately $13.8 million will provide sufficient funding for planned operations into the first half of 2016. If we do not generate adequate cash from revenues in 2016 in order to reach positive cash flows, we likely will be required to obtain additional financing to continue with our plan of commercialization. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company.  Results of Operations  The consolidated statements of operations presented in our consolidated financial statements represent the activities of (a) Resonant LLC, as predecessor company, for the period from January 1, 2013 to June 16, 2013, and  Table of Contents   Resonant LLC Resonant Inc. Period From Period From Total January 1, 2013 June 17, 2013 to Fiscal Year to June 16, 2013 December 31, 2013 2013 Period Revenue $ - $ - $ - Operating Expenses: Research and development expenses 195,403 926,095 1,121,498 General and administrative expenses 135,993 1,485,313 1,621,306 Depreciation and amortization 4,905 14,424 19,329 Total operating expenses 336,301 2,425,832 2,762,133 Operating loss (336,301 ) (2,425,832 ) (2,762,133 ) Other income (expense): Interest income (expense), net (199,961 ) (1,355,425 ) (1,555,386 ) Fair value adjustments to warrant and derivative liabilities - (4,520,736 ) (4,520,736 ) Bridge warrant expense (247,669 ) (312,486 ) (560,155 ) Other income (expense) - (333 ) (333 ) Total other income (expense) (447,630 ) (6,188,980 ) (6,636,610 ) Loss before income taxes (783,931 ) (8,614,812 ) (9,398,743 ) Provision for income taxes (800 ) (1,256 ) (2,056 ) Net loss $ (784,731 ) $ (8,616,068 ) $ (9,400,799 )  Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014  Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased from $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, or 2013, to $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, or 2014. The increase of $1.8 million is the result of the increased payroll, benefit costs, stock compensation expenses, consulting costs and development costs related to increased activity on our duplexer design under development. There were no employees until late June 2013 when we completed the Senior Convertible Note financing and we have expanded our research and development employees to 13 as of the end of December 31, 2014.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $2.9 million in 2014. The increase of $1.3 million consists primarily of payroll and related expenses associated with increased staffing following our June 2013 financing and our June 2014 IPO. The 2013 period consisted primarily of a non-cash charge of $716,000 for the fair value of the warrants issued for business consulting services. The consulting services were completed in 2013, and therefore we did not incur similar charges in 2014. Excluding the effect of the warrant charges from 2013, general and administrative expenses for 2014 increased by $2.0 million. The increase was due primarily to increased payroll, benefit costs, D&O insurance, finance costs, stock compensation and accounting expenses. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of planned growth and the costs associated with operating as a public company.  Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $201,000 from $19,000 in 2013 to $220,000 in 2014 primarily as a result of our increases in fixed assets associated with our new corporate headquarters and increase in employees in 2014 and our investment in patents.  Interest Income. Interest income increased by $28,000 from $1,000 in 2013 to $29,000 in 2014 primarily due to the increased cash balances from the net proceeds from the IPO. We expect interest income to increase modestly in 2015 as we earn interest on our increased cash balances.  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $1.2 million, from $1.6 million in 2013 to $2.8 million in 2014. The increase consists primarily of amortization and write-off of debt discounts and deferred financing costs due to the conversion of the convertible notes: $1.5 million for the Senior Convertible Notes, $151,000 for the Subordinated Convertible Note and $745,000 for the deferred financing costs. We also incurred and paid $404,000 of interest on the Senior Convertible Notes for 2014. We repaid the Bridge Loans in June 2013. The Senior Convertible Notes and the Subordinated Convertible Note were converted into common stock in June 2014 in connection with our IPO. Debt discounts and deferred financing cost amortizations ceased upon conversion of these notes.  Table of Contents  Fair Value Adjustments to Warrant and Derivative Liabilities. We recorded all of our warrant and derivative liabilities at their fair value at issuance and adjusted the liabilities quarterly to reflect changes in their fair value. Periodic adjustments to the fair value of these liabilities generated non-cash expense if they increased and non-cash income if they decreased. The fair value of these liabilities may have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter until the IPO Date. There was an increase of the fair value of the warrant and derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2013 resulting in non-cash cost of $4.5 million for 2013. For 2014, the net fair value of all these liabilities increased resulting in non-cash expense of $2.0 million for 2014. The increase in the fair value of these liabilities in 2014 is primarily due to our increasing share price and the related enterprise valuation. Due to the expiration of the redemption and put option features included in the Bridge Loan Warrants, Financing Warrant and Consulting Warrant as of the IPO Date and the conversion of the Senior Convertible Notes upon the IPO which terminated the derivative liability, there will be no further fair value adjustments of such warrants and derivative liabilities in the future.  Warrant Expense. We incurred bridge warrant expense of $560,000 in 2013 and none in 2014. This represents the non-cash expense associated with the original issuance of the Bridge Loan Warrants in the first quarter of 2013 by Resonant LLC. We repaid the Bridge Loans in June 2013. Consequently, we did not incur any bridge warrant expense in 2014 and will not incur further expense for these warrants.  Other Income. Other income consisted of a $1.2 million non-cash gain from the write-off of the derivative liability associated with our Senior Convertible Notes. Due to the conversion of these notes, the derivative liability balance was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with a portion recognized as a gain and classified in other income for 2014. Consequently, we will not incur any further charges associated with fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative liability.  Income Taxes. We have no revenues and are currently operating at a loss. Consequently, our only tax liabilities for both periods were for minimum taxes in the States where we conduct business.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities  We have earned no revenue since inception. Our operations have been funded with capital contributions, debt and equity.  We began operations in July 2012 with initial capital contributions from our founders and STI. The founders contributed $200,000 and agreed to work full-time without pay until we secured adequate funding. STI contributed a patent portfolio, software, equipment, temporary office space and an early version of our first development agreement. The founders received Class B units in Resonant LLC, but later exchanged their Class B units for common stock of Resonant Inc. STI received Class C units in Resonant LLC, but later exchanged its Class C units for the $2.4 million Subordinated Convertible Note of Resonant Inc.  The Bridge Loans provided $200,000 of additional funding during the first and second quarters of 2013.  We raised $6.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of Senior Convertible Notes in June 2013, and we used part of the proceeds to repay the Bridge Loans. In June 2014, we sold 3,105,000 shares of common stock in an IPO generating net proceeds of $16.2 million.  We had current assets of $13.9 million and current liabilities of $720,000 at December 31, 2014, resulting in working capital of $13.2 million. This compares to a working capital deficit of $8.8 million at December 31, 2013. The change in working capital is primarily the result of the net proceeds from our IPO and the related conversion of all outstanding notes to common stock.  Our principal sources of liquidity consist of existing cash balances and investments of $13.8 million. We believe our current resources will provide sufficient funding for planned operations into the first half of 2016. If we do not generate adequate cash from revenues in 2016 in order to reach positive cash flows, we likely will be required to obtain additional financing to continue with our plan of commercialization. There is no assurance that additional financing (public or private) will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced. New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise any needed funds, we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company.  Table of Contents  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The factors described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.  Cash Flow Analysis  The consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements represent the activities of (a) Resonant LLC, as predecessor company, for the period from January 1, 2013 to June 16, 2013, and  Operating activities used cash of $162,000 for the period from January 1, 2013 to June 16, 2013, $1.9 million for the period from June 17, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily the result of increased expenses following our first financing in June 2013 and an increase in costs associated with being a public company. These cash uses were partially offset by non-cash related costs for stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments for the warrants and the derivative liability, amortization of deferred financing and debt discount costs.  Investing activities used cash of $76,000 for the period from January 1, 2013 to June 16, 2013, $321,000 for the period from June 17, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $8.7 million in 2014 consisted primarily of an $8.0 million investment of excess cash balances in a short-term debt instrument, the build-out of our new corporate headquarters, the purchase of equipment and computers due to the increase in employees in 2014 and our investment in patents.  Financing activities provide cash of $201,000 for the period from January 1, 2013 to June 16, 2013, $5.5 million for the period from June 17, 2013 to December 31, 2013, and $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 2013 figures are primarily the result of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Convertible Notes in June 2013. For 2014, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the proceeds from our IPO of $18.6 million offset by $2.4 million in cash expended for IPO costs in 2014.  Off-Balance Sheet Transactions  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements  Indemnification Agreements  In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of stockholders' equity (deficit) or consolidated statements of cash flows.  Operating Leases  We lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Santa Barbara, California and our office in Burlingame, California, under operating lease agreements that expire through July 2017. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods.  Commitments  As of December 31, 2014, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under the operating leases for our offices. The following table summarizes our future minimum payments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2014:  Table of Contents   Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Operating lease commitments $ 411,000 $ 183,000 $ 228,000 None None  Mar 27, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
