IA  (イア) is a Japanese VOCALOID developed and distributed by 1st Place Co., Ltd., and was released in January 2012 for the VOCALOID3 engine. Her voice is provided by the Japanese female singer-songwriter, Lia, known for "Tori no Uta". In July 2016, an English voicebank was confirmed to be in the works.[1][2]


ConceptEdit
IA is the first vocal in the "- ARIA ON THE PLANETES -" project.[3]
The design philosophy 1st Place worked toward was to make the voice simple and straightforward but easy to adjust and customize, letting creators create their own version of IA.[4]

EtymologyEdit
"IA" is taken from her voice provider's name, "Lia".
There are at least two ways to read her projects name of "- ARIA ON THE PLANETES -":

 The words "Aria" and "Planetes" are Latin and Greek for "open space" and "planet" respectively, giving the translation of "Open Space on the Planet".
 "Aria", is also the Italian word for "air" and is used as a term in opera for expressive pieces, usually sung by a single singer. This also fits in with her more opera-esque vocal results compared to other released Japanese Vocaloids.

When she was first released, overseas fans often mistook "Aria" as the name of the Vocaloid.

AppearanceEdit
Her design was illustrated by Aka Akasaka (D. Z.), while the design direction was by Maxilla Inc.[5]  It was decided that they would go for soft colours instead of Vivid ones.  At the time, there was skepticism towards avoiding vivid colours as there was a fear of her not selling because of the softer tones.  Lia herself wanted her to be cute and pretty and was satisfied the first time she was shown the artwork.[6]
Despite the myth of IA's age being 15, she has had no age assigned to her. This myth seems to originate from a section underneath the paragraph on IA about her provider Lia, wherein one of the first things mentioned was that Lia debuted in America at 15 years old.

RelationsEdit
ONE; is a vocal created for CeVIO able to talk as well as sing. She is the second vocal in the "- ARIA ON THE PLANETES -" project.

Additional informationEdit
MarketingEdit
   The garage kit IA  
Information on IA was released much slower than the average VOCALOID. Her promotions have taken the approach to make her seem otherworldly and mysterious.
The licensing for IA is slightly different than past VOCALOIDs, and it is worth taking the time to read this page for more details. Unlike some past VOCALOIDs, users can use her image on CDs, flyers and posters without requesting permission, although some consent from the company is needed for greater use of her image. This is a departure from past VOCALOIDs such as Crypton Future Media, who require you to ask permission for use of their VOCALOIDs' images on things such as CDs, flyers and posters.
1st Place likes collaborations between their company and others. Their marketing style was designed to introduce IA to people unfamiliar with VOCALOID, expanding their audience.[7]

IA's character status








 Reaction



IA developed a good reputation as a reliable voicebank library among many producers, this owed to much of her success. IA was well received and had many hits in the Nico Nico Douga weekly rankings after her release. 
Within 6 months of her release, several songs hit 1,000,000+ views on Nico Nico Douga, whereas none of the other VOCALOID3 vocals achieved success of this caliber until December 2014 when Yuzuki Yukari managed to achieve her first 1,000,000 song. This put her on par with some of the more successful VOCALOID2 era voicebanks. Lia herself was reported as surprised when she became popular as she did not expect her to do so well.  She also commented on how there were many fans of IA who did not even know who she (Lia) was.[6]
On 1st July 2015, it was announced that her playback of related videos had reached 100 million, views were coming in from both Japan and abroad.  She had also experienced several live performances in Taiwan, France and North America.  This lead to the release of her official app.[8][9]



 Impact



IA's popularity has lead to further vocal development being considered for her and in 2014, IA-ARIA ON THE PLANETES - α Type C was released as a trial version via a one-month long feedback campaign. Several months later, it was announced that the finalized version of the new vocal library would be made available for sale in June of the same year. Her popularity also allowed her to expand into other languages. In mid-2016, an English vocal was announced.



 Miscellaneous



A survey released in 2015 in relation to the popularity of the Vocaloids on website Nico Video revealed IA was the 4th most popular Vocaloid for 2014.[10]

About BPI
Respect and Dignity
We believe in developing and maintaining meaningful and effective partnerships by fulfilling our commitments, preserving an atmosphere of respect and dignity, and sustaining a high level of character and integrity.
We don’t call this value engineering or performance service management, we call it our responsibility.










Quality Products
BPI constantly searches the marketplace for new, innovative,
and value producing products. This process includes customer feedback, competitive research, need-in-the-market evaluation, and value proposition. Suppliers are based not only on products, but also what they can provide for our customers.









Customer Focused
We believe providing solutions and support is what sets us apart and gives our customers an advantage. We strive in building personal relationships with customers, knowing their business needs, and providing education opportunities. Establishing corporate strategies that align with our customers’ needs and long-term partnerships is crucial to BPI’s longevity in the building materials industry.









Expert Sales Staff
Our sales staff are seasoned veterans of the building products industry. Importantly, they go through product knowledge courses and plant/warehouse tours on a consistent basis, allowing them
to be as astute as possible on all of our products. Not only do we provide continuing education for our customers, but we provide it for all sales staff as well.









Logistic Support
BPI products are delivered on 53’ curtain-side trailers, powered by environmentally friendly diesel trucks, reaching most customers on a multiple-day delivery schedule. Our products are processed via the Warehouse Management System and a large portion of products are shipped on racks or pallets for easy-off loading. We consider our drivers as the most courteous, and professional in the industry - they are true ambassadors of BPI.

	Impro, innovators in agriculture for nearly a half a century, would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our company. Impro had its beginning with the discovery of the theory of limited isolation housing and how it could translate to healthier, thriftier calves. This discovery led to the 1958 published research by James S. Collins titled “The Principle of Isolation – It’s Application in Animal Husbandry”. Subsequently Impro Products designed, constructed and copyrighted the first “Calfloo” in 1961. To this day, many universities and companies have taken these original findings and have altered the original design to fit their own specific needs.

	Although Impro Products never chose to capitalize commercially on the invention of the “Calfloo”, the philosophy of observing and working with nature to strive for peak production performance has resulted in the development of a number of products and programs that we recommend for achieving this end. We believe that only a healthy animal can produce at its genetic capacity, and that the key to production is proper care and nutrition throughout an animal’s life.

	Please feel free to browse our available product line and if you would like more information on how to implement the use of these products into your daily routines or would just like to talk to a dealer regarding your specific situation send us an email or give us a call.
