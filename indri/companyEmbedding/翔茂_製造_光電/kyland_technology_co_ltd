        Description    


KYLAND has manufactured this entry-level managed industrial Ethernet switch SICOM2024M, specifically for industrial purposes. Equipped with 24 10/100Base-T(X) and 4 100Base-FX ports. Also noted for carrying Kyvision 3.0 management software. Switch is perfect for hazardous industrial applications because of its overcurrent, overvoltage and EMC protection, top-performing switch engine, extremely efficient,  single-rib-shape, strong case. Of all the features of the device, they key features include 24 10/100Base-TX RJ45 ports, 4 100Base-FX SM/MM ports, RSTP support and power failure support feature. Both front and rear panel mounting. The industrial level system not only exceeds IEC61850-3 and IEEE1613 specifications, but exceeds. With its redundancy technology, it allows for RSTP support. There is a multicats protocol which supports IGMP Snooping, GMRP and static multicast. Network partition supports VLAN and PVLAN. The service quality of the switch supports QoS. With bandwidth management, there is support of port trunking, port speed limit and broadcast storm control

HSR is a further development of the PRP



approach, although HSR functions primarily as



a protocol for creating media redundancy



while PRP creates network redundancy.



Compared with PRP, HSR makes best usage of



one network and...

HSR High-availability Seamless Redundancy



HSR provides zero recovery time in case of failure of one component. It is suited for



applications that demand high availability and very short reaction time. Such applications are
