　802.11 b/g WLAN, Bluetooth Combo Module IC

Brief：
  The IEEE 802.11 b/g WLAN, Bluetooth Combo module IC, AW-GH381, is targeted to mobile devices including Mobile Phones, Digital Still
Cameras (DSCs), Portable Media Players (PMPs), Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and Gaming Devices which need small footprint package, low power consumption, multiple interfaces and OS support. By using AW-GH381, customers can easily enable Wi-Fi and BT embedded applications with the benefits of high design flexibility, short development cycle, and quick time-to market.

Compliance with the IEEE 802.11b/g standard, AW-GH381 uses Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), DBPSK, DQPSK, CCK and QAM baseband modulation technologies. A high level of integration and full implementation of the power management functions specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard minimize the system power requirements by using AW-GH381. In addition to the support of WPA/WPA2 and WEP 64-bit and 128-bit encryption, AW-GH381 also supports the IEEE 802.11i security standard through the implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)/Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP), and WEP with TKIP security mechanisms.

AW-GH381 also supports IPSec with DES/3DES/ASE encryption and MD5/SHA-1 authentication. In the future, AW-AH381 would support WAPI (WLAN authentication and privacy infrastructure) security standard. AW-AH381 is capable of WAPI/ WAPI+Wi-Fi / WAPI+Wi-Fi+Bluetooth multifunction and easily applied in hand-held devices.

MicroAP (Micro Access Point) cost-effectively creates a smaller-scale WLAN for real-time data access without the need for an Ethernet or wired connection. AW-GH381 would also support this function in the future. The MicroAP extends your enterprise-wide network by bridging mobile units to a wireless wide area network– keeping the handheld computers of public safety, transportation and other personal in communication with your base station.

For video, voice and multimedia applications, AW-GH381 support 802.11e Quality of Service (QoS).

For Bluetooth operation, the AW-GH381 supports Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed (HS) and is complaint with Bluetooth 2.1 + Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). Bluetooth 3.0 + HS can make it easier to connect devices with lower power consumption and improved security. The customer can base on different system to select WLAN/BT single antenna or WLAN/BT use different antennas.

  
　Wireless TV Satellite

Brief：
  AzureWave AD?SW200 is a wireless FTA DVB?S receiver. AD?SW 200 receives DVB?S signal from satellite dish then transmits transport stream to PC by 802.11n WiFi in USB package format. The USB based BDA driver of AD?SW 200 is installed on the PC as a normal USB device because WiFi replaces the USB cable.

Introducing Driver Matic.  In May 2007, PC Pitstop announced a revolutionary technology called Driver Matic.  
						Driver Matic allows the installation of a driver with the click of a button.  Prior to Driver Matic, all drivers had to be installed differently and required significant user involvement.  
						Now with Driver Matic, a PC can have up to date drivers automatically.  Driver Matic has been integrated into both PC Matic and Driver Alert 2.0.  
						Driver Matic finally has made it simple and easy to keep your drivers up to date.  Only at PC Pitstop.
To find the latest driver for your computer we recommend running our Free Driver Scan.
Find out how to make your computer faster by running our Free Performance Scan.


Tips from the PitCrew

If a hardware device isn't functioning properly, or if a program or game that you're installing states that it requires newer drivers, a driver update will be in order. 
Also, with many wireless adapters it is important to stay current as updates often contain security fixes. A driver update may also improve stability and performance, or may fix issues with games, programs and power management.
New drivers can unlock additional features for a device that may not have been available before. If you receive notification from a program or a manufacturer that a newer driver is available, it would be a good idea to check the release notes and see what’s different than the driver you’re already using.
