History


Hitachi had been manufacturing fans, electric refrigerators, coolers and well pumps since before World War II. However, the desires for household appliances only began in the late 1950s in Japan.
Hitachi released its first television model in 1956 under an affiliate brand, Showa Denshi (currently known as Kokusai Electric Inc). During that time, Hitachi was not well known for its home appliances as compared to Kansai manufacturers. To counter this, Hitachi managed to secure the right to advertise on the Tsutenkaku Tower in return for supporting its construction costs. Television then, was a popular topic among the consumers. Hence, Hitachi advertised on all four sides with "Hitachi Television", "Hitachi Pumps", "Hitachi Motors" and "Hitachi Lamps".
Hitachi's product range was extended to include light bulbs, fluorescent lamps, vacuum cleaners, room coolers, transistor radios, tape recorders and electric heating appliances. In 1957, Hitachi Home Electric Appliance Geppuhanbai (currently known as Hitachi Capital Corporation) was established to promote sales in Tokyo and Osaka. As the average annual income of a salaried professional was low due to economic recession, Hitachi started allowing convenient monthly installment purchasing of its products. After an economic growth, ordinary people are able to enrich their lives with one highly sought-after appliance after another through monthly installment payments.

A 100kW photovoltaic power system was installed on the roof of the new production building. Its operation status can be seen live from a large monitor.
Tokyo Works, Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc. is situated in Kodaira, Tokyo, an area that is still reminiscent of the Musashino region. Tokyo Works is engaged in the development, design, and manufacture of communication and information, broadcasting and video system products. The factory has achieved 100% registration rate in electronic manifests in Japan, to clarify the flow of waste treatment. The factory has promoted recycling and the reduction of discharged waste, and has achieved zero emission* since FY 2008. The new production building that was constructed in FY 2013 is an environmentally conscious Eco-Factory that uses high efficiency LEDs for all lighting. In addition, a 100kW photovoltaic power system was installed on the roof. Its operation status is displayed live on large monitors set up in 3 locations throughout the premises. Allowing visiting customers and employees to see its status at all times leads to the increase of environmental awareness.


*
Zero emission: Defined as a final disposal rate (landfill disposal/waste) of less than 0.5 percent in any given year.
