About Invengo’s Smartspot / Overhead Reader OfferingImagine you’re easily able to identify and localize people or products in and around your building. With Invengo-Intellifi Smartspots you can realize this by creating a so called smartspot, a location & identification enabled hotspot. The solution comprises of smartspots, tags and the Brain web services to make the information easily available to users. In order to be triggered by a smartspot, people and products are equipped with a small passive RAIN RFID tag that can be easily integrated in a badge, a card, or any other product or package.
People can also be identified by a Bluetooth LE phone. Together with the Brain web services and Apps, the information gathered by the system becomes directly available through smartphones, tablets, webpages and any Office applications.
