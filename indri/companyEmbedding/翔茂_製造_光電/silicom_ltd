IS40 Silicom 40G /10G Intelligent Bypass Switch Description Silicom 40G Intelligent Bypass switch (IS40) is Silicom second generation of an active external Bypass switch that protects network integrity from network failures and network maintenance. The Silicom intelligent Bypass switch (IS40) is a self-generating heartbeat and controls the network switch mode of operation. The Silicom IS40G1U is a 1U host system which supports up to three modules. The 1U host sytem can support mix of 40G Bypass module and dual rate 10G/1G Bypass modules. A 40G module supports one Bypass segment per module. A dual rate 10G/1G Bypass module supports two Bypass segment in a module. The Silicom IS40 supports 40 Gigabit Ethernet Multimode Fiber (40GBase-SR4) and 40 Gigabit Single mode fiber (40GBaseLR4) network standards. Each 40G Bypass module includes two MPO / LC ports for network ports, and two QSFP+ ports for the attached in-line network system. The Silicom IS40 supports dual rate 10/1 Gigabit Ethernet Multimode Fiber (10GBase-SR , 1000Base-SX) and 10/1 Gigabit Single mode fiber (10GBase-LR, 1000Base-LX) network standards. Each 10G Bypass module Network includes four LC Duplex Monitor ports and four SFP+ ports for the attached in-line network system. The Silicom Intelligent Bypass switch (IS40) supports four modes of operations: Inline, Bypass, Tap andLinkdrop. In Inline mode, the IS40 diverts inline network traffic to attached in-line network system. In Bypass mode, the IS40 does not divert the traffic to the attached in-line network system and diverts it to other network link. In Tap mode, incoming traffic in port NET0 is mirrored to port MON0 and incoming traffic in port NET1 is mirrored to port MON1.In Linkdrop mode the IS40 disables the links on the network ports (NET0, NET1). The IS40 simulates switch / router cable disconnection. The IS40 generates the heartbeat packets and transmits the heartbeat packet to the in-line Monitor / Network appliance port, the Monitor Network appliance receives the heartbeat packets and transmits is to its other port (bridges the heartbeat packet). The IBS40 detects back the heartbeat packet and maintains the Inline mode. The IS40 sets to Bypass, Tap or Linkdrop when it does not receive back the heartbeat packet from the Network / Monitor appliance. When the Network / Monitor appliance recovers, it transmits back the heartbeat packet and the Intelligent switch sets to Inline. The IS40 bypasses its Ethernet Monitor ports on event of power failure, Link failure, in-line software application system hang or user request. The IS40 includes Double Bypass Safe architecture. The Silicom Double Bypass safe architecture is based on two Bypass routing circuitry: An Active Bypass circuitry and Passive Bypass circuitry. If the internal active bypass routing circuitry fails, the passive Bypass routing circuitry is activated. The IS40 can be configured using: Simple CLI configuration management via a serial communication console port, Ethernet port using Telnet • or SSH • Web interface management interface • SNMP The Silicom IS40 Bypass switch includes centralized management to all Bypass segments in the box. The IS40G includes two redundant 90 – 240 V AC power supply or two redundant -48 DC power supply.
