        Description    


Application of the EFOY ProEnergyBox

The EFOY ProEnergyBox has been developed for use in all climate scenarios at temperatures from - 40 °C to + 50 °C (- 40 °F to + 122 °F).
Long autonomy  available in two sizes

The EFOY ProEnergyBox is available in two sizes. In the smaller EFOY ProEnergyBox one EFOY Pro fuel cell generator and up to two M28 fuel cartridges can be integrated. The larger EFOY ProEnergyBox has space for two EFOY Pro fuel cell generators and up to four M28 fuel cartridges. A long autonomy without any user intervention is warranted.

Brunnthal/Munich, Germany, October 14, 2010
SFC Energy AG, technology and market leader for mobile and off-grid power
solutions based on fuel cells, is announcing the international product launch
of the JENNY ND Terra. This portable plug & play solution for off-grid energy
supplies is based on the commercially-successful JENNY product family by SFC,
which has won numerous awards. The JENNY ND Terra has been specially
developed as a standalone, non-detectable, long-term energy supply for defense
and security applications and reliably supplies energy for the most sophisticated
applications. This compact and flexible fuel cell system has been designed for
mobile use or for observation directly in the field of action. As it is weatherproof,
it is suitable for both external use under harshest climatic conditions, as well as
for deployment underground. The JENNY ND Terra reliably provides electricity
for undercover monitoring, reconnaissance, and property protection. It is already
used by leading defense organizations as a lightweight, quiet and non-detectable
source of power in the field.
Like all product solutions by SFC, this integrated system solution is based on a
hybrid concept of fuel cell, fuel cartridge, and battery. Every electrical device can
be locally supplied with power as required through the SFC Power Manager, the
universal interface with all available electricity sources and consumers. The
system's 2.5-liter fuel cartridge has a capacity of 2,750 Wh. The same quantity of
energy in classic lead batteries or lithium-ion batteries would weigh about 90 kg
and 18 kg respectively. With a total weight of about 10.5 kg, the system is
designed so that it can be transported by a single individual, and is immediately
ready for use wherever and whenever required.
"We are very pleased to be able to present a further complete solution for reliable
off-grid power supplies in the JENNY ND Terra," says Dr. Peter Podesser, CEO of
SFC Energy AG. "The fact that JENNY ND Terra is already being used by leading
defense organizations at an international level obviously shows once again the
clear technological edge of our products. This solution guarantees reliable, nondetectable,
long-term energy supply, and is making a significant contribution to
increases in operational security."

SFC Energy will demonstrate JENNY ND Terra during Future Soldier in Prague,
Czech Republic, booth 213, hall 2, October 14-16, 2010 and during AUSA Annual
Meeting & Exposition in Washington, D.C., USA, German Pavilion, booth 960,
October 25-27, 2010.
