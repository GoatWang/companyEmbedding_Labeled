Add markup to your product pages so Google can provide detailed product information in
      rich Search results — including Image Search. Users can see price, availability, and
      review ratings right on Search results.
Using markup to enable rich product results lets you attract potential buyers while
    they are searching for items to buy on Google or images that include products you sell. Maintain the accuracy and freshness of your
        product information, so your customers find the relevant, current items they're looking for.
      
This page explains how to mark up your product information so that Google can display rich
      snippets. There are two types of pages where you would typically use this markup:

a product page that describes a single product
a shopping aggregator page that lists a single product, along with information about
        different sellers offering that product 

Examples

Guidelines
Product rich results provide users with information about a specific
      product, such as its price, availability, and reviewer ratings.
      The following guidelines apply to product markup:

Use markup for a specific product, not a category or list of products.
        For example, “shoes in our shop” is not a specific product.
        See also our
        
        structured data policies for multiple entities on the same page.
      
Adult-related products are not supported. 
Reviewer’s name needs
        to be a valid name for a Person or Team For example, "James Smith" or"CNET Reviewers."
        By contrast, "50% off on Black Friday" is invalid.
      

To include product information in Image Search, follow these guidelines for required markup:

To show your product information in the rich image viewer: Include the
        name, image, price, and priceCurrency properties.
        Alternatively, instead of price and priceCurrency, you can include
        any four properties and exclude  price.
To show your product information in the Related Items feature: Include the
        name, image, price, priceCurrency, and
        availability properties.
