COMPANY


Overview  
International TechneGroup Incorporated was founded in 1983 by the late Dr. Jason "Jack" Lemon with a mission to help manufacturers drive innovation and time to market by applying computer-aided product development to engineering problems. Since then, the increased use of product development software and engineering systems across the enterprise created complex integration and interoperability obstacles that our clients could not overcome on their own. Today, ITI is the global leader providing reliable interoperability, validation and migration solutions for product data and related systems.

What We Do
To remain competitive, manufacturers are implementing model-based enterprise, advanced simulation and PLM initiatives supported by best-in-class engineering systems. When product data interoperability issues threaten to impede the progress of these initiatives, you need a partner with proven experience. We are product data interoperability experts specializing in conversion, integration, validation and migration solutions.
Our customers recognize the value in having a trusted solution partner that provides more than just software. ITI solves complex product data interoperability problems so that the world’s leading manufacturers can focus on making great products.
You need to keep your engineering initiatives moving forward. Let ITI help you create momentum.
  


Customer success
Our customers say it best.
