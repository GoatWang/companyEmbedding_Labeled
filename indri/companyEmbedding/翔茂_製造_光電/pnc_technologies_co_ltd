The automatic
circuit recloser “PNC-RC type” is designed for use on overhead lines as
well as substation applications for 15kV, 27kV and 38kV respectively.
The recloser is
supplied with the controller named FTU-R200  which is a microprocessor-based RTU that provides the protection, fault
detection, remote control, data gathering and communication function in the
capacity of control devices inherently reliable and intelligent.
The recloser
combines the high reliability of vacuum interruption and high dielectric
strength of SF6, in a compact, maintenance-free unit. The magnetic actuator
provides consistent performance and high reliability.

Product Detail Information
Introduction
The automatic circuit recloser “PNC-RC type” is designed for use on overhead lines as well as substation applications for 15kV, 27kV and 38kV respectively.
The recloser is supplied with the controller named FTU-R200 which is a microprocessor-based RTU that provides the protection, fault detection, remote control, data gathering and communication function in the capacity of control devices inherently reliable and intelligent.
The recloser combines the high reliability of vacuum interruption and high dielectric strength of SF6, in a compact, maintenance-free unit. The magnetic actuator provides consistent performance and high reliability.
Key Features
-  Porcelain or Silicon rubber(option) bushing
-  Long mechanical and interrupting life
(10,000 C-O operation)
-  No maintenance needed during its entire lifetime.
-  Fast & Delayed auto reclosing capability
(up to 4 shots)
-  Easy SCADA connectivity
(DNP 3.0/IEC 60870-5-101,104)
-  High interrupting capacity and compact design.
-  High-pressure-relief device for safety.
-  Mechanical & Electronic control interlock for low gas-pressure
-  Phase Fault, Ground Fault, SEF detection, protection (Over current)
- Built-In 3 CT’s & 6 VT’s for all Electric measurements
