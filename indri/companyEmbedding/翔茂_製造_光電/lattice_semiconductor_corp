Every time the super cluster allocator is used, there is an incremental delay of t
tor is used, all destinations other than the one being steered to, are given the value of ground (i.e., if the super clus-
ter is steered to M (n+4), then M (n) is ground).
Macrocell
The 16 macrocells in the GLB are driven by the 16 outputs from the logic allocator. Each macrocell contains a pro-
grammable XOR gate, a programmable register/latch, along with routing for the logic and control functions.
Figure 5 shows a graphical representation of the macrocell. The macrocells feed the ORP and GRP. A direct input
from the I/O cell allows designers to use the macrocell to construct high-speed input registers. A programmable
delay in this path allows designers to choose between the fastest possible set-up time and zero hold time.

The clock input to the ﬂip-ﬂop can select any of the four block clocks along with the shared PT clock, and true and

DVI (Digital Visual Interface) and HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) have emerged as the dominant standards for connecting digital display devices like a PC monitor and HDTV. DVI only carries uncompressed video data, whereas HDMI can transfer both uncompressed digital video and multi-channel audio over a single cable. Developed specifically to address the unique requirements of the consumer electronics market, HDMI offers additional enhancements including the support of the YCbCr color space format, and the universal remote control capability through Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) protocol. HDMI-enabled display devices are backward-compatible with DVI-based PCs so users can display the PC contents on their HDTV.
DVI is a video interface standard created by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) to replace the legacy analog VGA connector standard. It is designed for carrying uncompressed digital video data to a display. This reference design focuses on DVI-D mode. DVI handles a single-link bandwidth up to 165MHz and thus supports UXGA and HDTV with resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 at 60Hz. Higher resolutions can be supported with reduced blanking periods or with a dual-link connection.
HDMI is an industry-supported, all-digital audio/video interface for transmitting both uncompressed digital video and multi-channel audio over a single connector and cable that replaces various cables behind the home entertainment center. HDMI can carry eight channels of 192KHz, 24-bit uncompressed audio, or any flavor of compressed audio format such as Dolby or DTS. HDMI has the capacity to support existing high-definition video formats such as 720p, 1080i, and 1080p. Because HDMI is electrically compatible with the DVI signal, no signal conversion is required, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used.
Reference Designs
Two separate reference designs are implemented for demonstration:

features the HDMI interface 
features the DVI interface 

Both reference designs have been validated using the LatticeECP3 Video Protocol Board and HDMI Mezzanine Card. The reference design consists of the HDMI Transmitter and Receiver cores which are compatible with both HDMI and DVI physical layer protocols. You can use this design to evaluate the SERDES-based HDMI/DVI physical layer solution for your specific application.
HDMI Loopback Demonstration
In the loopback demonstration, the incoming HDMI signal is split into the video and data components and looped back through the output. In addition to this various maipulations are possible on both the data as well as the video.

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]
Operations[edit]




Former company headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon


In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]

In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]
