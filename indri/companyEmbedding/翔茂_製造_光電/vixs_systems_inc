Introducing Driver Matic.  In May 2007, PC Pitstop announced a revolutionary technology called Driver Matic.  
						Driver Matic allows the installation of a driver with the click of a button.  Prior to Driver Matic, all drivers had to be installed differently and required significant user involvement.  
						Now with Driver Matic, a PC can have up to date drivers automatically.  Driver Matic has been integrated into both PC Matic and Driver Alert 2.0.  
						Driver Matic finally has made it simple and easy to keep your drivers up to date.  Only at PC Pitstop.

Tips from the PitCrew

If a hardware device isn't functioning properly, or if a program or game that you're installing states that it requires newer drivers, a driver update will be in order. 
Also, with many wireless adapters it is important to stay current as updates often contain security fixes. A driver update may also improve stability and performance, or may fix issues with games, programs and power management.
New drivers can unlock additional features for a device that may not have been available before. If you receive notification from a program or a manufacturer that a newer driver is available, it would be a good idea to check the release notes and see what’s different than the driver you’re already using.

ViXS Launches the XConnex™ Brand for Networking and Communication Products


September 9 2011

Download this Press Release ()


ViXS® XConnex™ supports complete system solutions, enables advanced home networking and communications, and complements ViXS’ media processing XCode™ products

Toronto, CANADA - September 09, 2011. ViXS Systems Inc. today announced a new product category under the brand XConnex. XConnex products are focused on developing advanced home networking and communication products optimized to work with ViXS’ video technologies in the XCode family of networked media processing products.
"The XConnex brand is a strategic part of our product and technology portfolio as it extends ViXS’ leadership and capabilities in delivering end-to-end system solutions", said Sally Daub, president and CEO of ViXS Systems. "ViXS’ customers will deliver cutting edge products more quickly to market when they leverage the optimized platform that combines ViXS’ XConnex products, XCode media processors, and XtensivTM software suite".
The XConnex XC1020 Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) Ethernet-over-Coax Bridge (ECB) announced by ViXS last month was the first product to launch under the new brand. The XConnex XC1025 MoCA 1.1 companion IC is another new device in the XConnex portfolio.
The XC1025 can be paired with other System on Chip (SoC) solutions that do not have an integrated MoCA and gives customers significant bill of material advantages over existing solutions. The XC1025 has an extensive feature list, including integrated Ethernet PHY, integrated memory eliminating the need for external DDR memory, and an integrated microprocessor providing end-to-end bridging with all firmware running on the SoC. The XC1025 supports the key features of MoCA 1.1, such as 175+ Mbps throughput, 16-node support, quality of service (QoS), packet level encryption, and co-existence with cable or satellite services.
ViXS will be demonstrating the XConnex MoCA solution at IBC 2011.
