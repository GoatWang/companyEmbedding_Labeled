PART I






Item 1.  Description of Business.



The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on
September 21, 1989 under the name Fulton Ventures, Inc.  On July
18, 1990, the Company changed its name to Triad Warranty
Corporation, Inc., and on May 22, 2000, the Company changed its
name to GTM Holdings, Inc.  Since 1993, the Company has not
engaged in any business operations.  At the present time, the
Company intends to seek, investigate, and if warranted, acquire
an interest in a business opportunity.  The Company does not
propose to restrict its search for a business opportunity to any
particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore,
engage in essentially any business in any industry.  The Company
has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a
business opportunity, subject to the availability of such
opportunities, economic conditions and other factors.


The selection of a business opportunity in which to
participate is complex and extremely risky and will be made by
management in the exercise of its business judgment.  There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to identify and acquire
any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be
beneficial to the Company and its shareholders.


The activities of the Company are subject to several
significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact
that the Company has no specific business and may acquire or
participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of
management which will, in all probability, act without the
consent, vote, or approval of the Company's shareholders.



Sources of Opportunities



It is anticipated that business opportunities may be
available to the Company from various sources, including its
officers and directors, professional advisers, securities broker-
dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community,
and others who may present unsolicited proposals.


The Company will seek a potential business opportunity from
all known sources, but will rely principally on personal contacts
of its officers and directors as well as indirect associations
between them and other business and professional people.
Although the Company does not anticipate engaging professional
firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations,
if management deems it in the best interests of the Company, such
firms may be retained.  In some instances, the Company may
publish notices or advertisements seeking a potential business
opportunity in financial or trade publications.



Criteria



The Company will not restrict its search to any particular
business, industry or geographical location.  The Company may
acquire a business opportunity or enter into a business in any
industry and in any stage of development.  The Company may enter
into a business or opportunity involving a "start up" or new
company.  The Company may acquire a business opportunity in
various stages of its operation.


In seeking a business venture, the decision of management of
the Company will not be controlled by an attempt to take
advantage of an anticipated or perceived appeal of a specific
industry, management group, or product or industry, but will be
based upon the business objective of seeking long-term capital
appreciation in the real value of the Company.


In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management
will consider such matters as the available technical, financial
and managerial resources; working capital and other financial
requirements;


2





the history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; the
nature of present and expected competition; the quality and
experience of management services which may be available and the
depth of the management; the potential for further research,
development or exploration; the potential for growth and
expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public
recognition or acceptance of products, services, trade or service
marks, name identification; and other relevant factors.


Generally, the Company will analyze all available factors in
the circumstances and make a determination based upon a composite
of available facts, without reliance upon any single factor as
controlling.



Methods of Participation of Acquisition



Specific business opportunities will be reviewed and, on the
basis of that review, the legal structure or method of
participation deemed by management to be suitable will be
selected.  Such structures and methods may include, but are not
limited to, leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint
ventures, other contractual arrangements, and may involve a
reorganization, merger or consolidation transaction.  The Company
may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a
partnership, corporation, or other form of organization.



Procedures



As part of the Company's investigation of business
opportunities, officers and directors may meet personally with
management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business
opportunity, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain
independent analysis or verification of certain information
provided, check references of management and key personnel, and
conduct other reasonable measures.


The Company will generally request that it be provided with
written materials regarding the business opportunity containing
such items as a description of product, service and company
history; management resumes; financial information; available
projections with related assumptions upon which they are based;
an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of
existing patents, trademarks or service marks or rights thereto;
present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a
description of transactions between the prospective entity and
its affiliates; relevant analysis of risks and competitive
conditions; a financial plan of operation and estimated capital
requirements; and other information deemed relevant.



Competition



The Company expects to encounter substantial competition in
its efforts to acquire a business opportunity.  The primary
competition is from other companies organized and funded for
similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and
corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy
individuals.



Employees



The Company does not currently have any employees but relies
upon the efforts of its officers and directors to conduct the
business of the Company.






Item 2.  Description of Property.



The Company does not own any property.  The Company
currently utilizes office space, free of charge, from its
officers and directors.


3









Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.



None.






Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Securities Holders.



No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year covered by this report to a vote of security holders.







PART II






Item 5.  Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.



The Company's common stock is listed on the Over the Counter
Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"), under the symbol "GTMH".  As of
February 27, 2001, the Company had 42 shareholders holding
2,299,886 shares of common stock.

The Company has never declared a dividend on its Common
Stock.  The Company has not paid, nor declared, any dividends
since its inception and does not intend to declare any such
dividends in the foreseeable future.  The Company's ability to
pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by Nevada law.
Under Nevada law, dividends may be paid to the extent that the
corporation's assets exceed its liabilities and it is able to pay
its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.



Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds:



The Company reported on Forms 10-QSB for the quarters ended
June 30, 2000 and September 30, 2000 that it had issued 2,000,000
and 35,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to reimburse
related parties for Company expenses paid by the related parties
in the amount of $36,790 and $560, respectively.  However, the
most recent audit shows the actual and correct amount of expenses
paid by the related parties to be $44,890 and $786, respectively.
As stated in the quarterly reports, the shares issued were not in
connection with any public offering, no commissions were paid,
and the Company


4





relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act to effect the
transaction.






Item 6.  Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of
Operation.



The Company generated no revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999.


General and administrative expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $43,894 and $0, respectively.
This increase is attributable to the administrative, legal,
professional, accounting and auditing costs associated with
reviving the Company from dormancy and bringing it current with
the reporting requirements pursuant to Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Due to the foregoing, the Company realized a net operating
loss of $43,894 for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to
no loss or gain for the year ended December 31, 1999.  The
Company does not expect to generate any meaningful revenue or
incur operating expenses unless and until it acquires an interest
in an operating company.





Liquidity and Capital Resources



At December 31, 2000, the Company had no cash with $2,149 in
accounts payable and $3,569 in accounts payable to a related
party giving the Company a working capital deficit of $5,718.


The Company does not have sufficient cash to meet its
operational needs for the next twelve months.  Management, like
in the past, will attempt to raise capital for its current
operational needs through loans from related parties, debt
financing, equity financing or a combination of financing
options.  However, there are no existing understandings,
commitments or agreements for such an infusion; nor can there be
assurances to that effect.  Moreover, the Company's need for
capital may change dramatically if and during that period, it
acquires an interest in a business opportunity.  Unless the
Company can obtain additional financing, its ability to continue
as a going concern is doubtful.


The Company's current operating plan is to (i) handle the
administrative and reporting requirements of a public company,

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




Board of Directors

GTM HOLDINGS, INC.


Salt Lake City, Utah


We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of GTM Holdings,
Inc. (formerly Triad Warranty Corporation) [a development stage
company] at December 31, 2000, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' (deficit) and cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and for the period from the re-
entering of development stage on December 27, 1993 through
December 31, 2000.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.


We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements audited by us present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GTM
Holdings, Inc. [a development stage company] as of December 31,
2000 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and for the period from
the re-entering of development stage on December 27, 1993 through
December 31, 2000, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in
Note 7 to the financial statements, the company has no on-going
operations, has incurred substantial losses since its inception,
has liabilities in excess of assets and has no working capital.
These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern.  Management's plans in regards to
these matters are also described in Note 7.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of these uncertainties.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Organization - GTM Holdings, Inc. (formerly Triad Warranty
Corporation) (formerly "Fulton Ventures, Inc.") was organized
under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 21, 1989.  On
May 22, 2000 Triad Warranty Corporation changed their name to GTM
Holdings, Inc.  GTM Holdings, Inc. (the Company) was formed to
purchase, merge with or acquire any business or assets which
management believed had potential for being profitable.  On June
14, 1990, the Company exchanged 2,464,829 of its common shares
for all the outstanding shares of Triad Warranty Corporation.


Triad Warranty Corporation was organized under the laws of the
state of Texas on November 21, 1988.  The purpose of this Company
was to provide extended warranty service coverage for heating and
air conditioning units and their component parts and various
other consumer products.  This Company began operations in
January 1989, in Dallas Texas.  The Board of Directors met on
December 27, 1993, and determined it was in the best interest of
Triad Warranty Corporation, Inc. (Nevada) and its sole operating
subsidiary, Triad Warranty Corporation, to separate ownership.
To effect this transaction, selected shareholders in the Company
were issued their pro rata shares in Triad Warranty Corporation,
and the original 2,464,829 shares of common stock were returned
to the Company for cancellation.  This transaction was accounted
for in the financial statement of the Company as a discontinued
operation as of December 27, 1993.  The Company is considered to
have re-entered into a new development stage on December 27,1993.


Development Stage - The Company is considered a development stage
company as defined in SFAS no. 7.  Consequently, cumulative
numbers have been provided from December 27,1993 forward to
reflect the change in control and the change in the Company's
planned operations which was effective as of 1994.  During 2000,
the Company under went a change in ownership control which has
resulted in a change in the officers and Board of Director's of
the Company.


Loss Per Share - The computation of loss per share of common
stock is based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the periods presented, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings
Per Share" [See Note 6].


Cash and Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the statement of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt investments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.


Accounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statement in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles required
management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial
Statement, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimated by management.


Recently Enacted Accounting Standards - Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 136, "Transfers of Assets to a
not for profit organization or charitable trust that raises or
holds contributions for others", SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - deferral of the
effective date of FASB Statement No. 133 (an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133.)," SFAS No. 138 "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities - and
Amendment of SFAS No. 133", SFAS No. 139, "Rescission of SFAS No.
53 and Amendment to SFAS No 63, 89 and 21", and SFAS No. 140,
"Accounting to Transfer and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities", were recently issued SFAS No.
136, 137, 138, 139 and 140 have no current applicability to the
Company or their effect on the financial statements would not
have been significant.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




NOTE 2 - CAPITAL STOCK



Common Stock - During May 2000, the Company issued 2,000,000
shares of its previously authorized, but unissued common stock to
reimburse a related party for Company expenses paid by the
related party in the amount of $44,890 (or $.023 per share).


During June 2000, the Company issued 25,000 shares to an officer
for services rendered, valued at $562 (or $.023 per share).


During July 2000, the Company issued 10,000 shares of common
stock to an officer for services rendered valued at $224 (or
$.023 per share).


During 1994, the Company issued 50,000 shares of its previously
authorized, but unissued common stock for services rendered,
valued at $50 (or $.001 per share).



NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES



The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting
for Income Taxes" which requires the liability approach for the
effect of income taxes.


The Company has available at December 31, 2000, unused operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $52,500, which may be applied
against future taxable income and which expire in various years
through 2019.  As substantial changes in the Company's ownership
has occurred, there is an annual limitation on the amount of net
operating loss carryforwards which can be utilized.  The amount
of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating
loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent, in part,
upon the tax laws in effect, the future earnings of the Company
and other future events, the effects of which cannot be
determined.  Because of the uncertainty surrounding the
realization of the loss carryforwards the Company has established
a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss
carryforwards (approximately $17,800) at December 31, 2000 and,
therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss
carryforwards.  The change in the valuation allowance is
approximately $1,700 and $0 for 2000 and 1999, respectively.



NOTE 4 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS



During May 2000, the Company settled a judgment in the amount of
$56,380 which was related to previously discontinued operations.
The judgment was settled for $7,500, resulting in a gain of
$48,880.



NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

25,000 shares of common stock to an officer for services
rendered, valued at $562 or $.023 per share.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




NOTE 7 - GOING CONCERN



The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.
However, the Company has incurred losses since its inception and
has not yet been successful in establishing profitable
operations. Further, the Company has current liabilities in
excess of current assets and has no working capital to pay its
expenses.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  In this
regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional
funds not provided by operations through loans or through sales
of its common stock or through a possible business combination
with another company.  There is no assurance that the Company
will be successful in raising this additional capital or
achieving profitable operations.  The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
these uncertainties.

Leveraged financial profile; Narrow business focus; and Customer concentration. The ratings on GTM Holdings Inc. reflect our concerns about the company's liquidity as result of tight covenant cushion under its revolving credit facility, the company's participation in the highly competitive apparel industry, its narrow product focus, the commodity nature of socks, customer concentration, and a highly leveraged financial profile. The ratings also incorporate the well-known Gold Toe brand. Standard&Poor's Ratings Services attributes a high degree of business risk to the sock industry because of intense competition, low barriers to entry, and the commodity nature of these items. The company is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of men's, women's, and children's socks, selling primarily to mass merchants  Report Type:Full ReportIssuerGTM Holdings Inc.GICSCatalog Retail (25502010)SectorCorporations, Global Issuers, Media & EntertainmentCountryUnited StatesRegionUnited StatesFormat:HTML Summary: GTM Holdings Inc. – 2009/03/02 – US$ 225.00Outlook On Gold Toe Moretz Holdings Is Revised To Negative; All Ratings Affirmed – 2009/04/13 – US$ 150.00Research Update: Gold Toe Moretz Holdings Outlook Is Revised To Negative; All Ratings Affirmed – 2009/04/13 – US$ 225.00Gold Toe Moretz Holdings Corp – 2009/04/14 – US$ 500.00Summary: Gold Toe Moretz Holdings Corp – 2009/04/15 – US$ 225.00Summary: GTM Holdings Inc. – 2008/08/04 – US$ 225.00Rating On GTM Holdings Is Lowered To 'CCC; Off Watch, Outlook Developing – 2008/07/18 – US$ 150.00Research Update: GTM Holdings Rating Lowered To 'CCC'; Off Watch, Outlook Now Developing – 2008/07/18 – US$ 225.00GTM Holdings Rating Lowered To 'B-', Remaining On CreditWatch Negative – 2008/04/18 – US$ 150.00Research Update: GTM Holdings Ratings Lowered, Remain On CreditWatch Due To Tight Covenant Cushion – 2008/04/18 – US$ 225.00More from S&P Global Ratings’ Credit ResearchS&P Global Ratings’ Credit Research—S&P Global Ratings’ credit research provides analysis on issuers and debt obligations of corporations, states and municipalities, financial institutions, insurance companies and sovereign governments.

The ratings also incorporate the well-known Gold Toe brand. We attribute a high degree of business risk to the sock industry because of intense competition, low barriers to entry, and the commodity nature of these items. The company is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of men's, women's, and children's socks, selling primarily to mass merchants and department and national chain store retailers.
