Internet Connection with Fiber OpticWith the growing network services such as HDTV, IPTV, voice-over-IP (VoIP) and multimedia broadband applications, the demand for bandwidth rises quickly. The current broadband environment has not met its needs; the FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) would be the most promising NGN (next-generation networking) application to fulfill the demand.High-speed 802.11n WirelessWith built-in IEEE 802.11b/g and 802.11n wireless network capability, the FRT-415N allows any computer and wireless-enabled network device to connect to it without additional cabling. 802.11n wireless capability brings users the highest speed of wireless experience ever; the data transmission rate can be as high as 300Mbps. The radio coverage is also doubled to offer high-speed wireless connection even in widely spacious offices or houses.More Product Info : http://www.planet.com.tw/en/product/product.php?id=48766
