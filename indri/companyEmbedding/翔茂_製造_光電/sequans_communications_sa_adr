	Schrift ändern: (0 Bewertungen)Business Wire·Mehr Nachrichten von Business WireSequans' LTE Cat 1 Technology Selected by Autonet Mobile for Connected Car Application Autonet's Dealer Connect product now LTE-enabled     Sequans Communications S.A. (NYSE: SQNS) announced that Autonet Mobile,   the industry's first internet-based vehicle telematics service, has   selected Sequans' LTE Cat 1* Calliope platform to provide the LTE   connectivity for its flagship Dealer Connect product. Dealer   Connect is the only product that seamlessly provides dealers and   consumers with continuous connectivity to their vehicles, creating   targeted CRM opportunities, vehicle diagnostics, and valuable real time   asset management.     "Our Dealer Connect product, now with LTE, gives our customers and car   owners the power of anytime, anywhere connectivity on a modern,   long-lived 4G LTE connection," said Mike Hultberg, COO and EVP of   Autonet Mobile. "Sequans is a leader in highly-optimized LTE for IoT   solutions, and their LTE Cat 1 technology allowed us to easily and   affordably LTE-enable our Dealer Connect product to the benefit of our   auto dealership customers."     Dealer Connect is a connected car solution exclusively for auto   dealerships and their customers and provides real-time monitoring of   overall vehicle health, notifying both the dealership and the car owner   when something needs attention and simultaneously creating the   opportunity to schedule a service appointment. Dealers and car owners   communicate via the Dealer Connect smartphone app, which gives dealers   the ability to track vehicles on their lots, notify customers of service   needs and deal offers, and gives car owners the ability to monitor   vehicle health and automatically schedule appointments.     "We are proud to contribute our technology to Autonet for this powerful   and exciting connected car application," said Craig Miller, VP of   worldwide marketing, Sequans. "LTE Cat 1 is a perfect fit for Dealer   Connect, enabling Autonet to extend Dealer Connect's availability to any   dealer, anywhere."     Autonet is using Sequans' Calliope   LTE Platform, an IoT-optimized chipset solution designed specifically   for LTE Cat 1 applications needing up to 10 Mbps of throughput, the   ideal speed for Autonet's Dealer Connect application. Calliope comprises   baseband and RF, an integrated IoT applications processor running   Sequans' carrier-proven LTE protocol stack, an IMS client, and a   comprehensive software package for over-the-air device management and   packet routing.     The Autonet device will be on display at CTIA's Super Mobility Week, Las   Vegas, in Sequans' meeting room, September 7-9. To make an appointment,   please contact events@sequans.com.     Note:     LTE Category 1 (Cat 1) technology is the lowest throughput category of   the existing LTE standard and is compatible with today's existing LTE   networks. Cat 1 LTE has been optimized for IoT use and recently deployed   by major LTE operators, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and NTT   DoCoMo. LTE Cat 1 is ideal for certain IoT applications, including   vehicle telematics, security systems, retail terminals, and smart   meters, and is expected to be used for these types of applications even   when new narrowband LTE-M and NB-IoT (Release 13) networks are launched.   For more about LTE Cat 1 and its applications, please see this blog.

      4G chipmaker Sequans Communications S.A. (NYSE: SQNS) today 
      announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.
    

Second Quarter 2017 Highlights:


Revenue: Revenue was $13.2 million, after a reduction of $740,000 
      related to a product return from an early 2016 tablet-related sale. 
      Excluding the impact of the return, revenue would have been $14.0 
      million. Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 increased 6.3% compared 
      to the first quarter of 2017 (12.3% without the impact of the return) 
      and increased 33.7% compared to the second quarter of 2016 (41.2% 
      without the impact of the return), reflecting increases in both product 
      and other revenue.
    

Gross margin: Gross margin was 42.1% compared to 47.1% in the 
      first quarter of 2017 and compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of 
      2016, reflecting an increase in the proportion of module sales in the 
      product mix in the second quarter of 2017.
    

Operating loss: Operating loss was $4.1 million compared to an 
      operating loss of $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an 
      operating loss of $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2016.
    

Net loss: Net loss was $6.0 million, or ($0.08) per diluted 
      share/ADS, compared to a net loss $5.6 million, or ($0.07) per diluted 
      share/ADS, in the first quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $5.1 million, 
      or ($0.09) per diluted share/ADS, in the second quarter of 2016.
    

Non-IFRS Net loss: Excluding the non-cash items of stock-based 
      compensation and the fair-value (in 2016) and effective interest 
      adjustments related to the convertible debt and other financings, 
      non-IFRS net loss was $4.9 million, or ($0.06) per diluted share/ADS, 
      compared to a non-IFRS net loss of $4.7 million, or ($0.06) per diluted 
      share/ADS in the first quarter of 2017, and a non-IFRS net loss of $5.8 
      million, or ($0.10) per diluted share/ADS, in the second quarter of 2016.
    

Cash: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposit at June 30, 
      2017 totaled $19.5 million compared to $14.5 million at March 31, 2017, 
      and does not reflect the net proceeds of approximately $3 million from 
      government grants and research tax credit expected to be received in the 
      third quarter of 2017.

      "We continue to make excellent progress," said Georges Karam, Sequans' 
      CEO. "Business during Q2 was in line with our expectations and it's 
      unfortunate that the optics were affected by an adjustment related to a 
      sale made over a year ago in the discontinued tablet business. Our Cat 1 
      business is ramping nicely and our visibility continues to improve. Our 
      Cat M1 customers, including an extensive list of module partners, are 
      moving aggressively to complete their certification on Verizon and AT&T, 
      and we are performing Cat M1 and Cat NB1 trials with multiple operators 
      world-wide, setting the stage for accelerating growth next year. In the 
      broadband business, we are a little cautious about some temporary 
      softness in the emerging markets, but we also see a number of very 
      exciting opportunities to augment the growth we expect from popular 
      devices such as Verizon's JetPack and SmartHub.
    

      "Our strategy of working closely with partners to combine their leading 
      technology with ours in an optimized solution is being well-received by 
      customers. We also continue to be approached by a growing number of 
      potential partners to discuss various forms of cooperation, which 
      further validates our leadership and positions us the LTE connectivity 
      partner of choice."
    

Q3 2017 Outlook


The following statements are based on management’s current 
      assumptions and expectations. These statements are 
      forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Sequans 
      undertakes no obligation to update these statements.


      Sequans expects revenue for the third quarter of 2017 to be in the range 
      of $15 to $17 million with non-IFRS gross margin above 40%. Based on 
      this revenue range and expected gross margin, non-IFRS net loss per 
      diluted share/ADS is expected to be between ($0.05) and ($0.07) for the 
      third quarter of 2017, based on approximately 79.8 million weighted 
      average number of diluted shares/ADSs. Non-IFRS EPS guidance excludes 
      the impact of stock based compensation, the non-cash fair-value and 
      effective interest adjustments related to the convertible debt and other 
      financings, and any other relevant non-cash or non-recurring expenses.
    

Conference Call and Webcast


      Sequans plans to conduct a teleconference and live webcast to discuss 
      the financial results for the second quarter of 2017 today, August 1, 
      2017 at 8:00 a.m. EDT /14:00 CEST. To participate in the live call, 
      analysts and investors should dial 800-230-1059 (or +1 612-288-0337if 
      outside the U.S.). A live and archived webcast of the call will be 
      available from the Investors section of the Sequans website at www.sequans.com/investors/. 
      A replay of the conference call will be available until September 1, 
      2017 by dialing toll free 800-475-6701 in the U.S., or +1 320-365-3844 
      from outside the U.S., using the following access code: 426480.
    

Forward Looking Statements


      This press release contains projections and other forward-looking 
      statements regarding future events or our future financial performance. 
      All statements other than present and historical facts and conditions 
      contained in this release, including any statements regarding our future 
      results of operations and financial positions, business strategy, plans 
      and our objectives for future operations and potential strategic 
      partnerships, are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). These statements are only predictions 
      and reflect our current beliefs and expectations with respect to future 
      events and are based on assumptions and subject to risk and 
      uncertainties and subject to change at any time. We operate in a very 
      competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time 
      to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue 
      reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results 
      may differ materially from those contained in the projections or 
      forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements 
      contained herein include, without limitation: (i) the contraction or 
      lack of growth of markets in which we compete and in which our products 
      are sold, (ii) unexpected increases in our expenses, including 
      manufacturing expenses, (iii) our inability to adjust spending quickly 
      enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall, (iv) delays or 
      cancellations in spending by our customers, (v) unexpected average 
      selling price reductions, (vi) the significant fluctuation to which our 
      quarterly revenue and operating results are subject due to cyclicality 
      in the wireless communications industry and transitions to new process 
      technologies, (vii) our inability to anticipate the future market 
      demands and future needs of our customers, (viii) our inability to 
      achieve new design wins or for design wins to result in shipments of our 
      products at levels and in the timeframes we currently expect, (ix) our 
      inability to enter into and execute on strategic alliances, (x) the 
      impact of natural disasters on our sourcing operations and supply chain, 
      and (xi) other factors detailed in documents we file from time to time 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements 
      in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions 
      contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    

Use of Non-IFRS/non-GAAP Financial Measures


      To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared 
      in accordance with IFRS, we disclose certain non-IFRS, or non-GAAP, 
      financial measures. These measures exclude non-cash charges relating to 
      stock-based compensation and the non-cash financial expense related to 
      the convertible debt and its embedded derivative issued in April 2015 
      and April 2016. We believe that these measures can be useful to 
      facilitate comparisons among different companies. These non-GAAP 
      measures have limitations in that the non-GAAP measures we use may not 
      be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. We seek to 
      compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation of the 
      non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS 
      measures in the table attached to this press release. We are not able to 
      provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking IFRS estimates for 
      gross margin and net loss per diluted share without unreasonable 
      efforts, because certain adjustments are not known until the end of the 
      period. The impact of these adjustments could be significant to our 
      actual IFRS results.
