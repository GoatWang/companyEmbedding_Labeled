About Us

Since 1959, Solitron has been an industry leader in power semiconductors. With corporate headquarters and manufacturing in West Palm Beach FL, our facility includes circuit design, wafer fabrication, power microelectronics assembly, packaging, electrical test and environmental screening.  Certifications and qualifications include MIL-PRF-19500 for JAN/JANTX/JANTXV, MIL-PRF-38534 Class H, ISO 9001:2008 and AS9100 Rev C.  Solitron also builds to customer supplied source control drawings and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) standards.
For over 50 years, Solitron has been dedicated to manufacturing power components for the most demanding high reliability applications including space, avionics and defense.  Standard products include JFETs, MOSFETs, diodes, rectifiers, and voltage regulators.  When standard solutions won’t fit the application, we can tailor products to meet specific electrical or mechanical requirements.  Solitron’s design expertise has also provided customized versions of  dc-dc converters, half/full bridge circuits, motor controllers, IGBTs, and PFC circuits to name a few.
Looking forward, Solitron is developing the next generation of power technology for applications such as electric control to replace traditional hydraulic control systems in aircraft …… next generation high density radar ….. and extreme temperature downhole oil exploration. From innovation in process to design, Solitron is developing leading edge products to meet the most challanging power applications of the future.

Interview conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, 
	CEOCFOinterviews.com, Published – November 6, 2009


CEOCFO: Mr. Saraf, Solitron has a long 
	history, what is the focus and vision today?

Mr. Saraf: Our focus is to continue 
	supporting the aerospace and the defense industry.

	 

CEOCFO: Would you tell us about your 
	products and what is unique about what Solitron?

Mr. Saraf: We are producing power 
	semiconductors and power hybrids that are utilized in the defense and 
	aerospace industries. For example, our product has been used on the robot 
	spacecrafts that are roaming Mars. Our hybrids were used originally to drive 
	the Lunar Rover, the Jeep, the astronauts used for traveling on the surface 
	of the moon. Our products are used in satellites, and missile systems like 
	AMRRAM, which is an advanced medium-range missile used by the US Air Force 
	and many other western Air Forces. It has been used on Arrow, which is the 
	anti-missile, missile that was developed jointly by Israel and the United 
	States. It is used on other missiles like Hellfire that is being used by the 
	US Air Force extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our hybrids are also used 
	in the radar systems of the F22, F18, F16 and F15.

	 

CEOCFO: Why is your product superior?

Mr. Saraf: It is the manufacturing 
	technology. We make our products in hermetically sealed packages that 
	withstand extreme temperatures, pressure and vibration.

	 

CEOCFO: I know that you do custom work 
	and you have been a pioneer in innovative design, what is an example of 
	something you have worked on and what are you able to do to make a 
	difference in the project?

Mr. Saraf: There is a custom product 
	that we are producing for an unnamed major defense contractor for an 
	advanced fighter and what is unique about it is that it is the world’s 
	smallest, thinnest, lightest, DC to DC Converter in a hermetically sealed 
	package. Nobody else has been able to make it in this constrains of the 
	physical envelope.

	 

CEOCFO: What gives you the edge?

Mr. Saraf: The know-how of the team of 
	people that have been doing it since the mid-1960’s.

	 

CEOCFO: Solitron recently received the 
	AS9100 Rev. B Certification; would you tell us about the new certification 
	and how that enhances what you offer?

Mr. Saraf: Major defense contractors 
	like Lockheed Martin, Hamilton Sundstrand, Boeing, L-3 and Raytheon are 
	requiring the AS9100 increasingly, and it is used for aerospace 
	applications. It demands stricter documentation, production and quality 
	control standards. It is an offspring of ISO9000, which is now required 
	worldwide.

	 

CEOCFO: Where do you do the 
	manufacturing?

Mr. Saraf: We do our manufacturing in 
	West Palm Beach, Florida.

	 

CEOCFO: What is the level of competition 
	in your industry?

Mr. Saraf: The number of our competitors 
	is shrinking because major and medium size companies have increasingly been 
	leaving the defense and aerospace area. This is because the volume of 
	business is not there to justify the cost of the additional certification 
	and quality system in place. Thus for us, it has opened up additional 
	opportunities, which have been vacated by other companies.

	 

CEOCFO: So it is a good time for 
	Solitron!

Mr. Saraf: Yes, it is.

	 

CEOCFO: Would you tell us about your ten 
	golden rules of premiere customer service?

Mr. Saraf: The rules speak for 
	themselves. Bottom line is a company can excel and attract new business when 
	its reputation is based on quality of its product and the quality of its 
	service. Service and quality in many cases are what set companies apart.

	 

CEOCFO: What is the financial picture 
	like at Solitron today?

Mr. Saraf: We are financially healthy, 
	stable, and profitable. If you look at our past performance, we have a solid 
	record of performance and profitability.

	 

CEOCFO: What do you see the next couple 
	of years down the line?

Mr. Saraf: The fact that because of 
	government plans for the future of the defense and aerospace sectors, the 
	number of opportunities large companies are interested in is decreasing 
	because the volume is not attractive to them. It has opened new 
	opportunities for small companies like us. This affords us the opportunity 
	to move in and fill voids created by large companies leaving the market. For 
	example, we are now developing custom Power semiconductors and hybrids 
	products that have been made by other companies that has obsoleted them, 
	stopped making them, or gone out of business and therefore created 
	opportunities for us to make these products that we did not make before.

	 

CEOCFO: Why should potential investors 
	pay attention?

Mr. Saraf: If they are looking for a 
	company that steadily performs financially, they should look at Solitron 
	Devices. They will not find anything flashy that comes and goes with the 
	tide, but a company that has a year after year solid performance, history 
	and future.

	 

CEOCFO: What might someone miss or not 
	understand when they look at Solitron that they should know?

Mr. Saraf: We are small, but if you look 
	at our P&L and balance sheet and items such as current stock price, compare 
	it to our net-cash holdings, and compare them to market valuation, the 
	numbers scream at you that our stock price is under valued. 

	 

CEOCFO: Final thoughts, what should 
	people remember most about Solitron?

Mr. Saraf: People should know that we 
	are here to stay and we have supported the defense and aerospace sectors 
	since the 1960’s. We supported programs like the first trip to the moon. Now 
	we can see the future trips to the moon, Mars and beyond.
