Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Facilities

      Below, you will find information on the nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile facilities of the countries profiled on the NTI website, including in most cases, the locations on an interactive Google map. To view facilities by country, visit the country profile. Since definitive information is often classified, the descriptions and mapped locations of these facilities are sometimes speculative, based on the most credible available open-source material. This material was prepared for the NTI site by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.

Location: Pyongyang (평양시) area, North Korea. Sources report that this facility is in "San'ŭm-ri (山陰里)," but "San'ŭm-ri" is not found on modern maps. One possibility is that "San'ŭm-ri" is a reference to an old name during the Japanese colonial period that no longer exists. There were two places called "San'ŭm-ri" in Yŏkp'o-kuyŏk and "Sun'an-kuyŏk" of present day Pyongyang.

No. 125 Factory


Location: Northwestern part of Pyongyang. There are conflicting reports on the location of this facility. Some reports place the factory in Chung'i-dong (중이동), Yongsŏng-kuyŏk (용성구역), Pyongyang, and others place it in Hyŏngjesan-kuyŏk (형제산구역), Pyongyang. Yongsŏng-kuyŏk and Hyŏngjesan-kuyŏk are adjacent to each other, and Chung'i-dong is right next to Hyŏngjesan-kuyŏk, which could be the cause for confusion. The South Korean Ministry of Unification reports that the factory is in "Chunggye-dong" (중계동), Hyŏngjesan-kuyŏk, Pyongyang, but apparently there is no "Chunggye-dong" in Hyŏngjesan-kuyŏk. There is a "Ch'ŏnggye-dong," which is nearby, but in Yongsŏng-kuyŏk.
