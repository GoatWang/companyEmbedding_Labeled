LOS ANGELES, CA – January 21, 2016 – GTX Corp (OTC: GTXO), a provider of wearable monitoring and tracking solutions using GPS, Cellular and BLE technology, announces The GPS SmartSoles were a winner in the 2015 New Product & Technology Awards. The program, presented by the Mature Market Resource Center, a national clearinghouse for the senior market, is the first awards program of its kind to recognize the most innovative products & services for older adults and their families.

The GPS SmartSole ® received a Bronze Award for the Wearable Technology category. “We were delighted to take part in the fifth annual New Product & Technology Awards program this year, and were honored to be selected as a winner,” says Andrew Duncan Director of Business Development.
Entries were judged by a distinguished panel of mature market experts from across the United States for overall excellence of design, content, creativity and relevance to the senior market.
GTX Corp (GTXO) was founded in 2002, became publicly traded in 2008, and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with a European distribution and fulfilment center in Ireland / U.K.  and international reseller/distributors throughout Europe and Latin America. Known for its game-changing and award-winning wondering assistive GPS SmartSole, the world’s first invisible tracking and monitoring technology. The patented GPS SmartSoles, which were featured in AARP’s 2015 technology gear guide are placed in the wearer’s shoes and contain a GPS tracking chip connected through a cellular network that sends a signal to a central monitoring website or app showing the exact location of the individual wearing the SmartSoles. They come in several trim to fit sizes for both men and women, are made with the highest quality electronic components and assembled in Rhode Island, U.S.A.  
The simplicity behind the SmartSole Platform is that when someone wanders off or becomes lost, a text or email alert is sent to a phone and computer, with a direct link to a map plotting the wanderer’s location delivering peace of mind to the caregiver, while preserving the privacy and dignity of the wearer.

2015 Award Winners
Entries in the 2015 New Product & Technology Awards Program were evaluated by a distinguished panel of judges. Using a rating scale of 1 to 100, each judge evaluated entries using general review criteria. The scores were then totaled and averaged. Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Merit certificates were awarded on the basis of these averaged scores. Note: Entries were judged on their own merit. Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Merit awards were not necessarily given in each division or category.

We have had 2 SmartSoles in the past year that both stopped working shortly after the brief⋯⋯ 90-day warranty expired.  We were given the opportunity to buy a replacement SmartSole for ~$180 which we did the first time.  This past weekend the replacement SmartSole stopped working (1 month after the 90-day warranty expired) and we aren't going to keep wasting money on this device.  If reliability is of importance to you I suggest that you consider other options. 更多Timothy Walsh · 2015年10月6日I am a police officer, these products are great. We now use a "LoJack" type system which means I hold an antenna out the window of my police car and drive aroun⋯⋯d looking for the missing person...literally a "rabbit ear" out my window.  We never find the person with this system. Usually a Good Samaritan sees an old lady walking around looking lost and calls the police. That's how we find them.  We don't have interaction  with GTXO because the loved one is found in seconds and the police are never needed or called.  If you need to where your loved one is at all times... There is no better product then this for the cost.   If you have some one with dementia this is the product you need... 更多Ren Guzman · 2017年3月22日Awesome product I would recommend all my friends this is the future nowMargaret Linam Bentel · 2015年5月16日I'm using GTX-SmartSole for my mother who has dementia-Altimerzers. I love that I can watch real time and tell if she's still or moving. Also, being able to tra⋯⋯ck her through my phone incase she wanders outside pass our house. Like any chargeable devise you have to get in the habit of charging just about every night. Overall I do recommend this product. 更多Nick Ryan · 2016年11月20日Instructions did not provide a pin/password and no one has called me back. I am unable to activate product and will return.Kiddo Ditto · 2016年10月31日No one answers the phone!
