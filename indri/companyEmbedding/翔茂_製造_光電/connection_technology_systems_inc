IntroductionConnection Technology System (CTS) HES-3106-PLUS is a CPE switch with five gigabit copper LAN ports and one gigabit ber WAN port , and is housed in an eye-catchingpearl-white case. It switches the traditional twisted-pair RJ-45 cable into various fiber optics optics media including multi-mode, single-mode, SC/ST connector, bi-directionalWDM fiber transceiver. The fiber optics port of HES-3106-PLUS can support connection distance from 550m to 20Km or even reach 80 KM via multi-mode fiber, single modefiber or Bi-directional single mode fiber for the deployment to the household, apartment or campus.HES-3106-PLUS CPE switch is fully compliant with IEEE 802.3, 802.3u, 802.3ab, and 802.3z standards. The user can connect other switches or NIC through HES-3106-PLUSCPE switch into RJ45 ports without crossover cables and monitor the status through comprehensive LED display.It can be easily managed via Web GUI, telnet CLI, andSNMP. To ful ll the requirement of mass deployment, the device also supports the auto provisioning mechanism to allow the operators or service providers to manage thedevice automatically and dynamically. Consequently, it can signi cantly help to save the OPEX (operational cost) for the operators or service providers. With CTS unique power down trap feature, HES-3106-PLUS is able to send out a SNMP trap message when unexpected power outage occurs.

Introduction
Connection Technology Systems Inc. (CTS) is 
pleased to release the latest new series of standalone media converter: MCT-100 
& MCT-3002-DR, with smaller size and performance as good as previous CVT series. 
Similar to CVT series, MCT series also can be stand-alone or installed in the 
power redundant rack. The compact size enables the flexibility of network 
deployments and offers a cost-efficient option for budget-limited operators.
Key Highlights of MCT series: 

Extended from existing media converter 
	solutions (CVT series)
Can be stand-alone or installed in 
	rack-chassis
Around 40% smaller than CVT series
MCT-100 series have SFP model (MCT-100SFP) 
	which CVT-100 series did not.
Also support Dual-Rate fiber auto-sensing 
	function
Cost-efficient and ideal for budget-limited 
	operators
