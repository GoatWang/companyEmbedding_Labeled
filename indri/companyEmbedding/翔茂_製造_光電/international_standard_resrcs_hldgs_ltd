THE GROUP 

						Pegasus Group is one of the largest footwear manufacturers in China for Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) customers.
						The origins of the Group's business can be traced back to 1956 when the founder Mr. Wu Suei (the father of Mr. Thomas Wu and Mr. Michael Wu) established a plastic shoe manufacturing business in Taiwan. The Group achieved rapid growth in the 1960's and 1970's through domestic sales in Taiwan as well as international trade.
						Due to the change in market environment, the Group decided to relocate the entire production facilities from Taiwan to China in 1990. Taking the advantage of an abundant, diligent and smart work force in China, and under the leadership of an experienced management team, the Group's performance was very promising in the past few years. In 1996, Pegasus was publicly listed in Hong Kong. Based on the over 20 years marketing and management experience achieved in Taiwan, in 1999, we started to develop domestic market in China by licensing international well-known brands and selling our own brand products. Being a leader of the business, Pegasus will continue to strive to maintain a high product quality standard and to uphold customer service excellence.
