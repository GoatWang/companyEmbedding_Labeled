An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: 2AEJ4R211CD is 2AEJ4. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, R211CD, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.

Grant Comments



Enter any text that you would like to appear at the bottom of the Grant of Equipment Authorization:


Output power is conducted and composite of multi-channels. The device must be
restricted to work related operation in an Occupational/Controlled RF exposure
Environment. The antenna(s) used for this booster must be based on maximum
antenna gain 12.5dBi and installed to provide a separation distance of at least
172cm from all persons. Only those antenna(s) specified in the filing may be used
with this booster. User and installer mus be provided with antenna installation
instruction and booster operating condition for satisfying RF exposure.
The transmitter operates as a remote unit of booster device using fiber-optic
distribution system receiving conducted signal from base station as described in
this filing, and excluding any other devices connected to the (uplink) transmit
output terminal of the base station interface unit. This application covers only the
system configuration with base interface unit connected to a base station RF port
in the uplink transmit path; operations of this remote unit if any in a system with
base interface unit connected to antenna or amplifier for uplink transmissions require separate equipment authorization.

            1. Introduction
Designed for coverage expansion of conventional macro cell base station for rural area with low popularity. To minimize the influence in ul path by higher power from dl, both paths are fully separated by electrical and mechanical. High-precision power control by zero error attenuator technology. Adaptive pwm fan control protects residents from loud noise.

It has following key features :
- supports 1.8ghz wcdma band, 3fa
- gsm 900/1800/1900, cdma 800/1900, lte 900/1800 band also available
- consists of two unit by dl and ul
- dl : 50dbm, ul : 0dbm output
- high input range : 30 ~ 46dbm
- high precision output control by hybrid analog and digital attenuator
- auto limit control , auto shut down, auto fan control
- high ingress protection for harsh field environment
