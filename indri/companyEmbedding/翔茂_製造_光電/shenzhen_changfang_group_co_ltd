Earnings Growth Analysis
The company’s year-on-year decline in earnings was influenced by a weakening in gross margins from 23.74% to 19.33%, as well as issues with cost controls.  As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 20.76% to 3.07% in this time frame.  For comparison, gross margins were 7.10% and EBITDA margins were -19.80% in the previous period.

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.


300301-CN‘s decline in gross margins has not produced any significant offsetting improvement in its working capital .  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the decline in gross margins are likely from operating issues and not trade-offs with the balance sheet.  Working capital days are currently 105.68 days, compared to last year’s level of -62.26 days.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
300301-CN‘s change in operating cash flow of 127.04% compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period.  Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group.  This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable.
