The 10-Gbps HSFP product line provides eight wavelengths within one 13-nm CWDM spectrum. Short CWDM wavelengths beyond the dispersion penalty are available in 10-Gbps CPRI/OBSAI and Ethernet as well. HSFP (High-Density SFP) is an advanced CWDM bi-directional pluggable optics approach that enables users to experience a 2X or 6X increase in fiber line operation efficiencies, thanks to its wavelength stack-up technology.
Lightron says its wavelength stack-up technology provides two, six, or maximum eight adjacent wavelengths within a 13 nm tolerance. In conjunction with its thermo-electrical cooling design from the company's Cooled BOSA (bi-directional optical sub-assembly), the technology enables CWDM links with 36, 108, or more wavelengths operating over the industrial temperature range. And its design reduces the effects of Rayleigh backscattering and back reflection.
Use of the technology also does not require the introduction of new passive modules into the network, the company adds. 







HSFP transceivers have already been deployed to support LTE roll outs in Korea. Enhanced versions that will support greater reach will widen the application space within wireless applications and 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks.  Judge's comment: "Just making a WDM SFP is not innovative, but this SFP solves an industry problem, and has lots of innnovation such as bi-di that works, multiple channels squeezed into existing bands, and compatibility with already fielded channel plans."

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
