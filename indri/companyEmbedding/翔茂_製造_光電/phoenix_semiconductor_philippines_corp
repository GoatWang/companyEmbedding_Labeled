MANILA, Philippines – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, June 24, approved the P2.65-billion ($60.42 million) initial public offering (IPO) of semiconductor manufacturing firm Phoenix Semiconductor Philippines Corporation.
Phoenix Semiconductor is engaged in manufacturing, assembling, testing, and warehousing of semiconductor and memory devices and applications and related products. The company started commercial operations in February 2011 and has since been awarded as one of the top exporters within Clark Freeport Zone. It is a major supplier of technology giant Samsung.
Documents filed with the SEC showed that Phoenix Semiconductor will offer up to 706.816 million shares at an offer price of up to P3.76 ($0.0857) per share.
Of the total offer shares, 286.093 million shares are primary shares while another 286.093 million shares are secondary shares owned by the company’s majority shareholder, STS Semiconductor & Telecommunications Co. Ltd. The company has also set aside 134.630 million shares to cover oversubscription.
STS Semiconductor is one of South Korea’s leading providers of comprehensive semiconductor packaging and test services.
The offer shares will be equivalent to 25% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company upon the completion of the IPO.
BDO Capital & Investment Corporation is the issue manager and lead underwriter for the offering.
Proceeds from the IPO will be used to purchase machinery and production equipment to expand business and operations.
“In the second half 2014, the company will embark on a maintenance and expansion program to further enhance and expand its business and operations. The maintenance includes acquisition of machines and equipment for existing manufacturing lines. The expansion program will include existing new manufacturing facility to be built within the company’s premises,” Phoenix Semiconductor said.
The company will also proceed with its expansion program that aims to increase its production capacity to cater to the needs of its prospective clients. This will include acquisition of machines and equipment and construction of new production facility.
In 2013, the semiconductor firm posted a net income of P607 million ($13.84 million), up 5% from P557 million ($12.70 million) in 2012, while revenues went up 6.8% to P9.36 billion ($213.45 million) versus the year ago's level of P8.76 billion ($199.77 million).
The semiconductor firm will be the third company to be listed on the stock exchange this year. The first two were Jollibee-led property firm DoubleDragon Properties Corporation and canned tuna manufacturer Century Pacific Food Inc. – Rappler.com

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
