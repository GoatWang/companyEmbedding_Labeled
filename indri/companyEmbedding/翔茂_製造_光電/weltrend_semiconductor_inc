USB Power and Charging Port Controllers
WT6630P





【 General Description 】


The WT6630P is a highly integrated USB Power Delivery (PD) controller that supports USB PD 2.0 specification designed for USB Type-C Downstream Facing Port (Source) charging applications such as travel adapters, charger, and power banks.


The WT6630P minimizes external components by integrating USB PD baseband PHY, Type-C detection, shunt regulator, voltage and current monitors, control circuits of blocking MOSFET, and an 8-bit MCU to allow small form factor and low BOM cost. It supports wide operating voltage range from 4V to 30V without the need of an external LDO. An One-Time-Programmable (OTP) ROM is provided for program code and user configuration data.


The WT6630P is certified by USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) for USB Type-C.
