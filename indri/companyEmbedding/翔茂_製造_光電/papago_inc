My mistake! . I bought Papago GoSafe 535 dash cam les⋯⋯s than 6 months ago and it has started giving me troubles within 4 months. The display flickered and the dash cam restarted frequently. It keeps saying "recovering"....and then "recovering Success"....and then the cycle of flickering display, restarting happens all over again.  May 26th : I reached out your customer service email service @ papagousa com and did not get a reply for 4 days. May 30th : a person named Jorge got back asking me to format my SD card. I replied the same day that it did not help. Did not receive any reply after that.  June 4th : Reached out again to Jorge asking for the next steps June 5th : Jorge asks to send the dash cam June 19th : I ship the product to 376 Lemon Creek Dr, Walnut, CA July 2nd: I ask if they have received the shipment as I never heard back. July 3rd: Jorge said he received. July 12th : I follow up again. July 13th: Jorge said he will ship the replacement today July 17th : Received the replacement  The so-called replacement is defective again. With the same defect. I don’t think a replacement was shipped. The same defective unit was sent back. I am really disappointed as my other car has Garmin dash cam and I have had no problem with it. Inspite of people giving bad reviews to Papago customer service in Amazon, I still thought of giving this thing a shot.  I sent a mail to Jorge again on July 27th to let him know that “So far this junk dashcam has bricked 4 of my sd cards. I have spent over $50 in these SD cards that this unit keeps bricking. Can I just have my money back (for the dash cam and the SD cards it bricked) ? I no longer trust Papago's quality or service.” but never heard back for him. I am in retail industry too and understand the challenges with Supply Chain. But this kind of service is just unacceptable from a company that is trying to succeed in USA.   Thanks, Kartikey RMA number 06052017002 更多Dan Meyer · 2016年12月29日**** update. I got a very nice email from Papago saying the replacement part has been shipped and it's on its way**** Thank you for your speedy response. Lookin⋯⋯g forward to using my new gosafe 520 soon as I get customer service on the ball to fix a part not working right out of the box. No working warranty number and not a lot of help after contacting them. Very neat camera but I had a part not working right out of the box. I tried the number on the warranty card several time and just got a fax tone. Finally had to do an internet search for phone numbers and got to talk to a person who told me I had to email another person. So I email but have no idea if it went to the right person or if it was ever received. I guess now I just wait a week or two to find out before trying again. Meanwhile I'm unable to use my brand new gosafe 520.  I'm looking forward to using my dash cam and I'm sure it'll be great but Papago NEEDS to do something to make this experience easier for warranties. It should not be this complicated or take anywhere this long. 更多Jamie King · 2016年12月9日People can see the products and make their decisions. What you will not see is the service behind the product, until you have a problem.  What I can tell you is⋯⋯ that this company has been 110% supportive and stands behind their products. Responses have been timely and personal and they worked with me to solve the problem. I am a Canadian customer and this has been non problem. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE. 更多Nancy Konrad Janisse · 2016年11月28日Love the Papago safe dash cam. Great resolution wide angle images. So easy to set up and use. When we had trouble with it,  after a bit of trouble shooting,  Frank replaced it without hesitation.  Excellent customer service. Highly recommended!  Thanks Frank!!Gregory Baxter · 2016年11月19日Love the rearview mount PaPago 268, no one has seen it yet, except for the friends I have told, it delivers clear HD videos, and warns me if an idiot is about to cut me off from the blind spot. It's a priceless gem, for drivers.Legos Guy · 2016年5月28日Extremely happy with the GoSafe 200 dashcams in all of our family vehicles.  Had a slight issue with one of the dashcam mounts so I contacted PAPAGO's customer ⋯⋯service and they immediately helped resolve it.  Kudos to PAPAGO for standing by their products and offering astounding customer service. 更多Jorge Rhommy · 2016年11月4日Excellent customer support!
