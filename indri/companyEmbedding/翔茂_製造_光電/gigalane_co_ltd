[Product Description]

The LED Etcher is applied to PSS(Patterned Sapphire Substrate) etching process and Photonics Crystal etching process to improve the luminous efficiency of LED devices / GaN etching process to form electrode. It also ensures high quality product and trustworthy productivity through excellent selectivity and etch uniformity along with reliable hardware specifications. Automated TRAY Loading System promotes further stability and efficiency of production. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Company Introduction]

GigaLane Co., Ltd. is the world's leading LED etcher manufacturer and the biggest supplier of RF connectivity components for mobile phones, telecommunication stations and aircrafts in Korea. Since its foundation in 2001, GigaLane has consistently developed components, equipment and advanced process technologies.
 
GigaLane has the plasma source of RIE, ICP and CCP types, which have been developed in-house. As a result, the company possesses technologies for foundry processes and mass production. Since GigaLane developed the etcher for semiconductors in 2000, Deep Silicon Etcher (DRIE) and PSS for LED has been recognized for its advanced technology and has become one of the world’s top devices in the ICP etcher industry. Through intensive investments in R&D, the company has acquired more than 45 patents and certifications. In addition, the company has been awarded the certification of ‘World-class Product’ by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy.
 
GigaLane’s LED etcher is an ICP type, specifically designed for patterned sapphire substrate (PSS). PSS is the process of forming small lenses on a sapphire substrate in order to improve the luminous efficiency of LED devices by 45~65%. The product ensures high quality and trustworthy productivity through excellent selectivity and uniformity along with reliable hardware specifications. The automated TRAY Loading System promotes further stability and efficiency of production.
