      LGL Chairman and CEO, Michael J. Ferrantino, Sr. said, “ This 
      acquisition represents another building block in the Company’s strategy

      LGL family. Over the next several quarters we expect to invest 
      additional resources into this product line, primarily in sales, 
      marketing and engineering, so that we can expand its geographic reach 
      and free-up current design engineering resources to focus on designing 
      new, market-driven products.”
    

      PTF LLC will be led by CEO, David Briggs, former CEO of PTF Inc., along 
      with an experienced team of engineers, also former employees of PTF Inc. 
      PTF LLC will remain in Wakefield, Massachusetts.
    

      David Briggs added, “We are excited to be a part of the LGL 
      organization, with its financial resources, component engineering 
      expertise, and world-class sales channel. We look forward to expanding 
      the presence and capabilities we have built over the past decade, and 
      are confident that together with the LGL organization we can grow PTF 
      LLC into a market leader.”

When Timing Matters...

With roots in precision crystal filters for radar in 1965, MtronPTI designs and manufactures RF & microwave solutions for data timing and radio frequency spectrum control in high reliability and harsh environment applications. Formed in 2004 with the acquisition of Piezo Technology, Inc. by M-tron Industries, Inc., MtronPTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the LGL Group, Inc.

In aerospace and defense markets, MtronPTI’s digitally tuned filters support secure communications in the presence of electromagnetic interference. Low drift, highly accurate oscillators provide reliable frequency lock for ground, vehicle, air and satellite communication as well as electronic countermeasures. Vibration and shock resistant crystal clocks sharpen radar images and help monitor commercial aircraft engine performance.

For Internet communication, MtronPTI very low noise and packet sync clocks help increase bandwidth and prevent data loss in cellular base stations, micro and femto cells and Wi-Fi access points. Millimeter wave filters ensure corporate and telecom point-to-point links stay error free.

On the lab bench or consumer electronics production test floors, MtronPTI ultra low noise frequency reference oscillators insure accurate measurements. When public safety is paramount, MtronPTI wide temperature range/waterproof cavity filters insure reliable radio communication.

Satellite links, phased array radars and anti-IED jammers use MtronPTI RF power amplifiers to boost the signal to the antenna.

Based in Orlando, Florida with manufacturing in the United States and India, MtronPTI is vertically integrated with deep experience in basic material science, design and manufacturing. With AS9100 Rev C and ISO 9001:2008 certification, sales and support worldwide and as a recognized service leader, MtronPTI supports innovation and reliability at major OEMs including Cisco, Raytheon, Ericsson, Harris, Rockwell Collins, UTC Aerospace and nearly 2,000 smaller clients through distribution partners.
