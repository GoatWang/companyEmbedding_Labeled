        UQM PowerPhase HD® 250 is designed for customers seeking to 
        operate at higher voltages of 450-750 volts
      

        New system produces 900 Nm of peak torque and 250 kW of peak power
      

        This expands UQM commercial applications and complements the 
        PowerPhase HD 220 and PowerPhase HD 950T
      

LONGMONT, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UQM Technologies, Inc. (NYSE MKT: UQM) has added the PowerPhase HD® 
      250 to its expanding production-ready product line for heavy-duty 
      vehicles. This system delivers high performance for high-voltage 
      electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, including heavy commercial truck, 
      transit bus and marine applications.
    

      “UQM is addressing market needs by developing a comprehensive range of 
      systems for our domestic and global customers. The PowerPhase HD 250 
      provides an ideal solution for trucks and buses that are designed to 
      operate at voltages between 450 and 750 volts,” said Eric R. Ridenour, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of UQM Technologies, Inc. 
      “Commercial vehicle systems are a significant part of our business, and 
      this new system further expands our opportunities within this segment.”
    

      UQM production-ready heavy-duty offerings began with the release of the 
      PowerPhase HD 220 which is now used in many heavy-duty platforms. Then 
      UQM released the PowerPhase HD 950T system for those applications that 
      require increased torque. Now, the new PowerPhase HD 250 variant 
      provides solutions for customers that have higher voltage and power 
      requirements.
    

      “Higher operating voltage creates lower operating current, enabling 
      lower weight or lower resistance losses in vehicle wiring, and this is 
      an architecture choice for some manufacturers’ electrified vehicles,” 
      said Jon F. Lutz, Vice President of Engineering of UQM Technologies, Inc.
    

      The UQM PowerPhase HD 250 provides 900 Nm (664 lb-ft) peak torque, 250 
      kW (335 horsepower) peak power and increases the maximum input (battery) 
      voltage up to 750 volts. Providing up to 95 percent energy conversion 
      efficiency, this system consists of an optimized permanent magnet 
      motor/generator and a full-featured digital signal processor (DSP) based 
      controller.
    

      UQM currently supplies its PowerPhase systems globally to power Hino 
      electric city buses, Proterra electric transit buses, Electric Vehicles 
      International medium-duty trucks and walk-in vans, Zenith Motors 
      electric vans, Boulder Electric Vehicle commercial vehicles and ReGen 
      Nautic marine propulsion systems, among others.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
