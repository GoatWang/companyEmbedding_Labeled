Disc dryerThe main body of disc dryer is mainly composed of stator, rotor and drive unit.（1）Stator：shape of stator of disc dryer is approximately cylindrical form, with a dome on the top providing space for carrier gas and water vapor; there are exhaust gas outlet and access opening provided for the convenience of maintenance and overhaul. The stator end plate is flange mounted, which is convenient for overhauling, and it is also used to fix the stator bearing.（2）Rotor：being the load bearing part of the whole dryer, the rotor is composed of a hollow shaft and a group of hollow disc. In order to improve the firmness of disc, several groups of support bar are annularly arranged in its hollow cavity. There is a propeller/agitator installed on the outer edge of disc, which is used to propel and agitate materials.（3）Drive unit：omposed of embedded reduction gearbox, belt drive, coupler and motor; used to drive the rotor to rotate slowly.（4）Working medium：medium and low pressure steam, heat transfer oil or high pressure hot water, and saturated steam with pressure between 0.2Mpa-0.6Mpa being generally applied.（5）Operating principle：the sludge is delivered into the dryer through feed inlet, the working medium flows between shell and hollow shaft, heat is transferred through the jacket, hollow shaft and hollow discs welded on the shaft and the sludge is indirectly heated and dried, the generated water vapor accumulated on the dome of dryer and is carried out the dryer by carrier gas. The hollow disc is almost perpendicular to the shaft and causes no cut to the sludge. （6）Schematic diagram


Applications：Food residue, sludge, fertilizer, feeding stuff, functional resin, precision ceramics and synthetic resin (PP, PVA, PC, PE, SAP, PPS, PL)

Product featuresDiscs combined a single hollow shaft is applied for heat transfer, and pipe manufacturing process is introduced into the fabrication of drier body, which improved the reliability of it and reduced the cost. Its features are as bellow:1. Applying steam as heat transfer medium, can be used for both half drying process and full drying process, the system is simple and with few auxiliary equipments; 2. Carrier gas replenishment port is provided, which allows more smooth tail gas emission, less auxiliary air and small tail gas treatment equipment; 3. No contact between steam and sludge, little insoluble gas contained in the tail gas, and can be burnt in furnace, causing little secondary pollution; 4. Oxygen content, temperature and dust concentration are low during operation, and system security is good; 5. Heat transfer of horizontal disc dries is carried out through shell wall, hollow shaft and both left and right sides of each upright disc, the heat transfer area is large, structure is compact and overall dimension is small; 6. Sludge inside the drier is wet, in order to avoid wet sludge sticking on the rotating disc, there are long scrapers fixed on the inner shell wall stretching into the gaps between discs so as to agitate the sludge and clean the surface of the discs. After being crushed and agitated, the sludge turns into granular form which is favorable for further treatment;7. Use low temperature heat source (≤180℃) for heating, thus the sludge on the disc will not be overheated after the operation being stopped; 8. The sludge treatment load is large, smooth operation can be ensured even with uneven material feeding, internal running resistance is small and power consumption is reduced significantly; 9. The upper cover can be completely opened, which makes maintenance very convenient; 10. High reliability, less repair and maintenance, can be continuously operated day and night, 8000 hours of operation per year can be ensured;11. After accidental power failure, the drier can start with load and operate stably;  12. With firm construction, the drier is durable

            Graphite introduction
Graphite is an allotrope of carbon element, each carbon atom of the neighboring link also three carbon atoms (arrangement is multiple hexagon honeycomb) by covalent bonds with the covalent molecule is formed. Because each carbon atom emits an electron, the electrons are free to move, so the graphite is a conductor. Graphite is one of the most soft minerals, and its use includes the manufacture of pencil cores and lubricants. 
Graphite application
1, as a refractory material: graphite and its products have properties of high - strength, high temperature resistance, mainly used to produce graphite crucible in the metallurgical industry, in steelmaking in graphite is usually used for the protection of steel ingot agent, metallurgical furnace lining.
2, as the conductive material: used for manufacturing electrode, carbon brush, carbon rod, carbon nanotubes, mercury is the cathode in electrical industry, graphite gaskets, telephone parts, TV picture tube coating.
3, as wear-resistant lubricating material: Graphite in the mechanical industry as a lubricant. Lubricating oils are often not used in high speed, high temperature and high pressure conditions, and graphite wear resistant materials can be used at high sliding speed in 200~2000. Many of the devices that transport corrosive media are widely used in the piston cup, seal rings and bearings, which are widely used in graphite materials. Graphite is many metal processing (drawing, drawing) the good lubricant.
4, graphite has good chemical stability. After special processing of graphite, with corrosion resistance, good thermal conductivity, low permeability characteristics, which is widely used in the manufacturing of heat exchanger, reaction tank, condenser, the burning tower, absorption tower, a cooler, a heater, a filter, a pump device. Widely used in petrochemical, wet metallurgy, acid and alkali production, synthetic fiber, paper and other industrial sectors, can save a lot of metal materials.
The corrosion resistance of the different types of non transparent graphite is different because of the different resin. Such as phenolic resin impregnated are acid, but not alkali resistant; furfuryl alcohol resin impregnated both acid and alkali. Heat tolerance of different varieties also have differences: carbon and graphite in a reducing atmosphere can be resistant to 2000 to 3000 DEG C, in an oxidizing atmosphere respectively in 350 and 400 degrees Celsius oxidation; impermeable graphite varieties with impregnating vary, generally by the heat-resistant phenolic or furfuryl alcohol immersed in 180 DEG C below.
