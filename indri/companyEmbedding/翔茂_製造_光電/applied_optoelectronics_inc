S&P 500 nudges record high, slow-motion breakout attempt underway
Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks continue to grind higher amid a constructive third-quarter start.  Consider that the S&P 500 has topped early Friday just one point under its record close (2,453), while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly registered consecutive all-time closing peaks.  A slow-motion breakout attempt remains underway.

Applied Optoelectronics expects to report profit and sales above expectations
Applied Optoelectronics Inc.  said Thursday that second-quarter profit and sales should exceed expectations, with the provider of fiber-optic access network products citing an improvement in manufacturing costs and expansion in capacity. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.36, above the FactSet consensus of $1.15. Revenue is expected to be about $117.3 million, above its previous guidance of $106.0 million to $112.0 million. The stock was halted for news until 9:00 a.m. ET. It was down 0.3% just before the halt. The stock has more than tripled year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.1%.

Charting the S&P 500’s bullish backdrop amid early third-quarter cross currents
Though the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture technicals, on balance, remain bullish.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 has maintained major support — the familiar 2,405 breakout point — while the Nasdaq Composite’s recently shakier backdrop has incrementally strengthened this week.

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.'s Best-Selling Product in 2017
AOI is making a mint in the data center right now.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 8:08PM
            
            





Optical-components maker Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of 2017, and it was a doozy. From top-line revenues to bottom-line earnings, every metric came in above the top end of management's guidance targets, and AOI's share price rose as much as 10.1% the next day.
At this point, AOI investors have enjoyed market-stomping returns of 253% in 2017 and 600% over the last 52 weeks. These massive gains are based on unrelenting demand for AOI's data-center products, to the point where the company must continue to improve its manufacturing operations in order to exploit the huge customer interest.
Let's take a closer look at the data-center components behind Applied Optoelectronics' success in 2017.

Welcome to the data center
While waiting for the full second-quarter report, let me point out that data center sales accounted for 83% of AOI's sales in the first quarter, up from 77% in the year-ago period. In particular, leading customers Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) added up to 73% of the company's total sales in 2016, as their rapidly growing cloud-computing services require epic numbers of high-speed data-center networks.
Copper-based Ethernet cables are going out of style for these applications, because the data streams moving around modern data centers can overwhelm gigabit cables, and faster Ethernet solutions are limited by data loss over long cable runs. The top-shelf Cat 7 cables required for 10-gigabit Ethernet connections are only rated for up to 100 meters of cable length.





That's where AOI and its sector rivals step in with fiber-optic transceiver modules rated for speeds up to 100 gigabits per second -- with no practical limit on cable lengths in the confines of a data center. AOI's 40-gigabit (40G) and 100G modules for data-center applications are listed at maximum cable runs as long as 10 kilometers.

Optical transceiver modules
About two-thirds of AOI's data-center sales are for 40G optical transceivers; the remainder comes from 100G transceivers. The mix is changing as customers look into next-generation 100G networks, and AOI is already developing 200G and 400G transceivers for future use.
The basic design of these faster solutions is not changing. The popular QSFP package seen above combines a small physical footprint with low power consumption, allowing device builders and data-center operators to cram a lot of bandwidth into small spaces. Instead, the core research is going into developing faster laser diodes. Inside 40G modules there's a bundle of four 10-gigabit diodes; the diode speed steps up to 25G in a 100G module and 56 gigabits per second in the recently introduced 200G module.

S&P 500 nudges record high, slow-motion breakout attempt underway
Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks continue to grind higher amid a constructive third-quarter start.  Consider that the S&P 500 has topped early Friday just one point under its record close (2,453), while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly registered consecutive all-time closing peaks.  A slow-motion breakout attempt remains underway.

Applied Optoelectronics expects to report profit and sales above expectations
Applied Optoelectronics Inc.  said Thursday that second-quarter profit and sales should exceed expectations, with the provider of fiber-optic access network products citing an improvement in manufacturing costs and expansion in capacity. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.36, above the FactSet consensus of $1.15. Revenue is expected to be about $117.3 million, above its previous guidance of $106.0 million to $112.0 million. The stock was halted for news until 9:00 a.m. ET. It was down 0.3% just before the halt. The stock has more than tripled year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.1%.

Charting the S&P 500’s bullish backdrop amid early third-quarter cross currents
Though the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture technicals, on balance, remain bullish.  On a headline basis, the S&P 500 has maintained major support — the familiar 2,405 breakout point — while the Nasdaq Composite’s recently shakier backdrop has incrementally strengthened this week.

How Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. Stock Rose 58% in July
Preliminary earnings looked great and analysts are falling over themselves to compliment this fiber-optic components supplier. Except for that guy in the corner. Here's why he's wrong.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Aug 1, 2017 at 6:53AM
            
            





What happened
Shares of  Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI) gained 58% in July 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Yes, the stock gained 58% in a single month. That's not a typo.
So what
The maker of high-speed transceivers and other components for fiber-optic networking equipment was already on a massive roll at the start of July, having soared nearly 200% higher in the first six months of 2017. And then the train kept rolling.
AOI released preliminary second-quarter results on July 13, exceeding management's own guidance targets by wide margins. An avalanche of analyst upgrades and target price boosts followed, and AOI's share prices jolted upward with every rosy research note.

Now what
Analyst firm BWS Financial broke from the jubilant crowd to issue a sell rating on AOI with a hugely negative target price of $25 per share on July 20. Its theory is that largest customer, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), has been ordering high-speed optical transceivers from AOI rival Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) recently, arguably pointing to lost sales for this highflier.
The markets simply shrugged off that complaint and AOI's rise continued. Amazon could simply be ordering more transceivers on top of the large supply AOI can provide. Consider this quote by Applied Optoelectronics CFO Stefan Murry from the first-quarter earnings call in May: "Right now, we're basically shipping everything we can manufacture. So the growth rate is not dependent on demand. It's dependent on our ability to continue to ramp our manufacturing."
Murry added, "There's a limit to how fast we can increase our production capacity. So that's really the limiting factor to the growth rate."
So Amazon might be wise to expand its component sourcing to another supplier -- and that's not necessarily bad news for AOI at all.

SEMICONDUCTOR LASER
Photonics SpectraNov 1999Applied Optoelectronics Inc. (AOI)Request Info 
        

            Applied Optoelectronics Inc. and the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center at the University of Houston have collaborated to create a dual-wavelength mid-IR semiconductor laser. It operates at 110 K and produces a total peak output of 150 mW per uncoated output facet under pulsed operation. The laser emits at 4.482 and 4.568 µm with a threshold current density of less than 120 A/cm2. External quantum efficiency is 278% for a 0.4-mm cavity length with an injection current of 500 mA. The device is suitable for chemical sensing applications where one wavelength is tuned to a molecular absorption line and the other is used for baseline correction.Visit company websitehttp://www.ao-inc.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=1000
