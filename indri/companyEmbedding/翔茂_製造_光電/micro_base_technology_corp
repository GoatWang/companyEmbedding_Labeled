1. What is the Stratum Corneum?
The purpose of the stratum corneum is to form a barrier to protect underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and stress. Desquamation, the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum, balances the growth of new skin cells that form in the deeper layers of the skin. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately 28-45 days. Just as fine lines appear when the skin is dehydrated, the accumulation of dead cells makes skin look dull, and also affects the absorption of skin care products.

2. Skin Moisturizing Mechanism
Skin moisture requires the circulation of new skin cells and removal of old ones. In order for the cells to receive enough water, they require the correct balance of hyaluronic acid, collagen, EGF and lipids. This creates a healthy skin condition. However, because the stratum corneum is exposed to a variety of environmental stresses, and as age increases and we experience stress, this results in a lack of moisture, dull skin, and fine lines.

3. The Rumour 3D Micro-Infusion Microcrystalline Principle
The thickness of the stratum corneum is generally 10-40 microns for most people. The Rumour 3D micro-infusion microcrystalline utilizes its advanced technology to loosen the stratum corneum, create micro channels in the skin in order to deliver hyaluronic acid to the underlying layer, increasing its ability to absorb and retain water. The micron-level stimulation revitalizes and repairs the skin, refines skin texture, and improves dullness.

4. What is Hydration?
The crystallized water delivered by The Rumour provides skin hydration. In simple terms, water hydration restores or maintains fluid balance, supplying water, fluids, and electrolytes to surrounding cells in order to provide an ideal environment for cell survival. It is essential for maintaining healthy body functioning.

5. What is Hyaluronate?
Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid, HA), also known as uronic acid, is naturally present in the body's connective tissue, forming a transparent gelatinous layer in the skin. Hyaluronate is essential for skin firmness and elasticity. It can absorb 500-1000 times its own weight in water, which makes it one of the best moisturizing ingredients.

6. The Importance of Hyaluronate
The amount of hyaluronic acid in the skin decreases as we age. This makes the skin gradually lose the ability to store water, causing dry skin, wrinkles, and dull skin tone. By replenishing hyaluronic acid, these effects can be slowed or reversed. A greater amount of hyaluronic acid allows cells to absorb and use nutrients more efficiently, creating healthy skin that looks great.
