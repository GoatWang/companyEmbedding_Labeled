Introducing Driver Matic.  In May 2007, PC Pitstop announced a revolutionary technology called Driver Matic.  
						Driver Matic allows the installation of a driver with the click of a button.  Prior to Driver Matic, all drivers had to be installed differently and required significant user involvement.  Now with Driver Matic, a PC can have up to date drivers automatically.  
						Driver Matic has been integrated into both PC Matic and Driver Alert 2.0.  Driver Matic finally has made it simple and easy to keep your drivers up to date.  Only at PC Pitstop.
To find the latest driver for your computer we recommend running our Free Driver Scan.
Find out how to make your computer faster by running our Free Performance Scan.


Tips from the PitCrew

If a hardware device isn't functioning properly, or if a program or game that you're installing states that it requires newer drivers, a driver update will be in order. 
Also, with many wireless adapters it is important to stay current as updates often contain security fixes. A driver update may also improve stability and performance, or may fix issues with games, programs and power management.
New drivers can unlock additional features for a device that may not have been available before. If you receive notification from a program or a manufacturer that a newer driver is available, it would be a good idea to check the release notes and see what’s different than the driver you’re already using.

Wistron Corporation (Chinese: 緯創資通股份有限公司; pinyin: Wěichuàng Zītōng Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) is a major original design manufacturer in Taiwan. It was the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc. before being spun off in 2000.
Wistron employs over 60,000 people worldwide.[2] As an ODM (original design manufacturer) Wistron designs and manufactures products for other companies to sell under their own brand name. Wistron focuses on ICT (information and communication technology) products, including notebook PCs, desktop PCs, servers, storage, LCD TVs, and handheld devices. Wistron provides a variety of technology services within the design, manufacturing, and after-sales service functions tailored to meet customers' specific requirements. [3]
In July 2011, Wistron and Microsoft entered into an agreement that offered coverage under Microsoft's exclusive rights portfolio for Wistron products including tablets, mobile phones and other devices running the Chrome OS or Android platform.[4] In September 2011, Wistron signed a patent licensing agreement with Intellectual Ventures.[5]
