MaxLinear Aligns with UMC for Production of World's Smallest Silicon Tuner Device
MxL7001 IC fabricated on UMC's CMOS process
 
HSINCHU, TAIWAN AND CARLSBAD, Calif. – July 10, 2007 - UMC [(NYSE: UMC; TWSE: 2303)] and MaxLinear, Inc., 
                a technology leader at the forefront of developing fully integrated 
                broadband radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for worldwide television 
                standards, today announced that MaxLinear produced its breakthrough 
                silicon tuner IC, the MxL7001 on UMC's CMOS process. The MxL7001 
                is the world's smallest silicon tuner produced to date for mobile 
                TV applications such as digital TV (ISDB-T) on cell phones. 

"This successful cooperation between UMC 
                and MaxLinear has resulted in a technology that is poised to provide 
                consumers with high-quality digital TV on mobile applications, without 
                interfering with the size, power or performance of end appliances," 
                said Henry Liu, senior vice president of UMC's New Business Development 
                Division. "Our most recent fabrication alliance with MaxLinear 
                follows a series of other similar successful product developments 
                for them, including MaxLinear's Silicon Tuner for fixed and portable 
                television applications that is currently in volume production at 
                UMC."

"We are very excited about our cooperation 
                with UMC as we were able to produce the MxL7001on CMOS rather than 
                in SiGe, an industry breakthrough," noted Kishore Seendripu, 
                MaxLinear's CEO and president. "UMC has continued to show us 
                over and over again that it has the process technology, the people 
                and the support to help us deliver leading products to market. We 
                are looking forward to continuing our collaboration as we head toward 
                volume production of the MxL7001, and toward cooperating on a myriad 
                of other exciting technology developments."

About the MxL7001 
                The MxL7001 is a 1.9mm x 1.9mm single-die, digital CMOS IC that 
                is at the foundation of a family of MaxLinear products supporting 
                mobile TV standards worldwide. The device is 1/10th the packaged 
                area of MaxLinear's MxL5000-family ICs (6mm x 6mm) which set the 
                previous record for small size, low power, and superior performance. 
                The MxL5000 ICs will continue to be a part of MaxLinear's standard 
                offering for fixed and portable television tuner applications. Using 
                a standard digital CMOS process technology, the MxL7001 consumes 
                only 65mW of power, reducing battery draw and minimizing heat dissipation 
                -- two very important criteria for mobile TV applications. The highly 
                integrated MxL7001 supports both ISDB-T 1-segment and 3-segment 
                applications. MxL7001 eliminates the need for an external balun, 
                SAW filters and IF amplifier, which reduces both board footprint 
                and BOM costs.

History[edit]
Founding and growth[edit]
MaxLinear was founded in 2003[1] in Carlsbad, California[3] by "eight semiconductor industry veterans."[2] Kishore Seendripu was co-founder, and would become chairman, president, and chief executive. Among other companies, in the past Seendripu had worked on the technical staff at Broadcom.[1] Prior to 2009, the majority of the company's revenue was from the sale of its "mobile handset digital television receivers" which contained MaxLinear's digital television RF receiver chips, in Japan. The biggest customers for the product were Panasonic, Murata, and MTC[disambiguation needed]. However, in 2009, the company sold more chips for use in digital set top boxes in Europe, automotive navigation displays, and digital TVs.[2] In 2009, the company shipped 75 million chips to companies such as Panasonic and Sony,[4] with 99 percent of its sales in Asia.[2]
In November 2009, MaxLinear announced it intended to go public.[1] At the time of the IPO, MaxLinear’s venture investors included Mission Ventures in San Diego, U.S. Venture Partners, Battery Ventures and UMC Capital.[5] MaxLinear raised around $35 million in venture capital prior to the IPO, spending around half of it. By the end of 2009, the company had $17.9 million in cash.[1] That year, MaxLinear had $51.4 million in revenue and $4.3 million in profit.[1]
IPO[edit]
The company held an initial public offering on March 24, 2010[1][5] on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3] under the ticker symbol MXL. Initially the company expected to raise around $43 million with the IPO, with that projection later raised to $90 million after a last-minute increase in share price by the company.[5] Writes the San Diego Union-Tribune, "shares soared 34 percent on their debut. MaxLinear collected about $92 million from the offering, with its shares opening at $14 and peaking at $18.70 on the first day of trading."[1] After the debut, MaxLinear said it planned to use the proceeds for "general corporate purposes," and perhaps for acquiring competitor businesses or products.[4]
Recent[edit]
By May 2010, the company employed 135 people.[1] In May 2015, MaxLinear acquired Entropic Communications. In April 2016, MaxLinear bought Microsemi's wireless backhaul business, adding about 30 workers to its workforce. In May 2016, MaxLinear announced it would buy Broadcom's "wireless backhaul infrastructure for 80 million in cash," in what was its second acquisition for the year. In the Broadcom deal, MaxLinear took on about 120 additional employees.[3] On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash.[6] As of 2017, MaxLinear is on the Multimedia over Coax Alliance board of directors as well as Arris, Broadcom, Comcast, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Echostar, Intel, and Verizon.[7]
Facilities and employees[edit]
MaxLinear is based in Carlsbad, California,[3] with research and development centers in Irvine, California, China and India.[citation needed] A "fabless" company, it uses outside chipmaking facilities, known as foundries or fabs, to manufacture its chips.[citation needed] By 2010, it used "third-party contractors in Asia for manufacturing and assembly," with all its chips made by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) at foundries in Taiwan and Singapore.[2] As of early March 2010, the company had 177 employees, with most in R&D.[2]
Products[edit]
MaxLinear sells its products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), module makers and original design manufacturers (ODMs).[citation needed] The San Diego Union-Tribune writes that "MaxLinear’s product is very small radio-frequency TV tuner chips — half the size of an individual dial button on the keypad of a cell phone."[4] According to Xconomy, "MaxLinear focuses on designing semiconductor chips that enable people to watch TV on devices with a wireless broadband connection."[5] The "tiny chips"[1] are further described as "high-performance radio frequency (RF) systems-on-a-chip for receiving and processing digital TV broadcasts, digital videos, and broadband data downloads," in order to "enable people to watch TV on a handheld wireless device."[2]
San Diego Union-Tribune writes that the company aims to "take over from bulky 'can' tuners in TVs and other electronics. It plans to get its chips into computers, set-top boxes, mobile phones and in-vehicle video systems."[4] Most of its customers were in Europe and Japan as of 2010, where the chips are used in "analog-to-digital set-top boxes."[4] They are also used in televisions, mobile phones, computers,[1] terrestrial digital[citation needed] and cable set-top boxes, car video systems,[1] DOCSIS 3.0 voice and data cable modems, digital televisions, and netbooks.[citation needed] The company designs its analog and mixed-signal circuits in standard CMOS process technology for low-cost manufacturing.[1]
Collaborations[edit]
In April 2013, SES S.A. announced the development by Inverto, Abilis and MaxLinear Inc of a prototype Sat-IP LNB (IP-LNB), which was demonstrated at a conference held at SES' headquarters in Luxembourg. The IP-LNB incorporates eight-channel satellite-to-IP bridging technology to deliver eight concurrent channels via IP unicast or multicast to fixed and portable client devices. As of July 2012, the prototype IP-LNB was being developed into a commercial product.[8]

Corporate Profile
MaxLinear delivers high-performance broadband and networking semiconductors based on its highly integrated radio frequency analog technology, high-performance optical networking technology and its pioneering MoCA and Direct Broadcast Satellite ODU single-wire technology.
MaxLinear was founded in 2003. The company’s original high performance, radio-frequency receiver products capture and process digital and analog broadband signals for applications including terrestrial, cable and satellite television and DOCSIS broadband. These products include both RF receivers and RF receiver systems-on-chip, or SoCs, which incorporate highly integrated radio system architecture and demodulator technology. The company’s products were based on its pioneering low power, low cost CMOS process technology.
In 2015, the company acquired Entropic, the world leader in semiconductor solutions for the connected home. Entropic pioneered multimedia over coax (MoCA) home networking technology. The company’s technology transforms how traditional broadcast and IP streaming video is seamlessly, reliably, and securely delivered, processed, and distributed into and throughout the home.
MaxLinear also offers optical networking driver and trans-impedance amplifier ICs for 100G / 400G optical data center networks. The devices use advanced technology that cut in half the number of channels needed in optical transmission modules, reducing power consumption, size and cost for 100Gbps and 400Gbps networks.
MaxLinear technology is trusted by leading telephone, cable and satellite operators, set-top box manufacturers, networking equipment providers and consumer technology providers.
