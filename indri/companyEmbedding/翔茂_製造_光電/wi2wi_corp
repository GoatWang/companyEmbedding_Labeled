目錄
Product Code: SE 2384The ever-increasing demands for miniaturization and higher functionality at less cost processes have driven the development of stacked ICs and System in Package (SiP) technologies. System in Package (SiP) is a single reduced functional module realized by the horizontal tiling or vertical stacking of two or more similar or dissimilar bare die or packaged chips. Taking the chips nearer enables the highest level of silicon integration and area efficiency at the lowest cost, compared to mounting them separately in traditional ways. In doing so, the electrical pathway length between chips is reduced, leading to a higher performance.
System on Package (SOP) is an emerging trend in the system miniaturization technology in divergence to System-on-Chip (SOC) at IC level and System in Package (SiP) at module level. System in Package (SiP) is obtained by thinning ICs from its original 800 micron thick wafer dimensions to 50 microns and stacking as many as 10 of these, one on top of the other, in 3D form. These are then interconnected by either wire bond or flip-chip technology. The current Through Silicon via (TSV) developments have further condensed System in Package (SiP) by replacing flip chip with pad to pad bonding.
The capability to integrate different technologies and to reduce total production cost and time to market are the prime drivers for System in Package (SiP) packaging. System in Package (SiP) has enabled the rapid integration of active and passive devices into single package solutions. This approach has also reduced product costs, allowing systems to be partitioned into the most cost-effective blocks. The stacked System in Package (SiP) alignments reduce the system size and eliminate the cost of individual packages for each die. They also improve signal transmission times and reduced power by minimizing capacitive loads between ICs.
The rapid expansion of the System in Package (SiP) market has inspired research and development in System in Package (SiP) associated technology by Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) as well as Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) providers and Semiconductor Assembly Services (SAS). With this evolution of System in Package (SiP) technology during the last few decades, the future trend for System in Package (SiP) technology in the next decade or two will be clearer if we look at the future electronics market sectors such as mobile products, high-end computers, automobiles, flat-panel High-Definition TVs (HDTVs), and sensors for security, health care, and environment. The consumer mobile products will advance to more multi functionality, thus, realizing the digital convergent dream with flexible displays with LED as a light source, thin film, or nano batteries.
Some of the key players in this market include Amkor Technology (U.S.), ASE Global (Taiwan), Powertech Technology (Taiwan), STATS ChipPAC (Singapore), ChipMOS Technologies (Taiwan), Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. (Taiwan), InsightSiP (France), Freescale Semiconductor Inc. (U.S.), Wi2Wi  Inc.(U.S.), and Nanium S.A. (Portugal), among others.Table of Contents

Wi2wi Corporation Announces FV Series of Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillators
Jul 10 17
Wi2Wi Corporation announced the FV series of Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillators (VCXO), a further promising extension of its product portfolio. The FV series of Voltage Controlled Crystals Oscillators (VCXO) are based on Wi2Wi's proprietary programmable Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Technology and gives industry's best ultra-low power and ultra-low jitter and can withstand the most extreme environment without compromising its performance. The FV series VCXOs supports various output types such as LVPECL, LVDS, CML and LVCMOS and is available in two different supply voltages, 2.5v and 3.3v. Based on each customer's applications and requirements, the FV series VCXOs can be customized to any frequency from 10MHz to 1500 MHz for outputs LVPECL, LVDS, and CML, and the frequencies can be customised from 10MHz to 250MHz for LVCMOS outputs. With less than 600 Femtosecond Jitter performance (12 kHz to 20MHz) and less than 200mW power dissipation makes the JV series VCXOs the industry's best in class in performance, functionality and reliability. The FV Series SMD VCXOs come in various operating temperatures; Commercial, Industrial and full MIL temperature ranges; -55°C to +125°C and is available in three different surface mount (SMD) package foot prints; FV3 (3.2mm x 2.5mm), FV5 (5.0mm x 3.2mm) and FV7 (5.0mm x 7.0mm).


Wi2Wi Corporation Announces Board Changes

Wi2Wi Corporation Announces Extension of Product Portfolio
Jun 12 17
Wi2Wi Corporation announced a further promising extension of its product portfolio. Specifics on the new product series: The new low noise VN05 series of Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillators (OCXO) are packed with best in class features, performance, functionality and stability in a very small surface mount (SMD) packaging. The low noise option for VN05 series SMD OCXO are available in various outputs; CMOS, LVCMOS and 50 ohm SINE WAVE outputs to +13dBm. VN05 series are available in standard power supply options of 3.3V, 5.0V and 12V. The customers also have options to use external voltage control with or without internal voltage references. The best in class stability options from ±1ppb to ±5ppb while dissipating <1W of power +25°C makes VN05 series very attractive for low power applications across many industries . VN05 series of SMD OCXO offers best in class phase noise performance of -100dBc/Hz at only 1Hz offset and -130dBc/Hz at 10Hz offset. The size verses the performance makes VN05 SMD OCXO ideal for many applications in the portable equipment markets. Applications include communication and test equipment, avionics, medical and military markets. Standard frequencies currently available are 5, 10, 12.8, 12, 16.384, 19.2, 19.44, 20, 25, and 26MHz. The VN05 series can be customised to a wide range of custom frequencies as well. Product with standard frequencies can be shipped in 4-6 weeks custom frequencies can be shipped in 8-10 weeks.

The FV series is a family of Surface Mount Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillators (SMD VCXO) which provides the industry's best-in-class ultra-low jitter and power," said Michael Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board."The release of the FV series of Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillators will significantly expand the market for our Crystal Oscillator family of products. The low-power and ultra-low jitter performance of the FV series, which do not compromise size and stability, are excellent building blocks for low jitter frequency translators and jitter attenuator applications in the premium markets. The new series will achieve superior performance for a wide range of applications across many markets, including communication and test equipment, avionics, space, medical and military equipment. Wi2Wi continues to expand its frequency control and timing device portfolios to better serve our client's most demanding technical requirements," said Zachariah Mathews, President and CEO of Wi2Wi.Specifics on the New Product Series:The FV series of Voltage Controlled Crystals Oscillators (VCXO) is based on Wi2Wi's proprietary programmable Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Technology and gives the industry's best ultra-low power and ultra-low jitter and can withstand the most extreme environment without compromising its performance. The FV series VCXOs supports various output types such as LVPECL, LVDS, CML and LVCMOS and is available in two different supply voltages, 2.5v and 3.3v. Based on each customer's applications and requirements, the FV series VCXOs can be customized to any frequency from 10MHz to 1500 MHz for outputs LVPECL, LVDS, and CML, and the frequencies can be customized from 10MHz to 250MHz for LVCMOS outputs. With less than 600 Femtosecond Jitter performance (12 kHz to 20MHz) and less than 200mW power dissipation, the FV series of VCXOs is the industry's best-in-class in performance, functionality, and reliability.The FV Series SMD VCXOs come in various operating temperatures; Commercial, Industrial and full MIL temperature ranges; -55°C to +125°C and is available in three different surface mount (SMD) package footprints; FV3 (3.2mm x 2.5mm), FV5 (5.0mm x 3.2mm) and FV7 (5.0mm x 7.0mm)Samples and production units are readily available. Samples can available within 2-5 business days and volume production quantities are available in less than two weeks.For further information, please contact:Dawn LeederChief Financial Officer608 203 0234 dawn_l@wi2wi.comAbout IoT and M2MEssentially, IoT and M2M describe the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. Driven by several factors including the growth in the availability of Broadband Internet, which reduces the cost of connecting, and the related increase in Wi-Fi capabilities as well as sensors built into myriad technologies, this has been described as the "perfect storm" for the IoT. Almost any device with an on and off switch that can be connected to the Internet (and/or to each other) - anything from cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices, cars, as well as machine components in the engine of a jet airplane or the drill of an oil rig. According to analyst firm Gartner, by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices. Others think this figure could be too conservative by a factor of four.About Wi2Wi CorporationWi2Wi is a vertically-integrated technology company which designs, manufactures and markets high-performance, low-power wireless connectivity solutions, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) modules, and frequency control devices.

“This is our eighth new best in class product released this year and the fourth from Wireless Connectivity.  WE935, from our EM series, gives industry our highest level of integration for their customers and is a simpler and faster way to embed wireless connectivity to their end products.  By adopting the plug and play WE935 our clients can substantially reduce their customer’s time to market and their overall product development cost. ” said Michael Sonnenreich, Chairman of the Board.
“I am proud to say that our R&D team continues to produce only best in class products for our customers.  The performance and feature packed WE935 is targeted to reduce the complexity of wireless integration. By completely off-loading the external Microcontroller (MCU) from wireless activities, our customer can dedicate the external host for application development and significantly reduce their time to market and their R&D cost."  said Zachariah Mathews, President and CEO of Wi2Wi.

About IoT and M2M
Essentially, IoT and M2M describe the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. Driven by several factors including the growth in the availability of Broadband Internet, which reduces the cost of connecting, and the related increase in Wi-Fi capabilities as well as sensors built into myriad technologies, this has been described as the “perfect storm” for the IoT. Almost any device with an on and off switch that can be connected to the Internet (and/or to each other) – anything from cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, lamps, wearable devices, cars, as well as machine components in the engine of a jet airplane or the drill of an oil rig.  According to analyst firm Gartner, by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices. Others think this figure could be too conservative by a factor of four.
