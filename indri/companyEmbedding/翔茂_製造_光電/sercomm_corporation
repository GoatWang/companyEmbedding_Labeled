										Fixed Mobile Convergence
									





	In response to an era of digital convergence, telecom operators and system service providers have continued to promote diverse value-added services and actively established Next-generation Networks to stimulate the need for broadband equipment upgrade. Following the evolution from Wireless Networks (Radio Access Network) to all IP technology, the distinction between fixed and mobile networks will be reduced. Telecom operators can offer customers greater value-added application services and superior experience by creating seamless service using a combination of fixed broadband and local access wireless technologies to meet their needs in homes, offices, urban areas and on the go. This is the so-called “Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC)”.

	 

	Sercomm has committed long-term investments in the development of the core technologies pertaining to telecom broadband and successfully set the industrial trends. The key technologies and products for FMC include Small Cells, Wi-Fi Hotspots, LTE products, M2M networking equipment and Quad-Play solutions (data, voice, video and mobile). Sercomm has been distributing and implementing these technologies and products for several years, and has become a leader in its field. The company has shown outstanding performance in the integration and development of software, firmware and hardware, providing complete and customized solutions to assist clients in establishing an all IP network infrastructure and increasing ARPU (Average Revenue per Unit). Therefore, Sercomm is the optimal partner for telecom operators and service providers.

Small Cells
	 


		According to the definition from Small Cell Forum, “small cells are low-power wireless access points that operate in licensed spectrum, are operator-managed and feature edge-based intelligence and Types of small cells include femtocells, picocells, metrocells and microcells– broadly increasing in size from femtocells (the smallest) to microcells (the largest)”
		 

		Small cells not only improve cellular coverage, capacity of use and applications for homes and enterprises as well as metropolitan and rural public spaces, but also facilitate a new breed of mobile service that exploits the technology’s ability to detect presence, connect and interact with existing networks. In addition, small cells are easy to install and are able to leverage the existing broadband network to form signal coverage. Above benefits make small cells prominent in present and future telecommunications market layout.




		Sercomm has strived to the R&D of small cells as member of the Small Cell Forum established in 2007. With its strong R&D capability of software and firmware, Sercomm provides not only 3G small cells (WCDMA/TDSCDMA), but also the latest 4G small cells (LTE-FDD/LTE-TDD) as mainstream products. In addition, Sercomm also offers customers integrated services related to small cells, such as integrating WiFi, router, GPON and other technologies into the small cells, and also provides small cell service manager.

										IP Cameras
									










		With the increasing market penetration of IP Camera, new technology weeds out the old and brings forth the new constantly. From the beginning development of MJPEG to recently MPEG-4, H.264 has become the main stream of IP Camera video format nowadays. As for video resolution, it progressively develops from SD to HD (High Definition) format.



	Sercomm has been focused on IP Camera for more than a decade and has delivered a full series of cameras, ranging from high-end professional video surveillance cameras to entry level consumer types. Furthermore, Sercomm also develops all kinds of IP Cameras based on different technologies.



		Sercomm has been engaged in R & D in the field of smart home and security surveillance for many years, and has developed a full series of solutions. Sercomm not only provides customers with different types and diversified IP camera products, such as VGA, HD, WiFi, PoE, etc., but also integrates various IP cameras into customers' systems in a timely manner to meet their demands in real time.

An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: P27RC8221V2 is P27. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, RC8221V2, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.

An FCC ID is the product ID assigned by the FCC to identify wireless products in the market. The FCC chooses 3 or 5 character "Grantee" codes to identify the business that created the product.
For example, the grantee code for FCC ID: P27NA930ZW2G is P27. The remaining characters of the FCC ID, NA930ZW2G, are often associated with the product model, but they can be random. These letters are chosen by the applicant.
In addition to the application, the FCC also publishes internal images, external images, user manuals, and test results for wireless devices. They can be under the "exhibits" tab below.
