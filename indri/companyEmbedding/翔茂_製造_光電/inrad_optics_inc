Photonic Products Group, Inc. ("PPGI") Announces Name Change to Inrad Optics, Inc.Date Announced: 23 Jan 2012New Jersey crystal maker goes back to its roots.
NORTHVALE, N.J., Jan. 23, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The directors of Photonic Products Group, Inc. are pleased to announce that at a Special Meeting  of the Shareholders held January 18, 2012, a change of the Company name was approved, from Photonic Products Group, Inc. to Inrad Optics, Inc.
Inrad Optics, Inc. has long been known as one of the photonic industry's seminal crystalline products companies.  Founded in 1973 as Inrad, Inc., the Company operated under the name Photonic Products Group, Inc. until the recent name change. 
The Company has executed the name change in order to leverage the positive historical and current brand equity of the original Inrad name, and more clearly communicate the Company's principal business activities to both the photonics marketplace and the investment community. The stock, listed on the OTC BB, will continue to trade as PHPG.OB in the immediate future.
Joe Rutherford, Inrad Optics CEO, said of the name change, "The original Inrad organization possessed a remarkable history that began in the formative years of the laser industry.  Our new name pays homage to that history, and also signifies a bright new future for our organization." 
Inrad Optics built its reputation on its ability to grow and fabricate crystalline materials to exceptional quality standards.  Today, Inrad Optics is a vertically-integrated photonics manufacturer offering crystal-based optical components and devices, custom optical components from both glass and metal, and precision optical and opto-mechanical assemblies.  Its products are used in a wide variety of defense, aerospace, laser, medical, process control and metrology applications.

Zinc Germanium Phosphide (ZGP)



Zinc Germanium Phosphide (ZGP) is one of those few reliable, efficient, high quality non-linear crystals that is beginning to dominate applications in a particular spectral region due to the unique properties of the material. A high non-linear coefficient (75 pm/V), good thermal conductivity (35 W/mK), relatively high Laser Damage Threshold (2-5 J/cm2 typically), and transparency with phase-matchability over the 2 μm – 8 μm range (and beyond) highlight the desirable properties of the material.
