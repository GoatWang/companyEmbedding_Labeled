The Women's Shop
At Amazon Fashion, we believe that Smart is Beautiful. That’s why we offer a vast yet easy-to-shop selection of women’s clothing, shoes, jewelry, watches, handbags, and more that answer women’s fashion needs for the workplace, special occasions, and everyday style.
Each season you’ll find a carefully curated assortment of women’s clothing and accessories from new and established brands–including Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Clarks, DKNYC, Fossil, Guess, Invicta, Jessica Simpson, kate spade new york, Levi’s, Nine West, Sam Edelman, Theory, Tommy Hilfiger, Versace, and hundreds more. Our women’s clothing selection houses both classic and on-trend options so you can find exactly what you want–favorite denim, women’s dresses, office-ready looks, everyday tees, swimwear, and other wardrobe essentials. Check out our selection of women’s shoes for styles that complement the latest women’s clothing, or to find must-haves like running shoes, rain boots, and outdoor shoes. Additionally, our women’s watches and jewelry categories serve up stylish accents to suit any occasion or outfit.
For specific women’s fashion needs, take a look at our specialty shops, which offer athletic wear, plus and petite sizes, maternity clothing, and more. And for those searching for gifts for women who love fashion, you’ll find a wealth of sparkling watches, fine jewelry, luxe handbags, and other style-centric options that fit virtually any budget.
To keep you in-the-know about new women’s fashion, we provide features on emerging trends, styling advice, and more. For example, you may find tips on what to pack for a weekend getaway, the key pieces to invest in for the season, and can’t-miss holiday gifts for everyone on your list.
Amazon wants to make your shopping experience as convenient as possible, which is why we’ve organized our women’s fashion into easily searchable categories. You can easily filter by item, brand, size, color, and more to find the items you need–and want–now. Best of all, many of our items are eligible for free shipping and free returns, meaning you can shop worry-free.

Timeline gives you the info you need, when you want it–so you can live 'now' to the fullest.
    





        Plays Well With Everyone

Best all-aroundByChris Uptonon May 29, 2016Color: Black|Package Type: Standard Packaging|Verified PurchaseI've owned so many watches and smart bands/fitness bands, I can definitely give a detailed idea of what makes the Pebble watches shine vs the competition. Let me get this out of the way...if battery life is important and you don't want to be charging every day or two, this is your watch. Other watches have good battery life (like the Martian Notifier I owned), but they don't have near the functions/features/capabilities of this watch. This is such a joy to own because it "just works" and you aren't always charging it. I've never had a notification from email/text/phone call not come through in the few weeks that I've owned it. I love Android phones and I've played with Android Wear watches, but I'm astonished at how well the Pebble OS just does everything I need it without feeling like a smart phone on my arm. Other people have said it, but this watch truly is an extension of your phone.I was in the camp that saw smart watches as a useless product. But as a Realtor, I get a ton of calls and notifications all day. I found the vibration on my Note 4 wasn't strong enough in my pocket and I would always miss calls. Plus, I'm pulling out my phone for every buzz I do feel. This watch has completely changed my life. I probably reach for my phone 75% less because I can dismiss notifications straight from the watch. I can also shoot back a text or email directly from the watch through voice dictation. The accuracy of the voice text is amazing. 99% of the time, it perfectly picks up what I say. It seems better than Google Now or Dragon Dictation on my phone. Super impressed. Let's move on to the pros and cons list.PROS:Battery Life - Unparalleled for what the watch actually does. I get a TON of notifications. I could probably get 4 days. Most people would get almost a week.Comfort - The watch band is the most comfortable of any smart watch I owned. I eventually opted to go with a dressier mesh band because of my daily attire, but if the silicone black band is what you like, this is the most comfortable. Any 22mm band works, which is really nice for most of these watches.Size - I have average size lower arms, and this watch is a great medium size. It would be fine for a male or female. If you love huge face watches, you might find this a TAD small.Buttons - I like the butttons. Some people may find this to be a con, but I don't. Buttons always work. Touch screen sometimes doesn't. These screens are pretty small for a touch screen too. I think the buttons are faster.Pebble Health - They are constantly updating it to make it better and closer to a fitness app. Right now, it still lacks some functionality like adding workouts. Apparently it's coming soon, but the problem is the calorie count will never reflect any type of weighlifting or HIIT style workout because it can't be manually added on the watch or in the app. It's not like anybody should be taking these watch's calorie burn estimates as truthful anyway, but not being able to account for workouts makes it even more off. The pedometer function of the Pebble Time is good. It tends to stay on the lower side for step count compared to others I've worn at the same time (MS Band 2, Garmin Vivosmart HR, Zenwatch 2, Fitbit Blaze). The Pebble Time honestly seemed more accurate than almost any other one, but this is still a notification watch first and foremost.CONS:Screen (compared to Android Wear/Apple Watch) - The reason you get that battery life is because of the very low color E-Paper screen. It's sorta monochrome looking..sorta dull. It's really one of those things you have to wear for a few days to see if it bothers you. We are so used to amazing LCD screens on all our devices, the Pebble Time just seems...underwhelming. To me, the screen helps make it feel like an accessory or extension of the phone compared to just another smaller phone on my arm. The first few hours were weird, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. It's also visible in the sun compared to normal LCD watches too.Bezel - I don't know why the bezel needs to be so big on these watches. They could have made the screen much bigger in the same size. This is a problem with a lot of smartwatches. I just don't get it. Wasted space.Looks - It's an average looking watch at best. It sorta looks like a toy, depending on the band. You could pull it off in a professional environment, especially with a mesh or link band. But..it looks much more at home in the gym. The just announced Pebble Time 2 is all steel and should be a nicer looking watch. However that won't be out until almost Christmas '16 and it will cost double what this Pebble Time is going for in May.Conclusion: Overall, I love this watch. The positives far outweigh the negatives. Pebble is always working on updates and this watch will get updated with the new OS that will ship with the Pebble Time 2. A few tweaks could make it even more outstanding. The development community is active and new apps are coming out for Pebble every day. For about a hundred bucks, this watch is a bargain. If I missed something, I will add it in the review as I remember. If you have any questions about this watch or any others, please let know in the comments. If I've helped you with my review, I would REALLY appreciate if you clicked the "helpful" button. Good luck with your smart watch search!Read more

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsIts beautiful with a few limitations, I am keeping it (week 2, 5, 9, & 12 edits)ByVCon July 23, 2015Color: Black|Package Type: Standard PackagingLet me set the context, I've been using Pebble and Pebble Steel for a while. I am a fan of Apple User Interface (Macs, iPhone, etc.) and have several Apple products but I think they failed with Apple Watch.What's working for Pebble:1) Battery - Relatively speaking this is a best option you have for iOS or Android if you don't want to charge your watch everyday. They claim 5 days with Pebble Time, I've yet to exceed 3 days realistically but 3 days is good enough too, I didn't have to charge it through an entire long weekend vacation, which was nice.2) User Interface - Pebble did it. Its snappy, fun, easy to learn, and above all, its a watch first. The timeline is very well thought. You can add pins from calendar, ESPN, BBC news, etc. (It needs a larger developer network, but I'll cover that later). I believe Apple Watch OS2 will bring Pebble like timeline interface to Apple.3) Watchfaces - the color faces are fun, you'll never get bored. There are more options with the color interface.4) Color Screen - some people complain the screen is faint but I think its more than fine. Its not a backlit LED screen, don't expect it to act like one. The always on is HUGE plus. I have seen my friends with Apple Watch and Android Wear flicking their hands just to read the time and its annoying. Pebble 3.2 update released this week (July 2015) added options to make light brighter or change font or change vibrate strength, so you can customize to your taste. See attached pics taken at night with single bulb lit in room (wooden floor background), no flash, and no watch light. (Note, in my week 9 update I added a daytime pic with large digits black couch background, so you can see the difference)5) Form factor - Its thin, light and very easy to wear, I wear it every night to monitor my sleep with Misfit app (the app sync is bit buggy, but not Pebble's fault). It makes a GREAT running companion if you use Runkeeper. The band is bit cheap but comfortable, you can change it. The display glass is beautiful. The bezel is not so great, covered later.6) Responsiveness - Its snappy. I've yet to see a lag loading a built in or 3rd party app, and I've tried many. A first time load of a new app on watch takes a few seconds. BTW, there is no limit on number of apps and I've yet to see one cache out/cache in and I've lots of faces and apps.7) Price - At $200, I rather buy 2 of these than 1 Apple Watch.8) They value their customer - they are bringing new OS to old watch, speaks volume for a company of their size.9) Looks - this is a subjective topic. I've worn big Citizen Ecodrives to elegant Movados. I was unsure when I saw Pebble Time in pics, I liked it when I first wore it and now I really like the looks, I have the black one. Again, a subjective topic, my suggestion, try it, the watchface surprisingly can make a difference.10) Software quality - pretty robust for a major release, I've tried 3.1 and 3.2.So what's not working (reason to deduct 1 star)1) The bezel is unnecessarily wide. And it scratched very easily, left ugly marks. Its not military grade whatever they claim it to be. This is a hardware design/quality issue. If you can keep it carefully (hard to do if you wear extensively) then this is not a deal breaker. I wish Pebble did something about it. The vendor replaced it for me, that piece was an early order and they were surprised too with the quality of bezel. May be this one will hold better.2) Their developer network is limited. The apps are limited but enough to keep a smartwatch remain a watch and not turn into a computer.3) They really need to work on their relation with Apple. iOS integration is bit limited. Apple doesn't make it easy but they need to try harder.4) Support - don't expect quick response but to their credit, they've already release 2 updates addressing few issues.Bottom line - if you are looking for a watch with good notification system, clean display, easy to ready time/date/weather, super light to wear, basic running/activity tracking and not break the bank, this is the watch for you. If you want to read your entire email, type text or control your drone, look at the other 2 big players. Smartwatch is relatively a new technology, a lot will change over years to come. For $200 this combination of software + hardware is a keeper.---------Week 2 Update - Love it more by the day. Battery lasting 3 days (20% left). No issue with display brightness.---------Week 5 Update - 2 scratches on the bezel just with gentle hit, kinda expected after seeing them on the previous watch. Few "very hard to notice" scratches on the glass. Bit disappointed as this is not as durable as my Citizen Ecodrive or Movado but it costs a lot less and does a lot more. A few friends have commented on its sleek and clean look, some didn't even realize it was a smart watch (they expected clunky piece of metal/plastic to be a smartwatch). Still getting 3+ days of battery. iOS Pebble app works great. Latest update of Misfit pebble/iOS app fixed syncing issue, I am able to track daily activity and sleep. I still would like a way to respond to text/call with pre-canned message, Pebble says they working with Apple on it (or something close to it).---------Week 9 Update - Battery holding strong 3.5 days, sometimes close to 4 but never more than that. One gripe - sometimes you just need to see the time and an app or notification makes it impossible. Pebble should make the UI so that the time, which is always on top, needs to be in bigger or bolder font, currently its tiny when an app or notification takes over the screen. Watch update 3.3 stable and fine.Few favorite apps (apart from built in Notifications and the Timeline feature) -* Music (built in) - does a good job or controlling the phone music player, works with any iOS media app (even Netflix!)* Timer (2 options, one by Pebble)* Runkeeper (built in) - good to see stats rather than pulling the phone out when running* 7 Minute+ - the famous 7 min workout, nice animations and good vibration alerts when to start/rest* Evernote - this is my grocery list companion, has a checklist that I can check as I pick items, dont have to pull the phone* Pandora - this one automatically starts when  iOS app starts, can thumbs up/down and change vol (or use built in music app)* ESPN - clean, simple, just works, supports Timeline* Misfit - the sync is a hit or a miss but this is best of the ones available for measuring steps/activity and syncing with phoneAdding a new photo, day time shot with large digits watchface (called TimeStyle), to compare with earlier night time shots.Planning to buy a second one for spouse.* Use with Google Maps - this is not an app. I have push notifications enabled from Google Maps on iPhone. When iPhone is locked, it sends notification to lock screen and Pebble, as a result the next direction is shown on watch, with two notifications, one ahead of turn and one just before (Google Maps feature). I find looking at pebble less distracting than looking at the phone, with my hands still on the steering. So this works as a mini-nav device.-----------Week 12 Update - probably the final update - the watch is a keeper, all working as stated above. No more visible scratches since the last time. The main gripes:1) When another app is running, the font of the time on top is really small2) Need to press back button several times to get back to home page (to see time)Both of these sometimes make it hard just to see the time because either an app or a notification takes over the screen. Sometimes, you just need to see the time :) Hopefully a software update will fix it, I plan to write to pebble about it.Pebble is coming with a round version, keep an eye on that, launching in Nov. But like I said in my first review, smartwatches have a long way to go before they mature. You won't be keeping this for 5 years or 2 or even 1. If you like it, go buy it.Hope you enjoyed reading these updates and it helped your buying decision.- VCRead more
