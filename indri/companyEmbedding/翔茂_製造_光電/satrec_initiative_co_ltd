– Satrec Initiative
Earth Observation Satellite Solutions
[INQ. NO. 1411C16] Satrec Initiative, headed by Mr. Kim Byung-jin, was awarded the 70th Trader of the Month in recognition its recent achievements in the global markets. Mr. Kim Byung-jin is CEO and founder of Satrec Initiative, the world’s leading company in high performance, costeffective Earth observation small satellite solutions.
Headquartered in Daejeon, Korea, Satrec Initiative was founded in 1999 by the engineers who had developed the first South Korean satellite and a series of advanced small satellites in the University, KAIST, for 10 years, and has successfully commercialized space technology.
Activities in SI cover the whole spectrum for Earth observation missions including spacecraft bus, Earth observation payload, communication equipment and satellite image receiving and processing system. The company currently has more than 130 highly experienced engineers and scientists with master’s or Ph.d. degrees.
SI has designed and developed four Earth observation small satellites for customers in the Middle East, Asia and Europe since it started to export its Earth observation small satellite with RazakSAT in 2001, which was followed by DubaiSat-1 in 2006, DubaiSat-2 in 2008. Deimos-2, one of the latest developments, is a 300 kg class small satellite system for Earth observation mission that provides 1m level resolution images. Developed for a Spanish client, the Deimos-2 has been launched in June 2014 in Russia.
In addition, the company has developed and exported four Earth observation electro-optical camera systems to Turkey and Singapore.
Even though Satrec Initiative is a relative newcomer in the field, it has moved ahead of its rivals by successfully launching Earth observation mission with 1m level resolution images.
“We have so far provided Earth observation small satellites, but we’re putting much more emphasis on developing medium- and large- sized models with 0.5m level resolution. We will strive to jump into a major company providing higherperformance and more cost-effective satellites by combining IT technology with our space engineering capability.” said Satrec Initiative CEO Kim.
SI has been setting up new manufacturing facilities for medium- and large- sized satellites with 0.5m level resolution on an area of 18,000 square metres in Daejon, Korea.

Company Description                    




                        Firm has maintained high growth trend due to stable order receipt in view of the features of artificial satellite markets. Though firm's year-on-year operating profit to sales ratio slightly fell, due to rising cost to sales ratio, firm's net profit to sales ratio is on the rise, owing to increase in non-operating income including gain on foreign currency translation. Firm has outstanding price competitiveness, due to firm's labor cost being 50%, compared to those of European SSTL, EADS and U.S. Orbital, which are the firm's competitors.   Firm's growth is expected, deriving from increase of the need for space development for military purpose, advance of private sector space development and small scale artificial satellite market expansion arising from rapid advent of India and China. Firm's profitability rising trend is likely to be slowed down, because of the increase of selling and administrative expenses stemming from addition obtainment of R&D personnel and sales ratio decline of high margin ratio in the artificial satellite industry. Firm's growth is expected, as the firm promotes diverse new biz including environmental radiation monitor device and special biz, based on technological prowess of artificial satellite biz.
