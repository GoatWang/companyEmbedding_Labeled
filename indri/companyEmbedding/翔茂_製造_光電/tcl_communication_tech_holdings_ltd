History[edit]
The company was founded in 1981 under the brand name TTK as a cassette manufacturer, making knock-off TDK cassettes.[citation needed] In 1985, after being sued by TDK for IP violation, the company changed its name to TCL by taking the initial letters from Telephone Communication Limited. It began manufacturing consumer electronics for the Chinese market during the 1980s,[5] and began to sell overseas in the 2000s.[6] Though a state-owned enterprise, TCL was established as a joint venture with several Hong Kong-based investors.[5] In July 2003, TCL chairman Li Dongsheng formally announced a "Dragon and Tiger Plan" to establish two competitive TCL businesses in global markets ("Dragons") and three leading businesses inside China ("Tigers").[7]
In November 2003, TCL and Thomson SA of France announced the creation of a joint venture to produce televisions and DVD players worldwide.[8] TCL took a 67 percent stake in the joint venture, with Thomson SA holding the rest of the shares, and it was agreed that televisions made by TCL-Thomson would be marketed under the TCL brand in Asia and the Thomson and RCA brands in Europe and North America.[8]
In April 2004, TCL and Alcatel announced the creation of a mobile phone manufacturing joint venture: Alcatel Mobile Phones.[7] TCL injected 55 million euros in the venture in return for a 55 per cent shareholding.[7]
