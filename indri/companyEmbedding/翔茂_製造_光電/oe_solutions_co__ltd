2.UNIVERSAL ROBOTS 


   

 Up until now, many companies have had to abandon the idea of automating numerous tasks and processes        because the traditional robots are either too large, expensive, noisy or inflexible to implement.
 Universal Robots has broken down the barriers. Our universal robots are extremely compact and can be used        without screening off. Every facility with repeated processes can benefit from them.        The universal robots have a low weight without a load and can easily be moved around in the production.        Programming is done by sheer intuition: Move the robot’s arm yourself and show it the        movement it has to make. The universal robots will then remember the movements. The universal robotsis controlled from a handy, touch-sensitive screen with a graphic user interface.        On the screen you can choose from a wide range of useful functions.
Universal Robots advanced and efficient technology is entirely unique on a global        level. The total implementation costs are exceptionally low. If you buy the universal robots with an adapted tool, it can be ready to run just a few hours after you take delivery.        Discover the new possibilities open to you and make a good head start.
Universal Robots has reinvented the industrial robot. Our modern and flexible industrial robots        open up brand new ways to streamline production – at your company too.
