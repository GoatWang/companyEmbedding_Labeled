Diodes Incorporated Releases First Product in Thermally Enhanced  PowerDI(R)5060 Package



Dec 8, 2010 


P-channel MOSFET Raises Reliability and Saves Space
DALLAS, Dec 08, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Diodes Incorporated (Nasdaq: DIOD), a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high-quality application specific standard products within the broad discrete, logic and analog semiconductor markets, today announced the release of the Company's first device in its unique PowerDI5060 package, the DMP3010LPS 30V rated p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET, offering designers of notebooks, netbooks and other consumer electronics improvements in reliability and reductions in pcb space requirements. 
With a junction to case thermal resistance (Rthj-c) of 2.1°C/W, the PowerDI5060's thermal resistance is 10 times lower than an SO8 alternative, improving on power dissipation performance, resulting in cooler running and more reliable product design. Its off-board height of 1.1mm is also 54% less than that of SO8, making it well suited for low profile applications. 
With a large drain pad significantly reducing package inductance and resistance parameters, the PowerDI5060 package helps to significantly boost p-channel MOSFET performance. With the DMP3010LPS's low typical on-resistance of 7.8m at 10V VGS on-state losses are effectively minimized in load switching and battery charging duties.

Diodes Incorporated Expands LED Driver Product Series



Sep 30, 2008 


New Products Bring Smaller Footprint and Energy Savings to Lighting Applications
    DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Diodes Incorporated (NASDAQ:DIOD), a leading global manufacturer
and supplier of high-quality application specific standard products
within the broad discrete and analog semiconductor markets, today
announced that it has further expanded its Zetex ZXLD LED driver
series with the introduction of three new miniature LED drivers
offering improved accuracy and thermal performance. Provided in
TSOT23-5 and thermally-enhanced DFN6 packages, the highly integrated
ZXLD1352, ZXLD1356 and ZXLD1366 deliver adjustable output currents of
350mA, 550mA and 1A, respectively, and are designed for a broad range
of automotive, architectural and industrial lighting applications.
    With a typical output current accuracy better than one percent,
ZXLD1356 and ZXLD1366 LED drivers provide highly accurate current
matching at working voltages up to 60V. Capable of producing output
powers of 30W and 48W, respectively, these TSOT23-5 and 3.0 mm x 3.0
mm DFN6 packaged LED drivers will support up to 15 LEDs in an array of
applications that require minimum footprint and maximum efficiency.
    Operating from a 7V to 30V supply and capable of producing an
output current up to 350mA, the 2.8 mm x 2.9 mm TSOT23-5 packaged
ZXLD1352 LED driver can provide up to 8W of power for driving chains
up to 10 LEDs. With a large PWM dimming ratio of 1000:1, the ZXLD1352
offers highly flexible brightness control and accurate color mixing.
    The ZXLD series of continuous mode inductive step-down LED drivers
are characterized by their simplicity of configuration and only
require three simple external discrete components. Nominal output
current, set by a resistor, is easily adjusted by applying a PWM or DC
voltage control signal to precisely match users' brightness
requirements, and a low-level control signal turns the output off to
put the LED driver into standby.
