History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
It was founded by T. J. Rodgers and others (Fritz Beyerlein, Fred Jenne, Steven H. Kaplan, R. Michael Starnes and Lowell Turriff [3]) from Advanced Micro Devices. It was formed in 1982 with backing by Sevin Rosen and went public in 1986. The company initially focused on the design and development of high speed CMOS SRAMs, EEPROMs, PAL devices, and TTL logic devices. Two years after going public the company switched from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange. In October 2009, the company announced it would switch its listing to the NASDAQ on November 12, 2009.[4]
The Cypress subsidiary AgigaTech, Inc. sells non-volatile random-access memory (RAM) and is based in San Diego, CA. It was acquired during the Simtek purchase in August 2008, and marks the second time that Cypress acquired a start-up venture from founder, Ron Sartore, who also co-founded Anchor Chips.[5]
In November 2011, Cypress also backed a packaging firm called Deca Technologies, Inc.[6]
2015: Spansion-Cypress merger[edit]
In December 2014, Cypress Semiconductor merged with Spansion in an all-stock deal worth $1.59 billion. The merger represented the combination of two companies that were No. 1 in their respective memory markets and have successfully diversified into embedded processing.[7]
In March 2015, Cypress and Spansion closed the merger in an all-stock, tax-free transaction valued at approximately $5 billion. Cypress shareholders approved the issuance of 2.457 shares of Cypress stock to Spansion shareholders for each Spansion share they own. The merger is expected to achieve more than $135 million in cost synergies on an annualized basis within three years and to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first full year after the transaction closes.[8] At the time of its merger with Spansion in 2015, Cypress Semiconductor had more than 7,000 US and foreign patents.[9] Cypress Semiconductor is a component of the Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index.[10]
Cypress attempted to acquire Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. in 2015 but was thwarted by a competing bid by Chinese buyer consortium Uphill Investment Co., which included GigaDevice, a major competitor in the NOR flash market. This buyer consortium offered a higher bid than Cypress and successfully acquired ISSI for $731 million.[11]
2016[edit]
In April 2016, Cypress announced the acquisition of Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) business and related assets in an all-cash transaction valued at $550 million. Under the terms of the deal, Cypress will acquire Broadcom's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee IoT product lines and intellectual property, along with its WICED brand and developer ecosystem.[12]
In April 2016, it was announced that Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. will invest $60 million in Deca and will license Deca’s M-Series Fan-out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP) technologies and processes. As part of the agreement, ASE Group and Deca will jointly develop the M-Series fan-out manufacturing process and will expand production of chip-scale packages using this technology.[13]
Cypress named Hassane El-Khoury its president and chief executive officer, and announced he will join the board of directors on Aug. 11, 2016.[2]
2017 Board Dispute[edit]
In April 2017 Delaware Chancery Court decided Cypress Semiconductor Corp. had to give former CEO Rodgers insight into internal documents related to possible violations of Cypress's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by executive chairman Ray Bingham.[14]
Bingham, who is a founding member of venture capital firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc,[15] a China-backed private equity fund, was criticized for the conflict of interest leading Cypress and Canyon Bridge as both companies possibly focus on the same acquisition targets.[16]
Rodgers ran a proxy contest against the board, aiming for veteran tech industry board directors Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino to replace Ray Bingham and Cypress director Eric Benhamou.[17]
On June 12, 2017 it was made public that Ray Bingham stepped down from the board.[18] Prior to Bingham’s resignation, shareholder-advisory firms ISS, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones had recommended McCranie and Martino, Rodgers's nominees, citing "additional - and sharper - questions not only regarding the board's handling of this situation but also regarding the potential for conflicts of interest inherent in Bingham's dual roles."[19]
On June 20, 2017, both of Rodgers's nominees won victories by substantial margins.[20]
Locations[edit]
Cypress is headquartered in San Jose, CA and has manufacturing plants in Austin, TX and Bloomington, MN, assembly and test operations in the Philippines and Bangkok, Thailand. Cypress has design facilities in the United States (including San Jose, CA; Lynnwood, WA; Colorado Springs, CO; Lexington, KY; San Diego, CA; and Beaverton, OR), Japan (Tokyo), Germany (Langen and Munich), India (Bangalore), China (Shanghai), Ukraine (Lviv), Ireland (Cork), Malaysia (Penang) and other locations. Cypress has divested a large portion of its San Jose campus to SVTC, SunPower and Second Harvest Food Bank.
List of acquisitions[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (November 2016)


Since its founding, Cypress has acted as an incubator for wholly owned subsidiaries which are given a degree of autonomy and has acquired other small technology companies. In addition, Cypress has been an active acquirer of smaller technology companies. In addition, Cypress has incorporated some of its technology into subsidiaries, to speed up development of such products as the PSoC Programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) that integrates analog and digital components with a microcontroller on a single chip to form a complete solution for embedded systems. Since the early 1990s, acquisitions have included:

Connecting “things” together to enhance convenience and intelligence in everyday life is what the Internet of Things (IoT) is all about. As the world’s leading supplier of connectivity solutions and flexible, ultra-low-power microcontrollers, Cypress is helping dreamers from startups to leading manufacturers bring their innovations to market quickly.  By joining Cypress, you will become part of this exciting market opportunity.












What if your refrigerator could notify you when supplies were running low? Or your home could alert you if you left the curling iron plugged in? What if your dishwasher and washing machine could talk to each other so they wouldn’t run at the same time during peak hours, helping you save money on your electric bill? These are just some of the ways a connected home can add value and convenience to your everyday life, and one of the many exciting end markets that you can be a part of by joining Cypress. 












Cypress is deeply embedded in industrial applications with a wide array of controllers, memories and analog devices serving this diverse market. Cypress focuses on product families that can survive in harsh environments while offering the performance, power and scale that is required. We are also committed to supporting the Industry 4.0 initiative of factory automation and data exchange. Find out how you can become part of this dynamic market with a job at Cypress.












As many as 100 microcontrollers drive the advanced features in today’s automobiles, and the amount of semiconductor content is expected to grow as self-driving cars proliferate. As a Cypress employee, you can become an important part of what may be the biggest innovation in personal transportation since the invention of the automobile, itself.
