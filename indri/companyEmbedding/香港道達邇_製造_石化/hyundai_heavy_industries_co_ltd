HHI Develops New Ship Navigation and Management Solution
Jul 20 17
Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) has developed a new technology known as the Integrated Smart Ship Solution (ISSS), which is intended to increase the reliability and cost-effectiveness of vessel navigation and management. ISSS forms part of HHI's information and communications technology (ICT) and has been developed to introduce various standardised methods of navigation that vary depending on the navigators' level of skill and experience. The solution can also collect and analyse real-time locational information, there by improving the overall efficiency and safety of ship navigation. HHI's ISSS system aims to pave the way for the widespread adoption of connected, digital and autonomous technologies, and is also capable of collecting and analysing energy data, as well as monitoring the status of engines and propellers. In addition, the solution is expected to reduce ships' annual operating costs by 6%. The solution has already undergone field testing by being mounted on a 6,500 pure car truck carrier (PCTC) and a 250,000 DWT very large ore carrier (VLOC).
