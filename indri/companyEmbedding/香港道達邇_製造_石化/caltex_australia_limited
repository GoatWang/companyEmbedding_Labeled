Kami merujuk kepada isu penamatan kontrak enam pengusaha stesen Caltex baru-baru ini. Pengusaha-pengusaha ini telah diberikan hak untuk mengendalikan stesen Caltex yang dimiliki oleh Chevron Malaysia. Penamatan kontrak pengusaha stesen Caltex ini adalah satu keputusan perniagaan, dan telah dilaksanakan mengikut terma dan syarat perjanjian di antara kedua-dua belah pihak, iaitu pengusaha dan Chevron Malaysia. Kami menghargai rakan kongsi perniagaan kami yang bekerjasama dengan kami dan secara majoriti, pengusaha-pengusaha Caltex kami telah memberi kerjasama sebagai satu pasukan dalam menangani sebarang isu atau masalah. Walau bagaimanapun, ini tidak semestinya berlaku dengan sesetengah pengusaha, walaupun usaha terbaik kami untuk menyelesaikan masalah secara baik dan dengan niat yang baik. Buat masa ini, kami sedang berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk melaksanakan proses penamatan secara aman dan mengikut terma dan syarat kontrak.

Kepada semua pelanggan setia kami, kami ingin memaklumkan bahawa stesen-stesen Caltex kami akan terus dibuka untuk anda seperti biasa! Kami ucapkan ribuan terima kasih atas sokongan anda!
//
We refer to the recent termination of contracts with six Caltex retailers. These retailers were granted a dealership to operate Caltex stations owned by Chevron Malaysia. The termination of retailer contracts is a business decision, and is carried out in accordance to the contractual agreement between the parties. We value partnerships that are collaborative and the majority of our retailers work as a team with us to address concerns. Unfortunately, this may not always be the case with certain retailers, despite our best efforts to resolve issues amicably and in good faith. At present, we are doing our best to carry out the termination process peacefully and in accordance with the contract.

To all our customers, we like to inform you that our Caltex stations will continue to serve you as usual! We thank you for your support.
