	Total Mory Maroc SA operates in the Petroleum products sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Total Mory Maroc SA with three other
	miscellaneous retailers and wholesalers in Africa:
		
	MRS Oil Nigeria PLC
	
		of Nigeria
		(2016
	sales of 109.64 billion Naira [US$313.56  million]
		of which 88%
		was Retail/C&I),
	
	Forte Oil PLC
	
		of Nigeria
		(148.61 billion Naira [US$425.01  million]
		of which 82%
		was Fuels), and
	
	Mobil Oil Nigeria PLC
	
		which is
		
			also
		
		based in Nigeria
		(94.11 billion Naira [US$269.15  million]
		of which 100%
		was Petroleum Products Marketing).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	Total Mory Maroc SA reported sales of 8.04 billion Moroccan Dirhams (US$852.28 million)
		for the
		
		year ending
		December of 2016.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
			a
			
			decrease of 3.5%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 8.33 billion Moroccan Dirhams.
	
		Contributing to the drop in overall sales was the 5.0% decline
		in Sale of Fuel, from 5.98 billion Moroccan Dirhams to 5.68 billion Moroccan Dirhams.
		
					There were also decreases in sales in
					Sale of Gas (down 0.2% to 1.88 billion Moroccan Dirhams)
				.
		
					However, these declines were partially offset by the increase in sales of
					Sales of Lubricants (up 2.1% to 398.77 million Moroccan Dirhams)
				
					and
				Others (up 0.9% to 68.30 million Moroccan Dirhams)
