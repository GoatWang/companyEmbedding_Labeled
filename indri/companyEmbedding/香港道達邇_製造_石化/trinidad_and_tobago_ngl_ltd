State holdings company National Enterprises Ltd (NEL) has recorded a $496.7 million profit after tax for its financial year ending March 31, 2013. This represents a 3.6 per cent increase over the previous year’s $479.5 million profit.
The company’s asset base also grew 2.9 per cent, from $2.6 billion to almost $2.7 billion. 
NEL is an investment holding company formed to consolidate the government’s shareholding in select State enterprises, and facilitate a public offering on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE).
NEL’s shares comprises National Flour Mills (NFM); NGC NGL Company Ltd (NGC NGL); NGC Trinidad and Tobago LNG Ltd; Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Ltd (TSTT); and Trinidad Nitrogen Company Ltd (TRINGEN).
“NEL’s diversified portfolio of investee companies had generally strong performances, with  Tringen and NGC NGL contributing the most,” chairman Kenny Lue Chee Lip said in a published statement. 
But NFM’s performance “continues to disappoint”, he said.
Major changes over the previous year including the Tringen dividend payout dropping by $64 million, while the NGC NGL dividend payout almost doubled to $201 million as a result of better product prices, he added. 
For the financial year, NEL shares traded at a low of $12.85 and a high of $15.50, closing at $$15.26 on March 31. 
NEL shares (TTSE:NEL) trade at around $15.95 per stock unit.

Nature of Business
In August 2013, The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) acquired 39% of Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited’s (PPGPL) equity from ConocoPhillips.  PPGPL is an operating company in the natural gas sector that processes natural gas and sells the outputs. In February 2014, NGC transferred its 39% shareholding into a newly formed entity - Trinidad and Tobago NGL Limited (NGL).  NGC formed NGL to enable the public to participate in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and own an equity interest in PPGPL. NGL would distribute dividends in accordance with its dividend policy to the holders of its Class A and Class B shares.   While NGL is a newly formed corporate entity, its underlying investment, PPGPL, is a company with over 23 years of operating history in Trinidad and Tobago’s energy sector, and with whom NGC has had a long term commercial relationship.  PPGPL operates Trinidad and Tobago’s only natural gas processing and Natural Gas Liquids fractionation plant and is the largest producer and marketer of propane, mixed butane, isobutane and natural gasoline in Trinidad and Tobago.  Trinidad and Tobago NGL Limited owns 39% interest in PPGPL in conjunction with NGC NGL Company Limited (NGC NGL) (51%) and an investment consortium comprising The National Insurance Board of Trinidad and Tobago (NIBTT), National Enterprises Limited (NEL), and The Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust Corporation (UTC) (10%).  NGC NGL is effectively owned by NGC (80%) and by National Enterprises Limited (NEL) (20%). NEL is a holding company listed on the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE) and is 66% effectively owned by the GORTT and 17% effectively owned by NGC.  Upon completion of the Offer and assuming full subscription of the Offer, public investors shall hold a 49% effective ownership interest in NGL. NGC shall hold the remaining shares for a total effective interest of 51% in NGL.
