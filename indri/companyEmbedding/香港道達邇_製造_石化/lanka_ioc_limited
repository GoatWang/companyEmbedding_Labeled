In every heart, in every part


Indian Oil Corporation stands tall among the world’s biggest, and best oil companies.

India Oil offers the largest network of fuel stations in the subcontinent, covering the widest area and providing the best service.  Our stations set the standard for quality of service and fuel provision across the country, and from the icy heights of the Himalayas to the sun-soaked shores of Kerala, from Kutch on India’s western tip to Kohima in the verdant North East, Indian Oil is truly ‘in every heart, in every part’ of India.
India Oil is India’s largest company by turnover, and is the highest ranked Indian company on the “Fortune 500” listings, in 83rd. It has 49% of the petroleum products market in India, owns 10 of the 20 refineries in the country, and has 67% of the downstream sector pipeline capacity.
Indian Oil has been ranked as India’s No. 1 brand by UK-based Brand Finance, an independent consultancy that deals with the valuation of brands. It has also been listed as India’s Most Trusted Brand’ in the ‘Gasoline’ category in a Readers’ Digest – AC Nielsen survey and topped The Hindu Businessline’s “India’s Most Valuable Brands” list.
However, the value of the Indian Oil brand is not just limited to its commercial role as an energy provider but encompasses the entire gamut of exploration & production, refining, transportation & marketing, petrochemicals, natural gas and downstream marketing operations abroad.
Above all, Indian Oil is a national brand owned by over a billion Indians and that is simply priceless.
Expanding Horizons
Indian Oil is currently metamorphosing from a pure sectoral company with dominance in downstream in India to a vertically integrated, transnational energy behemoth. The Corporation is already on the way to becoming a major player in petrochemicals by integrating its core refining business with petrochemical activities, besides making large investments in E&P and import/marketing ventures for oil & gas in India and abroad.

IndianOil owns and operates the country’s largest network of cross-country crude oil and product pipelines of nearly 8,0000 km, with a combined capacity of 56.85 MMTPA.
Countrywide Network
IndianOil’s countrywide network of over 22,000 sales points is backed for supplies by its extensive, well spread out marketing infrastructure comprising 162 bulk storage terminals, installations and depots, 94 aviation fuelling stations and 87 LPG bottling plants. Its subsidiary, IBP Co. Ltd, is a stand-alone marketing company with a nationwide network of over 3,000 retail sales points.
For the year 2003-04, IndianOil sold 48.60 million tonnes of petroleum products, including exports of 1.81 million tonnes. Its seven own refineries achieved a throughput of 37.66 million tonnes, and the pipeline network transported 44.50 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products.
IndianOil reaches Indane cooking gas to the doorsteps of 40 million households in over 2,100 markets through the country’s largest network of 4,350 distributors. The country’s leading SERVO brand lubricants from IndianOil, with over 42% market share and 450 grades, are sold through more than 9,100 Company retail outlets, besides a countrywide network of bazaar traders.
IndianOil’s ISO-9002 certified Aviation Service, with 67% market share, meets the fuel and lubricants needs of domestic and international flag carriers, Defence Services and private aircraft operators
To maintain its strategic edge in the market place, IndianOil has planned investments to the tune of Rs. 24,400 crore during the X Plan period (2002-07), mainly in linear integration & diversification projects, besides refining and pipeline capacity expansions, product quality upgradation and retail operations
Customer Care
Customer delight is the key driver of IndianOil’s marketing operations. Under the XTRA retail outlet brand unveiled during 2003-04, IndianOil is making customers visiting its petrol and diesel stations a number of XTRA offerings, including assured quality and quantity, efficient forecourt service and high levels of housekeeping, choice of regular and branded fuels, 100% electronic dispensing, cashless transactions, loyalty programmes for cash & credit customers, and a number of non-fuel offerings tailor-made to customer profile and requirements
Academy Company
IndianOil is an “academy” company with a score of full-fledged training centres across the country building skills and competencies among IndianOilPeople to face the challenges of the market place. Among these, the IndianOil Institute of Petroleum Management (IIPM) at Gurgaon, the IndianOil Management Centre for Learning at Mumbai, and the IndianOil Management Academy at Haldia have emerged as world-class training and management academies.
Pioneering R&D
IndianOil’s world-class R&D Centre has won recognition for its pioneering work in lubricants formulation, refinery processes, pipeline transportation and alternative fuels. It has developed over 2,100 formulations of SERVO brand lubricants and greases for virtually all conceivable applications – automotive, railroad, industrial and marine – meeting stringent international standards and bearing the stamp of approval of all major original equipment manufacturers. A wholly-owned subsidiary company, IndianOil Technologies Ltd., is commercialising the innovations and technologies of the Centre, which has over 140 national and international patents to its credit. Apart from leadership in development and commercialisation of bio-fuels, the R&D Centre is currently the nodal agency of the hydrocarbon sector in India for ushering in Hydrogen fuel in the country.
Expanding Horizons
IndianOil is currently metamorphosing from a pure sectoral company with dominance in downstream in India to a vertically integrated, transnational energy behemoth. The Corporation is implementing a master plan to emerge as a major player in petrochemicals by integrating its core refining business with petrochemical activities, besides making large investments in E&P and import/marketing ventures for oil and gas in India and abroad.
Spreading Wings
IndianOil is also strengthening its existing overseas marketing ventures and simultaneously scouting new opportunities for marketing and export of petroleum products to new energy markets in Asia and Africa.
Two overseas subsidiaries are already operational in Sri Lanka and Mauritius, and a regional office at Dubai is coordinating expansion of business activities in Middle East region. Within an year of incorporation, Lanka IOC Pvt. Ltd. (LIOC) has captured a 25% market share in Sri Lanka, with a target to take it to about 40% in the near future. IndianOil is investing US$ 18 million in Mauritius through its subsidiary, Indian Oil Mauritius Ltd. (IOML), to set up a range of marketing infrastructure there.
The Corporation has launched 11 joint ventures in partnership with some of the most respected corporates from India and abroad — Lubrizol, Nyco SA, Petronas, Oiltanking GmbH, Marubeni, to name a few. SERVO lubricants are being marketed in Dubai, Nepal, Bhutan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Bahrain, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritius, Bangladesh, etc.
IndianOil has been lending its expertise for nearly two decades to various countries in several areas of refining, marketing, transportation, training and research & development. These include Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Abu Dhabi, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Algeria, Nigeria, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Malaysia and Zambia.
IndianOil’s sincere commitment to Quality, Safety, Health and Environment is reflected in the series of national and international certifications and awards earned over the years.
The 19th largest petroleum company in the world, IndianOil, is well on its way to becoming an integrated, transnational energy corporate.

 Lanka IOC, IndianOil’s subsidiary in Sri Lanka, is the only private oil company other than the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) that operates retail petrol / diesel stations in Sri Lanka. Lanka IOC is ranked no. 1 among the island nation’s leading listed companies.
 
IndianOil’s entry into Sri Lanka is in line with its Vision of becoming a transnational energy major. While expanding its market base to convert the surplus avails of petroleum products into more wealth for stakeholders, IndianOil is also committed to being a good strategic partner to Sri Lanka. Its vast experience in downstream petroleum operations in India is helping create a healthy and competitive petroleum industry in Sri Lanka for the larger benefit of the island nation. The surplus refining capacity in India is being used to bridge the existing gap between demand and supply in Sri Lanka. Lanka IOC intends to harness the advantages of geographical proximity between India and Sri Lanka, resulting in low freight rates in transportation and IndianOil’s superior R&D capabilities, to provide petroleum products at the most competitive price to the Sri Lankan market. 
Incorporated to carry out retail marketing of petroleum products and bulk supply to industrial consumers, Lanka IOC operates about 150 petrol & diesel stations in Sri Lanka, and has a very efficient lube marketing network. Its major facilities include an oil terminal at Trincomalee, Sri Lanka's largest petroleum storage facility and an 18,000 tonnes per annum capacity lubricants blending plant and state-of-the-art fuels and lubricants testing laboratory at Trincomalee. Lanka IOC’s activities not only provide the island nation energy security and supply stability but also upgrade the overall standards of service, particularly in the retail sector. It took over 100 CPC-owned petrol/diesel stations in February 2003 and commenced retailing products to customers. Subsequently, it took over 59 dealer-owned franchisee retail outlets.

Presently, it holds a market share of about 43.5%. In a highly competitive bunker market, catering to all types of bunker fuels and lubricants at all ports of Sri Lanka, viz., Colombo, Trincomalee and Galle. It is the major supplier of lubricants and greases to the three arms of the Defence services of Sri Lanka. It has also introduced nitrogen filling facilities for automotive tyres, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. 

Lanka IOC is making phased investments to provide world-class quality petroleum products and services to the Sri Lankan customers. Through its retail chain, it is also making available non-fuel facilities like convenience stores, 24-hour ATMs, automatic carwash, food marts, etc. This will not only give value-for-money to the motorists but would give altogether a new refueling experience. The refurbished stations of Lanka IOC have brought praise from all sections of the Sri Lankan society.

Lanka IOC has also acquired the China Bay Tankfarm of World War II vintage, which is of historic and strategic significance as it is the largest tankfarm located between the Middle East and Singapore. The tankfarm connects to the Trincomalee harbour, which is the 5th largest all-weather, non-tidal natural harbour in the world, with a 56 km shoreline, making this tankfarm most effective for fuel receipt, storage and supply. The tankfarm, formerly owned and operated by CPC, has a total of 99 tanks, each with a capacity of 12,000 kilolitres. Currently, only 15 of these tanks are operational. Lanka IOC intends to develop the tankage on need basis, as the volume of its downstream marketing operations in Sri Lanka grows.

 Lanka IOC Plc has made major efforts to ensure a round-the-clock supply of petrol and diesel in the country during the strike called by CEYPETCO.
Due to strike called by CEYPETCO, there could not be any supply of petroleum products from the depots of Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd. (CPSTL) throughout the country on 25 July. This resulted in long queues at Lanka IOC filling stations which witnessed unprecedented demand for petrol and diesel. Lanka IOC operates just one depot in the country while another 12 depots are operated by CPSTL.
'Our depot being situated in Trincomalee, it takes considerable time for supplies to reach different parts of the country. However, employees of Lanka IOC Plc worked day and night to ensure that supplies of petrol and diesel remained at normal levels within the country. This required tremendous efforts on the part of the Lanka IOC Plc team in order to ensure that the product reaches all parts of the country,' the company said.
'A special effort was made to give priority to ambulances, SLTB buses, vehicles involved in public transport and three-wheelers so as to make the general public comfortable. Our supplies have increased to almost double from our Trincomalee depot on 25 July and similar efforts are on today also. Lanka IOC is committed towards the cause of the nation and we will always make our best efforts in such situations to help the general public to the best of our capability and capacity.'© Pakistan Press International, source Asianet-Pakistan
