History[edit]
Paz was founded in 1922, as Anglo-Asiatic Petroleum. From 1927 it operated as part of Royal Dutch Shell, under the name Shell Palestine. In 1958 Shell withdrew from Israel under economic pressure from Arab countries. The symbol of the company, a yellow triangle, still resembles that of Shell.
The company changed to the ownership of the Briton Isaac Wolfson and the French Nahmias brothers and changed its name to Paz Petroleum Company Ltd. Wolfson sold his company holdings in 1981 to the State of Israel, who sold it in 1988 to the Australian Jack Liberman. Since 1999 Israeli Zadik Bino owns the majority of the shares, with the Liberman family and other groups holding minority interests.[2]
Also in 1999, Paz acquired 74 percent of the Israeli fast food chain Burger Ranch. In late 2001, Paz completed the acquisition, becoming 100 percent owners of the chain. New branches of Burger Ranch were opened at Paz gas stations. In 2006, Paz sold the chain to the Israeli businessman Yossi Hoshinski. Paz operates combined cafes and stores in many gas stations, through another subsidiary by the name "Yellow".
In August 2006 Paz won a tender to acquire the Ashdod Oil Refineries with a NIS 3.5 billion bid, from Oil Refineries Ltd; which was forced to break its monopoly on oil refining in Israel. The acquisition made Paz Israel's most powerful energy company, and its owner Zadik Bino the industry's most powerful figure.[3]

About us

Strength. Initiative. Leadership. These are the foundations on which Paz's reputation is based – a golden reputation of 90 years' standing.

The Paz Group is Israel's leading energy corporation and during its 90 years has become one of the economy's most prominent brands. Paz supplies a third of Israel's fuel products and is the country's first energy company to own a refinery. At the end of 2006, Paz became a public company whose shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and it is listed on the TASE's flagship Tel Aviv-25 (Maof) index, which tracks the shares of the 25 companies with the highest market capitalization on the bourse. The Group engages in the refining, production, storage, importing and marketing of fuel products. In addition to its refinery in Ashdod, Paz has fuel product storage and distribution terminals and a network of hundreds of filling stations, convenience stores and retail complexes. The Paz Group integrates a variety of activities in the domestic market, including the sale of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the production and marketing of lubricants and chemicals, bitumen sheets and sealants for the construction and infrastructure sectors, jet fuel and more. The Group's primary advantage is its vertical structure that encompasses the entire value chain. The purchase of the Ashdod refinery, the Group's ownership of hundreds of retail outlets and its sophisticated operating methods facilitate long-term logistic planning and optimal synergy among all the divisions. The Group's financial resilience, combined with advanced work methods, a highly developed service orientation and the ability to zero in on marketing opportunities, have positioned Paz as Israel's top energy company, with a reputation for professionalism and leadership.

Activities throughout the supply chain have synergetic value and create significant advantages for the Group, allowing it to lead in all areas of its operations .
Paz is the only Israeli energy group to own a refinery and a leading chain of 272 gas stations. “Paz” has a strong and leading brand preferred by consumers thanks to its chain of 236 convenience stores, “Yellow”, which serve thousands of customers daily, and provides a range of roadside services and subsidiaries, each leading in its field (Pazgas, Paz Oils, Pazkar, Paz Aviation Services, Paz Aviation Assets ).
Paz was founded in 1922 and became a Shell subsidiary in 1927. Since 1999 Paz has been controlled by Bino Holdings Ltd., owned by Zadik Bino with Dolphin Energy and Instanz Holdings (Lieberman Group ).
In Nov 2006, Paz held one of the largest share and bond IPO’s known by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and is one of the leading companies in the Israeli economy. Paz is traded on the TA-25 index. Its credit rating according to S&P is Stable/-ilAA -.

The company operates three business divisions: Retail and Wholesale; Refining and Logistics; and Industries and Services. The divisional structure has the expertise to meet customer needs, enhance competitiveness and product quality to continue growth. Paz also emphasizes long-term planning and investment to uphold values of excellence and leadership .
 
Retail & Wholesale Division
Paz owns Israel’s largest gas stations chain with 272 gas stations, dozens of retail areas throughout the country and hundreds of Yellow convenience stores located in gas stations. The chains offer advanced services and a broad range of products that are the Division’s engine of growth together with retail complexes that increases traffic to gas stations and Yellow stores and bring in extra revenue. The Division’s activities include wholesale fuel marketing to large customers and marketing fuel to vehicle fleets through Pazomat, Israel’s largest electronic fuelling company .
Paz’s broad customer base includes industrial, institutional, aviation and governmental companies and organizations. Paz owns a portfolio of quality assets allowing optimal implementation and maintaining long-term leadership .
 
Refining & Logistics Division
The division manages the Group’s oil refinery, import of crude oil and products, manufacturing oil derivatives and producing electricity and steam for its own use and electricity for sale. The division coordinates the Group’s logistic activities including storing fuels, production, streaming, transport and procurement services. The oil refinery operates to the strictest environmental and safety standards, strives for high product quality, and invests hundreds of millions of dollars in improving capabilities and content. In 2013, after investing NIS 1.5 billion, and completing installation of the new projects, the refinery was upgraded so that refining capacity increased up to 5.4 million tons annually, improving and diversifying product composition, operating flexibility and energy consumption .
