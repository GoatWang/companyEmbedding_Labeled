Gulf Oil Lubricants India Ltd.
 Gulf Oil's presence in India is through Gulf Oil  Lubricants India Limited (GOLIL). A state-of-the-art PLC controlled  manufacturing facility in Silvassa, more than 350 distributors and  over 50,000 retail counters across the length and breadth of the  country have ensured that the Gulf brand in India today enjoys  tremendous recall and equity. 
With the wealth of knowledge and experience of its  principal, Gulf Oil International, including a vast database of  formulations across segments and industries, the Company is well  placed to cater to all major applications. GOLIL is a regular  supplier to various companies in the automotive, industrial and  construction sector and its products are approved by almost all major  original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
Gulf in India is the pioneer of the 'long drain  interval' platform and has several industry firsts to its credit. It  has revolutionised the market with introduction of Gulf Superfleet LE  Max in 2006, which could go up to 36,000 kms between engine oil  changes, which was used to an 18,000 kms drain interval. In 2010,  Gulf Superfleet LE Max was upgraded to offer a drain interval of up  to 40,000 kms and in  2012, it launched Gulf Superfleet LE Dura Max,  India's first and only 80,000 kms drain interval oil, once again  leaving all competitors far behind. In 2007, Gulf Pride 4T Plus,  India's first motorcycle engine oil with a drain interval of 10,000  kms was launched, again an industry first. 
Over the last five years, Gulf in India has  aggressively marketed the brand through mass media advertising and  tie-ups with leading IPL teams like Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super  Kings. In 2011, the Company brought on-board Mahender Singh Dhoni,  Captain of the Indian cricket team, as brand ambassador. 
To further build Gulf's leadership image among B2B  audiences and establish positioning for endurance that make leaders,  the company ran a very successful mini-series on CNN-IBN, where each  episode had a sports personality and a corporate leader as a guest to  share their experiences on their journey to leadership. 
These new initiatives in marketing, coupled with  intensive, exhaustive below the line  activities to enhance distribution reach, 'influence the  influencer' along with reaching out to more and more consumers has  helped the brand grow significantly in market share.
Today, Gulf is among the fastest growing brands in  the lubricant industry in India. The brand also enjoys the  distinction of being in the Top 2 in India in both new generation  commercial vehicle engine oils as well as motorcycle engine oils in  the 'bazaar' (market). It is also targeting to increase its  presence in the tractor segment with OEM tie-ups. The Company is also  planning to focus on exports to neighbouring countries. Plans are  underway to expand the immediate production capacities at Silvassa  and creating a second manufacturing unit at Chennai in the next two  years.
