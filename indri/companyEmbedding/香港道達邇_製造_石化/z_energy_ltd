Home Automation and Smart Home Control
The HZS (Z-Wave Sensing Device) series of PLANET Home Automation product family, based on Z-Wave technology, provides the advanced security system that protects your home and family 24/7. Easy operation and flexible configuration are the attractive features of our system; the simple one-touch button lets you program your regular settings according to your preference and operation mode. Worked with PLANET HAC-1000 Z-Wave Home Automation Control Gateway, you get the all-round and reliable home security services that we offer. Our full range of product lines ensure that you get all the devices you need for your home security system.  Energy and Cost Saving on Every Room
PLANET HZS-530 series is a Z-Wave Smart Energy Meter that checks the current energy consumption in your home within the configuration interface of the HAC-1000. You can also manage these energy-saving devices such as power meter switches, power switches and dimmer switches to help you reduce energy consumption and thus save expenses on utilities.  Scheduled Power On/Off
The HZS-530 series Energy Meter allows you to pre-define a power schedule for home devices via the HAC-1000 Control Gateway. It alerts users to an upcoming shutdown, and then waits a predefined amount of time to allow users to finish their work and sign off. For example, you can define a schedule that would shut down your home device on Friday night, and start it again Monday morning.  Getting Started is as Easy as 1-2-3
Via the Cloud Home App (including Home Automation Controller Pad and Control Gateway): Press Inclusion/Exclusion to include/exclude Z-Wave device.
On the Z-Wave device: Press the Pair button to establish a connection with the control gateway.
Users can enjoy and manage Z-Wave network right away.  Overload Protection
The HZS-530 series Energy Meter is a miniature device that allows you to control the amount of electricity consumed. If the current exceeds 10 amps, the circuit breaker will open up, cutting off any more current flow. Furthermore, the HZS-532E-DE, an ETSI compliant product in the HZS-530 series, could  inform you about the current load of the connected appliances by changing in color of its built-in LED.
