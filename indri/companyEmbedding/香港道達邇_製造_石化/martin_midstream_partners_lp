Martin Midstream Partners Reports 2017 First Quarter Financial Results

Net Income of $13.6 millionQuarterly Distribution Coverage Ratio of 1.68 timesBalance Sheet Improvement & De-levering.  Leverage at 4.42x as of March 31, 2017 KILGORE, Texas, April  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Martin Midstream Partners L.P. (Nasdaq:MMLP) (the "Partnership") announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Ruben Martin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Martin Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of the Partnership said, "We continue to execute on our stated path of improved distribution coverage and balance sheet leverage; and we delivered strong first quarter 2017 results, including net income of $13.6 million.  We followed up our highest distribution coverage quarter ever at the end of 2016 with another strong cash flow and distribution coverage quarter.  Based on actual distributions paid during the quarter, we generated a 1.68 times coverage ratio. "I'm pleased with our performance as Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $46.8 million, approximately 5% ahead of our guidance level as shown on our first quarter earnings slide.  Looking across our 
business segments, Sulfur Services was our strongest performer compared to guidance, beating our estimate by approximately 30%.  Fertilizer exceeded expectations on both volume and margin benefiting from favorable market and weather conditions.  Also, Marine Transportation outperformed versus plan due to improved efficiency and reduced operating costs.  Our Natural Gas Services segment performed below expectation as a result of warmer weather adversely impacting our wholesale propane business.  Also, we experienced reduced distributions from our West Texas LPG pipeline joint-venture as a result of lower system throughput in the quarter and the continued rollback of the posted tariff rates by the Railroad Commission of Texas during the ongoing rate proceeding. "Looking at our balance sheet, I'm pleased with the continued trend toward lower leverage.  For the first 
quarter our bank compliant total leverage ratio which includes certain pro forma adjustments and the positive impact of debt reduction from the follow-on equity offering completed in February, was 4.42 times.  This is the Partnership's lowest leverage since the second quarter of 2013 and represents an improvement of approximately 0.50 times from our year end 2016 level.  This debt reduction coincides with cash flow generation and reduced working capital levels primarily concentrated in our Natural Gas Services segment. Finally, during the quarter we successfully executed the drop down acquisition of the Hondo, Texas asphalt terminal currently under construction from MRMC.  Upon completion, which is expected mid-year, the total investment will be $36.0 million and we expect to generate approximately 
$5.0 million of cash flow on an annual basis.  We funded the entire acquisition with proceeds from the follow-on equity offering completed in February." The Partnership had net income for the first quarter of 2017 of $13.6 million, or $0.36 per limited partner unit.  The Partnership had net income for the first quarter of 2016 of $15.9 million, or $0.33 per limited partner unit.  The Partnership's adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 was $46.8 million compared to adjusted EBITDA from for the first quarter of 2016 of $49.3 million. The Partnership's distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 was $30.3 million compared to distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2016 of $32.5 million. Revenues for the 
first quarter of 2017 were $253.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2016 of $225.6 million. Distributable cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures which are explained in greater detail below under the heading "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information." The Partnership has also included below a table entitled "Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Distributable Cash Flow" in order to show the components of these non-GAAP financial measures and their reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measurement. Included with this press release are the Partnership's consolidated and condensed financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and certain prior periods.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the

About Martin Midstream Partners            The Partnership is a publicly traded limited 
partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the United States Gulf Coast region. The Partnership's primary business segments include: (1) terminalling, storage and packaging services for petroleum products and by-products; (2) natural gas services, including liquids transportation and distribution services and natural gas storage; (3) sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution; and (4) marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products. Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the Partnership's outlook and all other statements in this release other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements and all references to financial estimates rely 
on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the Partnership's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.  While the Partnership believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in anticipating or predicting certain important factors.  A discussion of these factors, including risks and uncertainties, is set forth in the Partnership's annual and quarterly reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Partnership disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Use of Non-GAAP Financial 
Information The Partnership's management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than its financial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") to analyze its performance. These include: (1) net income before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), (2) adjusted EBITDA and (3) distributable cash flow.  The Partnership's management views these measures as important performance measures of core profitability for its operations and the ability to generate and distribute cash flow, and as key components of its internal financial reporting. The Partnership's management believes investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  Certain items excluded from EBITDA and 
adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets. The Partnership has included information concerning EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it provides investors and management with additional information to better understand the following: financial performance of the Partnership's assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the Partnership's operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other similarly situated entities; and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects.  The Partnership's method of computing adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities. The economic substance behind the Partnership's use of adjusted EBITDA 
is to measure the ability of the Partnership's assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support its indebtedness and make distributions to its unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow.  Distributable cash flow is a significant performance measure used by the Partnership's management and by external users of its financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by the Partnership to the cash distributions it expects to pay unitholders.  Distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for the Partnership's unitholders since it serves as an indicator of the Partnership's success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not the Partnership is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an 
increase in its quarterly distribution rates.  Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Partnership's method of computing these measures may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities.
