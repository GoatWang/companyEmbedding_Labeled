Company Description                    




                        Expanding from Core Competency in Printed Circuit Manufacturing, Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. was established in 1972 by the name of WUS (Wu-Shi), the predecessor of WUS Printed Co., Ltd. The progress of the company’s products and their applications was significantly linked and fueled by the economic growth of Taiwan in the electronics arena. These applications included add-on cards (peripherals), motherboards, telecom products, and eventually to radio base stations, mobile phones, digital cameras, LCD monitors/TV’s/notebooks, and other digital and entertainment products. Throughout its history, strong R&D team enabled the company to keep pace with other international players. Besides core products like multilayer and mobile phones boards, the company technologically moved into advancements such as communication (RF) modules, embedded passives, and high-density microvia (HDI) products in order to differentiate from the advanced field to the traditions. WUS hasinvested two plants in China:WUS Printed Circuit (Kunshan) Co., Ltd.for PCB fabrication andCentron (Kunshan) Electronics Co., Ltd.for SMT services. It went public listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange on 5th February in 1991.
