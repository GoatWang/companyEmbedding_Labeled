Genesys Logic Receives USB-IF Certification for SuperSpeed USB Product 


Taipei, Taiwan -- April 6, 2010 -- Genesys Logic, Inc., a leading CMOS IC design company in mixed-signal high-speed I/O technologies, today announced its GL3310, a USB 3.0 to SATA 3Gb/s bridge chip, has passed USB compliance workshop tests and was certified and listed in the integrators list by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) for SuperSpeed USB peripheral silicon. The USB-IF Compliance and Certification Program is a standard body to ensure product quality and interoperability. The availability of GL3310 tremendously increases the transfer speed between USB and SATA devices such as Hard Drives and Optical Drives. With in-house developed USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and SATA 3Gb/s high speed SerDes circuits built-in, GL3310 is a power efficient and highly integrated USB 3.0 to SATA 3Gb/s bridge controller. Leveraging on the success of its predecessor, GL830, a USB 2.0 to SATA bridge controller, GL3310 is efficiently architectured to support customers with even better compatibility with various USB host controllers and SATA storage devices, and at a competitive cost structure. In addition to its extended transfer performance through USB 3.0, GL3310 comes with a long list of convenient functions such as SPI interface, PWM, watchdog timers, UART monitoring and multiple of GPIO, to facilitate customers’ system development.  Firmly dedicated to its mixed-signal high-speed I/O core competence, Genesys Logic has been developing the crucial and fundamental PHY (Physical Layer) circuits with its in-house talents. Besides the cost advantages, it gives Genesys Logic the flexibility to tailor its products to different customers’ requirements and the ever-changing markets. The next generation SATA standard, operating at 6Gb/s, will pave ways to yet an even higher level of performance in external hard drive usages for customers. Genesys Logic is expected to announce products with SATA 6Gb/s within this year. GL3310 provides 64-pin LQFP and 48-pin QFN packages. For additional product information, visit at: http://www.genesyslogic.com/_en/product_01_1.php?id=72

Genesys Logic Receives USB-IF Certification for SuperSpeed USB Product 


Taipei, Taiwan -- April 6, 2010 -- Genesys Logic, Inc., a leading CMOS IC design company in mixed-signal high-speed I/O technologies, today announced its GL3310, a USB 3.0 to SATA 3Gb/s bridge chip, has passed USB compliance workshop tests and was certified and listed in the integrators list by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) for SuperSpeed USB peripheral silicon. The USB-IF Compliance and Certification Program is a standard body to ensure product quality and interoperability. The availability of GL3310 tremendously increases the transfer speed between USB and SATA devices such as Hard Drives and Optical Drives. With in-house developed USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and SATA 3Gb/s high speed SerDes circuits built-in, GL3310 is a power efficient and highly integrated USB 3.0 to SATA 3Gb/s bridge controller. Leveraging on the success of its predecessor, GL830, a USB 2.0 to SATA bridge controller, GL3310 is efficiently architectured to support customers with even better compatibility with various USB host controllers and SATA storage devices, and at a competitive cost structure. In addition to its extended transfer performance through USB 3.0, GL3310 comes with a long list of convenient functions such as SPI interface, PWM, watchdog timers, UART monitoring and multiple of GPIO, to facilitate customers’ system development.  Firmly dedicated to its mixed-signal high-speed I/O core competence, Genesys Logic has been developing the crucial and fundamental PHY (Physical Layer) circuits with its in-house talents.
