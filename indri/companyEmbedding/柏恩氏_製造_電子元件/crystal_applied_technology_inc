Crystal Research, Inc. (CRI), founded in 2001, is a small technology inventor. We conduct research in the area of optics, photonics, holography, and electronics.Ultra Thick Transmission Gratings (UTG) provide a new grating platform technology for many important applications.  Our UTG technology is based on a proprietary polymer composite that has a refractive index modulation within the volume of the material. Unlike conventional phase gratings in dichromated gelatin (DCG), ultra thick gratings can be made with thickness from 3 microns to 3 minimeters in excellent optical transparency.  UTG can be polarization insensitive suitable for many fiber-optic applications.  UTG exhibits high diffraction efficiency, low wavefront distortion, low optical scattering.  UTG, packaged between two integrated glass plates, is extremely durable and easy to handle.Electro-Optic Holograms (EOH) can be electrically switched on-and-off through electro-optic effect. These holograms are formed by recording volume phase grating or hologram in a polymer dispersed liquid crystal mixture.  Unlike other conventional passive gratings, the diffraction efficiency of electro-optic holograms can be electrically adjusted over a continuous range from essentially zero to near 100% at very fast switching speed of 35 microsecond.Electro-Optic Crystals (KTN and SBN) have the largest electro-optic effect ever reported. KTN crystal is well known as an electro-optic crystal with a very large quadratic electro-optic coefficient, which is 20 times larger than that of conventional LiNbO3.

 Sapphire Heat Spread Substrates
Application & IntroductionSpecification Sapphire Heat Spread Substrates for LED ProductsLED lighting products lead illumination trends of the world. Spectacularly, omni-directional LED products are able to reveal the quality and beauty of LED lighting; therefore, they become manufacturing emphasis in the industry. Commonly, companies use glass as lighting substrates and thin film as circuit. Glass is characterized by translucence; however, its heat dissipation coefficient is about 1.5W/mK, which makes junction temperature of LED too high and thus decreases lighting efficiency and life cycle of products. Also, the use of thin film as circuit raises manufacturing costs. An appropriate solution comes from CWT is that the use of sapphire substrates. Sapphire has several characteristics such as high translucence, good intensity and better heat dissipation coefficient than glasses (20-40W/mK), which make it as a good replacement of filament to be applied to omni-directional LED products.On circuit manufacturing, CWT provides our customers with low-cost and high-efficient product processing. For making of LED lighting engines, CWT offers custmized substrates to our customers as reliable and multiple circuit design solutions to select.SPECProduct images

Recently Published ArticlesEffect of Axial Magnetic Field on Thermocapillary Convection with Bidirectional Temperature Gradients in a Shallow Annular PoolFei Rao and Lan PengVersion of Record online: 2 AUG 2017 | DOI: 10.1002/crat.201600342This simulation is based on the Czochralski model. The thermocapillary convection is harmful to obtaining high-quality crystal. The effect of axial magnetic field on themocapillary convection is reported. The hydrothermal waves and critical temperature gradient would be changed by the applied magnetic field. The transition of flow could be different under various condition. This investigation could be useful to the crystal growth.

Johnson on his 60th birthdayYuri Grin, Rainer Pöttgen, Alim Ormeci, Reinhard K. Kremer and Friedrich E. WagnerVersion of Record online: 2 AUG 2017 | DOI: 10.1002/crat.201700101The phase YbIn1–xAu1+x has a homogeneity range for 0.0 ≤ x ≤0.3 (770 K). Ionic interaction between the ytterbium and gold is supported by the dative bonding AuYb. Intermediate valence for Yb increases with increasing x. The 197Au Mössbauer spectra show a superposition of the signals for Au1 (δ = 3.31 mm s–1) and Au2 (δ = 5.37 mm s–1), indicating auridic character of gold.

SrivastavaVersion of Record online: 31 JUL 2017 | DOI: 10.1002/crat.201700098Gd-Co substituted M-type barium hexaferrite, Ba1-xGdxCoxFe12-xO19 has been synthesized using sol - gel method. UV Vis - NIR have demonstrated that the band gap of as prepared samples increases with substitution. VSM analysis has revealed that coercivity and saturation magnetization depend on substitution. The prepared material can be used as a recording media due to its high surface area, high coercivity and saturation magnetization.AbstractArticlePDF(1435K)PDF(1435K)ReferencesRequest PermissionsImplications of Crystal Structure on Organotin Carboxylate PhotoresistsMeredith C. Sharps, David A. Marsh, Lev N. Zakharov, James E. Hutchison and Darren W. JohnsonVersion of Record online: 24 JUL 2017 | DOI: 10.1002/crat.201700081A series of five organotin carboxylate clusters of the type [RSn(O)O2CR’]6 have been synthesized and examined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures have been compared with regards to the steric and intermolecular forces dictated by the ligand groups as a means to understand how these same factors affect irradiation trends in lithography of thin films. Trends found are compared to other factors that may also dictate resist formation. AbstractArticlePDF(855K)PDF(855K)ReferencesRequest PermissionsOne-Step Formation of 3D Alternating-Layer Structures Composed of Plates of Nanocrystalline Bismuth Oxide and Spherical Particles of Metallic BismuthBoris B. Bokhonov and Yurii M. YukhinVersion of Record online: 24 JUL 2017 | DOI: 10.1002/crat.201700099The authors demonstrate a possibility of synthesizing a periodic heterostructure consisting of layers of nanocrystalline β-bismuth oxide and layers of spherical particles of metallic bismuth in a single step by conducting partial reduction of [Bi6O5(OH)3](NO3)5·3H2O in benzyl alcohol. The mechanisms governing the interface formation during the synthesis of the β-Bi2O3/spherical Bi alternating-layer structure are discussed.
