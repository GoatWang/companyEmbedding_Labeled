The Company offers multilayer ceramic, solid and electrolytic aluminum and film capacitors. The Company's product offerings include surface mount, which are attached directly to the circuit board; leaded capacitors, which are attached to the circuit board using lead wires, and chassis-mount and other pin-through-hole board-mount capacitors, which utilize attachment methods, such as screw terminal and snap-in.The Company's product line consists of various part configurations distinguished by various attributes, such as dielectric (or insulating) material, configuration, encapsulation, capacitance (at various tolerances), voltage, performance characteristics and packaging. The Company sells its products to a range of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including computer, communications, automotive, military, consumer, industrial and aerospace industries. The Company also sells its products to electronics manufacturing services (EMS) providers, which also serve OEMs in these industries. In Asia-Pacific, KEMET manufactures tantalum and aluminum polymer and electrolytic products in China. In Europe, the Company has manufacturing locations in Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal and Sweden. In addition, it also operates product innovation centers in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Sweden.Solid Capacitors Business GroupSolid Capacitors operates approximately nine capacitor manufacturing sites in the United States, Mexico and China, and a product innovation center in the United States. The Solid Capacitors segment primarily produces tantalum, aluminum, polymer and ceramic capacitors. Solid Capacitors also produces tantalum powder used in the production of tantalum capacitors. It offers tantalum products to a range of customers, including computing, telecommunications, consumer, medical, military, automotive and general industries. The Company's ceramic product line offers a line of multilayer ceramic capacitors in a range of sizes and configurations. The Company offers ceramic products to medical, industrial, defense, aerospace, computing, telecommunications, automotive and general industries.Film and Electrolytic Business GroupThe Company's Film and Electrolytic Business Group produces film, paper and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors. It also designs and produces EMI Filters. EMI filters consist of capacitive and inductive elements that reduce electromagnetic disturbance in the frequency range desired. In addition, the Company produces capacitor grade aluminum foils utilized as a core component in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors. The Film and Electrolytic segment primarily serves the industrial and automotive markets. The Company operates approximately 10 film and electrolytic manufacturing sites throughout Europe, Asia and the United States.The Company competes with AVX Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Littelfuse, Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Samsung, Taiyo Yuden Co., Ltd., TDK-EPC Corporation, WIMA GmbH & Co., KG and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

KEMET Corporation was set up in 1919 and now is based in Simpsonville, South Carolina. The company produces many kinds of capacitors, such as tantalum, aluminum, multilayer ceramic, film, paper, polymer electrolytic, and supercapacitors. Capacitors are electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. As an essential passive component used in most circuit boards, capacitors are typically used for coupling, decoupling, filtering, oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems, data processing equipment, personal computers, cellular phones, automotive electronic systems, defense and aerospace systems, consumer electronics, power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems (basically anything that plugs in or has a battery). The company also manufacturers a variety of electronic components such as, AC line filters, EMI cores and filters, flex suppressors, relays, metal composite inductors, ferrite products, and transformers/magnetics. The product line consists of nearly 5 million distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes, such as dielectric (or insulating) material, configuration, encapsulation, capacitance (at various tolerances), voltage, performance characteristics and packaging.

History[edit]
In 1919, KEMET Corporation was founded as a business of Union Carbide Corporation to manufacture component parts for vacuum tubes. In 1958, KEMET changed its market focus to tantalum capacitor. In 1969, the company entered the market of ceramic capacitors. In 1990, KEMET Electronics Corporation was acquired from Union Carbide and after two years, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEM.
In its long developing history, KEMET acquired the tantalum business unit of EPCOS AG in 2007, Evox Rifa Group Oyj and Arcotronics Italia S.p.A. in 2008, Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC and Niotan Incorporated in 2012.[1]
In 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC and Niotan Incorporated.[2]
In 2017 the company announced the closing of a deal to purchase a controlling share of NEC Tokin. After the purchase by KEMET concludes on APril 10, 2017, NEC Tokin will be renamed "Tokin Corporation".[3]
Products and services[edit]
KEMET Electronics Corporation manufacturers capacitors and other components for computing, telecommunications, medical, aerospace defense, and auomotive markets. The Solid Capacitor Business Group produces tantalum and ceramic capacitors. The Film and Electrolytic Business Group sells film, paper, solid organic aluminum electrolytic capacitors, wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
Tantalum Business Group focuses on tantalum and aluminum capacitors for computing, telecommunications, medical, military, automotive and many other industries. Ceramic Business Group focuses on multilayer ceramic capacitors. Film and Electrolytic Business Group focuses on film, paper and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
Research and development[edit]
In January 2014, KEMET introduced the High Voltage-High Temperature (HV-HT) Series in C0G Dielectric, improving the efficiency over competitive high temperature (200 degree) precious metal electrode (PME) and base metal electrode (BME) ceramic capacitor devices.[4] Oct. 2013 KEMET announced the opening of the new aluminum Electrolytic Innovation Center (EIC) in Weymouth, U.K. Products made from this new center include 20 g High Vibration Screw Terminal capacitors and a Low Inductance product line under Film and Electrolytic Business.[5] In fiscal year 2015, KEMET had 33 PhD scientists, of which 17 were focused on technology, and 501 engineers (about one half of which are in manufacturing and the other half in R&D). KEMET was granted a record number of 20 U.S. patents in fiscal year 2015.
Awards[edit]
In June 2013, KEMET won the Supplier Excellence Award for the Americas, Asia and Europe by TTI.[6] In 2015, KEMET received the Global Operations Excellence Award from TTI.[7]

Downloading 3D Capacitor Models (STEP Files) | Ask An FAE #8
3D capacitor models and capacitor STEP files are easy to find at KEMET.com. Dimensional data is available in our datasheets. Our website’s search provides a one-click download of part number specific STEP files.





Quality at KEMET | Ask An FAE #7
KEMET ships approximately 36 billion (that’s with a "b") capacitors each year. Making sure every piece meets our quality standards is important to us. 







Ripple Voltage Differences by Capacitor Type | Ask An FAE #6
Different capacitor types reduce ripple voltage on DC-to- DC converters. Axel demonstrates how 4 different capacitor types affect the ripple voltage on a boost or buck regulator. Each bank of capacitors is the same capacitance. 





Reduce EMI with Flex Suppressor | Ask An FAE #5
Flex Suppressor solves EMI issues quickly. If your design does not pass EMI tests, try sticking pieces of Flex Suppressor inside. It can be applied directly to an IC, on the inside of an enclosure, or anywhere you think EMI might be leaking out.
