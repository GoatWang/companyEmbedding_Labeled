	Shibaura Electronics Co., Ltd. operates in the Electronic resistors sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares Shibaura Electronics Co., Ltd. with three other
	
			companies in this sector in Japan:
		
	Semitec Corp
	
		(2017
	sales of 13.13 billion Japanese Yen [US$119.11  million]
		of which 49%
		was Operating segment-China),
	
	Ohizumi Mfg Co Ltd
	
		(12.18 billion Japanese Yen [US$110.49  million]
		), and
	
	Tokyo Cosmos Electric Co., Ltd.
	
		(8.34 billion Japanese Yen [US$75.65  million]
		).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	Shibaura Electronics Co., Ltd. reported sales of ¥22.07 billion (US$200.19 million)
		for the
		
			fiscal
		
		year ending
		March of 2017.
	
		This
		
			represents
		
				an
			
			increase of 3.8%
		
		 versus 2016, when the company's sales were ¥21.26 billion.
	
		This was the fourth straight year of sales growth at Shibaura Electronics Co., Ltd..
	
		Sales of Operating Segment-Japan saw an increase
		
			of
		4.0% in 2017, from

			Not all segments of Shibaura Electronics Co., Ltd. experienced an increase in sales in 2017:
			sales of Operating Segment-Europe fell 1.7% to ¥713.29 million.
			
				(However, this segment's sales were only a very small portion of the company's overall sales).
