 The goal of this report is to assist managers in gauging a company's financial performance vis-a-vis firms competing in the same sector, at the global level.  In particular, this report covers TOKYO COSMOS ELECTRIC CO., LTD., HACHIOJI CITY, Japan. With the globalization of markets, greater foreign competition, and the reduction of entry barriers, it becomes all the more important to benchmark a company's performance against other firms on a worldwide basis.  Doing so, however, is not an obvious task.  First, one needs to find firms competing in the same sector.  Second, one needs to control for exchange rate volatility.  Finally, one needs to use comparable financial standards.  This report overcomes these issues and gives full financial benchmarks vis-a-vis worldwide competitors who are present in the same narrow industrial classification. Benchmarks cover assets, liabilities, income and ratios.  Since our reports are printed on demand, the statistics reported are for the latest quarter and are the most up to date available (4 reports are produced each year). Each report provides over 100 statistics and 40 graphs to the reader.

From the Publisher


For over 20,000 companies, Icon Group uses a proprietary methodology to generate international benchmarks and measure gaps that might be revealed from such an exercise. First, for a given company Icon Group searches across over 26,000 firms for others producing similar products, offering similar services, or are in the same stage of the value chain for a particular industrial classification.  We then collect the financials for each of these firms and standardize these into comparable categories (assets, liabilities, income and ratios).  From there, we eliminate all currency effects by standardizing within each category and country.  All benchmarks are updated quarterly.

Tokyo Cosmos Electric Co., Ltd (TOCOS) begun its operation in 1957 as an electronic components manufacturer specializing in quality potentiometer products for industrial applications. Since then, we have expanded the portfolios of potentiometers serving customer needs. On another front, we started a mass production of electronic components for automotive applications in 1976 and wireless modules in 2010. This is how we have grown steadily as an electronic components manufacturer.
