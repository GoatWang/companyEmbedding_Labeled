Company overview

Company name: Hokuriku Electric Industry Co., Ltd
Foundation: April 4, 1943
Headquarter: Toyama City, Japan
Products: Sensors (Pressure, Humidity, Force, Temperature, Current, Gas), Piezoelectric Buzzers, Resistors & Tactile Switches, Modules (Modules for automotive, DC DC converter, LCD etc), Printed Circuit Boards (Paste through Hole, Printed Resistor etc)
Company home page: https://www.hdk.co.jp/english/index_e.htm



Product line - Sensors
Hokuriku sensors based on MEMS technology have been manufactured at Hokuriku facility since 1993. For over 20 years, more than 50 million sensors have been shipped to various markets like automotive, industrial, consumer and medical. Sensing technology for the product lines Pressure, Humidity, Force, Gas, Temperature and Current sensors are currently in production. In the field of gas metering, Hokuriku pressure sensor have more than 80% market share in Japan.
Sensors as elements and modules are customizable according to application and customer requirement. In house design, development and fabrication of sensors has resulted in expertise across the entire value chain.
Please find more information about Hokuriku’s sensors on our sensors site: http://www.fujitsu.com/uk/products/devices/standard-components/hokuriku/products/sensors/


Product line – Piezo products
Hokuriku’s extensive experience and knowhow in ceramic material development, multi-layering and thin film technology have resulted in high reliability and performance of Piezo Speakers, Buzzers, Actuator, Receiver, and Sounders. Customization in terms of size, frequency and sound pressure. Hokuriku piezoelectric products have has been employed in home appliance and consumer electronics since 1994. Since 2005 customized Hokuriku products have also been used in automotive applications.

New Products





Rotary Electret Generator
Rotary electret generator of small size thin profile was developed.This device generates electric power by slight vibration energy like human motion.







Non-contacting Temperature Sensor "SFB sensor"
Non-contacting temperature sensor of world-smallest class, 2.2*2.2*0.9mm size was developed.This surface mountable sensor is unaffected environmental temperature.







Pressure Sensor Modules
Our pressure sensors are fabricated with an advanced semiconductor micromachining process, to meet a variety of customer requirements. The high sensitive and high precision sensor is available for any applications.







Capacitive Type Sensors
Ultramini & Low profile type: 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.75mm. 0%～100%RH: Wide range humidity measurable sensor was developed.







Force Sensors
Utilizing long home-nurtured silicon micro-machining technology as core technology, we made it possible to precisely detect micro force less than 1N, which otherwise can not be achieved with conventional method.







High Power Chip Fixed Resistors
Wide terminal made higher reliability of solder joint, compared to conventional chip resistor.
													Wide terminal made possible high power handling.







Sulfurization-proof Chip Fixed Resistors
Use of special protective material made excellent sulfurization-proof characteristic.
									Both reflow and flow soldering are applicable.







Barometric Pressure Sensors
We developed barometric pressure sensor which applied piezo-resistive effect on MEMS technology as a core.







Flat Type Chip Fuse
This is instant-blowing type chip fuse by HDK original structure.1005, 1608 and 2012 sizes are line-up.







Wide Terminal Type High Wattage Chip Resistor
Surface mount type, 3W , 5W rated of high wattage type.Primary circuit of power supply is suitable application.
