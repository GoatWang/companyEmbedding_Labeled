Qualcomm Earnings: What to Watch
Qualcomm Inc. is scheduled to announce results for its fiscal third quarter after the market closes Wednesday. Here's what to look for: EARNINGS FORECAST: For the quarter, which ended in June, analysts expect Qualcomm to report earnings of 81 cents a share on an adjusted basis that omits items including stock-based compensation, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, down 30% from $1.16 the same quarter a year earlier.

Qualcomm's stock jumps after J.P. Morgan upgrade
Shares of Qualcomm Inc.  rallied 1.4% in premarket trade Monday, after the wireless technology and chip maker was upgraded to at J.P. Morgan, which cited improved valuation and optimism over the upcoming closure of the NXP Semiconductors NV  acquisition. Analyst Rod Hall raised his rating back to overweight, after being at neutral since for the past five months, and established a $68 stock price target, which is 18% above Friday's closing price. He said that while he expects more negative news regarding the dispute with Apple Inc. , he views the stoppage of royalty payments by Apple contract manufacturers as a major milestone. "Though volatility in the shares could remain high through the summer we see the valuation gap as too large to continue to ignore with the [NXP Semiconductors] closure approaching," Hall wrote in a note to clients. "We advise investors to add to positions at current levels." The stock had rallied 9.8% since closing at a 9 1/2-month low of $52.50 on April 21 through Friday, but was still down 11.6% year to date. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index  has run up 17.0% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.4%.

Qualcomm Earnings: What to Watch
Qualcomm Inc. is scheduled to announce results for its fiscal third quarter after the market closes Wednesday. Here's what to look for: EARNINGS FORECAST: For the quarter, which ended in June, analysts expect Qualcomm to report earnings of 81 cents a share on an adjusted basis that omits items including stock-based compensation, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, down 30% from $1.16 the same quarter a year earlier.

Qualcomm's stock jumps after J.P. Morgan upgrade
Shares of Qualcomm Inc.  rallied 1.4% in premarket trade Monday, after the wireless technology and chip maker was upgraded to at J.P. Morgan, which cited improved valuation and optimism over the upcoming closure of the NXP Semiconductors NV  acquisition. Analyst Rod Hall raised his rating back to overweight, after being at neutral since for the past five months, and established a $68 stock price target, which is 18% above Friday's closing price. He said that while he expects more negative news regarding the dispute with Apple Inc. , he views the stoppage of royalty payments by Apple contract manufacturers as a major milestone. "Though volatility in the shares could remain high through the summer we see the valuation gap as too large to continue to ignore with the [NXP Semiconductors] closure approaching," Hall wrote in a note to clients. "We advise investors to add to positions at current levels." The stock had rallied 9.8% since closing at a 9 1/2-month low of $52.50 on April 21 through Friday, but was still down 11.6% year to date. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index  has run up 17.0% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.4%.

公司历史[编辑]
恩智浦半导体前身為飞利浦於半個世紀前創立的分支，專門研發半導體。在1980年代，此分支曾使飞利浦成為當年世界最大半導體生產商。
2006年，飞利浦宣佈出售旗下半導體分支予由多個荷蘭投資者組成的財團，從飞利浦分離出去。
2015年3月3日，恩智浦半導體以現金加股票收購同業飛思卡爾（Freescale），恩智浦將支付飛思卡爾股東每股6.25美元現金和0.325股的恩智浦股份。按收購價估計，飛思卡爾價值約118億美元，若計入債務，收購價將增至167億美元。合併市值超越400億美元，將成為車用及工業用半導體市場龍頭。合併完成後的恩智浦將因為營收規模擴增，躋身全球前十大半導體廠商之列；若把專注代工的台積電（TSMC）、以記憶體為主力產品的美光（Micron）和SK海力士（SK Hynix）忽略不計，恩智浦已具備挑戰全球半導體廠商前五大的實力。
2016年10月27日高通 （Qualcomm）以每股110美元現金，斥資378.8億美元收購恩智浦半導體，這項收購交易包括債務在內，總值高達470億美元。

Description[edit]
NXP said it was the fifth-largest non-memory semiconductor supplier in 2016, and the leading semiconductor supplier for the secure identification, automotive and digital networking industries.[4] The company was founded in 1953 as part of the electronics firm Philips, with manufacturing and development in Nijmegen, Netherlands.[5] Known then as Philips Semiconductors, the company was sold to a consortium of private equity investors in 2006, at which point the company's name was changed to NXP.[6]
On August 6, 2010, NXP completed its Initial public offering, with shares trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol NXPI. On December 23, 2013, NXP Semiconductors was added to the NASDAQ 100.[7] Finally, on March 2, 2015, it was announced that NXP Semiconductors would merge with chip designer and manufacturer Freescale Semiconductor in a $40 billion US-dollar deal.[8][9] The merger was closed on December 7, 2015.[10]
NXP Semiconductors provides mixed signal and standard products based on its security, identification, automotive, networking, radio frequency, analog signal, and power management expertise. With an emphasis on security of the connected vehicle and the Internet of things, the company's products are used in automotive, identification, wired and wireless infrastructure, lighting, industrial, consumer, mobile and computing applications. For example, in order to protect against potential hackers, NXP offers gateways to automotive manufacturers that prevent communication with every network within a car independently.[11]
NXP is the co-inventor of near field communication (NFC) technology along with Sony and supplies NFC chip sets that enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods, and store and exchange data securely.[12] NXP manufactures chips for eGovernment applications such as electronic passports; RFID tags and labels; and transport and access management, with the chip set and contactless card for MIFARE used by many major public transit systems worldwide.[13]
In addition, NXP manufactures automotive chips for in-vehicle networking, passive keyless entry and immobilization, and car radios.[14] NXP invented the I²C interface over 30 years ago and supplier of products using it.[15] Before the divestiture of Nexperia, NXP was also a volume supplier of standard logic devices, and celebrated its 50 years in logic (via its history as both Signetics and Philips Semiconductors) in March 2012.[16]
NXP owns over 9,000 issued or pending patents.[1]
Philips Semiconductors[edit]

Silicon Valley-based Signetics, the "first company in the world established expressly to make and sell integrated circuits"[17] and inventor of the 555 timer IC, was acquired by Philips in 1975. At the time, it was claimed that "with the Signetics acquisition, Philips was now number two in the league table of semiconductor manufacturers in the world."[18] In 1987, Philips-Signetics, a unit of Philips, was ranked Europe's largest semiconductor maker, with sales of $1.36 billion in 1986.[19]
Philips acquired VLSI Technology in June 1999. At the time, the acquisition made Philips the world's sixth largest semiconductor company.[20]
In December 2005, Philips announced its intention to legally separate its semiconductor division, Philips Semiconductors, into an independent legal entity.[21]
In September 2006, Philips completed the sale of an 80.1% stake in Philips Semiconductors to a consortium of private equity investors consisting of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), Bain Capital, Silver Lake Partners, Apax Partners, and AlpInvest Partners.[22]

Launch of NXP Semiconductors N.V.[edit]

The new company name NXP (from Next eXPerience) was announced on August 31, 2006,[6] and was officially launched during the Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA) consumer electronics show in Berlin. The newly independent NXP was ranked as one of the world's top 10 semiconductor companies.[23] At the time, CEO Frans van Houten emphasized the importance of NXP in enabling "vibrant media" technologies in mobile phones, digital TVs, portable music players and other consumer electronics devices.[24]
NXP's first acquisition as an independent company was in 2007, when NXP announced that it would acquire Silicon Laboratories’ AeroFONE single-chip phone and power amplifier product lines to strengthen its Mobile and Personal business.[25] Fourteen months later, NXP announced that it would transform its Mobile and Personal business unit into a joint venture with STMicroelectronics, which in 2009 became ST-Ericsson, a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson Mobile Platforms and STMicroelectronics, after ST purchased NXP's 20% stake.[26]
Similarly, in April 2008, NXP announced it would acquire the set-top box business of Conexant to complement its existing Home business unit.[27][28] In October 2009, NXP announced that it would sell its Home business unit to Trident Microsystems.[29]
In September 2008, NXP announced that it would restructure its manufacturing, R&D and back office operations, resulting in 4,500 job cuts worldwide, for annual savings of $550 million.[30]

Notable events[edit]

Current president and CEO Rick Clemmer took over from Frans van Houten on January 1, 2009.[31] Clemmer has emphasized the importance of "high performance mixed signal" products as a key focus area for NXP.[32] As of 2011, "standard products" including components such as small signal, power and integrated discretes[33] accounted for 30 percent of NXP's business.[32]
On July 26, 2010, NXP announced that it had acquired Jennic based in Sheffield, UK,[34] which now operates as part of its smart home and energy product line, using ZigBee and JenNet-IP.
On August 6, 2010, NXP announced its initial public offering at NASDAQ, with 34,000,000 shares, pricing each $14.[35]
In December 2010, NXP announced that it would sell its Sound Solutions business to Knowles Electronics, part of Dover Corporation, for $855 million in cash.[36] The acquisition was completed as of July 5, 2011.[37]
In April 2012, NXP announced its intent to acquire electronic design consultancy Catena to work on automotive applications.[38]
In July 2012, NXP sold its high-speed data converter assets to Integrated Device Technology.[39]
In 2012, revenue for NXP's Identification business unit was $986 million, up 41% from 2011, in part due to growing sales of NFC chips and secure elements.[40]
On January 4, 2013, NXP and Cisco announced their investment in Cohda Wireless, an Australian company focused on car-to-car and car-to-infrastructure communications.[41]
In January 2013, NXP announced 700-900 redundancies worldwide in an effort to cut costs related to "support services".[42]
In May 2013, NXP announced that it acquired Code Red Technologies, a provider of embedded software development such as the LPCXpresso IDE and Red Suite.[43]
In July 2014, NXP was reported to have sacked union organisers.[44] A campaign was started for their reinstatement.[45]
On June 14, 2016, it was announced that Nexperia would be divested from NXP to a consortium of financial investors consisting of Beijing Jianguang Asset Management Co., Ltd (“JAC Capital”) and Wise Road Capital LTD (“Wise Road Capital”).[46] This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 pending all required regulatory approvals and employee representative consultations.[46]

Acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor[edit]

In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which NXP would acquire rival Freescale Semiconductor.[47]
The RF Power Division was sold to JAC Capital for $1.8 billion and was rebranded as Ampleon, in a transaction closed in November 2015.[48]
On December 7, 2015, NXP completed its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor and the merged company continued operations as NXP Semiconductors N.V.

Analysis of merger[edit]
Both have deep roots stretching back to when they were part of Philips NV (in the case of NXP), and Motorola (Freescale). Each has comparable revenue figures; US$4.8B and US$4.2B for NXP and Freescale respectively in 2013. NXP primarily focuses on near field communication (NFC) and high-performance mixed signal (HPMS) hardware. Freescale focuses on its microprocessor and microcontroller. Both companies possess roughly equal patent portfolios.[49]
Certainly, each company brings core strengths to the combined organization, NFC from NXP and microcontrollers from Freescale. Also, both companies have been actively involved in litigation over the years as both plaintiff and defendant, so a larger and, more importantly, a more geographically diverse patent portfolio could likely prove useful in such matters. Chipworks' analysts suggest the newly merged company will divest itself of many properties as the merger progresses.[49]
Some analysts believe cost savings after the two companies merge are expected to be about $500M dollars. Customers are ultimately divided over the consolidation of their product families and how it may affect their own development and end-products.[49]

公司历史[编辑]
恩智浦半导体前身為飞利浦於半個世紀前創立的分支，專門研發半導體。在1980年代，此分支曾使飞利浦成為當年世界最大半導體生產商。
2006年，飞利浦宣佈出售旗下半導體分支予由多個荷蘭投資者組成的財團，從飞利浦分離出去。
2015年3月3日，恩智浦半導體以現金加股票收購同業飛思卡爾（Freescale），恩智浦將支付飛思卡爾股東每股6.25美元現金和0.325股的恩智浦股份。按收購價估計，飛思卡爾價值約118億美元，若計入債務，收購價將增至167億美元。合併市值超越400億美元，將成為車用及工業用半導體市場龍頭。合併完成後的恩智浦將因為營收規模擴增，躋身全球前十大半導體廠商之列；若把專注代工的台積電（TSMC）、以記憶體為主力產品的美光（Micron）和SK海力士（SK Hynix）忽略不計，恩智浦已具備挑戰全球半導體廠商前五大的實力。
2016年10月27日高通 （Qualcomm）以每股110美元現金，斥資378.8億美元收購恩智浦半導體，這項收購交易包括債務在內，總值高達470億美元。

公司历史[编辑]
恩智浦半导体前身為飞利浦於半個世紀前創立的分支，專門研發半導體。在1980年代，此分支曾使飞利浦成為當年世界最大半導體生產商。
2006年，飞利浦宣佈出售旗下半導體分支予由多個荷蘭投資者組成的財團，從飞利浦分離出去。
2015年3月3日，恩智浦半導體以現金加股票收購同業飛思卡爾（Freescale），恩智浦將支付飛思卡爾股東每股6.25美元現金和0.325股的恩智浦股份。按收購價估計，飛思卡爾價值約118億美元，若計入債務，收購價將增至167億美元。合併市值超越400億美元，將成為車用及工業用半導體市場龍頭。合併完成後的恩智浦將因為營收規模擴增，躋身全球前十大半導體廠商之列；若把專注代工的台積電（TSMC）、以記憶體為主力產品的美光（Micron）和SK海力士（SK Hynix）忽略不計，恩智浦已具備挑戰全球半導體廠商前五大的實力。
2016年10月27日高通 （Qualcomm）以每股110美元現金，斥資378.8億美元收購恩智浦半導體，這項收購交易包括債務在內，總值高達470億美元。

      From fitness and wellness to industrial and smart devices, these new 
      reference platforms target a range of IoT applications with open-source 
      hardware and software, form-factor flexibility, and expandable solutions 
      for designers to adapt to changing market needs. By offering both MCU 
      and MPU based reference platforms, NXP can scale to address the varied 
      requirements and usage models enabling faster and more cost effective 
      development and design.
    

      “NXP is able to leverage its broad portfolio of products to offer 
      comprehensive, form-factor reference designs for the wearable market, 
      simplifying customer design and accelerating customer time to market,” 
      said Geoff Lees, general manager and senior vice president of the 
      microcontroller business line at NXP. “These new reference platforms 
      target OEMs, as well as the larger maker community by offering 
      versatility for designs that need to be smart, low-power, and 
      expandable.”
    

Hexiwear Reference Platform enhanced by NXP


      Based on Kinetis MCUs, the Hexiwear platform combines the style and 
      usability found in high-end consumer devices, with the functionality and 
      expandability of sophisticated engineering development platforms, making 
      Hexiwear the ideal form factor for the wearable market, as well as other 
      edge-node IoT solutions. Completely open-source and developed by 
      MikroElektronika, in partnership with NXP, the Hexiwear hardware 
      includes a breadth of NXP products: the low power, high performance 
      Kinetis K6x microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M4 core; the Kinetis 
      KW40Z multimode radio SoC, supporting BLE in Hexiwear; three advanced 
      NXP sensors: 6-axis accelerometer and magnetometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 
      and an absolute digital pressure sensor; and an NXP single cell battery 
      charger IC.
    

      “NXP offers the most comprehensive portfolio of products for the 
      wearable market and combined with the expansive enablement and community 
      support, NXP was the ideal partner for the Hexiwear reference platform,” 
      said Dr. Djordje Marinkovic, director of business development at of 
      MikroElektronika. “The Hexiwear platform is also expandable with the 
      option to add nearly 200 different, additional sensors through click 
      boardsTM.”
    

      The Hexiwear software includes open source application software, drivers 
      and cloud connectivity, enabling designers to efficiently move data from 
      the device’s sensors to the cloud. Hexiwear is supported with its own 
      application for Android and iOS, so customers can connect the device to 
      the cloud straight out of the box, without any additional software 
      development. Hexiwear uses FreeRTOS, the Kinetis software development 
      kit (SDK) and the Kinetis Design Studio IDE.
    

      “Hexiwear is a complete IoT development system which, when integrated 
      with our cloud platform, delivers feature-packed cloud solutions faster 
      to the market,” said Alex Maniatopoulos, CEO of Yodiwo.
    

      At a $49 USD suggested resale, samples of the Hexiwear platform are 
      available now to early engagers, with full production scheduled to start 
      in April 2016.
    

Kinetis Designs


      The Hexiwear platform is also available for download from Kinetis 
      Designs, the online portal for customers to access the latest 
      open-source hardware and software reference designs based on Kinetis 
      MCUs. Kinetis Designs provides access to information such as software, 
      schematics and user documentation for quick use and customization. In 
      addition to Hexiwear, Kinetis Designs also includes such wearable 
      designs as the Bluetooth Low Energy heart rate monitoring platform. With 
      new reference designs being added regularly, visit Kinetis Designs and 
      Hexiwear at www.NXP.com/KinetisDesigns/Hexiwear.
    

WaRP7 Wearable Reference Platform enhanced by NXP


      Based on i.MX 7Solo applications processors, WaRP7 is one of the most 
      power-efficient MPU platforms for evaluation and rapid adoption into 
      original product designs so wearable device designers can innovate and 
      take a differentiated product to market faster. By utilizing the 
      heterogeneous multicore architecture of the i.MX 7Solo device, WaRP7 
      allows customers to optimize power efficiency, lower the bill of 
      materials, and it provides the ultimate in performance flexibility to 
      address the varied usage models for the wearables market.
    

      WaRP7 was developed in partnership with element14, a part of the Premier 
      Farnell Group, and leverages the expansive NXP portfolio. The platform 
      includes the new NXP i.MX 7Solo applications processor, PF3001 power 
      management IC, BC3770 battery charger, three NXP sensors: 6-axis 
      accelerometer and magnetometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and an absolute 
      digital pressure sensor, and a near field communication (NFC) IC to 
      enable short range communication and secure payments. The combination of 
      the NFC IC and the extensive hardware security features of the i.MX 
      7Solo device allows customers to meet the security requirements of the 
      diverse wearables market.
    

      “element14’s experience in small form factor design, manufacturing 
      capability and experience with supporting the development community will 
      enable wearable projects to utilize WaRP7 and potentially finally answer 
      the question, where should I start to be successful in the wearables 
      market,” said David Shen, Group Chief Technical Officer, Premier Farnell.
    

      WaRP7 hardware and software will be open source to allow developers to 
      take the platform as a starting point and innovate without licensing 
      restrictions. Hardware engineers will benefit from schematics, Gerber 
      files, and CAD files, while software engineers will be able to focus on 
      their differentiation by leveraging NXP’s board support packages for 
      Linux and Android optimized to run on the WaRP7 platform. A WaRP7 kit 
      will include the main CPU board, the I/O daughter card and a battery. A 
      touch screen LCD will be an optional choice. WaRP7 is scheduled to start 
      shipping in full production in April 2016 at a $99 USD resale. More 
      information can be found at www.element14.com/warp7.
