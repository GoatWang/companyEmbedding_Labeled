Description


The development of automobiles, machinery manufacturing, electrical, and other industries in China has triggered a rapid expansion of lubricant market size. So far, China has become one of the world's major lubricant producers and consumers. However, amid the low-speed growth of the global economy, China's lubricant market continued to decline for the past two years, with 2014's lubricant output falling by 3.6% year-on-year to 5.6866 million tons.


Influenced by the distribution of resources, China's lubricant industry presents obvious regional characteristics. In 2014, Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanghai ranked among the top three by lubricant output. Among them, Liaoning produced 1.3191 million tons, accounting for 23.2% of the total nationwide, and the output of Shandong and Shanghai were recorded at 824.9 kilotons and 496.4 kilotons, respectively.


At present, China's lubricant market is dominated by state-owned, foreign-funded, private-owned enterprises. As the leaders in China's lubricant industry, Sinopec (Great Wall Lubricant) and PetroChina (Kunlun Lubricant) represented a combined 48.7% market share in 2014, while transnational petroleum corporations e.g. Shell, BP, FUCHS, and Total occupied a 29.7% share.


Upbeat about the outlook for China's lubricant market, and hoping to stabilize their share in China's lubricant market, the foreign giants that have long dominated China's high-end lubricant market are working to make layout and integration of China's lubricant business.


In November 2014, Total, a French oil company, announced that it was integrating its lubricant business in China with COSCO Shipping. The company would put Total Lubricant (China) Co. as the main part, and make the companies in Guangzhou and Tianjin the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Total Lubricant (China); Guangzhou Ocean Shipping Co., a subsidiary of COSCO Shipping, will hold a 20% stake in the new Total Lubricant (China).


In June 2015, Shell's eighth lubricant blending plant in China-Tianjin Lubricant Blending Plant (located in the Tianjin Nangang Industrial Park) was put into operation. The new plant has an annual output of 330 million liters and expansion capacity of 500 million liters.


However, with the development of oil refining industry and the improvement of marketization, base oil supply bottlenecks will be eliminated, so that the local privately-owned enterprises, through years of efforts, will also hold an important position in some Chinese lubricant market segments. The companies like Jiangsu LOPAL Tech. Co. and Guangdong Delian Group Co. are the major Chinese automotive lubricant suppliers; Jiangsu Gaoke Petrochemical Company Limited, Dongguan Anmei Lubrication Technology Co., and Shandong Yuangen Petroleum Chemical, among others, have certain competitive advantages in China's industrial lubricant market segment.

                                        Foshan Surewin Technology Co., Ltd. Is a professional enterprise that specialize in all kinds of fastener (including expansion bolt, self drilling screw, self tapping screw, hex bolt etc...) stainless steel pipes, tubes and pipe fittings. We regard "quality supreme, customer first" as our company philosophy. Utilizing German technology and Germany standard mechanical equipments to manufacture our flagship products separated into two major specifications: Domestic standard and European standard. We has a high reputation in all over the world, especially in society and customers, for its merit of good quality, advanced technology, environmental friendliness and physical health. 

"Life from the natural, health from environmental protection" is our intention has always insisted the business philosophy, Presshope together with first class design term has researched and developed an international high-quality level drinking water pipeline system. Based on integrity and win-win concept, we hopefully seek a chance to start a business with you in such a vast stainless steel pipeline market, warmly welcome you to visit our factory, and develop sincerely, cast together brilliantly. 

Stainless steel press systems have been used for building services in the Central European market for approx. 25 years. The system pipes and fittings has been tried and tested for decades and is applicable as an extremely flexible and innovative connection technology. Particularly due to this time-saving and cold-forming (no risk of fire from open flames) connection technology, the customer-oriented machinery and equipment engineer is in the position to offer and implement an installation that is secure and fulfills the corresponding rulesets. 

This is also reflected in the growing market shares compared to traditional connection technologies such as screwing, welding and soldering. 

With the aid of a pressing tool, Press Fittings are made into an inseparable, permanently impervious friction locking connection actuated by longitudinal and profile forces. 

We offers the user an extensive range of products made of different materials as well as dimensions between 15 and 108 mm. 

The planer and the installation technician are therefore in the position to plan, produce and operate service facilities according to rulesets EN 806, EN1717, EN 12329, DIN 1988, DVGW W 551 and W 552 etc.

Summary
Table of contents


		The development of automobiles, machinery manufacturing, electrical, and other industries in China has triggered a rapid expansion of lubricant market size. So far, China has become one of the world’s major lubricant producers and consumers. However, amid the low-speed growth of the global economy, China’s lubricant market continued to decline for the past two years, with 2014’s lubricant output falling by 3.6% year-on-year to 5.6866 million tons.Influenced by the distribution of resources, China's lubricant industry presents obvious regional characteristics. In 2014, Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanghai ranked among the top three by lubricant output. Among them, Liaoning produced 1.3191 million tons, accounting for 23.2% of the total nationwide, and the output of Shandong and Shanghai were recorded at 824.9 kilotons and 496.4 kilotons, respectively.At present, China's lubricant market is dominated by state-owned, foreign-funded, private-owned enterprises. As the leaders in China's lubricant industry, Sinopec (Great Wall Lubricant) and PetroChina (Kunlun Lubricant) represented a combined 48.7% market share in 2014, while transnational petroleum corporations e.g. Shell, BP, FUCHS, and Total occupied a 29.7% share.Upbeat about the outlook for China's lubricant market, and hoping to stabilize their share in China's lubricant market, the foreign giants that have long dominated China's high-end lubricant market are working to make layout and integration of China's lubricant business.In November 2014, Total, a French oil company, announced that it was integrating its lubricant business in China with COSCO Shipping. The company would put Total Lubricant (China) Co. as the main part, and make the companies in Guangzhou and Tianjin the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Total Lubricant (China); Guangzhou Ocean Shipping Co., a subsidiary of COSCO Shipping, will hold a 20% stake in the new Total Lubricant (China).In June 2015, Shell's eighth lubricant blending plant in China—Tianjin Lubricant Blending Plant (located in the Tianjin Nangang Industrial Park) was put into operation. The new plant has an annual output of 330 million liters and expansion capacity of 500 million liters.However, with the development of oil refining industry and the improvement of marketization, base oil supply bottlenecks will be eliminated, so that the local privately-owned enterprises, through years of efforts, will also hold an important position in some Chinese lubricant market segments. The companies like Jiangsu LOPAL Tech. Co. and Guangdong Delian Group Co. are the major Chinese automotive lubricant suppliers; Jiangsu Gaoke Petrochemical Company Limited, Dongguan Anmei Lubrication Technology Co., and Shandong Yuangen Petroleum Chemical, among others, have certain competitive advantages in China’s industrial lubricant market segment.The report highlights the following:Operation environment of China lubricant industry, including international market environment, domestic macro-economic environment, etc.; Development status, market supply and demand, competitive landscape, import and export, growth prediction, etc. of China lubricant industry;Market status, supply and demand, import and export, etc. of base oil and additives in China;Policies, market status, supply and demand, etc. of waste lubricants in China;Operation, lubricant business, development prospects, etc. of 8 global and 8 Chinese lubricant companies.
