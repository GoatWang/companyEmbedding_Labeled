Unaudited Interim Results
 
Hydrodec Group plc (AIM: HYR), the clean-tech industrial oil re-refining group, today announces unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
 
Financial highlights
 
·     2015 has been, and continues to be, challenging, but the Company does not expect short term issues to impact 2016 expectations. 
 
·     The ramp up of key projects has been slower than expected.  In the UK, the Company continues to face, and react to, oil price volatility and difficult market conditions.
 
·     Total revenue and other income of US$21.3 million (H1 2014: US$29.4 million) includes business interruption income of US$1.5 million from the Canton insurance settlement but limited revenues from the plant as ramp-up is ongoing; it is also impacted by lost production during re-location of operations in Australia, whilst revenues in the UK are adversely impacted as a result of the lower price of oil.
 
·     Total sales volumes increased to 33.2 million litres (H1 2014: 25.5 million litres), with the acquisition of the business and assets of Eco Oil Limited ("Eco-Oil") in April 2015.  
 
·     Gross profit of US$2.8 million (H1 2014:  US$7.9 million); reflects limited revenues from the Canton facility, lost production in Australia, and the adverse impact of the lower price of oil in the UK.
 
·     Operating EBITDA1 loss of US$3.2 million (H1 2014: US$1.6 million profit); reflecting production delays in the US, the costs associated with relocation of operations in Australia and the effects of the decline in the price of oil and changing market conditions on margins in the UK Recycling business.
 
·     Overall loss for the period of US$7.5 million (H1 2014: US$3.0 million) included transaction costs and one-off restructuring costs incurred in relation to the integration of the Eco-Oil business, the re-commissioning of the rebuilt and expanded plant in Canton and the relocation of Australian operations.
 
1 EBITDA adjusted for growth expenditure of US$1.2 million (H1 2014: US$1.1 million), including acquisition costs of US$0.4m and restructuring costs of US$0.5 million (H1 2014: US$nil)
 
Operational and strategic highlights
 
·     The rebuilt and expanded facility in Canton, Ohio was fully installed largely as expected but has experienced performance issues with plant and contractors slowing ramp up of production. The pace and continuing execution of the Canton ramp-up is the key performance imperative.  At the time of this announcement, four Trains (out of six) are in production at a reduced rate producing approximately 38,000 litres of SUPERfineTM base oil per day. The previously announced issues with heat exchangers have been resolved; repaired units are now fitted to four Trains. Plans are in place to bring Trains 5 and 6 into production and we expect to switch production to transformer oil shortly. The business benefits from secure feedstock supply and ample stock. We have now revised our production projections for Canton for the year to 10 million litres assuming building to full production during October. 
 
·     The acquisition of the business and assets of Eco-Oil has consolidated feedstock collection for the proposed lubricant oil re-refinery in the UK. A full restructure of the consolidated UK recycling business is nearing completion, with an approximate 36% reduction in headcount as well as site consolidation benefits expected to generate annualised synergies of c.US$2.5 million.  
 
·     The Company has entered into an agreement for lease with The Manchester Ship Canal Company Limited (a member of the Peel Ports Group) for the proposed long term lease of a nine acre site near Eastham Locks, Port Wirral, Merseyside in North West England, for the first phase development of a used oil re-refinery in the UK.  The Company continues to ensure that it delivers on all aspects of the consultation and engagement process required by the NSIP regime, to work on the design and value engineering of the project and to develop the planning submission for the proposed re-refinery to be submitted later this year.
 
·     Commenced tolling under the outsourcing arrangement with Southern Oil in Australia; product achieving '500hr' oil status with encouraging market response.
 
Market outlook
 
·      In the US, despite slower than expected ramp up to full production, we remain confident that the rebuilt and expanded plant has a unique market proposition and is well placed in 2016 to leverage the production of the highest quality transformer oil produced in the US, meeting all US and international standards. 
 
·      In the UK, lower oil prices have created a significant market dislocation in supply and demand for used oil and used oil products. Hydrodec UK has responded, and continues to react to, and operate in, a tough trading environment, with a second phase of restructuring underway. The security of feedstock supply delivered by the combined business underpins the rationale and longer term strategy for a UK re-refinery where base oil margins are less volatile and continue to trade at a significant premium to fuel oil. 
Commenting on the results, Ian Smale, Chief Executive of Hydrodec, said: "We remain focused on managing the resources of the Company and on delivering the comprehensive six point plan set out at this year's Annual General Meeting against a backdrop of very difficult underlying market conditions and performance issues with plant and contractors in key projects.  We remain confident that the key elements of our comprehensive strategy are in place and believe that the delivery of this strategy and plan will drive the Company to profitability."
 
The Company also announces today that Gillian Leates, Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, has retired from the Board and as Chair of the Audit Committee with effect from the close of yesterday's Board meeting, in order to focus on her other business interests, including as Non-Executive Chairman of React Group plc.  Lord Moynihan, Chairman, commented: 'On behalf of the Board I would like to express our deep appreciation to Gill for her exceptional contribution and commitment to Hydrodec over the last six years. As a long standing member of the Board, she has been integral to the development of Hydrodec over the past six years.  We all wish her well for the future.'

Notes to Editors:
Hydrodec's technology is a proven, highly efficient, oil re-refining and chemical process initially targeted at the multi-billion US$ market for transformer oil used by the world's electricity industry. Spent oil is currently processed at two commercial plants with distinct competitive advantage delivered through very high recoveries (near 100%), producing 'as new' high quality oils at competitive cost and without environmentally harmful emissions. The process also completely eliminates PCBs, a toxic additive banned under international regulations. Hydrodec's plants are located at Canton, Ohio, US and Young, New South Wales, Australia.  In 2013, Hydrodec acquired the business and assets of OSS Group, the UK's largest collector, consolidator and processor of used lubricant oil and seller of processed fuel oil, with a national network of oil storage and transfer stations. Used oil is converted into processed fuel oil at OSS's plant at Stourport and principally sold on to the UK quarry and power industry. In April 2015, Hydrodec further acquired the business and assets of Eco Oil, a leading UK waste oil collector and supplier of recycled industrial fuel oil into the power and road stone industries. It is also one of four significant providers of waste management services to the marine industry in the UK, specifically oily-water slops or marine pollutant (MARPOL).  In line with our stated intention to develop a base oil re-refinery in the UK, we have an exclusive licence agreement with California-based Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) to develop the CEP wiped-film evaporation and hydrogenation technology in the UK as well as the basic engineering for a 75 million litre per annum capacity base oil re-refinery.
Hydrodec's shares are listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. For further information, please visit www.hydrodec.com.
 
Chief Executive's Report
 
Operations
 
At the Company's Annual General Meeting on 9 June 2015, we set out a clear, focused and comprehensive six point plan to drive the Company to profitability. The first half of 2015 has been challenging, but has delivered progress in terms of the Company's strategic plan despite a backdrop of difficult underlying market conditions as well as performance issues with contractors and equipment in key projects. 
 
The interim results reflect the re-commissioning of the rebuilt and expanded plant in Canton and the relocation of Australian operations as well as the impact of lower oil prices disproportionately affecting the UK collections business. In addition, they reflect the transaction costs and one-off restructuring costs incurred in relation to the integration of the Eco-Oil business, without the benefit of cuts in growth and overhead costs which arise in the second half of the year.
 
In the United States, we have commissioned the rebuilt and expanded facility in Canton, Ohio including the necessary remedial action on plant and equipment that slowed production ramp-up over the summer. We have achieved design specification production from individual processing trains and remain confident that noted efficiency improvements will be attainable with full production from the plant in due course.  At the time of this announcement, four Trains (out of six) are in production at a reduced rate producing approximately 38,000 litres of SUPERfineTM base oil per day.  Previously announced issues with heat exchangers have been resolved with repaired units now fitted to four Trains which will allow us to plan for Trains 5 and 6 to be in production. We expect to switch production to transformer oil shortly. Given the delay to the ramp up of Trains 3 to 6 and based on revised internal forecasts, we have now revised our production projections for Canton for the year to 10 million litres assuming building to full production during October. 
 
In Australia, tolling has commenced under the outsourcing arrangements with Southern Oil, with all transition and residual operating cost savings now delivered. Our product has achieved '500hr' oil status, certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and efforts to further develop market penetration of our SUPERfineTM product are underway. We expect the Australian operation to be cash flow positive by the year end supported by better margin structures compensating for some lost production during transition.
 
In the UK, our objective remains to deploy world leading technology that delivers a European hub for re-refining, producing high quality new oils from used oils for use in their original purpose. We have consolidated feedstock collection for the proposed lubricant re-refinery through the acquisition of the business and assets of Eco-Oil and are realising significant efficiencies through the transition of the OSS and Eco-Oil businesses under a combined Hydrodec (UK) operating structure and brand; revenue, scale and efficiency savings are estimated to deliver approximately US$2.5 million of benefit on an annualised basis. Significantly, the reduced oil price has changed the character of the UK waste oil market from oil as an opportunity value proposition to a liability cost for workshops and operators.  In the short term, however, this pricing lag both compresses margins and reduces oil available for collection.  An additional market feature is a reduction in demand for PFO with the decline in UK coal-fired power generation, pushing markets increasingly into Europe. A number of steps to mitigate both pricing lag and market structure are underway as Hydrodec UK continues to respond and operate in a tough trading environment.
 
Overall, the Company's priorities remain clear, and the Board remains confident that our focused and comprehensive six point plan will deliver value for shareholders: delivering the rebuild and expansion of our US market position through our Canton re-refinery; embedding the outsourcing relationship with Southern Oil in Australia; delivering the leading oil and associated waste management business in the UK; securing the technology platform of the Company through patents and partnership with key technology providers under the guidance of the Safety and Technology Board Committee; building out into the large lubricant oil re-refining market to be value accretive to Hydrodec shareholders; and, growth through technology de-risking expansion through partnership, collaboration or integration along the value chain. The key elements of this comprehensive strategy are in place; the Board and management all believe that delivery of this strategy and plan will drive the Company to profitability.

Chief Financial Officer's Review
 
The following provides a review of Hydrodec's results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015.  The half year results include additional costs related to the acquisition and consolidation of Eco-Oil's assets in the UK as well as re-commissioning costs in both the US and Australia.  The impact of the restructuring charges incurred in H1 2015 will further reduce direct and overhead costs in H2 2015.
 
Overview
 
In the period, the Group sold 33.2 million litres of oil, an increase of 30% on the previous year driven by the acquisition of the Eco-Oil business at the start of Q2. Total income declined 27% as Business Interruption income ceased on 31st March and Average Selling Price ("ASP") declined as a result of the fall in world oil prices.
 
The focus for H2 is the continued ramp up to full production in the US of the expanded six Train facility at Canton and to complete the consolidation of the UK Recycling business to build a sustainably profitable business despite lower oil prices.

Whilst the US plant remained under construction for the first half of the year, oil sales were restricted in that region to traded oil (3.6 million litres) which was lower compared to the prior year as the business focus moved to re-commissioning the plant.  In Australia the business traded oil to maintain supply to key customers while the operations were transferred to the Southern Oil Refinery, however because of extended commissioning there was some sales disruption to the business during the transition resulting in a decline in volumes of 20%.

Overall volumes increased due to the acquisition of Eco-Oil on 1 April 2015.  On a like for like basis volumes declined by 16% due to the focus on higher margin business and the impact of the decline in oil prices on the collection cycle at the end of 2014 as suppliers retained their feedstock on the expectation of a price recovery through Q1. The UK Recycling business has suffered further margin compression as a result of the recent decline in world oil prices.  The business has successfully mitigated some of this impact by pushing down feedstock acquisition costs and following the acquisition of Eco-Oil has undertaken a significant restructuring exercise to bring down the fixed cost base for the combined business. Whilst some of these restructuring costs were incurred in H1 as noted below the impact of most of these changes will only materialise in H2 and further cost reductions will continue through Q3 and Q4.

*Excludes one off transaction costs of US$422,000 for the acquisition of Eco-Oil
 
Despite the acquisition of Eco-Oil during the year, the Group has reduced ongoing indirect overheads by 6% compared to the first half of 2014, driven by a reduction in Growth and other indirect employee costs. 
 
Exceptional and other items
 
In the half year, the Group accounted for a net charge of US$175,000 of exceptional and other costs.  This consists of:
 
·     Transaction costs related to the acquisition of Eco-Oil of US$422,000
·     Bargain purchase on the acquisition of Eco-Oil of US$847,000
·     Restructuring costs in the Recycling business of US$105,000 as the business restructured Eco-Oil and OSS.
·     Re-commissioning costs of US$115,000 in the US
·     Re-commissioning costs of US$380,000 in Australia
·     The cash associated with exceptional items in the period was an outflow of US$1,022,000

Net cash expended in the first six months of 2015 was a US$12.6 million outflow compared to a US$3.5 million outflow in the prior year comparable period. EBITDA was US$4.8 million lower and working capital outflows increased by US$1.8 million driven mostly by the build-up of feedstock in the US in anticipation of the production restart at Canton. Capital expenditure in the period was US$10.9 million, of which US$10 million related to the construction of the expanded plant in the US with the remainder of the lease facility being drawn against it of US$9.6 million. The remaining US$0.9 million primarily relates to the UK as the Group progresses its planning permission process in respect of the planned UK based re-refinery. The acquisition of Eco-Oil for US$3.6 million completed during the period. Overall, the Group held US$2.4 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period.  Under the terms of the arrangements with G&S, a further US$1.7 million should be received in H2 along with disposal proceeds arising from the restructuring of the UK businesses.
 
Risk management process
 
The Group has policies, processes and systems in place to help identify, evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisation. Risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by Business Unit or functional management teams. The executive team review the major risks across the Group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus. The Board review these at least twice a year.
 
The principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on our business in the future are set out on pages 20 and 21 of the 2014 Annual Report. The pace and execution of Canton ramp-up is the key performance imperative and short term financial risk for the Group.  The Annual Report can be downloaded at www.hydrodec.com

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM REPORT
 
1.    Basis of Preparation 
Hydrodec Group plc is the Group's ultimate parent company.  It is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.  The address of Hydrodec Group plc's registered office is 6 Hay's Lane, London, United Kingdom.  Hydrodec Group plc's shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group presents its financial statements in US dollars, as the Group's business is influenced by pricing in international commodity markets which are primarily dollar based.
These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors on 22 September 2015.
The interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2015, which are unaudited, do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. Accordingly, this condensed report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2014, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and any public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.
The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been reported on by the Group's auditors, received an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the registrar of companies at Companies House. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2015 have been drawn up using accounting policies and presentation expected to be adopted in the Group's full financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2015, which are not expected to be significantly different to those set out in note 1 to the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  As highlighted in the risk management section of the CFO's Report, a key underlying risk to this basis is the pace and execution of the ramp up of production at Canton. 
 
 
2.    Revenue and operating loss
 
2.1.  segment analysis
Following the acquisition of the principal assets and business of OSS Group Limited in September 2013 and now of Eco Oil Limited in April 2015, the Group now operates two main operating segments:
• Re-refining: principally the treatment of used transformer oil and the sale of SUPERFINETM oil
• Recycling: principally the collection and treatment of waste lubricant oil and the sale of recycled oil products
 
The financial information detailed below is frequently reviewed by the Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker).

Trading Update

RNS Number : 5112R HydroDec Group plc 12 December 2016  

12 December 2016
 
Hydrodec Group plc
("Hydrodec", the "Company" or the "Group")
 
Trading Update
 
The Company is pleased to provide a further update to the market in respect of 2016 performance and progress. 
 
Despite the general market environment remaining challenging, particularly from a margin perspective, the Company reported an overall positive EBITDA at Group level for October, the first month this has been achieved since re-establishing the Canton plant following the rebuild last year. 
 
The Company is also pleased to report that it delivered record sales of re-refined oil from Canton in October of over 2.8 million litres, as well as exceeding daily production records on two separate days in the same month. This reflects the improving operational performance of the new plant in addition to the hard work being undertaken to establish a strong position in the market.  
 
Commenting on the update, Chris Ellis, Chief Executive Officer of Hydrodec said: "In our half yearly report in September, I stated that we continued to make strong progress towards positive Group EBITDA in the second half of the year, and it is pleasing to be able report that this KPI was met for the month of October. Challenges remain in the current market environment to both improve margins and create consistent performance going forwards, but this is an important milestone on the path to establishing a profitable operation in 2017."

Notes to Editors:
Hydrodec's technology is a proven, highly efficient, oil re-refining and chemical process initially targeted at the multi-billion US$ market for transformer oil used by the world's electricity industry. MarketsandMarkets forecasts that the global transformer oil market is expected to grow from US$1.98 billion in 2015 to US$2.79 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 7.14%. Spent oil is currently processed at two commercial plants with distinct competitive advantage delivered through very high recoveries (near 100%), producing 'as new' high quality oils at competitive cost and without environmentally harmful emissions. The process also completely eliminates PCBs, a toxic additive banned under international regulations. Hydrodec's plants are located at Canton, Ohio, US and Bomen, New South Wales, Australia. 
 
Hydrodec's shares are listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. For further information, please visit www.hydrodec.com.

      Long Term U lity Contract Awarded
    

      The Company is pleased to report that its Australian opera on has been awarded a 5 year contract for the supply of inhibited transformer and switchgear oil by Essen al Energy, a major Australian u lity. The contract includes the collec on and re‐reﬁning of all generated PCB and non‐PCB waste oils and is expected to generate over 1 million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract. The contract was awarded under a compe ve tender process, with the Company successfully compe ng against a range of new oil suppliers. Under this contract, Hydrodec will become the sole supplier of new inhibited transformer and switchgear oil to Essen al Energy. The Company expects to start supplying oil under the new contract from September 2016.
    

      Commen ng on this success, Chris Ellis, Chief Execu ve Oﬃcer of Hydrodec said "I am hugely encouraged by this contract award as it is a signiﬁcant milestone in the evolu on of the Company's ac vi es. Although it will only make a modest contribu on at the Group level, it is a very signiﬁcant contract both locally and strategically. We are delighted that our re‐reﬁned transformer oil was successful in a compe ve tender and exceeded the technical product acceptance criteria. It is further evidence of the quality of our product and provides the basis to develop similar rela onships with other u li es in Australia and elsewhere."

Chief Executive's Report
 
After a particularly difficult 2015 for the Company, I am pleased to be able to report significant progress in delivering the Company's key objectives during the period under review, achieved against a challenging, yet improving, market backdrop.
 
Strategy
 
At the time of my appointment as CEO and the divestment of the UK recycling operations in March 2016, the Board restated its strategy to concentrate on the Group's market leading transformer oil re-refining technology and business and to grow that business to access an increasing proportion of the US$2 billion plus global transformer oil market. Specifically, the Board stated its intention, as the Company moves forward through 2016, to look to strengthen Hydrodec's footprint in the US and in the international transformer oil market, where the Board believes Hydrodec has a competitive advantage through its proven and market‐leading technology.
 
In line with this strategy, my focus has been to grow the transformer oil business in order to drive profitability, with a rigorous focus on execution when deploying our market leading transformer oil re-refining technology, making effective costs savings and delivering the ramp-up of production and sales in the US.

Operational review
 
-      USA
 
The main drivers in 2016 have been to refocus on the core transformer oil re-refining technology by optimising the performance of the Canton facility, and to increase production levels through a combination of leveraging the experience gained since fully commissioning the plant at the end of last year along with specific targeted operating improvements, building on lessons learned during the commissioning process. These improvements have been validated by the significantly lower number of production hours lost through unscheduled stoppages and the record monthly production performance of the plant in May of 2.82 million litres of SUPERFINE transformer oil and base oil.  Plant utilisation increased over the period, from an average of 64% in Q1 to 70% in Q2 with a peak of 76% in May and has averaged 68% through Q3 to date. 
 
These developments have supported total sales volumes in Canton in the period of 15.5 million litres. An additional primary objective relates to improving the sales mix between higher margin transformer oil and lower margin base oil produced at the Canton plant. At the beginning of the year, January transformer oil sales represented 19% of US volumes sold. Since then significant improvements have been made in this area and in June transformer oil represented 71% of sales, with further advances targeted. Growth in transformer oil sales have been supported by the SUPERFINE product achieving "500 hour" oil status, certifying the oil to be high quality transformer oil and a prerequisite to accessing the larger power transformer market.
 
Post period-end, in September, we announced that the American Carbon Registry ("ACR") had approved Hydrodec's patented technology as a carbon offset project in the voluntary carbon offset market, allowing the Company to generate, and monetise, carbon credits.  Hydrodec of North America ("HoNA") is now generating offsets through the re-refining of used transformer oil, which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner. The ACR has recognised 165,000 credits for HoNA's previous production between 2009 and 2014 and the Company anticipates that it will generate 50,000 to 60,000 tons of carbon offset annually going forward. Whilst the historical credits may only generate nominal sums through trading, the ongoing generation of such credits could realise up to US$5 per ton (source: Carbonomics).
 
-      Australia
 
In respect of the operations in Australia, since the commissioning of the plant at the Southern Oil Refinery in May 2015 we have had to work hard to re-establish our commercial position in the market. Total sales volumes in Australia for the period were 1.3 million.  In May, the Australian business enjoyed one of its highest feedstock acquisition months since 2012 and since then has consistently sourced feedstock at an optimal level to maximise its profitability going forward.  The focus is now on expanding the customer base and increasing the proportion of transformer oil sales.  
 
Post period-end, in August, we announced the award of a 5 year contract to supply SUPERFINE transformer oil to Essential Energy, a major Australian utility.  The contract includes the collection and re-refining of all their PCB and non-PCB waste oils and is expected to generate over 1 million litres of new transformer oil sales over the life of the contract. The contract was awarded under a competitive tender process, with the Company successfully competing against a range of new oil suppliers.  
 
-      Market background
 
In the US, leading producers of naphthenic speciality products, of which Hydrodec is one, have experienced lower margins due to high value inventory and lagging market prices from the impact of the first quarter crude price fall. Whilst the Group has been successful in improving margins since the first quarter, the Board expects margins to remain challenging for the second half of the year before improving into 2017, driven by improving product prices which lag recent increases in crude prices.  
 
In Australia, market demand and margin remain relatively stable and the key to margin and volume improvement will be based around leveraging the award of the Essential Energy contract to increase sales of transformer oil into the key utilities.
 
 
Financial review
 
Revenues from continuing operations increased 148% to US$8.1 million (H1 2015: US$3.3 million), reflecting the full commissioning of the Canton plant at the end of last year.  The Group sold 16.8 million litres during the period, an increase of 217% on the corresponding period in 2015 which had included 3.6 million litres of traded oil whilst the US business was being recommissioned. Of the volumes sold in the period, 40% represented transformer oil and 60% was base oil, with margins steadily improving since the beginning of the year.
 
There has been a key focus on the reduction of overheads and corporate costs. Significant reductions have already been realised with the expectation that the benefits from more recently implemented initiatives will filter through in H2.  These savings are reflected in the reduction in administrative expenses from continuing operations from US$6.1 million to US$3.9 million as highlighted below.

Group EBITDA from continuing operations improved from US$3.4 million loss (H1 2015) to US$1.1 million loss.  The total loss for the period (including discontinued operations) was US$5.3 million (H1 2015: US$8.4 million). 
Operating cash outflow (before working capital movements) reduced to US$2.0 million (H1 2015: US$5.8 million).  The improved EBITDA performance resulted in lower working capital outflows which reduced from $3.0 million to $2.4 million. Total net cash expended in the first six months of 2016 was US$0.2 million compared to a US$12.6 million outflow in the prior year comparable period. Overall, the Group held US$0.6 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the period and retained approximately US$1.4 million headroom under its working capital facilities provided by Andrew Black, a Director and the Company's largest shareholder.  
 
Disposal of UK recycling operations
 
In late 2015 and January 2016, the Company undertook a detailed strategic review of its UK waste oil collections business and proposed UK lubricant oil re-refining project, following a significant deterioration in its UK operations. This deterioration was driven predominately by the rapid decline in global oil prices and continued challenging market conditions which resulted in the UK business generating an increasing level of significant losses. Despite implementing extensive restructuring and cost-saving measures during 2015, Hydrodec remained exposed to the impact of the global oil price decline. Given the significant cash consumption and limited cash resources available to the Company (in the absence of a significant further fundraising), the Directors reviewed all available options and concluded that it was in the best interests of the Company to dispose of the UK operations. 
 
Following a strategic auction process conducted by an independent third party financial adviser, the Company sold its UK operations to Andrew Black, a non-executive Director and substantial shareholder (the "Buyer"), on 4 March 2016 for a consideration of £1 in cash, including the transfer to the Buyer of c. £1.2 million of existing third party indebtedness in the UK business and involving the injection by the Buyer of further working capital into that operation. In addition, the Buyer granted Hydrodec a contractual right to receive a proportion of the Buyer's entitlement to any future profits of the UK re-refining project on the following waterfall basis (a) first, the Buyer, as primary risk taker, to recover the costs of its investment in the UK re-refining project; (b) then, the next tranche to be applied 70:30 between Hydrodec and the Buyer respectively until Hydrodec has recovered its costs incurred to date in connection with the UK re-refining project; and (c) finally, the balance of any profits to be shared 90:10 between the Buyer and Hydrodec. The Buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the UK lubricant oil re-refining project going forward, with Hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these profit share arrangements. The UK re-refining project also offers a potential opportunity to develop transformer oil re-refining capacity in the UK. The impact on the Company of all of the above is described in note 12 to the interim financial statements.
 
Risk management process
 
The Group has policies, processes and systems in place to help identify, evaluate and manage risks at all levels throughout the organisation. Risks are regularly reviewed and monitored by business unit or functional management teams. The executive team review the major risks across the Group on a quarterly basis to ensure that the management of these risks has appropriate focus. The Board review these at least twice a year.
 
The principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on the Group in the future are set out on pages 12 and 13 of the 2015 Annual Report. The continued successful operation of Canton is the key performance imperative for the Group.  The Annual Report can be downloaded at www.hydrodec.com  
 
Outlook
 
Today's results confirm significant progress in the turnaround of the Company over the first half of the year.  Our key objective during the rest of the year is to strengthen margins as we grow market share and seek to leverage the recent carbon credit approval in the US, whilst continuing the program of cost reduction. Volumes and margins in Q3 to date remain consistent with Q2 and, with both operations now generating positive EBITDA, we continue to make strong progress towards positive Group EBITDA in the second half of the year.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM REPORT
1.     BASIS OF PREPARATION
Hydrodec Group plc is the Group's ultimate parent company.  It is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.  The address of Hydrodec Group plc's registered office is 6 Hay's Lane, London, United Kingdom.  Hydrodec Group plc's shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group presents its financial statements in US dollars, as the Group's business is influenced by pricing in international commodity markets which are primarily dollar based.
These consolidated condensed interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors on 15 September 2016.
The interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016, which are unaudited, do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. Accordingly, this condensed report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and any public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.
The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been reported on by the Group's auditors, received an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the registrar of companies at Companies House. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been drawn up using accounting policies and presentation expected to be adopted in the Group's full financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016, which are not expected to be significantly different to those set out in note 1 to the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
 
2.     ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Restatement of prior period balances
In preparing the six months ended 30 June 2016 financial statements, certain balances in respect of prior period (six months ended 30 June 2015) have been restated. 
·      The retranslation of certain reserve accounts has been reversed so as to present the reserve accounts at their historical position as at 1 January 2014. It has not been possible to restate back to the original opening position but any impact is within reserves and deemed immaterial.
·      In the Statement of Comprehensive Income, exchange differences on translation of foreign operations and capital contribution from non-controlling interests have been restated to show the reclassification of capital contribution of US$325,000 from non-controlling interests from other comprehensive income to transactions with owners. This has subsequently changed the figure for exchange differences from US$(417,000) to US$(399,000).
·      In the Statement of Financial Position, the carrying amount of the intangibles relating to the CEP license has been restated to reflect the US$953,000 write-off in the six months ended 30 June 2015 with the offset reflected in trade and other payables. This restatement has no impact to profit and loss. 
·      In finalising the fair value of assets acquired with the purchase of Eco-Oil for the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, the Directors had reviewed the estimates of fair value made initially and recorded on a provisional basis in the Group's interim accounts for the six months ended 30 June 2015. Consequently, the reassessed figures for intangible assets were determined to have no material value assigned at the date of acquisition. This was further supported by the subsequent sales.  
Certain other balances in respect of prior periods (six months ended 30 June 2015 and year ended 31 December 2015) have been restated without any overall impact on net assets. 
·      Presentation of Income Statement to show reclassification between continuing operations and discontinued operations.

On 4 March 2016, the Group disposed of Hydrodec (UK) Limited ("HUK") and Hydrodec Re-Refining (UK) Limited ("HRR") (together, the "UK Operations") and agreed to transfer certain other rights and assets relating to its UK Operations for a consideration of £1.
Terms of the disposal
 
The Company sold the UK Operations to Andrew Black (the "Buyer") for a consideration of £1 in cash, including the transfer to the Buyer of circa £1.2 million of existing third party indebtedness in HUK. In addition to this, the Buyer granted Hydrodec a contractual right to receive 10% of the Buyer's entitlement to any future net profits of the UK lubricant oil re-refining project on distribution or exit. The Buyer will bear all risk and responsibility for developing the UK lubricant oil re-refining project going forward, with Hydrodec retaining only a passive economic interest under these profit share arrangements. 
 
Related party transaction
 
Andrew Black is a Non-Executive Director and a substantial shareholder (as defined in the AIM Rules for Companies) of the Company.  Accordingly, the disposal of the UK Operations constitutes both a related party transaction and a substantial transaction for the purposes of the AIM Rules.
