Jun 21 17
Caltex Australia Ltd. provided unaudited earnings guidance for the first half ended June 30, 2017. For the period, the company expects HCOP after tax (including significant items) in the range of $250 million to $270 million, RCOP (excluding significant items) after tax in the range of $290 million to $310 million and RCOP (excluding significant items) before interest and tax in the range of $450 million to $480 million. The forecast 2017 half year result includes a product and crude oil inventory loss of approximately $40 million after tax. This compares with a product and crude oil inventory gain of $64 million after tax in the first half of 2016. Net debt at 30 June 2017 is forecast to be $700 million, compared with $454 million at 31 December 2016 and $693 million at 30 June 2016. This includes the impact of the recently completed $95 million Milemaker acquisition (9 May 2017), but does not include the proposed $325 million acquisition of Gull New Zealand, which remains subject to regulatory approval.

Kami merujuk kepada isu penamatan kontrak enam pengusaha stesen Caltex baru-baru ini. Pengusaha-pengusaha ini telah diberikan hak untuk mengendalikan stesen Caltex yang dimiliki oleh Chevron Malaysia. Penamatan kontrak pengusaha stesen Caltex ini adalah satu keputusan perniagaan, dan telah dilaksanakan mengikut terma dan syarat perjanjian di antara kedua-dua belah pihak, iaitu pengusaha dan Chevron Malaysia. Kami menghargai rakan kongsi perniagaan kami yang bekerjasama dengan kami dan secara majoriti, pengusaha-pengusaha Caltex kami telah memberi kerjasama sebagai satu pasukan dalam menangani sebarang isu atau masalah. Walau bagaimanapun, ini tidak semestinya berlaku dengan sesetengah pengusaha, walaupun usaha terbaik kami untuk menyelesaikan masalah secara baik dan dengan niat yang baik. Buat masa ini, kami sedang berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk melaksanakan proses penamatan secara aman dan mengikut terma dan syarat kontrak.

Kepada semua pelanggan setia kami, kami ingin memaklumkan bahawa stesen-stesen Caltex kami akan terus dibuka untuk anda seperti biasa! Kami ucapkan ribuan terima kasih atas sokongan anda!
//
We refer to the recent termination of contracts with six Caltex retailers. These retailers were granted a dealership to operate Caltex stations owned by Chevron Malaysia. The termination of retailer contracts is a business decision, and is carried out in accordance to the contractual agreement between the parties. We value partnerships that are collaborative and the majority of our retailers work as a team with us to address concerns. Unfortunately, this may not always be the case with certain retailers, despite our best efforts to resolve issues amicably and in good faith. At present, we are doing our best to carry out the termination process peacefully and in accordance with the contract.

To all our customers, we like to inform you that our Caltex stations will continue to serve you as usual! We thank you for your support.

About Caltex Australia
Cars, planes and ships have forever been symbols of freedom. They made freedom obtainable. Freedom is a powerful ideal, a feeling that is empowering and liberating. Freedom and convenience are ultimately about choice and the ability to control your own outcomes. Distance, perishability, quality, range and time are no longer restrictive forces in the marketplace. Business and consumers are in the now generation, and this ultimately drives absolute freedom of choice for everyone. It’s our ability to deliver on this that drives our business and leverages our deep capabilities in making big things happen easily, everywhere.Proudly Australian, Caltex have grown from humble beginnings to become the nation’s outright leader in transport fuels, supplying one third of all Australia’s transport fuel needs. Through a flexible fuel supply chain, they have forged a reputation for providing safe and reliable supply of high-quality fuels to a diverse number of customer segments, including retail, mining, agriculture, aviation, transport, small-to-medium enterprises, marine, automotive and government. Caltex are also one of Australia’s largest convenience retailers and franchisors, with over 85% of their stores operated by franchisees.





History
As an Australian company, with roots tracking back to 1900, they are the only Australian fuel and convenience brand listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.Caltex's long history began years ago when the all-Australian oil importer Ampol, was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in the late 1940s. Both Caltex and Ampol opened refineries in the 1950s and 1960s, and the two companies competed fiercely in the service station arena and oil product marketing industry. As time went on, Ampol acquired Total and Caltex went on to acquire Golden Fleece.Despite these developments, Caltex and Ampol were still relatively small. Eventually, their 1995 merger helped the company become the largest refiner-marketer in Australia.What sets Caltex apart from other refiner-marketers in Australia is that they're an Australian company that operates independently, with all decisions made by the management and the Board in Australia. Caltex are listed on the ASX and have around 3,500 employees working across the country.
