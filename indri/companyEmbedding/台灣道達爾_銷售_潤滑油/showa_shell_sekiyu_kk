History[edit]
Origins[edit]
In 1900, Samuel Samuel & Co, which had started in Japan in 1876 by Samuel Samuel as an international trading business in Yokohama, created an independent petroleum division. It subsequently set up Rising Sun Petroleum Co. Ltd (which later became Shell Petroleum) to expand its distribution channels of candles and kerosene for lamps.
Before long, Samuel Samuel & Co, which expanded as Shell Transport, merged with Royal Dutch to form Royal Dutch/Shell. Rising Sun Petroleum continued to expand its operations as the base of the Shell Group in Japan.
At the same time, oilfields were discovered in Japan along the coast of the Japan Sea primarily in Niigata Prefecture. Hayama Sekiyu and Niitsu Sekiyu, the predecessors of Showa Sekiyu, were established amidst the production of domestic petroleum.
20th century[edit]
In 1947, Rising Sun Petroleum was renamed Shell Sekiyu and resumed business. Starting with a capital agreement between the Shell Group and Showa Sekiyu, domestic oil companies deepened the collaboration with foreign oil companies, and before long were preparing to be a key industry to support the energy needs of the impending recovery period.
Shell Sekiyu and Showa Sekiyu, which had played crucial roles since the dawn of Japan's oil industry, merged in 1985 to form Showa Shell Sekiyu.

History and Current Refinery Capacity






Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. was established on January 1, 1985, by a merger of equals between Showa Oil Co., Ltd. and Shell Sekiyu K.K. The former was originally established on August 1, 1942, by consolidation amongst three companies: Hayama Oil, Asahi Oil and Niitsu Oil. In April 1949, Showa Oil Co., Ltd. received authorization from Japanese government as an oil distributor and made a return to the business after a respite in the World War II. In June 1949, Showa Oil concluded an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell Group for crude oil import and technical know-how exchange. This relationship was further strengthened in the form of equity participation to Showa Sekiyu K.K. by Royal Dutch Shell Group in June 1951.Shell Sekiyu K.K. started its history in Yokohama in early  Meiji era (around 1876) as an entity called Samuel Company, which was the precursor of  Shell Group in later years. On April 11, 1900, it  spun out its petroleum business section and named it  as Rising Sun Petroleum Company to  handle petroleum import and sales. After ceasing operations for several years around the World War II, it resumed operations in 1949 when Japanese government determined the privatization of petroleum distribution sector. Thus, the two companies had a very close relationship both financially and operationally even before the merger in 1985. In December 2016, Royal Dutch Shell Group withdrew 31.3% of Showa Shell equities out of 35% that it used to hold.
Current Refinery Capacity
The combined capacity of the three Group refineries (Yokkaichi Refinery of Showa Yokkaichi Sekiyu, Keihin Refinery of Toa Oil and Yamaguchi Refinery of Seibu Oil), is 445,000 barrels per day. Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. has introduced state-of-the-art technologies, including fuel oil hydro-desulfurization units, a residue fluid catalytic cracking unit, continuously-regenerated catalyst reforming units, a gasoline isomeration unit and a Flexicoker. At the same time, the company is also fully committed to safety and environmental protection.

Shell will retain a 1.80% holding in the company.           “The sale is consistent with Shell’s strategy to concentrate its Downstream footprint on a smaller number of assets and markets where it can be most competitive,” said John Abbott, Shell Downstream Director. “Idemitsu is an established and successful company and is well positioned to take up Shell’s shareholding.” Shell’s presence in Japan spans more than 100 years and it remains an important LNG market for Shell’s Upstream integrated gas business. It also remains an important market for Shell’s Downstream business conducted in partnership with Showa Shell, including lubricants, chemicals and trading. Shell will continue to license its brand to Showa Shell for use in its retail business. Other recent Downstream divestments include the sale of Downstream businesses in Australia and Italy; a number of retail sites in the UK; and the initial public offering of, and further drop downs to, Shell Midstream Partners L.P. Shell has also agreed the sale of its marketing business in Denmark and Norway and its LPG businesses in France. The transaction is expected to complete in 2016, subject to obtaining regulatory and contractual approval.

Showa Shell Posts Impairment Loss as Solar Frontier Profit Shrinks

Solar Frontier's new product for residential houses (source: Solar Frontier)



Showa Shell Sekiyu KK announced Feb 6, 2017, that it will register a fixed asset impairment loss (extraordinary loss) of ¥10.7 billion (approx US$94.4 million) for the consolidated results of the term ending in December 2016 in the wake of the business downturn of Solar Frontier KK (Minato-ku, Tokyo).

The profitability of Solar Frontier is drastically lowering due to the worsening of its business environment. According to Showa Shell Sekiyu, the fixed assets of the Kunitomi Plant in Miyazaki Prefecture, which is Solar Frontier's main factory, are showing a sign of an impairment loss. Therefore, Showa Shell Sekiyu decided to post an impairment loss of ¥10.7 billion for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2016, as an extraordinary loss.

Nevertheless, in the consolidated earnings of Showa Shell Sekiyu, the increase in the amount of the financial impact of inventory valuation caused by the higher-than-expected oil price, etc offset the extraordinary loss. As a result, Showa Shell Sekiyu's operating profit and ordinary profit are expected to be higher than the previous forecasts.

Solar Frontier's business environment is worsening mainly because the price of solar panels in overseas market is sharply dropping. China-based solar panel manufactures that have excessive production capacities are reportedly selling their products aggressively by cutting prices.

Solar Frontier recently built the Tohoku Plant, aiming to achieve "one of the world's highest cost competitivenesses" higher than that of the Kunitomi Plant. But it is not in full operation yet.

Therefore, Solar Frontier is making efforts to, for example, tap the market for residential panels in Japan, which is relatively profitable (See related article), by, for example, releasing a new product for residential use.
