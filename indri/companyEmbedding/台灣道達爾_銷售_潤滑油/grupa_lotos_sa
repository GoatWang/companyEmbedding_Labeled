Grupa LOTOS S.A. selects Axens technology for coker naphtha hydro

MOSCOW (MRC) -- The Polish company 
Grupa LOTOS S.A. has selected Axens to provide the technology license for a new 
Coker Naphtha Hydrotreater at its Gdansk refinery, said Plastemart.This 
contract is part of the Gdansk refinery development and modernization program 
based on heavy residue coking technology. The two-step Coker Naphtha 
Hydrotreating Unit, with a capacity of 152,000 tpa, is being designed to produce 
naphtha quality for petrochemical use. "Axens’ technology turned out to 
be the best one among those evaluated. This technology which meets our 
objectives is both simple and energy efficient" said Grzegorz Zgoda, Project 
Manager in Grupa LOTOS S.A. Axens has extensive experience in the diolefin 
hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization of cracked naphtha (FCC, Coker, 
Visbreaker, Steam-Cracker). Drawing on this large expertise, Axens offers a very 
efficient and commercially proven process with a choice of specific catalysts 
and operating conditions to ensure meeting the product specifications while 
maximizing the catalyst cycle length.As MRC wrote previously, 
Poland's state-controlled refiner Grupa LOTOS along with chemical producer 
Zaklady Azotowe Tarnow will construct a petrochemical plant in the country. The 
project will cost 5-6 billion zlotys (USD1.6-1.9 billion) and its construction 
is scheduled to begin in 2014 or 2015. The plant should be ready by 2018. The 
new plant would be adjacent to the Gdansk-based Lotos refinery and would use its 
products.Grupa LOTOS is one of the largest companies in Poland. It is an 
oil company operating both in Poland and abroad, whose business consists in the 
extraction and processing of crude oil, as well as wholesale and retail sale of 
high-quality petroleum products. Apart from Grupa LOTOS, which manages the 
refinery in Gdansk, the LOTOS Group currently comprises 15 other companies 
operating under the LOTOS name. One of them is based in Lithuania and another 
one in Norway.
