Dragon Crown Group Holdings Limited Provides Group Earnings Guidance for the Six Months Ended 30 June 2017
Jul 19 17
Dragon Crown Group Holdings Limited provided group earnings guidance for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The board of directors of the company announced that the shareholders and potential investors of the company that the group is expected to record a decrease in net profit for the six months ended 30 June 2017 by approximately 30% as compared to the six months ended 30 June 2016. Such expected decrease in net profit for the period is mainly attributable to: (i) the decrease in gross profit resulting from the decrease in the Group's revenue; (ii) the negative effect of depreciation of Renminbi against Hong Kong dollar; and (iii) the significant increase in tax expenses due to the expiry of the preferential tax treatment with 50% deduction in the corporate income tax of the company's major subsidiary in Mainland China since 1 January 2017.
