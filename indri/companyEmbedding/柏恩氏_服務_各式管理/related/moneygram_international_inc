MoneyGram and Walmart Launch New Walmart2Walmart Mexico Product for the $24 Billion a Year U.S. to Mexico Remittance Market








        DALLAS, Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI) announced today a new cross border money transfer product for Walmart customers sending from any U.S. Walmart location to any Walmart Mexico location. Walmart2Walmart Mexico powered by MoneyGram is a new service that offers customers a $6.50* transfer fee when sending between $51 to $800. Customers can send money from over 4,500 Walmart locations in the U.S. to more than 1,250 Walmart locations in Mexico; including all Bodega Aurrera, Mi Bodega Aurrera, and Superama locations.
      

        'Our new Walmart2Walmart Mexico product is a big positive and offers MoneyGram and Walmart customers exceptional service at a great value when they need to send money to friends and family in Mexico.  MoneyGram and Walmart work side-by-side each day to ensure our customers are receiving the financial services they depend on at an affordable price,' said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chief executive officer. 'This new product along with other recent MoneyGram and Walmart initiatives, demonstrates our shared commitment to each other and to making money transfers easier and more affordable for customers and their families in the U.S. and Mexico.'
      

        The U.S. to Mexico corridor is the largest country-to-country remittance corridor in the world. According to the World Bank, more than $24 billion was sent from the U.S. to Mexico in 2015.  Most customers make money transfers for family support purposes or special occasions such as religious festivals or emergency transfers. Forbes recently reported that in 2015 remittances overtook oil as the leading source of foreign income in Mexico.
      

        In addition to today's announcement, last month MoneyGram and Walmart launched the upgraded Walmart.Moneygram.com site built on the MTaaS platform (Money Transfer as a Service).  MoneyGram has since branded this new state-of-the-art online money transfer technology as 'MoneyGram Kameleon™'.  MoneyGram Kameleon extends the same innovative and convenient services as MoneyGram's award-winning website, moneygram.com, to business partners through a co-branded experience.
      

        Separately, with the recent expansion of Walmart's white-label U.S.-to-U.S. funds transfer product into higher transaction bands, MoneyGram is adjusting its money transfer pricing structure in these bands for U.S.-to-U.S. transactions originated at Walmart. The new pricing structure provides customers with a flat fee for all transfers between $900 and $2,500.
      

        *In addition to the transfer fee, a currency exchange rate may also apply. MoneyGram also makes money from currency exchange.

History[edit]
MoneyGram International was a result of two businesses merging, Minneapolis-based Travelers Express and Denver-based Integrated Payment Systems Inc. MoneyGram was initially established as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems and then became independent company before it was acquired by Travelers in 1998.[7][8] In 2004, Travelers Express became what is known today as MoneyGram International.
Travelers Express (1940–1997)[edit]
Minneapolis-based Travelers Express Co. Inc. was founded in 1940.[4] A subsidiary of Viad Corporation, it became the nation's largest provider of money orders before initiating a company reorganization plan in 1993.[9] By the late 1990s, MoneyGram Payment Systems had served customers at over 22,000 locations in 100 countries.[10][11]
MoneyGram Payment Systems (1988–1997)[edit]
MoneyGram was formed in 1988 as a subsidiary of Integrated Payment Systems Inc.[10][12][13] Integrated Payment Systems was a subsidiary of First Data Corporation, which was itself a subsidiary of American Express.[7] In 1992, First Data was spun off from American Express and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[7][11] First Data Corporation later merged with First Financial, the owners of rival Western Union.[7] In order to approve the merger, the Federal Trade Commission forced First Data to sell Integrated Payment Systems.[12]
In 1996, Integrated Payment Systems, the nation's second largest non-bank consumer money transfer business, became its own publicly traded company and was renamed MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc.[11][12] In 1997, James F. Calvano, former president of Western Union, became MoneyGram Payment Systems CEO.[10]
MoneyGram International Ltd. was established in 1997 by MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. a year after the company had gone public.[10] At the time when MoneyGram International was established, MoneyGram Payment Systems owned 51 percent of the company, while the other 49 percent was owned by the Thomas Cook Group.[14][15]
MoneyGram International (1998–present)[edit]
In April 1998, Viad acquired MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc.[8][16] for $287 million.[11] MoneyGram was then folded into Viad's Travelers Express in Minneapolis.[11]
In 2003, Travelers Express gained full ownership of the MoneyGram network, including MoneyGram International.[10] Later that year, Viad spun off Travelers Express as an independent company.[17] In January 2004 and Travelers Express was renamed to MoneyGram International Inc.[17][18] In June 2004, Viad sold MoneyGram and it became a publicly traded, individual entity.
By 2006, MoneyGram International had expanded internationally to include over 96,000 agents in regions such as the Asian-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and Central America.[10] The company had also introduced additional services such as bill payment and online money transfers.
During the financial crisis, MoneyGram's shares fell 96 percent from 2007 to 2009.[19] It lost more than $1.6 billion from investments in securities backed by risky mortgages in 2008, and the losses led the company to sell a majority stake to Thomas H. Lee Partners and Goldman Sachs in exchange for a cash infusion.[20] During the drop, U.S. Bancorp shifted its money transfer services to Western Union.[21] The company began to see profitability again in 2009.[21]
Amid MoneyGram's turnaround, Pamela Patsley became the executive chairman of the company in January 2009 and was later named CEO in September of that year.[22][23] In November 2010, MoneyGram officially relocated its global headquarters to the city of Dallas, Texas.[19][23] The company continues to maintain global operations and information technology centers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[19]
In 2013 Moneygram began considering a sale. In 2014, Moneygram lost a relationship with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and afterwards began a restructuring to cut costs. From their peak in 2013 until late 2015, shares fell about 70%.[24] Moneygram closed a Global Customer Care Operations center in Lakewood, CO resulting in over 500 layoffs. Furthermore, MoneyGram closed its 376-person Brooklyn Center operation in 2015.[25] Moneygram has offshored numerous positions to Warsaw, Poland from its Colorado and Minnesota locations for additional cost cutting.[26] In 2015, the company's agent network in Africa reached 25,000 locations, including an agreement with the Mauritius Post Office.[27][28]
Between late October 2016 and January 2017, Moneygram's shares doubled in value.[24] On January 26, 2017 , Ant Financial Services Group announced a deal to acquire MoneyGram International for $880 million. Approval still needed to be granted from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.[24]

Legal cases[edit]
In November 2012, MoneyGram International admitted to anti-money laundering and wire fraud violations.[30] MoneyGram services were used by unrelated parties involved in mass marketing and consumer phishing scams that defrauded thousands of victims in the United States.[31] As a part of the settlement, MoneyGram created a $100 million victim compensation fund.[32] MoneyGram also retained a corporate monitor who will report regularly to the United States Department of Justice for a five-year trial period. If MoneyGram fulfills its obligations under the settlement, prosecutors will seek dismissal of the charges of aiding and abetting wire fraud.[32] MoneyGram also terminated any agents complicit in the 2009 scams and invested more than $84 million in improvements to the company's consumer anti-fraud systems and consumer awareness education.[31] In February 2015, MoneyGram assisted a local Houston reporter in shutting down a fraud scam after discovering a scheme that utilized an account with the company.[33]
In February 2016, MoneyGram agreed it would pay $13 million to end a probe stemming from customer complaints that scam artists duped them into wiring funds via the money transfer service. The settlement, with attorneys general in 49 states and Washington, D.C., includes $9 million for a nationwide fund that will facilitate the return of money to some MoneyGram customers and $4 million to cover states' costs and fees, according to numerous announcements by state attorneys general.[34]
Philanthropy[edit]
