FIS Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results


Key facts

Raises full-year 2017 guidance
Announces share repurchase authorization of $4 billion
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.40, and Adjusted EPS was $1.02

JACKSONVILLE Fla., Aug. 2, 2017 – FIS™ (NYSE: FIS), 
a global leader in financial services technology, today reported that second quarter GAAP revenue increased 1.5 percent to $2,341 million from $2,305 million in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased to $359 million for the quarter, from $283 million in the prior year quarter, while operating income margin was 15.3 percent. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $132 million for the quarter, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $0.36 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. 
For the second quarter, organic revenue increased 2.3 percent. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $746 million for the quarter, from $696 million in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.8 percent. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $342 million for the quarter, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $0.90 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.


“We are pleased with our year-to-date performance, enabling us to raise our EPS guidance today,” said Gary Norcross, FIS president and chief executive officer. “Our intense focus on executing our strategic plan continues to deliver benefits to our clients and ongoing value to our shareholders.”

Segment Information

Integrated Financial Solutions (IFS):
GAAP revenue increased 2.5 percent to $1,181 million from $1,152 million in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue increased 2.6 percent. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $469 million from $447 million in the prior year quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.7 percent.

Global Financial Solutions (GFS):

Corporate / Other:
GAAP revenue declined 20.8 percent to $84 million compared to $105 million in the prior year quarter. Organic revenue decreased 17.8 percent. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $54 million and is inclusive of $75 million of corporate expenses.
Second quarter interest expense, net of interest income, was $87 million.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

As of June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $786 million and debt outstanding totaled $9.7 billion. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $74 million and free cash flow was $275 million.  


The Company paid dividends totaling $97 million in the second quarter.

Updating Full-Year 2017 Guidance

Due to the successful execution of the divestiture of our consulting businesses on July 31, 2017, recently announced financing activities, and year-to-date performance, the Company is updating full-year 2017 guidance as follows: 


Consolidated GAAP revenue flat to down 1 percent;

IFS GAAP revenue growth of 2 to 3 percent; and
GFS GAAP revenue flat to down 1 percent


Consolidated organic revenue growth of 2 to 3 percent;

IFS organic revenue growth of 3 to 4 percent; and
GFS organic revenue growth of 4 to 5 percent


Adjusted EBITDA of $3,030 million to $3,075 million
Adjusted EPS of $4.22 to $4.32, an increase from previous guidance of $4.15 to $4.30


Today the company is announcing that its board of directors has approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization, effective through December 31, 2020. The company’s revised full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance does not anticipate any share repurchase impact.


FIS has not provided a reconciliation of the foregoing forward-looking guidance to the most comparable GAAP measures for Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EPS because such measures are not available at this time without unreasonable efforts. The significant impact of the SunGard acquisition, including among other things, the timing and amount of integration and severance costs, and the transition of systems, facilities and personnel, make it difficult to provide meaningful and comparable GAAP guidance.

Webcast

FIS will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EDT) Wednesday, August 2, 2017. To access the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section of FIS’ homepage, www.fisglobal.com. A replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast. 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.


These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, constant currency revenue, organic revenue growth, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (including per share amounts), adjusted cash flow from operations and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.


We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’s core operating performance. The “constant currency” and “organic revenue” measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures, giving investors further insight into our core performance. Finally, the non-GAAP cash flow measures provide further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.

Adjusted revenue consists of reported revenue, increased to reverse the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment made upon the acquisition of SunGard. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting adjustments. The deferred revenue adjustment in purchase accounting was made entirely in the Corporate and Other segment; reported GAAP results for the IFS and GFS segments are not affected by this adjustment and, therefore, no adjusted revenue is presented for these segments.
EBITDA reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.

Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenue.

Constant currency revenue represents (i) adjusted revenue in respect of the consolidated results and the corporate and other segment and (ii) reported revenue in respect of the IFS and GFS segments, in each case excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.


Organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is further adjusted to exclude the impact of any acquisitions and divestitures by FIS during the applicable reporting period.


Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization, which is recurring.


Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or Adjusted EPS, reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.


Adjusted cash flow from operations reflects GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations, and excludes certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows.


Free cash flow reflects adjusted cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.


Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS web site, www.fisglobal.com.

Forward-Looking Statements

This news release and today’s webcast contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about anticipated financial outcomes, including any earnings guidance of the Company, business and market conditions, outlook, foreign currency exchange rates, expected dividends and share repurchases, the Company’s sales pipeline and anticipated profitability and growth, as well as other statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future, are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events and our future results, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Any statements that refer to beliefs, expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.


Actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to include, without limitation: 


the risk that acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will be more costly or more time-consuming and complex than anticipated; 
the risk that cost savings and other synergies anticipated to be realized from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; 
the risk of doing business internationally; 
changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts of terrorism, changes in either or both the United States and international lending, capital and financial markets, and currency fluctuations;
the effect of legislative initiatives or proposals, statutory changes, governmental or other applicable regulations and/or changes in industry requirements, including privacy regulations; 
the risks of reduction in revenue from the elimination of existing and potential customers due to consolidation in, or new laws or regulations affecting, the banking, retail and financial services industries or due to financial failures or other setbacks suffered by firms in those industries; 
changes in the growth rates of the markets for our solutions; 
failures to adapt our solutions to changes in technology or in the marketplace; 
internal or external security breaches of our systems, including those relating to unauthorized access, theft, corruption or loss of personal information and computer viruses and other malware affecting our software or platforms, and the reactions of customers, card associations, government regulators and others to any such events; 
the risk that implementation of software (including software updates) for customers or at customer locations may result in the corruption or loss of data or customer information, interruption of business operations, exposure to liability claims or loss of customers; 
the reaction of current and potential customers to communications from us or regulators regarding information security, risk management, internal audit or other matters; 
competitive pressures on pricing related to the decreasing number of community banks in the U.S., the development of new disruptive technologies competing with one or more of our solutions, increasing presence of international competitors in the U.S. market and the entry into the market by global banks and global companies with respect to certain competitive solutions, each of which may have the impact of unbundling individual solutions from a comprehensive suite of solutions we provide to many of our customers;
the failure to innovate in order to keep up with new emerging technologies could impact our solutions including the ability to attract new, or retain existing, customers; 
an operational or natural disaster at one of our major operations centers; and 
other risks detailed under “Risk Factors” and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and other filings with the SEC.



Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake (and expressly disclaim) any obligation and do not intend to publicly update or review any of these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
