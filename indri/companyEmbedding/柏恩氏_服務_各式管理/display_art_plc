                  designed LED display panels using large amount of LEDs and 
                  indicators including different type and size indicators in 
                  same project. Some of applications are building machinery 
                  operator panel screens, mixed sign indicators panels, indoor - 
                  outdoor LED displays, medical instruments LED displays, exchange 
                  board LED displays, timetable schedule boards, transport 
                  information systems, production information LED displays 
							digital clocks and etc. 
                  Comprehensive and simple process of developing of specific 
                  projects gives ability for very fast time to market and 
                  reduces cost of developing and production process.

            LED CONTROLLERS



             




     MCA2X16 are 
            fully integrated and cheap LED controller designed for driving all 
            kind of Common Anode LED displays and single LED's. These  
            products are very easy to use, simple and flexible in design, 
            providing low count of cables , low consumption, low cost, light 
            weight and small in dimensions. This LED controller is 
            suitable for wide range of applications. LED controller provides 
            all refresh cycles and logic operations, Light Intensity Control 
            (Global Intensity) using programmable PWM control, Power Supply for 
            logic, Power Anode Drivers and Serial Channel Buffers - LED drivers. LED 
            controller drive two independent LINES. Refresh rate is 100 Hz and provide excellent, free 
            flicker views of the designed LED display. Duty cycle of refresh is 
            1 to 10, providing maximal possible light intensity for driving 
            dynamic LED displays. Simple and 
            cheap external serial driver blocks - LED drivers, provides high current for 
            driving LEDs and low count of cables and interconnections between 
            PCB boards, low power consumption and heat losses of the custom 
            designed LED displays. Internal Download - Upload Character generator 
            takes ability of the user to dump directly decimal and hexadecimal 
            values for 7 segment displays and ASCII characters and strings for 14 
            -16 segment indicators without one byte additional software. LED 
            controllers provides additional useful information about level of 
            Power supply voltage (VIN), logic supply voltage (VCC) and room 
            Luminosity value for optimal PWM adjusting. LED controller accepts two 
                types of data HEXADECIMAL and ASCII strings and characters. 
            First type is decimal-hexadecimal bytes and blocks for transmitting 
            commands and driving seven segment displays.  Second type of data is 
            ASCII characters and strings for driving 14 -16 alphanumeric segment 
            indicators. After the command is completed, LED controller sends to 
            HOST message (selectable as LITERAL or HEX) for result of operation 
            and indicate that is ready to accept new command. Simple and low count
of command set is very easy to learn and use.  
            By this way can be designed 
            variety of graphic symbols and pictures to the LED display. 
MCA2X16 
                  is multifunctional LED Display Controller supports 
			three types of interfaces using wedge type  interface boards 
                  depending of specific application. This interface boards 
                  dramatically expand connection flexibility and amount of driven LED's. As 
                  example when is used CB485 interface board can be connected to 
                  single serial channel  up to 32 Slave LED controllers 
                  MCA2X16 that can 
                  drive total amount of 81920 single LED's. Each type 
                  of 
                  interface board is recognizing automatically from LED controller and 
                  initialize peripherals requirements.

MCA2X16 uses same command set lincluding one extra 
                  command for Slave select (applicable only with
                  CB485 board).

                  point to point connection with user systems, that maintain 
                  standard TTL level serial channel.  This interface board 
                  is very suitable for direct connection with microcontrollers 
                  and microprocessor boards without additional buffering. 
                  Signals are internally buffered (to the LED controller's side) 
                  and can be used tree wire cable that can be long up to few 
                  meters. Connectors are Cvilux tree pin HU3 crimp cable 
                  connectors.

    Selecting of LED drivers buffer 
            depends on the desired load current for selected indicators. This 
            technique enables ability of connection of different types of 
            indicators in each LINE to the same LED driver. Current for desired LED display can be 
            easily provided depending value of Input Voltage (VIN) and Technical 
            Data about Forward current for selected LED indicator using formula 
            and examples in  
            extbuf3.8.pdf. Actually each  LINE is constructed from 
            up to 16 serially connected 8 bit shift registers - LED drivers. Anodes of 
            indicators are directly connected to appropriate pins to Anode 
            connector. For more detailed information and downloads refer to

LED Lighting Facts® Products



                    Welcome to the LED Lighting Facts Product List! 
                    The searchable list includes LED luminaires and retrofit kits with verified performance information for each product.
                

Update 12.16.2016: Due to changes in the market as well as in replacement-lamp testing requirements, LED Lighting Facts is no longer listing replacement lamps, but luminaires and retrofit kits continue to be listed. 
                
Once you have narrowed your search criteria, click on the search button. You can further refine your search by clicking on the section headers. LED Lighting Facts expanded the characteristics by which a product can be defined; manufacturers have the option of confirming a product's mounting base, subcategory, size and use location. Some products may not include all of the characteristics and therefore may not appear in a search using additional criteria. The program encourages all manufacturers to review their listed products and apply the new designations.
