Oculus VisionTech Inc. Releases DPS2.0 Beta
Dec 6 16
Oculus VisionTech Inc. announced the release of a new version of its Cloud-based document protection system - DPS2.0 Beta. The new release is a significant upgrade to the previously released DPS1.0. The upgraded features of DPS 2.0 Beta include the way the application transfers data, which has been converted to a seamless streaming process. The use of streaming creates quicker and less [data] intensive transactions within servers that are key to future developments, especially the extension of the DPS platform to mobile use. The user interface has also been completely revamped to create a more user-friendly experience. DPS2.0 Beta features several key additions to the functionality of the Windows application for DPS. The improvements include changes to the core DPS application and the newly introduced Document Viewer, as described in further detail below. DPS: The DPS 2.0 Beta contains two online document protection and authentication features, namely Anti-Tampering and DoquTrace: The Anti-Tamper feature is the standard DPS feature that protects documents and imprints digital timestamps of QR Codes and customized logos onto the files. This feature is compatible with general document file formats. The DoquTrace feature protects documents by leveraging Oculus’ proprietary document tracking technology. DoquTrace is compatible with all general document file formats, as well as image file formats. Other features of DoquTrace include: The option to specify protection start and end dates. Providing tracking information whenever a document is opened, which information can be accessed from Oculus servers. Authentication service, which automatically detects the protection technology used on documents and properly applies the selective algorithms for authentication.

Cyber Document Protection
Anti-Tamper and DoquTrace protection









Protection

Watermarking creates a “protected copy”, which becomes the true master document. This master document is carried within the file so there is no need to use an external source for verification.








Document Anti-Tampering

Anti-Tamper Cloud DPS is based on protecting documents with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm and then comparing the original protected document with a returned document








DoquTrace

Documents protected with DoquTrace can provide dynamic access control to the document. Give control to who will have access to the document and when.

VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2016 / Oculus VisionTech Inc. (the "Company" or "Oculus") (TSX.V: OVT; OTCQB: OVTZ) is pleased to announce that, subsequent to the successful completion of alpha testing of its Cloud-based Document Protection System (DPS) technology and the commencement of field trials of the document protection features of the Company's Cloud-DPS technology (see news release of February 9, 2016), the Company is in the process of implementing its proprietary watermarking technology to its new photo DPS product that will offer online, Cloud-based security for documents in general, and that can be optimized for digital photographs in particular, and which is invariant to document/photo file format (and subsequently to today's image/video CODECs).
The technology underlying the photo DPS product is on proprietary scanning technology that allows a digital picture to be scanned with an "image understanding" algorithm that identifies and extracts prominent image features. The Company's proprietary DPS technology is based on protecting documents with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm and then comparing the original protected document with a returned document. If a document has been tampered with, the DPS document authentication feature will highlight the tampered locations in the document.
The initial goal of the photo DPS product will be to evaluate and confirm the digital photograph/picture authentication process, as well as the product's ability to preserve the robustness and resilience of returned information, while minimizing false positives. Assuming successful validation, the Company expects to release a commercial version of the photo DPS system and begin nation-wide product field testing in the United States, during the second quarter of 2016.
Tom Perovic, a director of the Company, who is overseeing the testing and launch of the Company's Cloud-DPS technology stated, "The offering of an online photo/picture DPS product will allow Oculus to open another vertical market, the social media market, which we expect will be another revenue-generating product for Oculus."
About the Oculus Cloud-DPS Technology
The Oculus Cloud-DPS is an Internet-centric, Cloud-based web service for document tamper-proof protection and authentication. The first step is taking a document in digital form and protecting each page with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm, and returning an image-based protected PDF document. The document is also encrypted to provide access control security. In the second step, the Oculus Cloud-DPS document authentication feature takes in the protected PDF document and returns authentication results. If the document was tampered with, the returned pages will highlight the tampered locations. Cloud-DPS technology is intended to protect high-value, sealed documents against any malicious tampering or forgery. Vertical target markets for high value documents have been identified as personal, real estate and corporate legal contracts, personal last wills, medical records, law enforcement records or financial institutions and government issued documents. The following document formats are accepted by the Cloud-DPS: *.doc, *.docx, *.xls, *.xlsx, *.xps, *.pdf, and *.jpg.
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

	Overview



	 


	Oculus VisionTech Inc. is a Canadian-based development-stage technology company that

	designs and markets digital marking technology to business customers.



	 


	We have also developed a Cloud-based Document Protection System (Cloud-DPS) technology that allows us to offer a Cloud-based Internet service for document tamper-proof protection and authentication that allow us to leverage our digital watermarking technology.


	 


	Historically, we have used our digital watermarking technology for streaming video content distribution based on embedded digital watermarking, as well as video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity. We developed a number of specific products and services based on these technologies. These include MediaSentinel™ and SmartMarks™, a process that watermarks digital video content; StreamHQ™, a collection of source-to-destination media delivery services marketed to businesses; EncodeHQ

	™


	, a service that digitizes and compresses analog-source video; hardware server and encoder system applications under the brand name Hurricane Mediacaster™


	; ZMail™


	, a service that delivers web and rich media content to targeted audiences, and mediaClix™


	, a service that delivers content similar to Zmail™


	but originating from an existing web presence.



	 


	We were incorporated on April 18, 1986, as "First Commercial Financial Group Inc." in the Province of Alberta, Canada. In 1989, our name was changed to "Micron Metals Canada Corp.", which purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of USA Video Inc., a Texas corporation, in order to focus on the digital media business. In 1995, we changed our name to "USA Video Interactive Corp." and continued out of the Province of Alberta into the State of Wyoming. At a shareholders meeting held on December 30, 2011, a resolution was passed to change our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." and to alter our share capital by way of a reverse stock split (share consolidation) on the basis of fifteen old common shares for one new common share. On January 25, 2012, we changed our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." and completed the reverse stock split. We have one wholly-owned subsidiary, USVO Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut.

	Business Environment and Market Opportunity




	 



	We have recognized that Internet-based, digital document security/protection products are a business opportunity for the Company that allow us to apply our proprietary real-time digital video watermarking technology, which was developed for studios and networks in the entertainment industry, to the digital document security/protection sector. Our Cloud- DPS technology introduces the Company to the online, digital document security/protection industry and possible vertical markets that exist in the sector, including the ability to confirm the authenticity of online documents and photographs distributed through traditional wireline networks or over wireless smart devices.

	 



	 


	Our Cloud-DPS secures and protects digital documents (including text documents, photos, blueprints, etc.) from any modification, and/or attempted forgery. It works by imperceptibly watermarking documents, using real-time image processing and watermarking algorithms, embedded into a secured/protected copy of a document. This protected copy is designed to resist any attempts to alter or forge the document by forensically tracking and deterring any attempts to tamper with the document. The watermarking algorithms are able to ascertain whether a document is protected by our DPS technology and if any attempts to modify or tamper with the document occurred. Any such modifications will be flagged, time stamped, and can be spatially highlighted in the document where any tampering occurred. This authentication and verification process ensures the integrity of the original document.


	 



	Strategic Plan



	 


	Our strategic plan is to use our proprietary digital watermarking technology to offer a Cloud-based Internet service for document tamper-proof protection and authentication. We expect to continue our focus on developing our Cloud-DPS technology and, overtime to switch our focus away from video-on-demand (VOD) systems and the associated products and services.


	 


	We believe that our Cloud-DPS technology is superior to the products offered by our competitors, which do not rely on a file invariant watermarking system (as opposed to a system that supports different file formats, such as Microsoft Office, Open Office, etc., by employing handlers for each document file format.). In order for a non-file invariant system to be used successfully for a variety of documents, it must be capable of handling and working with all present and future file formats, whereas our DPS solution relies on the PDF (portable document format) document format to create a format invariant watermarking system. PDF document readers are freely available and widely popular. All the incoming documents can be converted into PDF images and protected with an image understanding algorithm, while the PDF document layout is preserved.


	 


	Going forward, we plan to licence our Cloud-based Document Protection Services (Cloud-DPS) to select document distributors and allow these distributors to expand their Cloud-based service offerings for end-customers. We expect to differentiate the Cloud-DPS from our competitors on the basis of its core tamper-proof technology and by providing a superior process workflow and mobile user experience for document protection, processing and management for business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) customers. We also plan to develop our Cloud services and workflows to enable the mass market mobile users access these technologies while processing, storing and sharing their sensitive documents.


	 



	Proprietary Technologies



	 


	Our previous video-on-demand (VOD) systems, source-to-destination digital media delivery solution were based on our proprietary rich media delivery infrastructure and software and our Store and Forward Video-on-Demand patent. This patent expired in February of 2010. Subsequently, we have elected not a patent our Cloud-DPS technology.



	5




	 



	 


	Our proprietary document protection technologies include digital watermarking based document tamper-proofing for all types of documents. The objective is providing document originators and users the confidence that a subject document is authentic and has not been forged.


	 


	Our main technology differentiator is content-based document protection, which involves searches for robust, invariant document/image segments. This proprietary document "recognition" technology is a file format invariant watermarking system, and is subsequently fundamentally different from today's document data encrypted schemes, stored in different file formats-containers. The key feature of our DPS technology are:


	 




	 



	●




	Our DPS technology "personalizes" protected documents, based on their content, thereby creating a format invariant watermarking system. A document, converted into a PDF document is encrypted before delivery, such that it cannot be opened without providing proper credentials. The result is that a document watermarking system can be offered as a cloud-based software service that can:

	Our DPS technology combines the access control security for electronic documents, forensic grade anti-tampering technology based on the document's content "understanding", and data storage (optional) into a single, unique solution. Because of its cloud-based scalable system architecture, the DPS has a potential to expand and grow into a complete document management, security and storage eco-system, offered in a flexible and cost-effective web service model.






	 




	Products and Services



	 


	Currently, our principal product is our proprietary digital watermarking document protection technology.


	 


	Our Cloud-based web service system architecture enhances already existing storage and collaboration solutions such as Google Drive, DropBox, Box.com and others by adding document tamper-proof protection and workflows such as document sign-offs, authentication, secure distribution and collaboration. We believe that this will allow our DPS technology to be deployed and scaled in wide range of vertical markets such as:

	Customers and Markets



	 


	On January 28, 2015, we received notice that our sole software license agreement dated November 13, 2006 for customized deployment of our proprietary watermarking technology to one of the industry's major Hollywood studios was to be terminated effective January 31, 2015.


	 


	We currently have no customers for our products and services. We are taking steps to monetize our Cloud-DPS technology. These steps include actively seeking licensing initiatives. Our DPS architecture is designed as a web service, which allows for an easy customization to individual customer needs. The main customization effort is reduced by our creation of well synchronized interfaces to a potential customer's infrastructure. This feature will allow us to offer "white label" licensing of our DPS technology.


	 


	The principal market for our products services are businesses requiring digital documents protection, authentication and storage. For example, digital watermarking technology may be required by copyright-owning content providers who have concerns about the authenticity and forgery protection of their documents. Potential business users and areas of our products include:


	 




	 



	●





	Legal Contracts


	 – We plan to offer a secured contract protection services to online legal content distributors, and directly to legal firms from our data center. This will require us to launch our Legal DPS differently, disruptively and globally for the mass market rather than joining the list of local vendors in this segment.

	 









	 



	●





	Real Estate Contracts


	 – A special case of the above service, real estate is a large and unique market where we can provide streamlined efficient contract signing and sharing service among buyers, sellers, agents and lawyers related to a deal. We believe that many of the cumbersome, manually signed contracts today could become paperless and be signed off from mobile. Real estate title registration in the United Stated by First American Title, Fidelity National Financial and alike are potential customers, because the tamper-proofing protection of their title documents is crucial and including millions of documents a year.








	 



	●





	Healthcare Records Management System


	 – This vertical market requires secure sharing of patient data among healthcare service providers, the patients, and the healthcare insurers. We expect to develop B2B projects with selected healthcare providers that require secure and standard complying health records management.








	 



	●





	Government Documents Management


	 – We expect this vertical to be similar to the Healthcare vertical applications in serving citizens, businesses, and vendors.








	 



	●





	Engineering Specs Protection


	 – Manufacturing and engineering companies are required to store, manage and share their secured files with vendors and developers. We intend to offer secured cloud storage for tamper-proof documents.








	 



	●





	Financial Institutions


	have a great deal of account related files, agreements and transaction records that may require tamper-proof protection. We intend to pursue large opportunities in this vertical market and be open to licensing servers in these institutions' data centers.








	 



	●





	High Security Organizations


	 – Similarly to Financial Institutions, these organizations would require our DPS installed in their data centers. This complicates the update and maintenance of these servers and hence makes this difficult market even less attractive for us. We will monitor opportunities in this vertical market.

	Materials and Supplies



	 


	We are in the process of migrating from a server-based environment into a Cloud web-based environment. Eventually, we expect to host a digital cloud in our own data center. We plan to assemble our cloud server hardware from components manufactured by others. We will specify, procure, assemble, test and deploy the various system components (servers, routers, solid-state memory blocks) according a set of procedures that we will develop for this. We have started preliminary consultations with companies that supply the major components and materials needed to build and expand our Cloud systems. Cloud components can be programmed and configured to meet a wide variety of different vertical markets requirements. We will procure the materials and hardware to assemble our Cloud from various companies, as needed, and in sufficient quantities to preclude any danger of significant sourcing problems in the immediate future. There are no seasonal limitations on our operations.


	 


	We plan to launch the OVT Cloud with main set of features, as follows:

	Competition




	 



	To successfully launch our products and services and derive revenues from our technology, we face competition from a number of competitors with more established products and services in our sector. Potential competitors include:


	 



	1. Digi-Sign


	, which markets Cloud-based application programming to document creating companies, offering them digital signatures. Their business model is similar to ours. While a potential competitor, we are contemplating offering a product that complements Digi-Sign's technology, otherwise we will have to provide our own document signing and protecting workflows and solutions. The principal differences between the Digi-Sign solution and our solution are that we offer (i) document tamper-proof protection for high-value documents; (ii) simple and fast mobile user experience; (iii) B2C consumer collaborative repository of contracts, signed and sealed, in the Cloud.



	 



	2. Altavion/NexStamp


	, a California based developer of document and human authentication technologies. The company developed Digital Stamping Technology for document authentication filling a void in the standard Digital Signature Technology area. This technology alleviates the burden of proof of forgeries made to documents. The company grows through franchises in various countries.



	 



	3. MarkAny


	from South Korea released in 2001 e-Page SAFER™, the world's first solution designed to prevent document forgery. The solution has improved public administration services and helped move the age of e-government forward in Korea. MarkAny also developed Content SAFER, a digital rights management platform that has contributed to the development of Korea's content industry by creating a secure environment for the distribution of content through the protection of multimedia content copyrights. MarkAny develops a technology for 3D parts protection from copying.



	 



	4. ContractWorks.com


	is the newest member of the SecureDocs, Inc. from California. ContractWorks provides contract management software services from the Cloud that focuses on usability and a simple user interface. They provide secure storage and visible watermarking feature to protect documents. Their pricing is $400 a month for unlimited secure storage of contracts.



	 



	8




	 



	 


	Most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories in the document protection industry, larger customer bases, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, larger, well-established and well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with on-line competitors as the use of the Internet-centric, Cloud-based cyber document security services increases. In addition, cyber document security and cloud document management technologies and the expansion of existing B2B and B2C document protection technologies are expected to result in additional competition.


	 



	Research and Development



	 


	Our current research and development is focused on the evolution of our digital watermark technology. We redirected our Wavelet development and other image processing methods toward the creation of an adaptive, content-dependent document protection technology that is grounded in similar science as Wavelet compression. Products currently in development include:

	Android App






	In order to use DPS as a stand-alone product, it needs to have a front end interface. For wider acceptance, the front-end application needs to be implemented on smartphone devices. In this release, an app will be created for Android platform, which will be available in the Google Play store.




	 



	●





	Photo Protection

	We plan to create a stand-alone product that allows user to protect the documents from their own favourite apps by simply printing the document to Oculus Virtual Printer. This product will only be available on Microsoft Windows Desktop platforms.




	 



	●





	iOS (iPhone App)






	We plan to address DPS front end capability as well by supporting the iOS platform and by creating iPhone App. DPS will then be capable of running the front-end apps on Windows Desktop, Android and iOS platform, allowing us to cover all of the major platforms available.


	 


	During fiscal 201

	6 and 2015, our research and development expenditures were $240,370 and $138,431, respectively.




	 




	Intellectual Property



	 


	Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely upon patents, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services.


	 


	On June 19, 2001, United States Patent Application No. 09/884,787, "


	Method and Apparatus for Digitally Fingerprinting Videos

	", was officially filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This patent is for "

	MediaSentinel


	™



	". This patent expired in February of 2010. At this time, we have elected not to patent our Cloud-DPS technology.

	Laws and Regulations



	 


	Our operations are or may be subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the marketing of products and relationships with data protection, intellectual property protection, the export of technology products to certain countries and privacy protection. Although we believe that we are compliance with all federal, provincial, state and local regulations, the risk of claims and actions against us for breach of the aforesaid laws cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of a breach of these laws, we could be held liable for any damages that result. The amount of such damages could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


	 



	Employees



	 


	We currently have no employees. We engage independent contractors to provide services as necessary. Compensation for current and future work will be conducted on a contract basis.

	 



	 


	The loss of the services of any key management could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the life of its officers. In addition, our future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to hire, train, motivate and retain key senior management and skilled technical and marketing personnel. Competition for technical personnel in the industry we compete in is intense. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to contract, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we have had limited success in recruiting qualified contractors, but there is no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. Attracting qualified expertise is contingent on raising sufficient working capital and project advancement.

	Risk Factors.







	Our business and operations a

	re subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that harm our business, financial condition or operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operations could suffer.




	 




	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate

	our business and prospects.





	 


	We have a very limited operating history in the context of document protection products and services and have yet to develop an extensive record regarding the sale of our products and services. As a result, our ability to accur

	ately forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to:



	 




	 



	•




	maintain or develop relationships with suppliers and marketing partners;

	retain and motivate qualified personnel.





	 




	 



	•




	In addition, we have and will continue to be subject to the risks and unc

	ertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to market factors, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business could suffer.






	 





	We have incurred substantial losses; we expect to incur losses in the future, and may never achieve profitability.





	 


	To date, we have not generated a profit or significant revenue from operations and in fact have incurred substantial loss

	es. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we maintained $321


	,556 of negative working capital but sustained a net loss of $453


	,240 and had an accumulated deficit of $40,779


	,853


	.



	 


	We intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources o

	n the development of our proposed products and services, and other aspects of our business. As a result, we expect operating losses and negative cash flows to increase for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We may be unable to do so. If our revenues grow more slowly than anticipated or if operating expenses increase more than expected, or are not reduced sufficiently, we may never achieve profitability. Because of factors discussed in this paragraph, our auditors, in their report on our financial statements, have expressed substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.



	 



	 





	If we are unable to obtain substantial additional financing, we may not be a

	ble to remain in business.





	 


	We require substantial working capital to fund our business. We have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since the inception of our current business and expect to continue to do so for the for

	eseeable future. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including our ability to establish and expand a client base, to grow our sales and to employ effective marketing efforts. Our capital needs will also be influenced by the rate of market acceptance of our products and services.



	 


	We expect that we will require approximately $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 in financing to meet our working capital needs for the remainder of 201

	7 and further financing thereafter. If our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional financing. We have no arrangements or commitments for any financing. Financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to further develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, or ultimately, to remain in business.

Our current market share is insignificant.



	 


	The document protection market is currently dominated by a small number of larger companies, including Di

	gi-Sign, Altavion/NexStamp, MarkAny and ContractWorks.com. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, stronger brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, larger, well-established and well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with on-line competitors as the use of the Internet-centric, Cloud-based cyber document security services increases. In addition, cyber document security and cloud document management technologies and the expansion of existing B2B and B2C document protection technologies are expected to result in additional competition.

	We are subject to rapid technological change, which could render our products and services obsolete.




	 


	Our future success will depend in part o

	n our ability to offer products and services that incorporate leading technology and address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers. Our market is characterized by rapidly changing and unproven technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and frequent new service introductions. These changes and developments may render our products and technologies obsolete in the future. As a result, our success depends on our ability to adapt to these changes, particularly to develop new products and services, adapt our current products and services or to acquire new products and services that can compete successfully. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.

	In addition, future advances in technology may not be beneficial to or compatible with our business and we may not be able to incorporate technological advances into our products and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Keeping pace w

	ith technological advances may require substantial expenditures and lead time, particularly with respect to acquiring updated hardware and infrastructure components for our systems. We may require additional financing to fund such purchases. Any such financing may not be available on commercially reasonably terms, if at all, when needed and may result in a loss of earnings and market share.



	 




	We are dependent upon vendors and other third party service providers, and will be competing with some of these comp

	anies.





	 


	We are, and will continue to be dependent on vendors and other providers to supply the hardware, software and co-location resources that comprise our products and services. We have no long-term or exclusive contracts or arrangements with any of t

	hese vendors or providers. We cannot be certain that our current and proposed vendors and service providers will continue to do business with us or that we will be able to establish relationships with new vendors and service providers if necessary. If we are unable to establish and maintain satisfactory relationships and arrangements with these third parties, our business could be harmed. In addition, we will be dependent upon our third party vendors and other suppliers to adequately test their products before release, and to provide support for their products after delivery. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.



	 


	Further, we currently compete with, and expect to compete with in the future, providers of some of our technolog

	y or system components. If we are unable to effectively balance our need to cooperate and compete with these companies, our business may be harmed.



	 




	Our services are complex and we may not be able to prevent defects that could decrease their market accept

	ance, result in product liability or harm our reputation.





	 


	Our document security, digital water marketing and streaming media products and services are complex, and the steps we take to ensure that they are free of errors or defects, particularly when fi

	rst introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, may not be successful. We cannot guarantee that current versions or enhanced versions or our products will be free of significant software defects or bugs. Despite our testing, and testing by our third-party vendors and providers, current or future products may contain serious defects. Serious defects or errors could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance of our products and could seriously harm our business and operating results. Errors in our products may be caused by defects in third-party hardware or software incorporated into our products. If so, we may be unable to fix these defects without the co-operation of these third-party providers. Because these defects may not be as significant to these providers as they are to us, we may not receive the rapid co-operation that we may require. Errors, defects or other performance problems with our products could also harm our customers' businesses or result in potential product liability claims. Even if unsuccessful, a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming, costly and harmful to our reputation. Nor can there be any assurance that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any successful claim.

	Any loss of our personnel or inability to acquire new personnel could harm our business.




	 


	Our continued operations and future success relies significantly on the continued services and performance of our senior management. The

	loss of the services of any member of our senior management team could cause significant disruption in our business. We have no long-term employment agreements with senior management, do not currently maintain any "

	key person

	" life insurance and have no employees. As such, our future success depends on our ability to retain current senior management and to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, operations, customer service, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. The failure to retain and attract the necessary personnel could impede our future success.



	 




	Failure to maintain

	effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting.





	 


	Effective internal controls

	are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our's operating results could be harmed. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, regardless of whether the Company is required to maintain such controls, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's share price. Although the we are not aware of anything that would impact its ability to maintain effective internal controls, we have not obtained an independent audit of the Company's internal controls and, as a result, we are not aware of any deficiencies which would result from such an audit. Further, at such time as the Company is required to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may incur significant expenses in having its internal controls audited and in implementing any changes which are required.

	Our sales were $

	-0- in 2016 and $5


	,500 in 2015. One customer accounted for 100% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The contract with this customer expired at the end of January 2015 and was not renewed. We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. The inability to increase the number of customers could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share, or could cause revenue to drop quickly and unexpectedly.



	 




	Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property.




	 


	We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents, trade s

	ecrets, trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees and third parties. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we have proprietary rights over. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources with no assurance of success and could seriously harm our business and operating results.



	 




	Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, causing us to incur significant costs or

	prevent us from licensing our products.





	 


	Other companies, including our competitors, may have or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or license our products. We cannot be certai

	n that our products do not and will not infringe patents or the proprietary rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings, including claims of alleged infringement by others of the intellectual property rights of third parties. If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to or are unable to license the infringed technology on commercially reasonable terms, our business and operating results could be significantly harmed. Companies in the technology sector are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. Although we are not currently subject to any litigation or claims, any future claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:



	 




	 



	•




	cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property;





	 




	 



	•




	o

	btain a license from the rights-holder or owner of the infringed intellectual property, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or

	If we are forced to take any of these action

	s, our business could be substantially harmed.



	 




	Our success depends on the continued growth in demand for e-business applications.




	 


	Our primary business strategy involves the development of products and services that enable users to transmit video over

	the Internet. As a result, our future sales and any future profits will be substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as an effective medium of business by consumers and businesses. To be successful, consumers and businesses that have historically used traditional means of commerce to transact business must continue to accept and utilize the Internet as a medium for conducting business and exchanging information. Consumers and businesses may reject the Internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons, including potentially inadequate network infrastructure, slow development of enabling technologies, insufficient commercial support and privacy concerns. In addition, delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity or increased government regulation could cause the Internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium. If the demand for e-business applications does not grow or grows more slowly than expected, demand for our products and services would be reduced and our revenue would suffer.



	 




	Government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs and risks to doing business on the Internet.




	 


	We are not currently subj

	ect to direct regulation by any governmental agency, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally, export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet covering issues such as: user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution and characteristics and quality of products and services.



	 


	Furthe

	rmore, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the Internet or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.



	 


	The applicability of existing laws to the Internet, property ownership, cop

	yrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, export or import matters, obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes to such laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed changes, could create uncertainty in the Internet marketplace. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs.

	Our share price has been and could be highly volatile, which could result

	in substantial losses to investors.





	 


	The trading price of our common shares has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors including variations in quarterly operating

	results, new products or services offered by us or our competitors, conditions or trends in the Internet and online commerce industries, changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other Internet and online service companies, and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related and technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including large price drops in 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2003, 2002 and 2001, that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against affected companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.



	 




	We have not paid cash dividends in the past and does not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited

	We have never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its capital stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on the Company's capital stock will

	depend on its earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting the Company at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, its common shares may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the common shares price appreciates.

	The trading market for the

	Company's securities could depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about Oculus' business and the Company. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover the Company's securities. If securities analysts do not cover the Company, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market prices of the Company's common shares. If the Company is covered by securities analysts, and its securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the prices for the Company's securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause its share price and/or trading volume to decline.



	 




	Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change in control of the company.




	 


	Our articles of continuance and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions

	that could discourage, delay or even prevent an acquisition of our company at a premium price or at all. Any of these provisions might prevent the market price of our common shares from increasing in response to takeover attempts, and could prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common shares.



	 




	We intend to issue additional equity securities, which may dilute the interests of current shareholders or carry rights or preferences senior to the common s

	We intend to issue additional equity securities in order to raise working capital. Accordingly, existing shareholders may experience additional dilution of their percentage ownership interest in our company. In addition, the new equity securities

	may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing common shares.



	 




	The exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of common shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares will dilute the ownership

	interests of the Company's current shareholders and may adversely affect the future market price of the Company's common shares.





	 


	We may use stock options, stock grants and other equity-based incentives, to provide motivation and compensation to our offi

	cers, employees and key independent consultants. The award of any such incentives will result in an immediate and potentially substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could result in a decline in the value of the Company's share price. The exercise of these options and the sale of the underlying common shares and the sale of common shares issued pursuant to stock grants may have an adverse effect upon the price of the Company's common shares.

	Our bylaws contain provisions that limit the liability of directors for monetary damages and provide for indemnification of officers and directors. These provisions may discourage sha

	reholders from bringing a lawsuit against officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duty and may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors even though such action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited the shareholders. In addition, a shareholder's investment in Oculus may be adversely affected to the extent that costs of settlement and damage awards against officers or directors are paid by Oculus pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the bylaws.



	 




	Requirements of the SEC with regard to low-priced "penny stocks" may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market.




	 


	"Penny stocks" are low-priced, and usually highly speculative, stock selling at l

	ess than $5.00 per share. Our securities are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors" (generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse). For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale. The rule also requires the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commissions payable for the transaction, current quotations for the stock, and, if applicable, the fact that it is the sole market maker in the stock. Consequently, the rule may adversely affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market.



	 




	We do not anticipate paying dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future.

	Substantially all of our assets and operations are located and conducted in the United States and Canada. As a result, our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency rates relate

	to Canadian dollar operating expenses, assets and liabilities. A decline in the Canadian dollar would decrease the U.S. dollar value of our Canadian assets while a rise in the Canadian dollar would increase the U.S. dollar value of Canadian operating expenses and liabilities.

	We intend to host a digital Cloud platform with various features including document storage. While this Cloud service will have security features, Cloud-based content has been, and continues to b

Should our security features be breached as a result of third-party attacks or due any error, negligence, product defect or otherwise, and should such a breach compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our cloud services, the business may suffer and its reputation may be injured. In addition, if an actual or perceived security breach occurs, we may become subject to significant liability through lawsuits or claims and lose future sales and customers and there is no assurance that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any successful claims.

	The obligations of being a public company in the United States require significant expenditures and place certain demands on our management, including costs r

	esulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that the Company complies with all of these requirements. Moreover, despite recent reforms made possible by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations increase the Company's legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Any changes that the Company makes to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow it to satisfy its obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.



	 


	We also expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for it to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to a

	ccept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These factors also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors, particularly to serve on its audit and compensation committees, or as executive officers.

	Dividends



	 


	The Company has not declared or paid any dividends in the previous two years. The Company currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, for use in its business. The Company does not anticipate paying dividends on the common shares in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay any future dividends will remain at the discretion of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) and will be made taking into account the Company

	’s financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.

	The Company has a stock option plan under which options to purchase shares of common stock may be granted to certain officers, directors and service providers.


	 


	In April 2014, the Company adopted a new Stock Option Plan (the "2014 Plan"). The 2014 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,250,000 of the Company's common shares, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Company is listed on the TSX-V and is subject to a limitation on the number of options a company may have. The 2014 Plan provides for the issuance of both incentive stock options and nonqualified options as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


	 


	During the years ended

	December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no options, warrants and rights granted, issued, exercised or outstanding under any equity compensation plan.



	 



	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities



	 


	On October 15, 2015, the Company issued 32,000,000 common shares of the Company at the price of CDN$0.07 per share. The common shares were issued by the Company in connection with the closing of a non-brokered private placement for aggregate gross proceeds of CDN$2.24 million (the "Offering").


	 


	In connection with the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 450,000 common shares of the Company, for aggregate cash consideration of CDN$31,500 to purchasers who were in the "United States" or "U.S. persons" (as such terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act), in reliance upon Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act ("Regulation D"), solely to "accredited investors", as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.


	 


	In connection with the Offering, the Company issued an aggregate of 31,550,000 common shares of the Company, for aggregate cash consideration of CDN$2,208,500 to purchasers who were outside the United States and not U.S. persons in reliance upon Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act.


	 


	A finder

	’s fee consisting of a cash payment equal to 8% of the gross proceeds and share purchase warrants equal to 8% of the common shares issued in respect of certain purchasers who were outside the United States and not U.S. persons. Each finder's warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company for a period of two years at the price of CDN$0.07 per share. The finder’s warrants were issued in reliance upon Rule 903 of Regulation S under the under the Securities Act.

	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with

	‘‘Selected Consolidated Financial Data’’ and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.




	 



	Overview



	 


	We

	design and market to business customers digital watermarking, streaming video and video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity. The Company’s systems, services and delivery solutions include digital watermark solutions and video content production, content encoding, media asset management, media and application hosting, multi-mode content distribution, transaction data capture and reporting, e-commerce, specialized engineering services, and Internet streaming hardware.



	 


	The Company

	’s products and services are based on its media delivery infrastructure and software. It has developed a number of specific products and services. These include MediaSentinel and SmartMarks, a process that watermarks digital video content; StreamHQ, a collection of source-to-destination media delivery services marketed to businesses; EncodeHQ, a service that digitizes and compresses analog-source video; hardware server and encoder system applications under the brand name Hurricane Mediacaster; ZMail, a service that delivers Web and rich media content to targeted audiences, and mediaClix, a service that delivers content similar to Zmail but originating from an existing Web presence.



	 


	As more fully discussed below

	we have not been profitable, and our revenues for 2016 were $-0-. We cannot predict our revenue levels for the next 12 months, or thereafter, nor when, or if, our operations will become profitable. We will require additional financing, both for the remainder of fiscal 2016 and thereafter, to continue to operate and expand our business. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.



	 



	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 


	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the

	United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



	 



	25




	 



	 


	We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management

	’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results:

	REVENUE RECOGNITION


	.  


	Revenue is recognized for digital water marking based on a contracted usage schedule on a monthly billing cycle. Software revenue and other services are recognized in accordance with the terms of the specific agreement, which is generally upon delivery and when accepted by customer.  Maintenance, support and service revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement. In order to recognize revenue, we must not have any continuing obligations and it must also be probable that we will collect the accounts receivable.



	 



	IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS


	.  Long-lived assets are reviewed in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05.  Impairment or disposal of long-lived assets losses are recognized in the period the impairment or disposal occurs.  



	 



	DEFERRED TAXES


	.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized.  



	 



	ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

	Under ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)), the Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

	The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. The amount of expense attributed is based on estimated forfeiture rate, which is updated based on actual forfeitures as appropriate. This option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the Company®€™s common stock, pre-vesting forfeiture rate and an option®€™s expected life. The financial statements include amounts that are based on the Company®€™s best estimates and judgments.



	 



	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

	We account for commitments and contingencies in accordance with ASC Topic 450 Contingencies (for

	merly referred to as financial accounting standards board Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies). We record a liability for commitments and contingencies when the amount is both probable and reasonably estimable.

	Our

	management and employee agreed to no compensation for fiscal 2016 and 2015. Product marketing costs increased due to management’s decision to direct our efforts toward the current customer in additional divisions and additional potential customers through effort of management.   Administrative expenses have decreased due to management decision not to offer a private placement and an additional exchange.



	 


	During the

	year ended December 31, 2015 in connection with the settlements of accounts payable, we wrote off accounts payable obligations of $4,889 and recorded a gain of $4,889.

	Selling, general and administrative expenses were $

	Net Losses



	 


	To date,

	we have not achieved profitability and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss for fiscal 2016 was $453,240, compared with a net loss of $386,584 for fiscal 2015.




	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At

	December 31, 2016 our cash position was $6,425, a decrease of $180,672 from December 31, 2015. We had a negative working capital of $321,556 and an accumulated deficit of $40,779,853 at December 31, 2016.



	 


	Our

	principal source of cash during fiscal 2016 was $227,760 from management from advances.



	 


	We have

	historically satisfied our capital needs primarily by shareholders’ loans and issuing equity securities to our officers, directors, employees and a small group of investors, and from short-term bridge loans from members of management.



	 


	Our

	independent registered public accounting firm, in their report accompanying our audited financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2016, have stated that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2016, we had $6,425 in cash. We will require an additional $1 million to $2.5 million to finance operations for the fiscal 2017 and we intend to obtain such financing through sales of our equity securities. The threat to our ability to continue as a going concern will be removed only when revenues have reached a level that sustains our business operations.



	 


	Assuming the aforementioned $

	1 million to $2.5 million in financing is obtained, continuing operations for the longer-term will be supported through anticipated growth in revenues and through additional sales of our securities. Although longer-term financing requirements may vary depending upon our sales performance, management expects that we will require additional financing of $1.0 million to $2.5 million for fiscal 2017.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	To the Board of Directors


	Oculus Visi

	onTech, Inc.



	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated

	balance sheets of Oculus VisionTech, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.



	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company

	’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the fina

	ncial position of Oculus VisionTech, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2014 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has not generated significant revenue from operations and has a net working capital deficiency and a stockholders

	’ deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan in regard to these matters is also discussed in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	In

	Canada, reporting standards do not require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) or a reservation of opinion when the consolidated financial statements are effected by conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Such doubt is accounted for and disclosed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.



	 


	Our report to the Board of Directors dated

	March 31

	st

	, 2017, is expressed in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which requires an explanatory paragraph in the auditor’s report.

	consolidated financial statements present the financial results of Oculus VisionTech, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary 


	USVO Inc. on a consolidated basis.

	                   BUSINESS:




	 


	Oculus Vision

	Tech, Inc. (the "

	Company

	") is a designer of digital watermarking services and solutions. At December 31, 2016 and for the two-year period then ended, substantially all of the Company's assets and substantially all its operations are located and conducted in the United States and Canada.



	 



	3.

	                   SUMMARY OF Significant Accounting Policies:




	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements, the Company

	has incurred losses of $453,240 and $386,584 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, the Company has a negative working capital of $321,556 and an accumulated deficit of $40,779,853 at December 31, 2016. These conditions raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations as they come due, which management believes it will be able to do. To date, the Company has funded operations primarily through the issuance of common stock, warrants and options to outside investors and to the Company's management. The Company believes that its operations will generate additional funds and that additional funding from outside investors and the Company's management will continue to be available to the Company when needed. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiar

	y. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.



	 


	The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts.


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the

	United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

	                   SUMMARY OF Significant Accounting Policies:




	(

	continued




	)



	 


	The Company sells its products to customers on an open credit basis. The Company

	’s trade accounts receivable are due from such customers and are generally uncollateralized. Management closely monitors outstanding accounts receivable and charges off to expense any balances that are determined to be uncollectible or establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no account receivable. 



	 


	Revenue from hardware product sales is recognized when the product has been shipped and the collection of payment is reasonably assured. Revenue recognized from these sales is net of applicable provisions for refunds, discounts and allowances. Engineering services sales are recognized upon the service having been provided.

	The Company had no hardware product sales in 2016 or 2015.



	 


	Revenue from software sales is recognized when the product has been delivered. Revenue from multiple element contracts (hardware, software and engineering) is allocated to the various elements based on fair value. If objective evidence of fair value is not available, revenue from these contracts is deferred until the earlier of when objective evidence of fair value does exist or all elements of the contract have been delivered. Discounts will be applied to each element on a proportionate basis. No portion of the revenue will be recognized if the portion of the revenue allocable to delivered elements is subject to forfeiture, refund or other concession.

	The Company had no software sales in 2016 or 2015.



	 


	Revenue is recognized for digital water marking based on a contracted usage schedule on a monthly billing cycle.

	Revenue for digital watermarking software usage totaled $-0- and $5,500 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.



	 


	Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax bas

	is of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carry forwards measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically evaluates the reliability of its net deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



	 


	The foreign assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments is immaterial at

	December 31, 2016 and 2015.




	 



	Basic loss per common share ("


	EPS

	") is computed as net loss divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the impact of common stock potentially issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no potentially issuable common stock, except for stock purchase warrants.



	 


	Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

	     Control and Procedures





	 



	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report.


	 


	In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.


	 


	No system of controls can prevent errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system

	’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some people, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with its policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.



	 


	Subject to the limitations above, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.


	 


	Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were not effective as a result of the weaknesses in the design of our internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	Based upon their evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective.

	 The material weaknesses in our internal controls related to a lack of segregation of duties due to inadequate staffing within our accounting department and upper management, the assignment of authority and responsibility, lack of consistent policies and procedures, inadequate monitoring controls and inadequate disclosure controls.



	 


	There were no changes in our internal controls that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our

	internal controls over financial reporting.



	 


	We are committed to improving our financial organization.

	 As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to our company.



	 


	In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes.

	 Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result in proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department.  Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support our company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur.



	 



	28




	 



	 


	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.

	 



	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

	 Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management's report in this annual report.

	The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consists of Maurice Loverso, Anton J. Drescher and Ron Wages, who serves as Chairman. The Board of Directors had determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and

	accounting matters to serve on the Committee and that Anton J. Drescher is an “

	audit committee financial expert

	” as defined by SEC rules.



	 


	The Audit Committee meets with

	our independent auditors at least quarterly to discuss the results of the annual audit or interim periodic reviews and to review the financial statements; appoints the independent auditors to be retained; oversees the independence of the independent accountants; evaluates the independent auditors’ performance; approves fees paid to independent auditors and receives and considers the independent auditors’ comments as to controls, adequacy of staff and management performance and procedures in connection with audit and financial controls. The Audit Committee met informally by telephone conference four times and signed four consent resolutions during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014.



	 


	The Audit Committee is primarily concerned with the effectiveness of

	our audits by our internal audit staff and by our independent auditors. Its duties include: (1) recommending the selection of independent auditors; (2) reviewing the scope of the audit to be conducted by them, as well as the results of their audit; (3) reviewing the organization and scope of our internal system of audit and financial controls; (4) appraising our financial reporting activities (including our Proxy Statement and Annual Report) and the accounting standards and principles followed; and (5) examining other reviews relating to compliance by employees with important policies and applicable laws.

OCULUS ANNOUNCES DPS PRODUCT FOR PHOTOS AND PICTURES							
								Published by Corey Leung on November 1, 2016











Vancouver, British Columbia, February 17, 2016: Oculus VisionTech Inc. (the “Company” or “Oculus”) (TSX.V: OVT; OTCQB: OVTZ) is pleased to announce that, subsequent to the successful completion of alpha testing of its Cloud-based Document Protection System (DPS) technology and the commencement of field trials of the document protection features of the Company’s Cloud-DPS technology (see news release of February 9, 2016), the Company is in the process of implementing its proprietary watermarking technology to its new photo DPS product that will offer online, Cloud-based security for documents in general, and that can be optimized for digital photographs in particular, and which is invariant to document/photo file format (and subsequently to today’s image/video CODECs).
The technology underlying the photo DPS product is on proprietary scanning technology that allows a digital picture to be scanned with an “image understanding” algorithm that identifies and extracts prominent image features. The Company’s proprietary DPS technology is based on protecting documents with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm and then comparing the original protected document with a returned document. If a document has been tampered with, the DPS document authentication feature will highlight the tampered locations in the document.
The initial goal of the photo DPS product will be to evaluate and confirm the digital photograph/picture authentication process, as well as the product’s ability to preserve the robustness and resilience of returned information, while minimizing false positives. Assuming successful validation, the Company expects to release a commercial version of the photo DPS system and begin nation-wide product field testing in the United States, during the second quarter of 2016.
Tom Perovic, a director of the Company, who is overseeing the testing and launch of the Company’s Cloud-DPS technology stated, “The offering of an online photo/picture DPS product will allow Oculus to open another vertical market, the social media market, which we expect will be another revenue-generating product for Oculus.”
About the Oculus Cloud-DPS Technology
The Oculus Cloud-DPS is an Internet-centric, Cloud-based web service for document tamper-proof protection and authentication. The first step is taking a document in digital form and protecting each page with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm, and returning an image-based protected PDF document. The document is also encrypted to provide access control security. In the second step, the Oculus Cloud-DPS document authentication feature takes in the protected PDF document and returns authentication results. If the document was tampered with, the returned pages will highlight the tampered locations. Cloud-DPS technology is intended to protect high-value, sealed documents against any malicious tampering or forgery. Vertical target markets for high value documents have been identified as personal, real estate and corporate legal contracts, personal last wills, medical records, law enforcement records or financial institutions and government issued documents. The following document formats are accepted by the Cloud-DPS: *.doc, *.docx, *.xls, *.xlsx, *.xps, *.pdf, and *.jpg.
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
