DOING BUSINESS IN INDONESIA

Indonesia is not the easiest place to start an enterprise or, generally, to conduct business. This is reflected by the World Bank's Doing Business 2016 index in which the country ranks 109th. One of the major obstacles of doing business in Indonesia concerns obtaining the necessary permits and licenses; this can become a time-consuming and expensive affair. In order to successfully start and expand a business it is also important to establish a good network in Indonesian business and government circles. Foreign entrepreneurs should realize the importance of these networks and make efforts to develop them as well as to maintain them. 






Luckily, it is not difficult to establish these networks as foreign businessmen are also interesting parties for Indonesians. It is highly recommended to become acquainted with cultural values beforehand in order to know how to socialize with Indonesian business partners and Indonesian employees as well as to grasp Indonesia's business culture. This will make your business more efficient and effective, especially in the long term.
This section aims to provide an accurate overview of the Indonesian business environment by sharing detailed information on Indonesian companies and commodities. At the same time it will also discuss obstacles to the business environment that are hampering efficiency and effectiveness for economic and social development. Moreover, this section can function as a reference point for those wanting to start a business and/or planning to live in Jakarta as it contains detailed information about certain legal issues such as obtaining the necessary permits for establishing a company or another legal entity. Of course Indonesia Investments can connect you to agencies specialized in these matters and act as a mediator.
Our Business section also provides suggestions concerning strategic living or office accommodations and gives some tips for behavioral patterns when socializing with Indonesians. Enterprises or individuals that want to start doing business in Indonesia and offer services or goods globally (or are in search for specific services or goods) are welcome to advertise on our Business Platform.
Business Columns
The Business Columns section contains articles with an in-depth analysis of subjects at the heart of the Indonesian business world. Together, these columns should provide a clear and detailed image of a wide scope of subjects in Indonesia's business sector and inform about developments within this field. It can serve as a source for investment ideas but it also deals with the negative aspects of (doing) business in Indonesia in order to obtain an objective view.
View our business columns
Indonesian Company Profiles
This section is an ever-expanding catalogue of Indonesian company files, both publicly traded at the Indonesia Stock Exchange and privately-held or state-owned companies. Each company file provides a comprehensive outline of the company in order to give insight into its business(es) and performance. It presents an overview of basic corporate data, future prospects and provides conducted interviews with management and other stakeholders.
View the Indonesian company profiles
Commodities
Indonesia contains an abundance of commodities such as coal, gold and gas. A negative side effect in the case of Indonesia, however, is the country's over-dependency on the export of (raw) commodities. Downstream processing industries still lag behind although the government is making efforts to push for the development of such downstream industries. This section discusses the diverse and high traded Indonesian commodities separately, and in detail.
Read about Indonesia's commodities
Industries & Sectors
This section on our website presents detailed analyses and overviews of specific industries and sectors within the Indonesian economy, including the automotive industry, tourism, (Islamic) banking, property, as well as the tobacco industry. These analyses will give you insight into the sector: what is the historic background? What are the latest developments? Who are the main players? What are the risks? What is Indonesia's position in the broader world perspective?
Visit Indonesia's industries & sectors page
Risks
Indonesia is a promising country from a macroeconomic perspective but also entails more risks than investing in a developed country due to a number of specific political, social and cultural dynamics of the country. This section aims to provide some insight into these country-specific obstacles to successful investments and hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the country, thereby reducing chances of failure.
Read about the risks when doing business in Indonesia
Foreign Investment
This section is devoted to foreign direct investment in Indonesia, specifically the establishment of the necessary legal entities to start doing business or market your products/services in Indonesia. We focus on the process to set up a foreign investment limited liability company (in Indonesian: Perseroan Terbatas Penanaman Modal Asing, PT PMA) and a representative office (Kantor Perwakilan Perusahaan Asing, or, KPPA).
Visit our foreign investment in Indonesia section
Working & Living
For someone who is not or barely acquainted with Indonesia it can be difficult to find his or her way. It will take perseverance to arrange organizational matters (such as arranging a work permit, establishing a company or finding a place to live) while adjusting to a new culture that differs markedly from his own. This section deals with Indonesia's regulatory framework and other (cultural) information needed to ease the process of settling in Indonesia for business or private purposes.
