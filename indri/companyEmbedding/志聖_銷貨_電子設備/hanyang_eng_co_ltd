RSView SE

RSView supervisory software is
the new standard in SCADA
Information Management
Systems allowing comprehensive
monitoring and control of your
entire RTU network and plantwide
process control networks.
Architected for reliably and
flexibility, RSView SE (supervisory
edition) is a client/server
architecture with redundant I/O
and HMI servers combined with
centralized security administration.
RSView SE can connect to your
legacy third-party hardware via
standard OPC drivers and other
protocol drives making RSView SE
the clear choice for supervisory
control software.

VISUALIZATION & CONTROL
SCADA HMI SOFTWARE
The SCADA Human Machine Interface (HMI) software provides a graphical representation of the
RTU status and alarm history. The SCADA HMI software allows visualization of all process data and
operator control over site equipment. Operational and environmental reports can be generated from the
SCADA HMI system and summarized data can be stored in historical files of the SCADA HMI system.
SCADA HMI SOFTWARE
System Overview, Trends, Alarms,Reports, Historical Data
RSVIEW SCADA HMI SYSTEM FROM ROCKWELL SOFTWARE PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO:

View facility-wide operationally-centric data
Capture, store and retrieve critical operational data with operator notes
View Trend data in real-time from “live” data or historical sources
Provide high system availability and data integrity
Preemptive critical alarm notification of operations and maintenance staff via text or voice paging system
Produce operational and regulatory report on regular intervals
Provide system-wide administration of security and log-on rights

COMMUNICATION MEDIA
Lease line modems, radio modems, cellular
modems, frame relay, satellite, and microwave
are all means of connecting RTUs to a central
SCADA HMI system. Rockwell Automation RTUs
connect to many Third Party devices to build a
complete SCADA system. Rockwell Automation
maintains a list of quality communication technology
partners in our Encompass Partnering program.
We have partnerships with some of the top names
in the industry.


SCADA APPLICATION
WATER WASTEWATER

LIFT STATIONS
Collections systems rely on a series of lift
stations and combined sewer overflow
(CSO) stations communicating to a central
location to prevent sewerage back-ups and
protect the environment.
WATER BOOSTER STATIONS
Booster pump stations for fresh water
systems operate by maintaining system
pressure or matching water flow demand.



SCADA APPLICATION
OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION
OIL AND GAS WELLS
There are two main types of wells: Natural Flow
and Artificial Lift wells. Monitoring and remote control
requirements depend on the type of well. For natural
flow well, surface process variables like flowing /
casing pressure and temperatures and the position of
the flowing valve need to be monitored and gas wells
include compensated flow calculations. Remote control
is limited to the shutdown valve. For artificial lift wells,
additional monitoring and control is required to be able
to supervise motor or gas lift valves and be
able to control those devices.
PUMP STATIONS
Operate by maintaining system pressure or matching
flow demand. Multiple pump stations connected to the
pipeline and communicating back to a central location
are used to deliver crude oil or products to refineries
and terminals.

COMPRESSOR STATIONS
Compressor Stations
are responsible in
pipeline systems for
maintaining the
appropriate pressure
levels needed to deliver
gas at the destination
locations. Multiple compressor
stations are typically needed
in a gas pipeline and the
communication to a central
location is key to ensure
coordination and safety
of the operation.
VALVE STATIONS
An important element in the
safe operation of a gas or
liquid pipeline is the block
or segmenting valves.These
valves are mainly responsible
for shutting down segments
of the pipeline to isolate
leaks or ruptures. Local and
remote control capabilities
as well as data acquisition
functions to be able to
collect process
information along the
pipeline (Pressure,
temperature, flow and
valve position) are the
main requirements of
this application
