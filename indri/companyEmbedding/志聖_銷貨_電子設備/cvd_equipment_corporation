  (NASDAQ: CVV) CVD Equipment Corporation (CVD), today launched a new line of chemical vapor deposited three dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name CVD3  D  Graphene™ and is expected to enable new high performance products.  Karlheinz Strobl, V.P. of Business Development, states, “The CVD3  D  Graphene™ cellular material platform is based on a three dimensional graphene-foam like material having several two dimensional (a few atomic layers thick) graphene sheets that are mechanically and electrically fully interconnected in three dimensions. This novel, highly customizable material platform enables the preservation of many of the high performance material properties of the traditional one atom thick two dimensional graphene sheets. Such three dimensional graphene materials can be further functionalized by chemical vapor deposition, electro deposition and/or chemical grafting to develop even more advanced materials for high performance product developments. This new nano-material platform interconnects the two dimensional nano world with the three dimensional macroscopic world of products in a more manufacturable manner. The novel material platform is already being explored by innovators for a growing range of product applications. It is anticipated that as additional variations of the material are developed, more growth market opportunities will become available.”  " CVD Materials Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of CVD Equipment Corporation that focuses on providing a range of nano-enabled materials and products,” said Leonard Rosenbaum, President. “By leveraging our custom equipment design and manufacturing capabilities with the process development and manufacturing capabilities of our Application Laboratory, CVD Materials Corporation can optimally focus on shortening the time to market for novel 'nano-enhanced' material products. With the commercialization of CVD3  D  Graphene™ cellular materials using a range of Nickel foam templates and by tuning the thickness of the carbon film layers we can provide an expanded range of CVDGraphene™ research materials that enables our customers to develop new products, including: higher performance batteries; ultracapacitors; and gas, liquid and bio sensors.”  About CVD Equipment Corporation  CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ: CVV) is a designer and manufacturer of custom and standard state-of-the-art equipment used in the development, design and manufacture of advanced electronic components, materials and coatings for research and industrial applications. CVD offers a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control, and other equipment that is used by customers to research, design and manufacture semiconductors, solar cells, graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, LEDs, MEMS, smart glass coatings, battery and/or ultra capacitor materials, medical coatings, industrial coatings and equipment for surface mounting of components onto printed circuit boards. CVD recently announced the expansion of its Application Laboratory focusing on novel, higher efficiency material manufacturing for a wide variety of growth markets, which will be marketed through its wholly owned subsidiary, CVD Materials Corporation.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements. Certain information included in this press release by CVD), as well as information included in oral or other written statements made or to be made by CVD, contains statements that are forward-looking. All statements other than statements of historical fact are hereby identified as "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

What Researchers are Saying About Our Systems
I built two CVD systems when setting up my lab. They were basically clones of a system I had used previously, so the design was already in my mind and mostly down on paper. However, I severely underestimated the time involved in selecting all the proper pieces and parts. By the time things finally came together and the first system came on-line, I found myself wishing I had simply purchased complete solutions from a company that had already invested the time to engineer a reliable system. As a new faculty member, funds are a limited resource, but time is even more so. Quickly getting the ball rolling on research is worth more than what one might save with a home-built approach.
- Erik Einarsson, Ph.D, Assistant Professor"I am glad to share with you the good news that ever since the very first batch of samples we continued to produce long and uniform silicon nanowires. Suffice to say that members of our research group are all impressed with the turn-key reliability as well as extensive safety features of this LPCVD system which greatly satisfy the needs of our fundamental research program in nanomaterials. We also appreciate the custom system design effort to cater to our needs from your  expert team and your ability to deliver and install in a timely manner."
- Jie Xiang, Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering"The FN/CVD Application & Research Lab provides our company with one-stop CNT process capabilities and technical staff support that we simply cannot get anywhere else and that help us accelerate the commercialization of our proprietary thin film technologies"
- Vincent Stenger, Ph.D, Principal Research Engineer"EasyTube® provides a very versatile platform for synthesizing various semiconductor nanowires. The configuration allows for consistent nanowire growths."
- Yi Gu, Ph.D, Assistant Professor of Physics | Gu Research Group"The researchers at the University of Cincinnati partnered with FirstNano®, a division of CVD Equipment Corp. of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., to use their laboratory and a specialized furnace called EasyTube® 3000.  With this equipment, the research team succeeded to produce 18 millimeter long CNT array which is considered the longest aligned CNTs reported ever."
- Dr. Vesselin Shanov, Associate Professor of Chemical and Materials Engineering "It has been a pleasurable interaction with the FirstNano® process and development team. Collectively, collaborations between the Cornell Nanoscale Facility and FirstNano® have yielded single wall carbon nanotube growth from lithographically defined catalyst pads on full four inch wafers. Incorporating wafer scale nanoscale fabrication processes with predefined carbon based systems represents a major step forward in creating complex carbon based nanostructures. This enhanced functionality raises intriguing possibilities in modern scientific research of widely disparate endeavors."
- B. Rob Ilic, Ph.D, Research Associate | User Program Manager"The purchase of the EasyTube® 3000 will enlarge the spectrum of our research with the growth of heterostructured nanowires, their doping, and with the possibility to extend the growth to a wide variety of other materials thanks to the liquid precursor kits. Our projects cover fundamental aspects (growth, carrier transport …) as well as potential applications (Nanoelectronics, Solar Energy, Nanophotonics, MEMS, and Sensors)."

FirstNano® provides a range of advanced research and development chemical vapor deposition process tools for universities, startups, and industry research laboratories.
The systems are designed to meet today’s safety standards for handling pyrophoric, corrosive, flammable, and toxic gases such as hydrogen, silane, germane, diborane, hydrogen chloride, and metal organic precursors. All our systems are designed with exhausted metal cabinet enclosures which contain the reactor, furnace, power control, gas distribution, and electrical systems. The systems are engineered with ease of access to all components for maintenance purposes.
FirstNano® systems are powered by CVDWinPrC™, our proprietary realtime instrument control, data logging, and process editing software suite. CVDWinPrC™, included as standard, is equivalent to the package included with our industry-ready production equipment. A web interface connection allows for remote training, software upgrades, and system troubleshooting.
FirstNano®’s ultra-high purity gas lines and delivery systems are manufactured by Stainless Design Concepts (SDC), a division of CVD Equipment Corporation. We take advantage of the SDC 4,000 ft2 clean room fabrication facility, with multiple high purity orbital welding stations. Our manufacturing is vertically integrated; we procure raw materials and deliver finished systems. Contact us to schedule a visit to our facility on Long Island, New York, where you can witness our quartz fabrication, extensive machine shop, and build/test facilities.
FirstNano® systems can be configured with a range of modules to meet the often unique requirements of the R&D environment. More information can be found by clicking on the system images below.
