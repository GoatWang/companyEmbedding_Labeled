BUMP Descum


				[BUMP Descum]
			

				PSK Inc. specializes in developing and manufacturing semiconductor equipment including PR strips, plasma oxide cleaning systems, etch backs, power device etchers, and the BUMP descum system. 

The company¡¯s core product line consists of the Ecolite3000 and Ecolite2000, for 300mm and 200mm descumming processes respectively.

PSK¡¯s systems are simple and economically sensible low-temperature descum systems designed with a low-damage remote microwave plasma source and bias power. 

These systems are designed to achieve high ashing rates (¡Ã2¥ìm/min) under low temperature conditions and high-performance descum process for bumping applications. 

PSK¡¯s Ecolite systems exhibit high productivity and process recipe flexibility along with a small footprint that reduces the cost of ownership for users. 

These systems also have wide process windows, and auto transfer modules are available for any size of substrate such as 2inch, 4inch, 6 inch, 8 inch, or 12inch. Smart EES unction is also available. 

PSK¡¯s systems utilize a dual process chamber that allows for the independent operation of each chamber with flexibility of process recipe and maintenance.

Founded in 1990, PSK is one of the world¡¯s leading manufacturers of PR strips, BUMP descum systems and etch back systems. 

Exporting to major markets around the world including Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, China and the United States, the company holds certifications in ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001, and OHSAS18001, as well as SEMI, CE, and UL marks.
