We are focused on developing photoresists for plating to address redistribution layers (RDLs) aimed at ultra-small targets and continuous electrolytic plating. We are also focused on developing photoresists for plating that target the formation of μ-bumps, tall copper pillars, and stud gold bumps. 



The advantages of positive photoresists include not only their proven track record by customers and their resolution and rectangularity, but also their detachability and resistance to electrolytic plating solution processes (flexibility and resistance to plating chemicals), compared with dry film photoresists and negative photoresists.

Going forward, TOK will continue devoting efforts to helping improve the yields of our customers.

Offering TOK’s unique packaging / MEMS manufacturing technologies, in terms of both materials and equipment, that widely support the manufacturing of lighter, thinner and more compact mobile devices and electronic components with high functionality


In addition to being equipped with highly sophisticated functions, mobile devices are rapidly becoming lighter, thinner and more compact in a pace much faster than we could have imagined. Packaging and MEMS manufacturing technologies play an extremely important role for such advancement.


We have developed and commercialized optimal photoresists and processing equipment for a range of packaging processes, including the newest technologies. Photoresists for packaging are available for a wide range of production technologies including wafer-level CSP, SiP, RDL, TAB and COF. In the field of processing equipment, we have developed unique technologies for thick film processing, such as a coating machine that can form thick films at 20-100 μm with excellent CD uniformity.


MEMS manufacuturing technology is widely used for the miniaturization and higher functionality of electronic components. This technology is an integrated combination of electricity, machinery, light and materials, and expected to be an integral part of fundamental technologies necessary for the development of electronic components. In fact, it has already been employed by some electronic components and introduced to manufacturing technologies of image sensors, inkjet nozzles and high-frequency wave devices.


We have commercialized thick-film permanent photoresists for MEMS, and developed a non-spin coater that can form thick films capable of highly uniform photoresist coating at a 100 μm level with a single application and a developing machine for thick films. We offer high quality, most advanced and most effective processing technologies in the MEMS field as well, thus widely supporting the miniaturization of electronic components in terms of both materials and equipment.



































Glossary



Positive photoresist
When image developing process is carried out after exposure, the unexposed part remains as a pattern.
Negative photoresist
When image developing process is carried out after exposure, the exposed part remains as a pattern.
Wafer level CSP
A general term for packages that are as small as, or a little larger than the chip size of semiconductor.
Photoresist film formation
A liquid photoresist film is formed by spin coat, spray coat, curtain coat, or slit coat methods. The dry film resist is formed on a substrate by lamination.
Chemically-amplified photoresist
An acid with a catalytic action is generated when a photochemical reaction is used; the functional group in the resist polymer reacts with the acid as a catalyst in the baking process carried out after exposure. And a pattern is formed with the change in physical properties.
Naphthoquinone photoresist
A general term for a dicarbonyl compound that has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring of an aromatic compound, quinone. When the aromatic ring of the quinone is a naphthalene ring, it is called naphthoquinone, and a pattern is formed with the photoreaction of this naphthoquinone.
Wafer thinning
A wafer is thinned in order to stack multiple chips in a semiconductor package.
