Intevac’s Core Sensor Technology
Intevac’s patented Electron Bombarded Active Pixel Sensor (EBAPS®) is the core of our extreme low-light products for the defense industry. This proprietary technology enables the ongoing development of our advanced digital sensors and systems for applications including military night vision, weapon sights, surveillance and precision targeting.
Intevac’s EBAPS technology is based on a III-V semiconductor photocathode in proximity-focus with a high resolution, backside-thinned, CMOS chip anode. The electrons emitted by the photocathode are directly injected in the electron bombarded mode into the CMOS anode, where the electrons are collected, amplified and read-out to produce digital video directly out of the sensor.
Light Spectrum Addressed
by EBAPS

Delivering Superior Performance
Visible / Near-Infrared:
Selectable by photocathode choice
Resolution / Frame Rate / Low Power:
Selectable by silicon sensor choice
The EBAPS sensor achieves state-of-the-art night vision performance in a compact, lightweight, low power, low cost package by eliminating the complex components associated with traditional image intensifier assemblies.
How the DI² Sensor Works

Photons are absorbed by photocathode allowing electrons to be emitted.
Electrons are accelerated by high voltage
Electrons are collected on megapixel CMOS silicon sensor

Intevac, Inc.200 Lean product brochure 

brief
In the vastly competitive and volatile hard disk drive industry, it was important for Intevac to stay top of mind with their customers. To introduce their new product, 200 Lean, Intevac needed a brochure their sales team could use to discuss the product and leave behind.
solution
Knowing that many of their buyers may not have a complete understanding of how their machines work, UNIT developed a modular graphic system to break down the information. With the use of bold colors, and close up photography, the brochure represented the information in an easy-to-understand manner.
results
The generous use of white space created a natural pacing system that allowed the sales teams to continue a conversation with the customer without overwhelming them with too much complex information at the same time. The launch of 200 Lean was a great success for Intevac.
