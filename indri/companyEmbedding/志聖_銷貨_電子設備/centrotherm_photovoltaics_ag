Our core business is the development and sales of turnkey production lines for the manufacture of crystalline solar cells, including the full range of engineering and technological process services. We supply our customers with diffusion furnaces, PECVD systems and drying and annealing furnaces as key equipment.
We also use components produced by partner companies according to our specifications. We integrate these into coordinated production lines, which cover all process steps required for the manufacture of crystalline solar cells. We are now supplementing our service portfolio with module lines for crystalline module production.

BEWARE - Special Warning Notice about ExpoGuide and FAIRGuide
With the ongoing solicitations, SEMI would like to continue to alert you the two organizations soliciting internet Event Directory listing information in a misleading manner. The two organizations are Mexican based, ExpoGuide and Austrian based, FAIRGuide. This is an ongoing issue and is not related to the SEMICON Event Guide. Both the Expo-Guide.com and FAIRGuide are not endorsed or supported by SEMI Show Management. By submititing these forms, exhibitors are contracted into a three-year, non-retractable agreement with excessive fees.
