What is Plasma?

                                                Ice melts and returns to the state of water, water evaporates and turns into water vapour. This pattern of transition between the three material states of solid, liquid and gas is familiar but there is actually another fourth material state. This fourth material state is called “plasma”.
                                                As energy is applied the electrons of a material the orbits of these electrons widen, this process is called “excitation”. Electrons that escape are called “free electrons”, and the remaining particles are known as “ions”. In this state with electrons flying around and ions dancing around the bond between electron and nulceus is unstable, this state of chaos is called “plasma”.

                                                The Northern Lights, or aurora, are caused by the energy in radioactive rays from the sun (solar wind) colliding with electrons in oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Free electrons that result from these collisions are then deflected by the earth’s magnetic field to create a plasma effect.
                                                For an example coser to home, fluorescent strip lights and neon signs employ a “glow discharge plasma”. Other examples include high temperature plasma where electrons and ions are completely dissociated as used in material processing. Plasma torches, known as “plasma jets” or “arc plasma” are being widely used in the fields of metal refining and fusion.
                                                Currently plasma technology is most being widely used in the field of semi-conductor manufacturing, in particular deposition, etching and ashing process applications. Plasma technology is also vital to the production of DVD, “opto-magnetic disks” and electronic components that support the IT industry. New emerginging applications include gas scrubbing of ecologically harmful gases and film coatings to prevent leakage of environmental toxins from plastic food and beverage containers.

                                                We can truthfully say that the 21st century is an era when “plasma” will influence our daily lives. At ADTEC Plasma Technology, we are striving to develop the plasma generators that form the source of plasma energy to meet the needs of the wide range of fields that utilize plasma.
                                        






Total Solutions

 
                                                Plasma technology is used in numerous fields of science, and the range of applications will continue to expand rapidly.
                                                For this reason at Adtec Plasma Technology, we feel it is vital to work together with people in all fields connected with plasma technology, not only electronics, in order to produce a better product.
                                                By delivering reliable, high quality plasma generators, impedance matching networks, meters and sensors, we aim to provide a Total Service and Total Solution for plasma generator related products.

Our Products



                                                
												When Adtec first started making RF Power products in 1990, the core concept was to make products that were world-leaders in ruggedness that the user could rely on, even in the toughest of environments. As critical dimensions and process windows shrink and the cost of down-time and scrapped product grows, it's even more critical today to have RF products that can take the strain that industry demands.
										

												At Adtec, we're confident that we've delivered on that promise - a confidence that allows us to give a two-year warranty as standard on all RF power supplies. It's a confidence our users share too, as year-on-year Adtec products create greater value through durable and reliable performance.
										

        										Adtec RF products are used to enable plasma processes in semiconductor, flat-panel, data-storage, MEMS, solar, sputter and industrial coating applications. Over the years we've built up an enviable track record of dependable product and support.
