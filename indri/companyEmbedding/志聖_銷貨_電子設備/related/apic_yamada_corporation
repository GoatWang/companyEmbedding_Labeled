WCM-300/330 SeriesFully Automated WLP Molding System


WCM-300/330 series has in-line concept for wafer
loading/unloading, compound feeding, encapsulation and
vision inspection.
This system handles the wafer without any damage nor
contamination and encapsulates high quality products.
The press system is high precision mechanical press,
specially developed for WLP. This system can handle
either liquid or granular compound to accommodate to
the customer’s requirement.

		
	
	WCM-300.....36ton (Standard model)
Type: Auto or MS (Manual System)
WCM-330.....85ton (High pressure model)
Type: Auto or MS (Manual System) *1
*1WCM-f400 press unit can be utilized as the manual system.
	



WCM-f400Fully Automated WLP/PLP Molding System

WCM-f400
New fully automatic compression molding
system, WCM-f400 has the concept of the
flexible molding process to meet with the latest
devices, such as WLP/PLP.
New platform has high precise 85t mechanical
press and enables to use with granular
compound and bottom cavity compression
molding. Also high speed and high vacuum
pressure vacuum unit is equipped.
This system also accommodates to the upper
cavity molding with the liquid compound to
meet various package types, as WCM-300/330
series.



LPM-600MS
		LPM-600 Auto System
	Large Panel Compression molding system


Wafer Level Packaging has come through 8” FI-WLP (Fan-in WLP) and its
mass-production, 8” FO-WLP (Fan-out WLP) development and its massproduction,
then come up to 12”, 300×300mmSQ molding since 1996, and
now stepping into new stage, which is larger panel molding. That is over
500×500mm panel molding, using metal carrier or organic substrate.
Encapsulating high quality product does not mean to enlarge the molding
system in geometric series. The limitation of the compound characteristics,
total thickness variation, mold uniformity for entire panel, mold temperature
uniformity and much more conditions have to be considered. Apic Yamada,
as the only one supplier of fully automated mass-production system for WLP
molding provided the molding know-how, accurate compound dispensing
technology and further more technologies into new large panel molding
system LPM-600 series.
	


CDIM-500Automated Cavity Direct Injection molding system


For the last few decades, Transfer molding technology has been at
the height of its prosperity. Now, this technology is facing its physical
limitations for the packaging of the forefront devices, because of the further
miniaturization, longer wire, narrower wire pitch, multi layer dies, Low-K
material, etc.
The liquid compression molding, CDIM® technology is the best solution for
these forefront devices, such as PoP, Multi-chip modules, as well as LED
lens.
This fully automated CDIM-500 shall materialize the new packages, which
are still in your imagination.
	

Molding System Lineups  < Transfer Molding >

GTM-XHigh performance molding system


G-Line is one of flagship for the molding system, and this system has been supporting the massproduction
in the field for over a decade. Following G-Line’s prominent concept and performance and to
beyond G-Line, this new Transfer molding system, GTM-X is developed.
Semiconductor devices are being changed and these new generation devices require higher encapsulation
technologies, higher productivity and higher device quality.
GTM-X is accommodating to large 100×300mm substrate and 2 or more substrates per mold. The machine
cycle time is also improved, and the compatibility of the G-Line peripheral equipments are considered as
well.
GTM-X can support any manufacturing style of customer’s requirements with the system line-up from
manual to full auto.
	


Small Innobvative Molding systemMolding system for Low/Medium production


Introducing new light weight compact molding system, optimized for low/
medium production volume. The concept of this system is based on the
innovative MINIMAL-FAB mass-production line and not only limited to the
automation of molding process, but also accommodating to the in-line
connection with before and after molding process. The system, having the quick
product change over enables user friendly operation. New compact one-strip
mold tool, accommodating to 3D gate design can encapsulate the almost all
kinds of electronics devices.
The customer, who wants to change to automated molding process, but being
obliged to use manual system. Complying with such customer’s needs, new
innovative molding system will debut.
	


GTM-SStandard auto-molding system


Releasing “GTM-S”, standard Transfer Molding system inherits
G-Line concept!
GTM-S adopts the most innovative system controller and interface
to secure the production with the user-friendly, safety, high
precision and stable features. The existing mold tools and product
change kit of G-Line can be used as it is.
This new automated molding system guarantees to support
customer’s mass production.
	


GTM-S MSCompact manual molding system


GTM-S MS　　
This manual system is designed for molding Lab or small lot production use.
AC servo motor drive clamp and transfer system materialize precise and shock-less operation without
hydraulic oil or cooling water. Either Transfer Molding or Compression Molding dedicated system, or compatible system can be selected.
	


GTM-170TMolding system for large scale ECU


Now, ecology is the matter of great urgency for us to work on. Apic Yamada is introducing newly developed transfer molding system GTM-
170T for large scale electronics devices, such as power semiconductor devices for solar batteries, motor controller or ECU modules to
control automotives. This world’s first fully automated system prepares all necessary function, such as large platen, higher clamping force,
vacuum molding capability, dual in line plunger layout, individual preheating stage for the thick and large substrates.
	


LTM-120/170LLiquid Transfer Encapsulation System


High brightness white LED is no longer the state-of-theart
technology. How to supply new products in reasonable
price and timely manner is the current key word.
LTM-120/170L is the fully automated Transfer Molding
system to comply with these needs.
This new system can accommodate to either Pre-mixed or
Post-mix type compound dispensing to meet customers
process. The major feature of this system is to accept
the large substrates for chasing production efficiency
and also large scale LED modules with top terminals,
which requires flash free molding on the top surface of
substrate.
