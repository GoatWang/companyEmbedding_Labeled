About UsCompany

6Harmonics was founded in 2010 with its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. As a G7 capital, Ottawa is an internationally recognized center of excellence in telecommunications technologies having some of world’s largest telecommunications network equipment vendors such as Nokia, Blackberry, Ciena, Cisco, Ericsson, and Huawei. Because of the strong wireless ecosystem in Ottawa, 6Harmonics is able to design and manufacture all of our products locally without outsourcing any of the technology development to third parties. With our global network of partners we are able to work with customers to design and deploy networks in many countries with widely differing requirements.
6Harmonics has an associate company in Beijing (6WiLInk) which customizes and supports 6Harmonics products for the Chinese market.
We released our first FCC certified product in 2013, and continue to expand our product portfolio to meet the needs of our customers. ETSI certification will be achieved by Q2 2017.

The Engineering of Easy: UniCam® Connectors
UniCam® Connectors






For years, the installation of cable networks' field connectors was a fairly time-consuming process. To ensure the seamless flow of data-forming light, each hair-thin strand of glass fiber had to be glued into a connector. Technicians had to tote along portable ovens to heat-cure the special epoxy.
After waiting for the connector to finish curing, the technician would clean and polish the components by hand to ensure the pristine surface required for optical transmission.
On average, it took six to eight minutes to terminate a single connector. Results varied widely, based on the skill and experience of the technician. As recently as the mid-1990s, that’s just how it was.
But as carriers everywhere began to embrace the fast transmission capabilities of optical fiber networks, Corning engineers knew they had to find a better way.

Answering the Customer’s Call
It may not seem like it now, but it wasn’t that long ago that fiber to the home (FTTH) was in its infancy. There were no mass deployments, no customized products, and no recommended or common installation procedures. While Corning had been preparing for FTTH deployments for many years, we hadn’t yet had the opportunity to work with a customer and realize the vision of taking optical fiber all the way to the end customer. That changed when the first major carrier announced its plans to deploy FTTH technology.
With this announcement, we got to work, hand-in-hand with our customer. Our goal was to merge our expertise in fiber optics with the customer’s need for a reliable, future-ready product that could be deployed rapidly to allow for large-scale FTTH deployments. The result: The FlexNAP™ system, which uses standard optical fiber cables with network access points pre-installed at customer-specified locations along the length of the cable. With this product, we were able to bring the life-enhancing benefits of optical fiber to the customer, with deployments several times faster than traditional field installations.
Together with our customer, we developed a product that revolutionized FTTH delivery and is still an essential element in many FTTH deployments today.
