Lectra Announces the Launch of Lectra Fashion PLM 4.0 to Navigate the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Thrive in the Digital Era of Fashion
Jun 7 17
Lectra announced the launch of Lectra Fashion PLM 4.0, the product lifecycle management solution designed to help fashion and apparel companies navigate the fourth industrial revolution and thrive in the digital era of fashion. With digitalization transforming the way consumers shop, today's fashion companies are playing a never-ending game of catch-up, as they compete for the attention of a generation of connected, fickle-minded millennials who want it all: personalization, sustainability, quality and speed, accessible at all times, across multiple channels, and at the lowest price. Industry 4.0 is not only revolutionizing how manufacturers operate, but also how brands and retailers need to function, if they want to be fast and agile enough to meet the needs of this demanding new consumer. The stakes are high and how effectively companies harness technology to put the consumer at the heart of their process will be the deciding factor in who comes out ahead and who gets left behind. Lectra Fashion PLM 4.0 has undergone a drastic reboot to give fashion and apparel companies the speed and agility they need to tackle the challenges of Industry 4.0 head on. Lectra Fashion PLM 4.0, with the widest functional scope on the market, acts as an intelligent nerve center to the digital supply chain, from planning through design to production. This ensures a consistent flow of error-free data between processes, technologies and people. The system connects CAD, industry-standard software such as Adobe Illustrator, company IT systems (such as ERP) and external suppliers, so that actors across the supply chain can work on, save and share information on the platform, ensuring data integrity. The solution also draws on best practices, fashion-business intelligence and real-world scenarios to automate administrative and repetitive tasks, with templates, standard libraries and shortcuts that allows more time for value-added activities. The final result is a fast, connected digital supply chain that helps fashion companies jump on trends quickly and deliver products that fulfill their customer's expectations. This new incarnation of Lectra Fashion PLM is designed to work out of the box and can be scaled to accommodate the different needs of small to large businesses, brands, retailers and manufacturers. Companies can start small by implementing the standard offer, then add on as they go, choosing from up to ten different modules, such as design integration, product details, sourcing, sampling and costing.

Lectra (EPA:LSS Euronext Paris) is an industry-leading technology company[1][2] based in Paris, France.[3][4] Lectra specializes in CAD and CAM systems for soft material industries[5][6] and operates 32 subsidiaries around the world.[7] The company develops software, hardware, consulting and associated services for organizations in industries including fashion and apparel, automotive, furniture and others.
History[edit]
Lectra was founded in 1973 by engineers Jean and Bernard Etcheparre. The first machine enabled a piece of clothing to be cut in all sizes from a cardboard pattern. The company launched its first CAD systems for apparel making in 1976. Venture capitalist André Harari met the two founders and raised the capital needed to implement Lectra’s business development plan. In 1980, Lectra established its first foreign subsidiary in Germany followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and the United States in 1982.[8]
By 1986, Lectra was the world’s leading CAD and CAM systems provider and the company had its initial public offering the following year. After financial troubles in the early 1990s, the company was recapitalized by Daniel and André Harari.[8][9] In 2014, Lectra partnered with ESCP Europe to establish a chair in Fashion and Technology on its Paris campus for fashion and luxury sector innovation research.[10]
Overview[edit]
Lectra develops software, hardware, consulting and associated services to a broad array of major markets.[11] Lectra is an industry-leading company in integrated technology for industries using soft materials,[6] including fashion (apparel, accessories, footwear), automotive (car seats and interiors, airbags, furniture), as well as a wide range of other industries such as the aeronautical and marine industries.[12] Lectra has over 23,000 clients in over a hundred countries including companies such as Louis Vuitton, Hermès and H&M.[13]
Lectra initially launched its Modaris software in 1984. Its onscreen pattern modification and design systems are widely used in the textile industry, including fashion schools and colleges.[14] Vector, Lectra's fabric-cutting technology, was introduced in 1993. The company first launched its product life-cycle management (PLM) software in 2006. It manages the life cycles of products and collections through software from development to production.[9] In 2011, Lectra launched its leather-cutting technology Versalis for the automotive, furniture and fashion industries.[15] Versalis, the fastest leather-cutting solution in the industry, replaces leather-cutting typically done by hand with software and machinery that automates the process.[16]

Only Lectra for new DFM production plant







      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    

      Contact - Lectra Headquarters / Press Dept.: Nathalie Fournier-Christol

      Only Lectra for new DFM production plant
    

      Lectra's process expertise-and Versalis® solution-ramp up production capacity and reduce leather consumption for Poland-based upholstered furniture manufacturer DFM
    

      Paris, November 3 - Lectra, the world leader in integrated technology solutions dedicated to industries using fabrics, leather, technical textiles and composite materials, is pleased to announce that DFM Sp. z o.o-based in Dobre Miasto, in the Mazuria region of Poland-has chosen Lectra's Versalis® leather cutting solution to boost the company's production capacity.
    

      Managed by a team with over 30 years of industry experience, DFM produces furniture-
    

      from initial concept to finished product-for customers from North America and most of Europe. DFM has been a Lectra customer from its opening. In 2015, the company enlarged its operations to include creating furniture for its own brands. To fulfill the growing list of orders, DFM recently constructed a six hectare extension onto the plant, upgraded the existing machinery and equipped the cutting room solely with Lectra solutions, including two Versalis Furniture cutting solutions.
    

      "Offering our customers high-quality furniture and punctual delivery are DFM's top priorities. Implementing the most efficient processes and equipping our plant with the best technology available is the best means to continue to achieve these objectives," says Roman Dariusz Kołakowski, CEO, DFM.
    

      Prior to acquiring Versalis, DFM's operators used a combination of manual and automated leather cutting. Switching to Versalis is an integral component of the company's strategy to guarantee maximum production efficiency and significant material savings. As leather costs rise and lead times shorten, using a manual cutting process has become impractical. With Versalis, DFM can eliminate manual cutting.
    

      "As a long-time Lectra customer, we knew that their combination of advanced technology, services and cutting-room expertise would help us transform the way we work and ensure maximum cutting-room efficiency over the long term," concludes Roman Dariusz Kołakowski.
    

      Within the first few months of using Versalis, DFM reduced hide consumption by approximately 5 percent, significantly surpassing the savings expected following the preliminary return on investment calculation. Thanks to Versalis' offline process, which separates the hide analysis, nesting and cutting phases, the company optimized nesting without affecting productivity.
    

      In addition to improving material use, Versalis enables the company to optimize human resources by reducing the number of operators in the leather cutting room, and assigning them to departments where they have more value.

      Process improvements will not only be limited to leather cutting. Already equipped with Lectra's marker- making software, Diamino® Furniture, its pattern-making software, Formaris® Furniture, and a Vector® fabric cutting solution, DFM now benefits from having its entire production based on a single, unified solution. This will facilitate communication and data-sharing between teams.
    

      "Polish manufacturers are the cornerstone of the European upholstered furniture manufacturing industry and are quickly becoming major players in the global furniture market. Lectra is proud to share its expertise and technology with companies like DFM, whose dynamism and growth positively impact not just the company itself but the whole industry," states Céline Choussy Bedouet, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Lectra.
    

      About DFM
