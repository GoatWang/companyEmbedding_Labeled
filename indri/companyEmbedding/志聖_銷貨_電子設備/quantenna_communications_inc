Quantenna Announces World’s First 802.11ac 10G Wave 3 Wi-Fi Product Line


World’s Fastest 10Gbps Family for Wi-Fi Access Points Features True 8x8™ and MIMO for 5GHz and 2.4GHz to Manage High-Density Wireless Networks
FREMONT, Calif., Sept. 9, 2015 -- IBC2015 -- Quantenna Communications, Inc.. the leader in ultra-high performance Wi-Fi, today announced the availability of the industry’s first 10G Wave 3 Wi-Fi product family. The products are built on Quantenna’s True 8x8™ QSR10G Wi-Fi platform with multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology for home wireless access points and residential gateways. Quantenna’s up-to-12-streams 10G Wave 3 product family delivers unprecedented Wi-Fi performance, reliability and capacity for high-density environments, and can address both the service provider and retail market segments.

10G Wave 3 is a revolutionary new way for Wi-Fi networks to operate. As Wi-Fi usage continues to explode, 10G Wave 3 provides the flexibility and scalability to meet the growing demand for Wi-Fi capacity. Quantenna is the first and only company implementing 10G Wave 3 to support speeds up to 10Gbps. This milestone speed benchmark for Wi-Fi is attained by combining the industry’s first True 8x8™ MIMO configuration for 5GHz networks with a 4x4 MIMO configuration on 2.4GHz networks for a combined 12-stream configuration.

Quantenna’s 10G Wave 3 platform delivers the maximum capacity within the minimum spectrum so that more streams can be simultaneously transmitted with improved range and reliability. This means that 802.11 Wi-Fi access points or gateways using Quantenna’s 10G Wave 3 product family can support more clients, each running more efficiently for such demanding applications as real-time video, OTT video, voice, IoT and other services. Even single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), 1x1 and 2x2 client performance is vastly improved, ensuring that the millions of currently shipping mainstream smart phones, tablets and notebook PCs will also benefit from an improved Wi-Fi experience.

According to ABI Research, over 1.5 billion products with 802.11ac will ship worldwide by the end of 2015. “Shipments of devices which support the 802.11ac standard grew significantly in 2014 and 2015,” said ABI Research Director Philip Solis. “Rising demand for home access points that can manage and support the dozens of Wi-Fi devices is generating an immense opportunity for leading component suppliers, such as Quantenna, who are early to market with innovative solutions.”

The QSR10G Wave 3 product family also supports a unique adaptive MIMO architecture. This enables 10G Wave 3 access points to maximize overall network performance, delivering the best possible capacity across all client devices. This is important as the mix of legacy and new client devices are changing, as end consumers adopt more devices with 802.11ac.

“In Wi-Fi access points more antennas are always better, but 10G Wave 3 is not just about 8x8 MU-MIMO and faster speeds. It’s about making better use of network and airtime efficiency to support the growing number of connected devices, services and applications,” said Dr. Sam Heidari, Quantenna CEO. “After pioneering the Wi-Fi industry with 4x4 MIMO, we’ve gained a deep understanding of real-world channel behavior in crowded environments. These insights have led to the creation of 10G Wave 3 and the world’s first 8x8 MIMO, which are poised to revolutionize the Wi-Fi experience.”

In addition, 10G Wave 3 allows access points to support up to four simultaneous Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) clients per group. This means more total system capacity and aggregate throughput can be supported - a trend that continues unabated, as the number of clients increases per household over time. More consumers will experience the fastest, most reliable video streaming experience, faster downloads and uploads, and better performance even at extremely long distances, in challenging high-density Wi-Fi home environments and outdoor applications like Wi-Fi hotspots.

Quantenna Announces QSR5G-AX, an 802.11ax Dual 4x4 Wi-Fi Access Point Solution targeting the Mainstream Wi-Fi Segment
New QSR5G-AX Access Point Solution Complements Best-in-Class QSR10G-AX 12-Stream Solution Announced in Oct 2016

LAS VEGAS, Jan.  05, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quantenna Communications, Inc. (Nasdaq:QTNA), a leading provider of high performance Wi-Fi solutions, today announced a new 802.11ax product called QSR5G-AX with support for dual-band, dual concurrent 4x4 + 4x4 operation. This product joins Quantenna's QSR10G-AX, the world's first dual-band, dual concurrent 8x8 + 4x4 802.11ax 12-stream Access Point solution previously announced in October 2016.
"802.11ax advancements promise to expand the Wi-Fi market particularly in segments where there are higher user densities such as the home, enterprise and public venues. We estimate that the total 802.11ax enabled device shipments will increase from 116 thousand units in 2019 to 58 million units in 2021*," said Christian Kim, Senior Analyst IoT, Connectivity, and Telecom Electronics at IHS Markit. As service providers and device manufacturers bring increasing bandwidth and services to the home, consumer demand for faster and more robust Wi-Fi continues to rise. Wi-Fi must continue to support an ever increasing array of mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and do so more efficiently in denser environments, such as multi-dwelling units (MDUs). 802.11ax is designed to address these demands through improved bandwidth 
efficiency. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is added in order to allow simultaneous operation of many clients which increases overall network capacity. In addition, network efficiency is also improved as OFDMA preambles (the portion of the frame used for network synchronization) can be shared amongst all client devices. Since OFDMA is a scheduler-based approach, there is less contention between client devices and the access points for access to the air. Therefore, the 802.11ax access point allows client devices to have longer sleep times enabling extended battery life. Finally, 802.11ax allows these improvements in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, supporting applications that need long range in 2.4GHz frequencies as well as applications which demand higher speed and denser network coverage in the 5GHz frequencies. The QSR5G-AX solution supports 8 total streams of 
802.11ax: 4 streams in the 5GHz band and 4 streams in the 2.4GHz band. QSR5G-AX joins Quantenna's 12-stream QSR10G-AX chipset to form a complete family of 802.11ax access point solutions that address both mainstream and high-end markets. These 802.11ax access point solutions are designed to be compatible to both future 802.11ax client devices as well as existing Wi-Fi client devices such as Quantenna's best-in-class 802.11ac/n/a/g/b solutions. "802.11ax is the future of Wi-Fi," said Dr. Sam Heidari, Chairman and CEO at Quantenna. "We have applied our considerable expertise in RF, digital signal processing, Wi-Fi protocol and software to deliver the world's most compelling 802.11ax solutions. QSR5G-AX is the latest embodiment of our technology and expertise. We are proud to offer it to the market and continue

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures




	In addition to GAAP reporting, Quantenna provides information regarding net income, gross profit and operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes stock-based compensation expense. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company’s management for the purposes of evaluating the underlying operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, comparing performance with internal forecasts and goals, strategic planning, benchmarking against other companies, to provide a more consistent basis of comparison and to enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial tables included in this press release.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 In addition to GAAP reporting, Quantenna provides information regarding income, gross margin and operating expenses on a non-
 GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes stock-based compensation expense, which the Company’s management believes is
 not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are used by the Company’s management for
 purposes of evaluating the underlying operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, comparing performance
 with internal forecasts and goals, strategic planning, benchmarking against other companies, and to provide a more consistent basis
 of comparison and to enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to,
 and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP
 and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial tables included in this press release.
 Forward-Looking Statements
 This press release contains forward-looking statements based on Quantenna’s current expectations, including statements regarding
 Quantenna’s financial results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2017, expected future business and financial performance, growth 
opportunities, product technologies and customer relationships. The words "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," 
"plan," "project," "will" and similar phrases as they relate to Quantenna are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements reflect the current views and assumptions of Quantenna and are subject to various risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Among the factors that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are the following: risks that Quantenna may not be able to maintain 
its historical growth; quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results; ability to accurately predict future revenue and 
expenses; challenges developing new and leading edge products on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance; ability to attract 
and retain customers and service providers; dependence on a limited number of products and customers; intense market 
competition; intellectual property litigation risks; political uncertainty; potential changes in tax and other laws affecting Quantenna’s 
business; risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships; product liability risks; potential cancellation of 
customer orders; difficulties managing international operations; risks that Quantenna may not be able to manage strains associated 
with its growth; dependence on key personnel; stock price volatility; dependence on, and geographic concentration of, contract 
manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and other vendors that subject Quantenna's business and results of operations to risks 
of natural disasters, epidemics, war and political unrest; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, adjustments to the
 preliminary financial results reported in this press release and related earnings call announcement and materials for the first quarter 
2017 in connection with completion of the final closing process and procedures and preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-
 Q, and other factors that are detailed in the Securities and Exchange (“SEC”) filings of Quantenna Communications, Inc., which you 
may obtain for free at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Quantenna disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise 
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results
 of operations, business strategies, product development plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, use of
