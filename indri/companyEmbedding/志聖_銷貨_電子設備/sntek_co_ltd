R&D Total Solution for Solar Application

Features
Plasma Enhanced CVD is an excellent alternative for depositing a variety of thin films at lower temperature than those utilized in CVD reactors without setting for a lesser film quality. PECVD uses electrical energy to generate a glow Discharge(Plasma) in which the energy is transferred into a gas Mixture. Some of the desirable properties of PECVD films are good adhesion, low pinhole density, Good step coverage, and uniformity.
Specifications

Sample Size : 150mm x 150mm 
Power Source : RF 13.56MHz, VHF 60MHz
