Eclat Forever, Micro Engineering tie up for LCD equipment business

                        	Nov 25, 2004 Ι Industry In-Focus
Ι Electronics and Computers Ι By Quincy,  CENS
                            










Chairman Chou Kun-lin of Eclat Forever (right) and General Manager Hirotoshi Hiramoto Micro Engineering Taiwan Inc. shake hands with each other after signing the cooperation pact.Taipei, Nov. 25, 2004 (CENS)--Taiwan's Eclat Forever Machinery Co., Ltd., which specializes in making liquid crystal display (LCD) rear-section cleaning and wet-production process equipment, has recently signed a technical cooperation pact with Micro Engineering of Japan to handle contract production of LCD manufacturing equipment for the Japanese firm. 

Both sides reached the cooperation agreement following three years of negotiations. Eclat Forever will introduce relevant technologies from the Japanese partner for contract production of the equipment for sales in Taiwan and mainland China. 

Eclat Forever has allowed Micro Engineering to hold a certain stake in it and will mull granting one board seat to the Japanese partner if the cooperation fares smoothly. 

According to Chou Kun-lin, chairman of Eclat Forever, Taiwan's LCD equipment makers boast good technical capability but most of them are operating on a small scale. He urged the makers to further sharpen their technical and marketing abilities so as to develop overseas sales. 

Chou also stressed that local equipment makers should continue cultivating technical professionals and build technical cooperation ties with foreign partners so as to win more opportunities for cooperating with big international equipment brands. 

Riding on strong demands from local thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panel makers, Eclat Forever scored revenue of over NT$500 million (US$15.38 million at US$1: NT$32.5) in the first three quarters and expects to rake in total revenue of NT$600 million (US$18.46 million) this year, two to three times the corresponding figures for the past few years. 

Most local makers of large-sized TFT-LCD panels adopt equipment made by Eclat Forever, including AU Optronics Corp. (AUO), Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. (CMO), Chunghwa Picture Tubes, Ltd. (CPT), Quanta Computer Inc. etc.
