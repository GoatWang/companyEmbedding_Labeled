BEWARE - Special Warning Notice about ExpoGuide and FAIRGuide
With the ongoing solicitations, SEMI would like to continue to alert you the two organizations soliciting internet Event Directory listing information in a misleading manner. The two organizations are Mexican based, ExpoGuide and Austrian based, FAIRGuide. This is an ongoing issue and is not related to the SEMICON Event Guide. Both the Expo-Guide.com and FAIRGuide are not endorsed or supported by SEMI Show Management. By submititing these forms, exhibitors are contracted into a three-year, non-retractable agreement with excessive fees.
