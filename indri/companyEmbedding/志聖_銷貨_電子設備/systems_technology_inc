Features
Connection Technology System SFP (Small Form-factor Plug-in) transceivers can be mixed and matched on a given switch to maximize flexibility. However, the connection and associated port at the remote end must match the chosen SFP connection type. CTS SFP transceivers can be used in those CTS Switches and Converters which support SFP modules.

Case Shaker








The case shaker is an automatic system designed to settle and produce a uniform distribution of bulk fill product and allow for efficient compaction of a case in minimum time.  The case shaker is fully adjustable to settle and compact a wide range of cases and can be fully integrated into any packaging system. Mild or 304 stainless steel offers a sanitary heavy duty design and is ideal for food applications as well as bread and bakery products, frozen foods, pharmaceuticals, powder and granule items, fasteners, and weigh & filling systems.

Square Roller








System Technology, Inc. is proud to introduce our new and improved Square Roller Conveyor. Designed by our innovative and forward-thinking engineers, the Square Roller is able to perform the function of two separate machines while giving you maximum performance from one. Conveying and settling product in this compact design allows you to save time and space while modernizing your packaging system.  The square roller acts as a mover and a shaker as the case bounces along, pushing the case forward, while effectively compacting and settling the contents.

Vibration Feeder








The Vibration Feeder Conveyor is designed to settle cases prior to closing and producing a dense and uniform distribution for bulk fill products. This space saving unit allows for maximum compaction in the least amount of time. Powered by two eccentric vibratory motors the Vibration Feeder Conveyor produces a smooth motion that is fully adjustable. Fully customizable,  and easily integrated into any packaging system, the Vibration Feeder Conveyor is perfect for bread and bakery products, weigh and filling systems, powder and granule products, frozen foods, pharmaceuticals, and many other products.
