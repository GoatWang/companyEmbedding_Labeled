氟化橡膠 Fluoroelastomer, FKM




氟橡膠FKM，於不同的廠牌有不同的商品名。美商杜邦TM的FKM商品名為Viton®，美商3MTM公司的FKM商品名則為DyneonTM; 日商Daikin®的商品名則為DAI-EL®，而同為日商的旭硝子®則以Aflas®為商品名在市場上販售。過去，使用者經常誤以為Viton®即是FKM，實為長久以來的習慣所造成的誤解。FKM為一種全合成之高分子彈性體材質，其主鏈或側鏈的碳原子與氟原子鍵結。氟橡膠為全合成橡膠，與其他橡膠材料相較，氟化橡膠在物理特性上具有較高之拉伸強度及結構強度，耐高溫，靜密封使用可在攝氏230度環境下長時工作，瞬時高溫更可達攝氏250度。抗化性上，氟化橡膠具有極佳之耐腐蝕性，對於有機溶劑，有無機酸類，強氧化劑，及油脂類的耐腐蝕性均優於其他種類橡膠。除此之外，氟化橡膠之氣密性，耐候性，耐燃性，耐輻射性及耐真空性亦優於其他彈性體材料，故廣泛應用於航空，國防，機械，汽車，化工等工業領域中。 
 
FKM的成品一般指的是含氟量66%的氟橡膠，也就是ㄧ般俗稱的Viton®。事實上氟橡膠也有高氟的成品，其含氟量介於67-70%之間，相對於一般含氟量的FKM來說，具有更強的抗化性與物理性質，但相對售價也偏高，應用於對使用環境要求更高的的領域中。不同廠牌的氟橡膠具備各自的特色，針對較高的耐溫與耐化性，以及耐高溫水氣等的不同需求，氟橡膠皆須透過混練廠調整FKM原膠材質與不同的佐劑而製造適合的商品。因此，如何挑選合適的氟橡膠產品仰賴的不僅是經驗，還有不同混練配方的測試，以求達成使用上的狀況需求。 
       
孚瑞科技自有橡膠混練廠房設備並專注投入FKM配方的研究與開發，以自有品牌Femrex™進行銷售FKM各式標準及訂製成品，我們有齊全的AS- 568A，JISB2401P，V，G，S模具。我們亦接受客戶指定所需的各型特種規格的FKM產品，不論是各種顏色，形式，硬度或各種環境需求的成品我們皆可配合客戶製作或開發。與鐵件接合的氟橡膠成品也是我們服務的項目，我們同時也能提供PTFE(鐵氟龍)及PFA包覆的密封件, FEP(氟樹脂)噴鍍的密封件。此外，針對特殊環境的氟橡膠使用，我們開發了一系列以Femrex Plus™為名的特殊氟橡膠系列，用以應付一般氟橡膠無法應付的環境。Femrex Plus™系列包含了高潔淨度低釋出的E-1375系列，特殊耐溫型氟橡膠E-1475系列，各項物化性更佳的高氟E-1575系列，還有，抗化性優異的氟橡膠E-1675系列，都提供了在特殊環境下的絕佳密封條件。  Femrex Plus™使用的原膠包含了含氟量較高的氟橡膠(FKM)或是不同於一般氟橡膠分子結構的原膠去進行混練，並從而調配出物理性質有別於一般氟橡膠的產品。相類似的產品在市面上多被過度包裝並與全氟橡膠(FFKM)進行比較，這樣的比較事實上是沒有意義的。因為密封件的材質選擇，不單單只看使用環境，很多時候，使用壽命也是一個重要的選擇要點。無論是哪一種氟橡膠產品，都有他擅長表現的環境狀態與相對應的疲態。全氟橡膠在潔淨度，使用壽命，耐溫耐化上，依然有其不可取代性。選擇上，我們多建議客戶與製造方多討論，必要的測試經常比書面文字更有效率。唯有將合適的材質應用在合適的應用範圍，方能在經濟考量上與期待的使用狀態上取得平衡。
