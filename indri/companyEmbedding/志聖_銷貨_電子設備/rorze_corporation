Long distance transfer of over 10m at high speed is made possible with the accurate rack-and-pinion robot transfer axis.
The cassette station has a segmented structure at each stage that facilitates compatibility with AGV, MGV. RGV and stockers.
The cassette positioning mechanism is equipped with a floating structure to control particles generated from the bottom of the cassette
Patented end effectots & know-how to manage low particle count with clean robot on a large unit.
