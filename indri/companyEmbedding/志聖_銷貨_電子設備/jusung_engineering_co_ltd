SDCVD Equipment


				[SDCVD Equipment]
			

				SDCVD (Space divided CVD-ALD) is one of the most advanced and promising thin film technologies. Thanks to
its superior film qualities including impurity-free film, excellent step coverage, good uniformity and lower process
temperature, SDCVD is expected to soon replace conventional thin film technologies such as CVD and PVD.
JUSUNG¡¯s development strategy is to advance hardware concepts to meet the requirements of micro device
makers. One of the unique hardware concepts is the singlewafer type, which is suitable for very thin film deposition
and integration with other thin film processes. Another new concept is the semi-batch type, which is
appropriate for thick film deposition and stand-alone processes. JUSUNG¡¯s system guarantees the highest
throughput with excellent film quality. 
(1) CYCLONE PLUS¢â SystemThe most significant disadvantage of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is low 
throughput. To maximize the throughput of ALD, JUSUNG has developed an innovative semi-batch type system 
with a five-wafer batch size. In addition, a rotating injector has been developed to cover a larger deposition area. 
The technical advantages of rotating injectors are good uniformity of gas distribution, higher deposition rate, and 
minimization of valve control.JUSUNG¡¯s CYCLONE PLUSTM system guarantees to deliver the world¡¯s highest 
throughput.
(2) EUREKA¢â System
JUSUNG has developed EUREKA¢â, a single wafer system with a unique injector and reactor. The injector is
located in the center of the top lid (the ¡°top injector¡±), and its structure is very simple compared to the shower 
head type. Due to the injector¡¯s small volume, it takes a relatively short time to purge the source and reactant. 
The reactor structure is also much simpler than that of the laminar flow type ALD system. Therefore, this single 
wafer system guarantees easy maintenance, high reliability and repeatability. Another important advantage 
of this system isthat it performs both pure and pseudo ALD processes, while the shower head and laminar 
flow types can only perform either the pseudo or pure process.

SDPCVD (Space Divided Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition)


				[SDPCVD]
			

				Developed by Jusung Engineering, SDPCVD (Space Divided Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition) is considered to be one of the most advanced and promising technologies as the system can handle all of the deposition processes by PECVD,
LPCVD and ALD.

SDPCVD can replace PECVD and LPCVD at the same time. In combination with new-concept plasma technology, the SDPCVD provides improved productivity up to twice than PECVD and LPCVD. It is an innovative system designed to manage quality film coating even the temperature is below 400¡Æ by maximizing the merits of the ALD system and tackling PECVD system¡¯s drawback of wafer damage from plasma.

Given the large global market for PECVD, the LPCVD and ALD systems that the SDPCVD system can be replaced with amounts to about US$6 billion, the SDPCVD market is expected to rapidly catch up.

JUSUNG, which presented the SDPCVD system for the first time in SEMICON Korea that was held in Seoul earlier this year, will forge ahead with promoting its products overseas.

Jusung Engineering Co. Ltd. is a leading semiconductor equipment company that engages in developing, manufacturing, and selling semiconductor, display, and solar cell equipment in Korea. JUSUNG has internationally appreciated deposition technology which refers to a series of electrical film coating processes for display and solar cell and LED . OLED and is considered to be the crucial factor in deciding quality of the end products.
