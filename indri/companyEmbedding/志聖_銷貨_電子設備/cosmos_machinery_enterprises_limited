Company Description

      The history of Cosmos Group dates back to 1958 when it commenced trading in machine tools. Over the years, we have become one of the most successful machinery distributors in Hong Kong. Our business covers manufacturing of machinery and plastic products, trading of machinery and industrial consumable as well as environmental engineering. The successful listing of Cosmos Machinery Enterprises Limited ("the Company") on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited in 1988 marked a milestone in our growth. In 1997, we acquired Welltec Industrial Equipment Limited ("Welltec") and its subsidiaries - one of the most significant events in our corporate history. This exercise strengthened our manufacturing capabilities substantially, and today we are one of the largest manufacturers of plastic injection moulding machines in Hong Kong and the PRC. Following the acquisition of Welltec, China Resources (Holdings) Company Limited ("CRC") became a substantial shareholder of the Company. CRC's connections and network in China, together with its involvement in the management of Cosmos through their appointed representatives, will facilitate our exploring of new business opportunities.
