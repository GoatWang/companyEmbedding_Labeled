BH Telecom is a leading telecommunication company in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[2]
It was established during the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1992[3] and was the first company in Bosnia and Herzegovina to provide GSM, 3G, IPTV and many other services. It was a government-owned corporation whose sole proprietor was Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but since 2004 it is listed as a public company with most stock still owned by the government.[4] Although stock owners have both governance as well as ownership rights, the effect of such controlled distribution of capital is that company is effectively still directed and managed by the government, but funds and small shareholders are enabled to earn money on dividends and stock trading.

Company Profile[edit]
The General Directorate of the company is located in Sarajevo. The seven regional BH Telecom directorates are located on the territory of the whole Bosnia and Herzegovina, having their main offices in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Bihać, Travnik, Brčko and Goražde.[5] The company also includes the tenth biggest organizational unit in Bosnia and Herzegovina - Telecom Inženjering, with its main office in Sarajevo.[citation needed]
On December 31, 2003, the company had 3016 employees.[citation needed]
The company has been significantly characterized by: annual profit ower 40 million euro a developed technological infrastructure in all networks and own human and professional potentials.[citation needed]
Users of services of either fixed or mobile network of BH Telecom Sarajevo have been enabled to have a high quality telephony in local, toll and international traffic.[citation needed]
At the end of 2003, BH Telecom Sarajevo had 454 installed switches (98 HOSTs and 356 Remote Units, with totally 648.527 installed connections), having 86,3% digitalization.[citation needed] Transmission system of the company had 100% digitalization.[citation needed]
IN node was put into operation in 2003, allowing provision of new services to users.[citation needed]
Extending its Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) system and increasing the number of base stations in 2003, BH Telecom Sarajevo provided its users with better coverage of the BiH territory with GSM signal, and with even better quality of services than before. (Totally 346 BSs installed).[citation needed]
BH Telecom Sarajevo enabled its BIHNET users to have access to Internet via public switched telephone network, leased lines and ADSL access. In 2003 the company began with a major introduction of broadband technology, so, accordingly, ADSL service was at disposal to users in FBIH.
In May 2013, BH Telecom started implementing LTE (4G) technology.[6] but it will probably not be released before 2017.[7]

Sve ok, ali gdje su opcije za kvalitet?


            Zašto ne mogu odabrati HQ ili HD opciju, kao na web stranici? Sam program je dosta praktičniji od stranice, ali je beskoristan bez opcije za podešavanje kvaliteta. Nadam se da ćete to dodati u narednoj verziji.
