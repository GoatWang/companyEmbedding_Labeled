ABOUT VIVOCOM INTL HOLDINGS BERHAD


 




Instacom Group Berhad was established on 8 October 2012, when Instacom Engineering Sdn Bhd completed the restructuring and reverse take-over of I-Power Berhad. Consequently, I-Power Berhad changed its name to Instacom Group Berhad.

Instacom Group is an end to end solution provider for the telecommunication industry with more than 10 year of experience and proven track records in the telecommunication industry, where it has a strong foothold in providing telecommunications network services to the telecommunications carriers and operators all over Malaysia. In addition, the Group also has close working relationship with major telecommunications infrastructure, hardware and equipment market players, which put the Group in a good position to undertake subcontract telecommunications network services related jobs from these telecommunications infrastructure, hardware and equipment market players.

On 30 January 2015, the Group had completed the acquisition of 35% equity in Neata Group, which comprised Aluminium (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd ("Neata”) and its wholly owned subsidiary company, Vivocom Enterprise Sdn Bhd. On 5 November 2015, the Group increased its holding in Neata by acquiring a further 43.6% of the share equity of Neata, there making the Neata a subsidiary unit of the Group. This acquisition would give Instacom Group a strong foothold in the robust and growing construction industry.

On 14 January 2016, Instacom Group Berhad changed its name to VIVOCOM INTL HOLDINGS BERHAD. The change of name is to strengthen the Group’s brand image and to better reflect the Group’s focus and aspiration to be a regional construction company.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
