VILNIUS, Lithuania--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      TEO will offer the fastest fiber-optic Internet services in Lithuania
    

      In March, TEO LT, AB, the largest provider of integrated 
      telecommunication, IT and TV services in Lithuania, will offer 
      residential customers the fastest, up to 200 Mbps (Megabits per second), 
      Internet access services in Lithuania. The new ZEBRA Internet plan will 
      be available for use to the large number of customers using the 
      fiber-optic network services of TEO.
    

      The New-generation fiber-optic access network, which is being actively 
      implemented by TEO, currently operates in more than thirty cities of 
      Lithuania. It is being developed at the fastest rate in the country’s 
      biggest cities – it is estimated that by the end of 2010 it will be 
      available for use to approximately 95 percent residents of Vilnius and 
      Klaipeda, 70 percent residents of Kaunas, half of Siauliai residents, 
      and a third of Panevezys residents.
    

      During the past three years, TEO has invested around LTL 160 million in 
      the New-generation fiber-optic access network. Its services are 
      currently used by more than 62 thousand customers and, according to 
      forecasts, their number will grow to more than 100 thousand by the end 
      of the year.
    

      Lithuania is one of the European Union countries most rapidly 
      implementing fiber-optic technologies, which currently are among the 
      most state-of-the-art in the world. At present, the FTTH (Fiber to the 
      Home) network is available to nearly one-third of Lithuanian residents.
    

      From March, TEO also intends to increase the speed of international 
      Internet connection provided to the residential users of ZEBRA Internet 
      services by up to 10 times. By the end of the year it is planned to 
      increase the total speed of TEO international Internet traffic by more 
      than double – up to 48 Gbps. According to research data, the speed of 
      international Internet connection is one of the three most important 
      criteria when selecting an Internet service provider.
    

      At present, TEO Internet services are used by more than 313 thousand 
      customers.

TEO LT, AB
Product Launch


      Product Launch
    

      TEO LT, AB



      TEO will offer the fastest fiber-optic Internet services in Lithuania
    

      In March, TEO LT, AB, the largest provider of integrated 
      telecommunication, IT and TV services in Lithuania, will offer 
      residential customers the fastest, up to 200 Mbps (Megabits per second), 
      Internet access services in Lithuania. The new ZEBRA Internet plan will 
      be available for use to the large number of customers using the 
      fiber-optic network services of TEO.
    

      The New-generation fiber-optic access network, which is being actively 
      implemented by TEO, currently operates in more than thirty cities of 
      Lithuania. It is being developed at the fastest rate in the country’s 
      biggest cities – it is estimated that by the end of 2010 it will be 
      available for use to approximately 95 percent residents of Vilnius and 
      Klaipeda, 70 percent residents of Kaunas, half of Siauliai residents, 
      and a third of Panevezys residents.
    

      During the past three years, TEO has invested around LTL 160 million in 
      the New-generation fiber-optic access network. Its services are 
      currently used by more than 62 thousand customers and, according to 
      forecasts, their number will grow to more than 100 thousand by the end 
      of the year.
    

      Lithuania is one of the European Union countries most rapidly 
      implementing fiber-optic technologies, which currently are among the 
      most state-of-the-art in the world. At present, the FTTH (Fiber to the 
      Home) network is available to nearly one-third of Lithuanian residents.
    

      From March, TEO also intends to increase the speed of international 
      Internet connection provided to the residential users of ZEBRA Internet 
      services by up to 10 times. By the end of the year it is planned to 
      increase the total speed of TEO international Internet traffic by more 
      than double – up to 48 Gbps. According to research data, the speed of 
      international Internet connection is one of the three most important 
      criteria when selecting an Internet service provider.
    

      At present, TEO Internet services are used by more than 313 thousand 
      customers.
