John Cooper Works








A LEGEND IS BORN.







Around 50 years ago the course of history was changed forever. Mini suddenly burst onto the motorsport rally scene annihilating the much bigger and established competition – much to their shock. Legendary racing car pioneer, John Cooper had taken his hand to the iconic little car and transformed it into a champion. It was the beginning of a highly successful partnership between Mini and John Cooper. One whose legacy lives on to this day in John Cooper Works.

Rallye Dakar 2016








TOP SPOTS.







2015 winner, Nasser Al-Attiyah, was once again a force to be reckoned with in the gruelling cross-country race. Finishing 2nd overall and winning in the four-wheel drive category, he was closely followed by the other three MINI ALL4 teams, who all earned places in the top 10. The Finn, Mikko Hirvonen finished an impressive fourth overall and claimed the award for Best Rookie.

Restoring one of the oldest classic MINIs








The rediscovery of a legend.






In a surprise find, one of the very first Minis ever made was recently discovered in a barn in the Netherlands. Thanks to the MINI ReBorn project, this historical treasure was lovingly restored to its former glory with the help of an expert team and the MINI community. You can read all about its amazing resurrection story here.

JOHN COOPER WORKS








INSPIRED BY A LEGEND







The association with racing legend John Cooper began over 50 years ago, when this performance pioneer developed the original Mini into the track-ready Mini Cooper. With a powerful new engine and uprated brakes, a speed demon was born: one that could be enjoyed by the public and rally drivers alike.

John Cooper Works is available throughout the MINI range on the 3-door Hatch, Convertible, Clubman and Countryman models.

The World's First True Android PC
Powered by Remix OS, Remix Mini allows you to work and play with the entire Android app ecosystem while taking full advantage of intuitive PC features such as a taskbar, multiple window multi-tasking, mouse and keyboard support,and so much more.








Size matters.
But not in the traditional PC sense. While everyone else is spending top dollar for the latest and greatest hardware specs just to check their email and watch Youtube videos, we realized that there's SO much more to creating a great PC. Through its carefully engineered optimization of hardware and software, Remix Mini is able to undeniably live up to its motto:less can be more.






64-bits of effortless.
Remix Mini is powered by the latest 64-bit chipset and delivers up to 20-30% better performance than its 32-bit counterparts. At the core of what makes this so special is actually what Remix Mini doesn't need you to do. You will never have to worry about whether you're installing the right bit version ever again. With Android, it all just works.


Less energy, more efficiency.
The typical desktop computer clocks in at anywhere between 65 to 250 watts. Remix Mini gives you the same power of desktop computing at a mere 10 watts. By simply leveraging already existing power efficiencies found in mobile CPU architectures, Remix Mini is able to save you so much more in power without sacrificing anything in performance.





The power of touch.
Remix Mini features a capacitive touch power button unlike any PC of its kind. Rather than awkwardly feeling around the back panel for that elusive power button, just gently tap the top of your Mini. Within seconds you'll be able to start doing what you need to do.







Stay connected. In every way.
Even at its small size, Remix Mini comes equipped with everything you need in order to stay connected: WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, and USB. All of these options gives Remix Mini an unprecedented level of versatility in a variety of scenarios.





Your Mini. Your choice.
To whom much is given, much is expected. Remix Mini comes in two versions. Both run Remix OS smoothly, but vary depending on how you plan on using your Mini. 
As a home media center, the 1G RAM + 8 GB storage gives you more than what you need to stream and download that blockbuster movie you've been dying to see. Now, if you're looking for something with a bit more kick and productivity in mind, we highly recommend the 2G RAM + 16GB storage version. No matter what you decide, the choice will quite literally be in your hands.







Remix OS. Android re-engineered for PC.
At the core of Remix Mini is our custom engineered version of Android Lollipop - Remix OS. Our state of the art operating system is the cornerstone to all of our hardware. With its multitude of productivity oriented features combined with over 1.6 million apps, Remix OS seamlessly merges functionality, ease of use, and beauty in amazing ways to give you an unforgettable Android experience.

A list of products made by Yamaha Corporation. Please note that many of the items listed here are no longer in production. For example, the YAS-21 student-grade alto saxophone of the 1970s was superseded by the YAS-23 and YAS-25 saxophones during the 1990s. When manufacture of the YAS-23 and YAS-25 ended they were superseded by the YAS-275, which was in production as of 2010, but was eventually replaced by the YAS-280.

Organs[edit]




Yamaha organ (1888–)



Nishikawa organ (left, 1884–c.1936)




Reed organs[edit]
In 1888, Yamaha started to manufacture the reed organs.
In 1921, Yamaha acquired the Nishikawa & Sons in Yokohama after a death of its founder, and continued to manufacture the Nishikawa organs and pianos until 1936.


Magna organ (1935–?)










Yamaha Magna Organ & Tone Cabinet (1935)


Magna organ[3][4] seems to be a multi-timbral keyboard instrument based on electrically blown free reeds with pickups, and possibly similar to the electrostatic reed organs developed by Frederick Albert Hoschke in 1934 then manufactured by Everett and Wurlitzer until 1961.
