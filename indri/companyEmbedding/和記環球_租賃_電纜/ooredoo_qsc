History[edit]




Alternate logo


Qtel was founded in Doha in 1987 initially as a telephone exchange company. It has since grown to become the largest communications operator in Qatar offering new technologies to the country including mobile, broadband, digital, and fiber services. The publicly traded company has ownership from the royal family with H.E. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed Bin Saud Al Thani as the company's chairman is and Sheikh Saud Bin Nasser Al Thani as its CEO. Q-Tel's COO is Waleed Al-Sayed.
Qtel Group and all its operating companies worldwide were officially unified under Ooredoo Group in February 2013, as part of the company's strategy to combine its assets in order to form a global business within the telecommunications industry.[5] The name Ooredoo is Arabic for "I Want", chosen "to reflect the aspirations of Ooredoo customers and the core belief that Ooredoo can enrich people's lives and stimulate human growth in the communities where it operates."[6]
Ooredoo has experienced significant growth over the last six years, transforming from a single market operator in Qatar to an international communications company with a global customer base of more than 114 million customers worldwide (as of September 2015)[3] and consolidated revenues of QAR 24.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015.
In 2010 the company upgraded its 3G network in the country and launched its Mobile Money service. By 2012, its network grew with its fiber network that provided services with download speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s, HDTV, and its initial phase of its 4G LTE mobile broadband service. The company's consumer base has grown significantly in recent times, from 1.9 million subscribers in 2008 to 2.5 million in 2012 within Qatar. Its annual revenues increased by QAR 3.5 billion from 2012 to 2013 in a single quarter.[7]
Citing strong organic growth, prudent investments and the growth and loyalty of its customers, Ooredoo has been the fastest-growing telecommunications company in the world by revenue since 2006 and its enterprise value has more than tripled since 2005.[5]
Current standing[edit]
In the last two years the company has developed a strong partnership with Nokia in Qatar. In May 2016, the firm expanded this partnership with Nokia in a three-year deal to develop a nationwide mobile network in Qatar.[8] The firm has also broadened its reach with its operations on over 16 countries across the GCC, Middle East, North Africa, and Asia regions.[9] As of 2013, the company unified under Ooredoo Group. Under this flagship, the firm has experienced significant growth with QAR 24.2 billion in revenues in the first 3 Quarters of 2015, and over 17,000 employees.

Chairman
Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed Bin Saud Al Thani
Sheikh Abdullah is the chairman of the board of directors for Ooredoo[10] and his main focus is the restructuring and regional expansion of Ooredoo.[11] Since the launch of Ooredoo's expansion strategy in 2005, Sheikh Abdullah has steered the growth of Ooredoo from being a single nation telecom operator to a group with a global presence in 17 countries, spanning from North Africa, Middle East to South East Asia.[11]
Sheikh Abdullah has played a key role in directing Ooredoo's growth and its vision of enriching people's lives along the way by using social impact to drive financial performance.[12] By working with widely respected international organisations, Sheikh Abdullah has supported Ooredoo's work across a series of key areas, including the empowerment of women and provision of mobile finance for the unbanked.

The double Nojoom point promotion with Seib Insurance and Reinsurance Company is back “due to popular demand”, Ooredoo has announced.
Ooredoo said in a statement yesterday that the first promotion, which was available earlier this year, saw a “huge response” as Nojoom members looked to be rewarded with double Nojoom points, as well as a “reduced insurance rate as low as 2.25%”, for purchasing insurance for their vehicle with Seib Insurance Company.
Nojoom members who purchase Seib motor insurance will also be able to take advantage of free roadside assistance in Qatar, a zero deductible on claims for new vehicles, the policy getting delivered to their door, and more.
The offer will be available for all Nojoom members until September 30. To take advantage of the promotion, members can visit Seib Insurance and Reinsurance Company at the Sheikh Jabor Bin Yousef Bin Jassem Al Thani Building on Airport Road.
Manar Khalifa al-Muraikhi, Ooredoo director of PR and Corporate Communications, said: “We’re proud to once again offer this promotion with Seib Insurance, and we hope all Nojoom members who missed out last time get the chance to take advantage of the double points and amazing benefits.”
For more information on Nojoom partners and how to enrol with Nojoom, customers can visit the Nojoom page of the Ooredoo website at www.ooredoo.qa/nojoom, download the Ooredoo app or visit any Ooredoo shop.

Qatar ‘driving force’ in interior design boom

Qatar’s building surge ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup has sparked a boom in interior design spend across the Gulf - with the region’s décor and fit-out market now worth almost $18bn per year.
A region-wide study commissioned by Index Qatar, a new interior design exhibition taking place in Doha this November, found that the State’s mammoth spend on infrastructure and real estate is helping skyrocket the value of the region’s interiors industry.
In the last year alone, the fit-out market has grown by more than $2.2bn, and is now estimated at being worth $17.7bn per annum.
The report, commissioned exclusively by Index and carried out by market analysts Ventures, concluded that interior design is one of the Gulf’s fastest growing industries.
A spokesperson for Ventures said: “Contractors should consider themselves fortunate to be in a region that is still very active compared to many other parts of the world, despite low oil prices.
“With the current slowdown in the market and the fast-approaching dates for the likes of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, developers and consultants are bound to turn their attention towards providing high-quality refurbishments to their existing projects, in turn fuelling the demand for interiors and fit-out contractors.
“The value of projects in the construction and interiors pipeline is four times the value of projects completed in the past 10 years.”
Index Qatar will bring together international product manufacturers and interior design firms at Doha Exhibition and Convention Centre from November 13 to 15, according to a press statement.
The show is expected to attract thousands of interior designers, architects, project managers, importers and distributors from the full spectrum of retail, hospitality, residential and commercial design.
With a weekly spend of more than $500mn being put into infrastructure projects ahead of Qatar taking centre-stage in 2022, Index arrives at an opportune time for designers looking to make the most of the country’s surging interiors market, itself valued at almost $3bn a year and growing, the statement notes.
Jaafar Shubber, Index Qatar event director, said: “The region, Qatar in particular, will play host to some of the world’s biggest events over the next decade, and the construction and redevelopment process for each of those is already well under way, across all sectors: hospitality, commercial real estate, retail, health and hospitals, and education. It’s hugely exciting.”
According to the report, the Gulf region’s interiors industry is valued at its highest within the building sector, where its annual worth is $9.2bn - up almost $1bn on last year. The commercial real estate ($1.1bn), hotel ($2.1bn), retail ($1.2bn), hospital ($667mn) and education ($452mn) sectors have all increased interiors investment since 2016. The residential sector remained buoyant with an annual value of more than $3bn.(c)  Gulf Times Newspaper 2017 Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.
