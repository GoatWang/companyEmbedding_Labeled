About Equities
Equities are securitized fractions of the registered capital of a stock corporation. Equities can be sold at a stock market, but don't have to. The exchange rates (prices) are determined by supply and demand. When selling shares, the bid site of the quote is important for investors and by purchase the ask-side. Once the buyer and the seller agree at a price and the quantity, a trade takes place and its coming to a turnover. Investors want a return on their investments; beside the gain also the devidant which was diced on the general meeting was relevant. The dividend is the part of the profit which will be distributed to the stockholders.
To further illustrate the development of other markets, equities are often divided into indices and form the image to the equity-market. The most important German indices are the DAX, TecDAX, MDAX, SDAX und DivDAX. There also exist the ökoDAX. The international equity-market is transparent by indices as the Dow Jones Industrial, Nikkei or the Nasdaq 100.
With the help of the ISIN or the WKN, equities can be identified and the value development can be displayed as charts for example on the website from Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange). The current status of the DAX, the most important German indice, is simultaneous the image for the German-Bluechip-equities. They are equities with a particularly high exchange value, whose company enjoy a high recognition.
On the trading venue XETRA investors can trade 1.000 German equities and 11.000 international equities. Stock corporations have the possibility to list in three different transparency standards at Frankfurt Stock Exchange: Prime Standard, General Standard or Open Market, whereby the transparency obligations in the Open Market are lower.
