History[edit]
Nationalised service (1970s–1980s)[edit]
In 1792, under the French Revolution, the first communication network was developed to enable the rapid transmission of information in a warring and unsafe country. That was the optical telegraphy network of Claude Chappe.
In 1878, after the invention of the electrical telegraph and then the invention of the telephone, the French State created a Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Telephone Services were added to the ministry when they were nationalised in 1889. However, it was not until 1923 that the second 'T' (for 'telephones') appeared and the department of P&T became PTT.
In 1941, a General Direction of Telecommunications was created within this ministry. Then, in 1944, the National Centre of Telecommunications Studies (CNET) was created to develop the telecommunications industry in France.
In the 1970s, France tried extra hard to make up its delay on other countries with the programme "delta LP" (increasing the main lines). It was at the time when the majority of the local loop was built; that is all the cables linking the users to the operator. Moreover, with the help of French manufacturers, digital switching, the Minitel and the GSM standard were invented by engineers and CNET researchers.
Creation of France Télécom (1988–1997)[edit]
Until 1988, France Télécom was known as the Direction Générale des Télécommunications, a division of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It became autonomous in 1990. This was in response to a European directive, aimed at making competition mandatory in public services from 1 January 1998. The 2 July 1990 Bill changed France Télécom into an operator of public law, with Marcel Roulet the first Chairman. Since then, the company has had a separate body corporate from the State and acquired financial autonomy. It was privatised by Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government starting on 1 January 1998. The French government, both directly and through its holding company ERAP, continues to hold a stake of almost 27% in the company. In addition, the government Conseil of Ministers names the CEO.[7] In 1982 Telecom introduced Minitel online ordering for its customers. In September 1995, Michel Bon was appointed to run France Télécom Group.
'Roaring Nineties' (1997–2000)[edit]
In 1997, the capital of the new public company was successfully floated whereas the dot-com bubble phenomenon made the stock exchanges bullish. A second share offering occurred in 1998. France Télécom got behind in the internationalization launched by its international competitors such as Vodafone, thus, it started looking for targets at the highest speculation rate of the dot-com bubble. Moreover, its alliance with Deutsche Telekom based on a reciprocal capital contribution of 2% broke off when Deutsche Telekom announced that they were planning to do business with Telecom Italia without letting the French know – even if this project ended up failing.
Acquisition of Orange and privatization[edit]
See also: Orange (UK) § History

In July 1991, Hutchison Telecom, a UK subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications Ltd, who by then had acquired a license to develop a mobile network in the United Kingdom.[8][9][10] Hutchison renamed Microtel to Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd, and on 28 April 1994 the Orange brand was launched in the UK mobile phone market. A holding company structure was adopted in 1995 with the establishment of Orange plc. In April 1996, Orange went public and floated on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ,[11] majority owned by Hutchison (48.22%),[12][13] followed by BAe (21.1%).[11] In June 1996, it became the youngest company to enter the FTSE 100, valued at £2.4 billion. By July 1997, the company's growth strategy paid off and Orange reached one million customers with the lowest churn rate and best profit margins compared to its competitors.[citation needed]
In October 1999 the German conglomerate Mannesmann AG acquired Orange for a price equivalent to €7,900 per customer, i.e. US$33 billion.[14][15][16] Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange triggered Vodafone to make a hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann. Shortly thereafter, in February 2000, Vodafone acquired Mannesmann for US$183 billion, and decided to divest Orange because the EU regulations wouldn't allow it to hold two mobile licences.[17]
In August 2000, France Télécom bought Orange plc from Vodafone for a total estimated cost of €39.7 billion.[18][19][20] At the time, France Télécom also bought stakes in several other international firms (GlobalOne, Equant, Internet Telecom, Freeserve, EresMas, NTL, Mobilcom), of which some have since been sold back. Through this process, France Télécom became the fourth biggest global operator. The mobile telephone operations of Orange plc were merged with the majority of the mobile operations of France Télécom, forming the new group Orange SA.
On 13 February 2001, Orange SA was listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange with an initial public offering of 95 Euros per share, with a secondary listing in London.[21] In May 2001, Orange SA was listed on the CAC 40,[22] the benchmark stock market index of the top 40 French companies in terms of market capitalisation.[23]
In June 2001 the France Telecom Mobile brands Itinéris, OLA, and Mobicarte were replaced by the Orange brand. On 21 November 2003, France Telecom withdrew the 13.7% of Orange’s shares traded on the Paris stock exchange.[24]
On 2 October 2002, the CEO, Thierry Breton was given the task of turning the company around after the company became crippled by debt following the drop of the company's stock price. On 30 September 2002, the company's stock price was €6.94, down from €219 on 2 March 2000. France Télécom was the second most indebted company worldwide in terms of short-term liabilities. The company obtained 15 billion of debt adjustment that needed to be borne by banks and investors, another 15 billion as a capital increase from the French State since it was still the majority shareholder, and an additional 15 billion in cash from internal savings. On 25 February 2005, Thierry Breton was appointed Minister of Finance and Industry and Didier Lombard, who had been head of the firm's new technologies division, replaced him as CEO.[25]
NeXT scheme and rebranding to Orange (2006–present)[edit]

The NeXT scheme was the recovery plan for France Télécom which aimed at, among other things, reducing costs, especially wage costs, carrying on a converging policy for its products and services, and grouping together all the brands under a single brand, except for the activities dealing with fixed line telephone which would stay under the designation 'France Télécom'. Consequently, this led to the disappearance of a number of brands.
From 1 June 2006, France Télécom tried to commercialize all its products under a single worldwide brand, becoming the sole brand of the France Telecom group for Internet, television and mobile services in the majority of countries in which Orange operated. Orange Business Services became the brand for all its business services offerings worldwide, replacing the Equant brand. In June 2007, Orange and Mid Europa Partners acquire Austrian mobile network company One, re-branding it as Orange Austria. In 2012 this network is sold to Hutchison 3G and the Orange Austria brand was terminated.[26]
In November 2008, Orange launched five Orange Cinema Series channels. To do so, Orange bought the exclusive rights from Warner Bros..[27] for first runs of all new films, previously held by TPS Star (a subsidiary of the Canal+ Group), as well as all films in its catalogue and rights to the film catalogues of Gaumont, HBO[28] and MGM.[29] Orange also secured exclusive rights to broadcast Saturday evening Ligue 1 football matches from the French Football Federation.[30] SFR (a subsidiary of Canal +). Free accuses Orange of tied-selling because the Orange channels are only available to its subscribers.[31] In June 2008, the firm abandoned a €27 billion bid for Swedish operator TeliaSonera after the two companies failed to agree terms.[32]
In 2008, Orange was given permission from Apple to sell the iPhone in Austria, Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Jordan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Switzerland and Orange's African markets.[33] On 8 September 2009, Orange and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom announced they were in advanced talks to merge their UK operations to create the largest mobile operator with 37% of the market. Both T-Mobile and Orange brands[34] will be kept due to the differences in targeted market. T-Mobile will remain the budget conscious offering and Orange the premium one although there is some overlap as of February 2011.[35]
On 5 April 2009, Orange won an Arbitration Court case against Orascom Telecom, forcing Orascom to transfer its stake in Mobinil to Orange at a price of E£441,658 per Mobinil share.[36] On 28 October 2009 Orange changed the name of its Luxembourgish telecommunication company VOXMobile to Orange.[37] On 5 November 2009 Orange Armenia, 100% subsidiary of France Telecom, launched telecommunication services in Armenia.[38] On 11 December 2009 Egypt's regulator approved an offer from a unit of France Telecom (Orange) to buy Mobinil.[39] In 2010 Orange changes CEO. Didier Lombard is replaced by Stéphane Richard.[40] The company is also reorganised internally, most notably with the arrival of former Culture Minister Christine Albanel as head of communications for the group.[41] In mid-April 2010 Orange UK announced that it would outsource the management of its broadband network to BT. This announcement was greeted positively by broadband commentators, who felt that the move was likely to improve Orange's broadband quality and customer services.[42]
On 2 March 2012,Didier Lombard, who remained special advisor to Stéphane Richard, left the company.[43] His departure was shadowed by controversy over his stock options: he was suspected of having stayed with the company longer to wait for the France Telecom share to recover and then exercise his stock option. The share was trading at around €16, whereas his stock options were at €23.[44] On 3 February 2012, Hutchison Whampoa announced that it would buy Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion.[45] The deal closed on 3 January 2013,[46] and the Orange brand was phased out on 19 August 2013, when its operations were merged into 3.[47] In March 2012, France Télécom bought 93.9 percent of Mobinil, an Egyptian mobile operator, from Naguib Sawiris's Orascom Telecom Media and Technology (OTMT) in an effort to double its revenue in MENA by 2015.[48] On 28 May 2013 at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders approved changing the name of the group to Orange S.A. This became effective on 1 July 2013.[6] In September 2014, Orange agreed a deal to acquire Spanish firm Jazztel for a fee of around €3.4 billion.[49]
Shareholders[edit]
The major shareholders of Orange as of 31 December 2015 are the state of France through Agence des participations de l'État[50] and Banque publique d'investissement (replacing Fonds stratégique d'investissement) for 23.04%.[51] As in mid-2013, Orange employees, who own 4.81%, and the company itself, who own 0.58%.[52]

Landline and Internet[edit]
See also: Livebox
Orange took over the landline and Internet businesses of France Telecom and Wanadoo in 2006. Since then, Orange is the sole brand of France Telecom for landline and Internet services worldwide, with a few exceptions, such as Mobistar in Belgium and TPSA in Poland. Orange’s triple-play broadband Internet offers are supplied through the Livebox. As of 31 December 2010, Orange has 13.7 million broadband ADSL customers worldwide, 67% of whom are in France40.
The Livebox is the ADSL modem supplied to Orange’s ADSL and FTTH customers in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and Tunisia, and to WiMAX customers in Cameroon. It serves as a bridge between the Internet access and the home network through several communication interfaces (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). The Livebox has evolved over time. The Livebox 1.0 was replaced by version 1.1, the Mini Livebox, followed by the Livebox 2.0. The newest version was scheduled to be rolled out 2012 41. The Livebox is offered on a monthly contract for €3 per month or for purchase for €59. Number of Liveboxes rented in 2008: 7.3 million, a 12.3% increase in one year.[57]
Broadcasting[edit]
Beginning in 2003, Orange’s strategy has centred on the acquisition, creation and diffusion of content. This starts with the creation of MaLigne.tv in 2003, later renamed Orange TV, an ADSL television access service and a video on demand service. In 2004, Orange organises a television access service for mobile phones. In 2007, Orange creates Studio 37 (fr) and, in 2008, enters into a partnership with France Televisions to broadcast pre-recorded programming from the public national television and to roll out theme channels for sports, cinema and television series. Dubbed Content Everywhere in 2008, the content access strategy is announced simultaneously with the launch of the Orange cinema series television channels,[58] and aims to offer customers access to all of the company's content, anywhere and from any device.
Orange Cinema series[edit]
Orange Cinema Series is launched 13 November 2008, along with Orange Sport; it comprises five channels devoted to movies (Orange Ciné Max, Ciné Happy, Ciné Choc, Ciné Novo, Ciné Géant). The channels primarily show films from the Warner Bros. and HBO catalogues. Orange installs additional VOD services on its channels, allowing viewers to watch programmes broadcast in the previous 30 days whenever they like, as well as supplementary programmes from the previous month.
Orange Sport[edit]
Orange Sport is launched 13 November 2008. Orange secures the broadcast rights for the Saturday evening lineup of Ligue 1 matches from season 2008/2009 to season 2011/2012, and the rights to home matches of eight Serie A clubs (U.C. Sampdoria, Atalanta B.C., A.C. ChievoVerona, Reggina, A.C. Siena, U.S. Città di Palermo, Udinese Calcio and S.S.C. Napoli).[59] The acquisition of these rights marks the start of competition for sports programs with the Canal+ group.

Dailymotion[edit]
Main article: Dailymotion
On 25 January 2011 Orange announced the acquisition of 49% of Dailymotion, a French online video platform, at a cost of €58.8 million. The group also secured an option to acquire all of the shares in the platform in 2013.[93] This is indicative of a new strategy by Orange, which seeks to offer a full range of multi-screen video to its subscribers.[93]
Deezer[edit]
Main article: Deezer
In late August 2010 Orange acquired an 11% share in the streaming site Deezer. With this acquisition, the operator offered its subscribers a new "Deezer Premium" option: a high-quality paid streaming music service with no advertising and 7 million titles.[94]
Studio 37[edit]
Created in 2007 Studio 37 (fr) co-produces and acquires films, unlike the Canal+ Group’s StudioCanal. The producer Frédérique Dumas starts the studio, which has an initial budget of 30 million Euros. For its growth, Orange negotiates exclusivity agreements with Warner, HBO, Fidélité Films and Gaumont, ensuring a stream of films for its TV Orange Cinema Series package.[95] In 2011, Studio 37 co-produced The Artist which went on to win best picture and four further awards at the 84th Academy Awards. This makes it the first silent film to win an award since the original ceremony in 1929.
Cityvox[edit]
Cityvox is a network of websites with local content (restaurants, cultural happenings, etc.) created in 1999. Orange purchased the network site in 2008.[96]
Cloudwatt[edit]
Cloudwatt is a cloud services provider set up in 2012 by Orange (44%), the French government through Caisse des Dépôts (33%) and Thales (22%). In March 2015, Orange acquired all remaining shares of Cloudwatt to strengthen its enterprise cloud services offering.[97]
Controversy[edit]
Staff suicides[edit]
Between the beginning of January 2008 and April 2011, more than 60 France Télécom employees committed suicide,[98] (in 2008 and the early part of 2009 there were 25 [99]) some leaving notes blaming stress and misery at work. In October 2009, the wave of suicides led former Deputy CEO Louis-Pierre Wenes to resign under trade union pressure, to be replaced by Stephane Richard.[100][101] Faced with repeated suicides, the company promoted Stephane Richard to chief executive officer on 1 February 2010, while Didier Lombard remained as chairman.[102]
The suicide rate among France Télécom's 102,000 domestic employees is 15.3 per year, compared with an average of 14.7 suicides per 100,000 in the French population as a whole.[103]
Following an investigation, the Inspection du travail (Labour Inspection) told the labour union Sud-PTT that the work organisation at France Télécom "was conducive to generating suffering at work" and "health risks" for employees.[104] An investigation was conducted by the audit firm Technologia at the request of France Télécom's management. Of the 102,843 employees in the group’s parent company, 80,080 responded, i.e. a response rate of 77.9%. The fact-finding report revealed a "very poor general feeling", "strained physical and mental health", and a "tense and even violent working environment" for some categories of personnel. Working conditions were deemed difficult, mainly for personnel in charge of sales and "customer interventions". Given heavy media coverage, these findings were the source of major contention about working conditions.
Access to some sites limited[edit]
In 2011, following complaints by Internet users, Megaupload accused Orange of not providing sufficient connectivity to its site, thus severely limiting throughput from France, an allegation Orange denied.[105]
Accusations of false advertising in France[edit]
In November 2009, three users lodged a complaint against Orange for false advertising concerning its "Unlimited 3G Key" service.[106] These customers criticised the operator for the misleading way in which this service is presented, since it isn't in fact unlimited. While it is true that there is no time limit, the user cannot download more than 1 gigabyte per month, thus limiting browsing. Unaware of this, the three plaintiffs browsed beyond plan limits and had to pay additional fees as a result.
Corruption in Tunisia[edit]
In March 2011, the information website OWNI uncovered a questionable financial deal that enabled the Orange group to acquire a 3G license.[107]
Anticompetitive practices in French overseas departments[edit]
On 28 July 2011, the Competition Authority fined France Télécom €27.6 million for having improperly impeded the development of new competing operators in the French overseas departments (primarily Réunion).[108]
France Télécom used its dominant position, resulting in particular from its former monopoly, to take unfair advantage of its competitors.
The practices identified by the Authority were:

excessive rate levels
as operators of the quasi-totality of the telecommunication infrastructure local loops, making use of the data which they have access to, France Télécom has targeted former subscribers who had switched to a competitor, in order to win them back, offering them specific deals.
margin squeeze on broadband Internet offers
maintaining call barring services inconsistent with the prior selection of an alternative operator

SMS and MMS propagation of 1 January 2011 in France[edit]
On 1 January 2011, Orange users’ SMS and MMS were sent and billed multiple times. The operator agreed to reimburse the excess costs to consumers, explaining that the error came from a "third party operator"[109] (which turned out to be Bouygues Telecom),[110] said not to have sent acknowledgements, which caused the messages to be resent. A computer problem at the Bouygues platform was blamed.[111] During the night of 31 December 2010 to 1 January 2011, more than 930 million text messages were exchanged in France (for the three operators combined), setting a new record compared with the peaks of the previous years.[112]
Controversies in UK regarding the quality of service[edit]
On 21 March 2007 Watchdog, a television series by the BBC focusing on consumer protection, published the results from a broadband survey they held. According to the survey Orange is the worst ISP in the UK. 68% of Orange customers that took part in the survey said they were unsatisfied with Orange's customer service, it was voted as the most unreliable broadband provider, and it had the highest number of dissatisfied customers. Two thirds of Orange customers experienced problems cancelling their Orange broadband.[113]
In response to the problems with Orange UK broadband and 3G broadband during March 2009 and April 2009 the 3G data network has been upgraded to 3.5G and increased signal coverage. This new network can be seen in action on many mobile phones which display network for instance the Nokia N95, when the phone detects the higher speed. The Orange UK mobile broadband USB adapter works with the new network. The 3G networks for all telecommunication suppliers still struggle to get the throughput that was originally advertised when these networks were announced. The UK Telecoms Regulator[114] has reported on the challenges for all suppliers.
A consumer organisation forum web site known as OrangeProblems.co.uk focuses on the poor level of service provided by Orange Broadband in the UK. Initially set up as WanadooProblems.co.uk, the site focuses on the infamous Orange local loop unbundling and poor customer service but covers a wider range of Orange operations such as lost email, significantly delayed SMTP and outages, suspicions of eavesdropping, et al.[citation needed]
Orange Mobile has been criticised during a Channel 4 News investigation for a lack of security which potentially exposed customer records to fraud.[115]
In August 2007 Orange was criticised for summarily deleting email accounts tied to old Freeserve and Wanadoo 'pay as you go' dial-up accounts with no warning.[116]
In August 2008, after well publicised problems with iPhone 3G performances, customers compared their download speed and discovered that Orange in France was capping 3G download bandwidth. Orange admitted capping to 384kbit/s, well below the theoretical 7.2Mbit/s provided by the iPhone.[117][118] Orange uncapped 3G and 3G+ by mid-September 2008.[119]
Accusations of antisemitism and calls for boycott[edit]
The French chairman and CEO of the Orange telecommunications company, Stephane Richard said in Cairo regarding his company operations in Israel, "Believe me, I would cancel the contract tomorrow if I could. We want to end this and to fix this; we don't want it." [120] Later, Orange announced desire to discontinue use of popular brand name by its Israeli operator Partner Communications Company.[121] The president of the State of Israel Reuven Rivlin said in response "Just yesterday Israel faced attacks from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bodies, who have chosen to delegitimize the state of Israel, and to launch rockets at us from the Gaza Strip. We must face these challenges together, right and left," Rivlin said.[122][123] Israeli culture minister Miri Regev said, "I call on Jews of France and the world to disconnect from Orange unless Stephane Richard takes back his words. The time has come for them to understand that Jews in the world and sane voices that oppose anti-Semitism and racism also have power."[122][124] The statement on the company's website announced in response that "The Orange Group is a telecoms operator and as such its primary concern is to defend and promote the value of its brand in markets in which it is present," the statement began. "The Group does not engage in any kind of political debate under any circumstance."[120] Later, Richard visited Israel to clarify his remarks. He met Israeli PM Benyamin Netanyahu and former president, Shimon Peres. Richard told both Netanyahu and Peres that Orange has not and will not support anti-Israel boycott efforts, and insisted that its announced decision to abrogate its relationship with Partner was purely commercial and not political.[125]
On 30 June 2015, Orange and Partner announced a change to their 10-year licensing agreement. Orange paid Partner €40 million to add an opt out clause to the contract,[126] with which Partner conducted a market survey which is determine the best course of action moving forward.[127] In the first year only Partner can opt out, with either party being able to opt out in the second year.[128] Regardless of which party opts to exercise the out clause, Orange will pay Partner an additional €50 million to end the arrangement.[129] Orange stated that the money paid to Partner was purely for re-branding purposes and affirmed their previous statement that their wish to leave Israel is based on desire to discontinue license agreements and maintain only subsidiaries that they control, rather than a boycott.[130] Orange would make the relevant payments over the course of two years and charge it to their books as a mix of marketing, sales, customer services and related expenses.[131] As part of the agreement Orange's research and development activities within Israel would transition to the Orange name, but would be restricted from entering the telecommunications services market.[132]
In September 2015, Orange reaffirmed their commitment to Israel with an investment in Hola, a video distribution network.[133]
In February 2016, Orange and Partner decided to cut the agreement and remove the brand from Partner.[134] Since then, the rebranding happened and Orange Israel became "Partner".

Jordan Telecommunications Report Q2 2015BMI View: Jordan's telecoms operators look set to remain under intense financial pressure over our fiveyearforecast, as they will be buffeted by macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges. Strongcompetition has also played a role, with ARPUs falling across the board in the first nine months of 2014.Increased taxes on telecoms revenues have been a major factor in operator revenue declines and thegovernment is not inclined to reduce taxes or reinstate subsidies given its weak fiscal position.. In this set ofcircumstances, network operators must find new ways to generate revenue and reduce operatingexpenses. Zain launched Jordan's first 4G LTE network in February 2015 and Orange is likely to launch itsnetwork within 2015. BMI believes that stronger macro outlook and historical 3G user base growth showsthat 4G adaption too will be strong.Key Data Jordan's mobile market grew by 1.6% in the year to September 2014, but contracted by 1.1% q-o-q. Mobile ARPU continued its downward trend, with mobile operators Zain and Orange both reportingcontinued decline in H114. The pace of decline in the fixed-line sector slowed down Q314, with period q-o-q numbers unchangedand yearly losses accounting to 3219. The internet sector continues to show high y-o-y growth up by15.1% in Q314, although there has been fluctuation in dedicated data subscriptions.

Telecommunications & Wireless Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


The terminology wireless communication includes a wide range of products including handheld radios, PDAs, cell phones, and wireless networking. There are other examples of wireless technology that can be found in devices like Maritime VHF, garage door openers, computer mice, satellite television, GPS, keyboards, and cordless telephones.

Wireless communication has the ability to be limited to small distances, like it’s done with bluetooth communications, or also to thousand mile distances like with short wave radio communication. Very often wireless communication is applied where wires are not possible or costly.

Wireless communications can be found frequently within the telecommunication sector as a vehicle to transport data without the need to use wires. This transfer of data over large distances to communicate with complex, electrical products can be found in devices like telegraphs, teletypes, telephones, the use of microwave and radio waves, fiber optics and their corresponding electronics, in addition to its use in various orbiting satellites and the Internet.

While the focus of opportunity in the telecommunications industry continually changes from wired to wireless frameworks, the necessity to access a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly valuable. There are many competing opinions of the best way to free up spectrum under the present power and control of the government bureaucracy’s around the world.
