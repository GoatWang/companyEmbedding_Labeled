Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. It has 256 million customers worldwide and employs 95,000 people in France, and 59,000 elsewhere.[3] In 2015, the group had revenue of €40 billion.[4] The company's head office is located in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. The current CEO is Stéphane Richard. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5]
Orange has been the company's main brand for mobile, landline, internet and IPTV services since 2006. It originated in 1994 when Hutchison Whampoa acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications during the early 1990s and rebranded it as "Orange". It became a subsidiary of Mannesmann in 1999 and was acquired by France Télécom in 2000. The company was rebranded as Orange in July 2013.[6]

History[edit]
Nationalised service (1970s–1980s)[edit]
In 1792, under the French Revolution, the first communication network was developed to enable the rapid transmission of information in a warring and unsafe country. That was the optical telegraphy network of Claude Chappe.
In 1878, after the invention of the electrical telegraph and then the invention of the telephone, the French State created a Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Telephone Services were added to the ministry when they were nationalised in 1889. However, it was not until 1923 that the second 'T' (for 'telephones') appeared and the department of P&T became PTT.
In 1941, a General Direction of Telecommunications was created within this ministry. Then, in 1944, the National Centre of Telecommunications Studies (CNET) was created to develop the telecommunications industry in France.
In the 1970s, France tried extra hard to make up its delay on other countries with the programme "delta LP" (increasing the main lines). It was at the time when the majority of the local loop was built; that is all the cables linking the users to the operator. Moreover, with the help of French manufacturers, digital switching, the Minitel and the GSM standard were invented by engineers and CNET researchers.
Creation of France Télécom (1988–1997)[edit]
Until 1988, France Télécom was known as the Direction Générale des Télécommunications, a division of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It became autonomous in 1990. This was in response to a European directive, aimed at making competition mandatory in public services from 1 January 1998. The 2 July 1990 Bill changed France Télécom into an operator of public law, with Marcel Roulet the first Chairman. Since then, the company has had a separate body corporate from the State and acquired financial autonomy. It was privatised by Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government starting on 1 January 1998. The French government, both directly and through its holding company ERAP, continues to hold a stake of almost 27% in the company. In addition, the government Conseil of Ministers names the CEO.[7] In 1982 Telecom introduced Minitel online ordering for its customers. In September 1995, Michel Bon was appointed to run France Télécom Group.
'Roaring Nineties' (1997–2000)[edit]
In 1997, the capital of the new public company was successfully floated whereas the dot-com bubble phenomenon made the stock exchanges bullish. A second share offering occurred in 1998. France Télécom got behind in the internationalization launched by its international competitors such as Vodafone, thus, it started looking for targets at the highest speculation rate of the dot-com bubble. Moreover, its alliance with Deutsche Telekom based on a reciprocal capital contribution of 2% broke off when Deutsche Telekom announced that they were planning to do business with Telecom Italia without letting the French know – even if this project ended up failing.
Acquisition of Orange and privatization[edit]
See also: Orange (UK) § History

In July 1991, Hutchison Telecom, a UK subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, acquired a controlling stake in Microtel Communications Ltd, who by then had acquired a license to develop a mobile network in the United Kingdom.[8][9][10] Hutchison renamed Microtel to Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd, and on 28 April 1994 the Orange brand was launched in the UK mobile phone market. A holding company structure was adopted in 1995 with the establishment of Orange plc. In April 1996, Orange went public and floated on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ,[11] majority owned by Hutchison (48.22%),[12][13] followed by BAe (21.1%).[11] In June 1996, it became the youngest company to enter the FTSE 100, valued at £2.4 billion. By July 1997, the company's growth strategy paid off and Orange reached one million customers with the lowest churn rate and best profit margins compared to its competitors.[citation needed]
In October 1999 the German conglomerate Mannesmann AG acquired Orange for a price equivalent to €7,900 per customer, i.e. US$33 billion.[14][15][16] Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange triggered Vodafone to make a hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann. Shortly thereafter, in February 2000, Vodafone acquired Mannesmann for US$183 billion, and decided to divest Orange because the EU regulations wouldn't allow it to hold two mobile licences.[17]
In August 2000, France Télécom bought Orange plc from Vodafone for a total estimated cost of €39.7 billion.[18][19][20] At the time, France Télécom also bought stakes in several other international firms (GlobalOne, Equant, Internet Telecom, Freeserve, EresMas, NTL, Mobilcom), of which some have since been sold back. Through this process, France Télécom became the fourth biggest global operator. The mobile telephone operations of Orange plc were merged with the majority of the mobile operations of France Télécom, forming the new group Orange SA.
On 13 February 2001, Orange SA was listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange with an initial public offering of 95 Euros per share, with a secondary listing in London.[21] In May 2001, Orange SA was listed on the CAC 40,[22] the benchmark stock market index of the top 40 French companies in terms of market capitalisation.[23]
In June 2001 the France Telecom Mobile brands Itinéris, OLA, and Mobicarte were replaced by the Orange brand. On 21 November 2003, France Telecom withdrew the 13.7% of Orange’s shares traded on the Paris stock exchange.[24]
On 2 October 2002, the CEO, Thierry Breton was given the task of turning the company around after the company became crippled by debt following the drop of the company's stock price. On 30 September 2002, the company's stock price was €6.94, down from €219 on 2 March 2000. France Télécom was the second most indebted company worldwide in terms of short-term liabilities. The company obtained 15 billion of debt adjustment that needed to be borne by banks and investors, another 15 billion as a capital increase from the French State since it was still the majority shareholder, and an additional 15 billion in cash from internal savings. On 25 February 2005, Thierry Breton was appointed Minister of Finance and Industry and Didier Lombard, who had been head of the firm's new technologies division, replaced him as CEO.[25]
NeXT scheme and rebranding to Orange (2006–present)[edit]

The NeXT scheme was the recovery plan for France Télécom which aimed at, among other things, reducing costs, especially wage costs, carrying on a converging policy for its products and services, and grouping together all the brands under a single brand, except for the activities dealing with fixed line telephone which would stay under the designation 'France Télécom'. Consequently, this led to the disappearance of a number of brands.
From 1 June 2006, France Télécom tried to commercialize all its products under a single worldwide brand, becoming the sole brand of the France Telecom group for Internet, television and mobile services in the majority of countries in which Orange operated. Orange Business Services became the brand for all its business services offerings worldwide, replacing the Equant brand. In June 2007, Orange and Mid Europa Partners acquire Austrian mobile network company One, re-branding it as Orange Austria. In 2012 this network is sold to Hutchison 3G and the Orange Austria brand was terminated.[26]
In November 2008, Orange launched five Orange Cinema Series channels. To do so, Orange bought the exclusive rights from Warner Bros..[27] for first runs of all new films, previously held by TPS Star (a subsidiary of the Canal+ Group), as well as all films in its catalogue and rights to the film catalogues of Gaumont, HBO[28] and MGM.[29] Orange also secured exclusive rights to broadcast Saturday evening Ligue 1 football matches from the French Football Federation.[30] SFR (a subsidiary of Canal +). Free accuses Orange of tied-selling because the Orange channels are only available to its subscribers.[31] In June 2008, the firm abandoned a €27 billion bid for Swedish operator TeliaSonera after the two companies failed to agree terms.[32]
In 2008, Orange was given permission from Apple to sell the iPhone in Austria, Belgium, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Jordan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Switzerland and Orange's African markets.[33] On 8 September 2009, Orange and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom announced they were in advanced talks to merge their UK operations to create the largest mobile operator with 37% of the market. Both T-Mobile and Orange brands[34] will be kept due to the differences in targeted market. T-Mobile will remain the budget conscious offering and Orange the premium one although there is some overlap as of February 2011.[35]
On 5 April 2009, Orange won an Arbitration Court case against Orascom Telecom, forcing Orascom to transfer its stake in Mobinil to Orange at a price of E£441,658 per Mobinil share.[36] On 28 October 2009 Orange changed the name of its Luxembourgish telecommunication company VOXMobile to Orange.[37] On 5 November 2009 Orange Armenia, 100% subsidiary of France Telecom, launched telecommunication services in Armenia.[38] On 11 December 2009 Egypt's regulator approved an offer from a unit of France Telecom (Orange) to buy Mobinil.[39] In 2010 Orange changes CEO. Didier Lombard is replaced by Stéphane Richard.[40] The company is also reorganised internally, most notably with the arrival of former Culture Minister Christine Albanel as head of communications for the group.[41] In mid-April 2010 Orange UK announced that it would outsource the management of its broadband network to BT. This announcement was greeted positively by broadband commentators, who felt that the move was likely to improve Orange's broadband quality and customer services.[42]
On 2 March 2012,Didier Lombard, who remained special advisor to Stéphane Richard, left the company.[43] His departure was shadowed by controversy over his stock options: he was suspected of having stayed with the company longer to wait for the France Telecom share to recover and then exercise his stock option. The share was trading at around €16, whereas his stock options were at €23.[44] On 3 February 2012, Hutchison Whampoa announced that it would buy Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion.[45] The deal closed on 3 January 2013,[46] and the Orange brand was phased out on 19 August 2013, when its operations were merged into 3.[47] In March 2012, France Télécom bought 93.9 percent of Mobinil, an Egyptian mobile operator, from Naguib Sawiris's Orascom Telecom Media and Technology (OTMT) in an effort to double its revenue in MENA by 2015.[48] On 28 May 2013 at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders approved changing the name of the group to Orange S.A. This became effective on 1 July 2013.[6] In September 2014, Orange agreed a deal to acquire Spanish firm Jazztel for a fee of around €3.4 billion.[49]
Shareholders[edit]
The major shareholders of Orange as of 31 December 2015 are the state of France through Agence des participations de l'État[50] and Banque publique d'investissement (replacing Fonds stratégique d'investissement) for 23.04%.[51] As in mid-2013, Orange employees, who own 4.81%, and the company itself, who own 0.58%.[52]

Landline and Internet[edit]
See also: Livebox
Orange took over the landline and Internet businesses of France Telecom and Wanadoo in 2006. Since then, Orange is the sole brand of France Telecom for landline and Internet services worldwide, with a few exceptions, such as Mobistar in Belgium and TPSA in Poland. Orange’s triple-play broadband Internet offers are supplied through the Livebox. As of 31 December 2010, Orange has 13.7 million broadband ADSL customers worldwide, 67% of whom are in France40.

It serves as a bridge between the Internet access and the home network through several communication interfaces (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi). The Livebox has evolved over time. The Livebox 1.0 was replaced by version 1.1, the Mini Livebox, followed by the Livebox 2.0. The newest version was scheduled to be rolled out 2012 41. The Livebox is offered on a monthly contract for €3 per month or for purchase for €59. Number of Liveboxes rented in 2008: 7.3 million, a 12.3% increase in one year.[57]

Beginning in 2003, Orange’s strategy has centred on the acquisition, creation and diffusion of content. This starts with the creation of MaLigne.tv in 2003, later renamed Orange TV, an ADSL television access service and a video on demand service. In 2004, Orange organises a television access service for mobile phones. In 2007, Orange creates Studio 37 (fr) and, in 2008, enters into a partnership with France Televisions to broadcast pre-recorded programming from the public national television and to roll out theme channels for sports, cinema and television series. Dubbed Content Everywhere in 2008, the content access strategy is announced simultaneously with the launch of the Orange cinema series television channels,[58] and aims to offer customers access to all of the company's content, anywhere and from any device.
Orange Cinema series[edit]
Orange Cinema Series is launched 13 November 2008, along with Orange Sport; it comprises five channels devoted to movies (Orange Ciné Max, Ciné Happy, Ciné Choc, Ciné Novo, Ciné Géant).

Dailymotion[edit]
Main article: Dailymotion
On 25 January 2011 Orange announced the acquisition of 49% of Dailymotion, a French online video platform, at a cost of €58.8 million. The group also secured an option to acquire all of the shares in the platform in 2013.[93] This is indicative of a new strategy by Orange, which seeks to offer a full range of multi-screen video to its subscribers.[93]
Deezer[edit]
Main article: Deezer
In late August 2010 Orange acquired an 11% share in the streaming site Deezer. With this acquisition, the operator offered its subscribers a new "Deezer Premium" option: a high-quality paid streaming music service with no advertising and 7 million titles.[94]
Studio 37[edit]
Created in 2007 Studio 37 (fr) co-produces and acquires films, unlike the Canal+ Group’s StudioCanal. The producer Frédérique Dumas starts the studio, which has an initial budget of 30 million Euros. For its growth, Orange negotiates exclusivity agreements with Warner, HBO, Fidélité Films and Gaumont, ensuring a stream of films for its TV Orange Cinema Series package.[95] In 2011, Studio 37 co-produced The Artist which went on to win best picture and four further awards at the 84th Academy Awards. This makes it the first silent film to win an award since the original ceremony in 1929.
Cityvox[edit]
Cityvox is a network of websites with local content (restaurants, cultural happenings, etc.) created in 1999. Orange purchased the network site in 2008.[96]
Cloudwatt[edit]
Cloudwatt is a cloud services provider set up in 2012 by Orange (44%), the French government through Caisse des Dépôts (33%) and Thales (22%). In March 2015, Orange acquired all remaining shares of Cloudwatt to strengthen its enterprise cloud services offering.[97]
Controversy[edit]
Staff suicides[edit]
Between the beginning of January 2008 and April 2011, more than 60 France Télécom employees committed suicide,[98] (in 2008 and the early part of 2009 there were 25 [99]) some leaving notes blaming stress and misery at work. In October 2009, the wave of suicides led former Deputy CEO Louis-Pierre Wenes to resign under trade union pressure, to be replaced by Stephane Richard.[100][101] Faced with repeated suicides, the company promoted Stephane Richard to chief executive officer on 1 February 2010, while Didier Lombard remained as chairman.[102]
The suicide rate among France Télécom's 102,000 domestic employees is 15.3 per year, compared with an average of 14.7 suicides per 100,000 in the French population as a whole.[103]
Following an investigation, the Inspection du travail (Labour Inspection) told the labour union Sud-PTT that the work organisation at France Télécom "was conducive to generating suffering at work" and "health risks" for employees.[104] An investigation was conducted by the audit firm Technologia at the request of France Télécom's management. Of the 102,843 employees in the group’s parent company, 80,080 responded, i.e. a response rate of 77.9%. The fact-finding report revealed a "very poor general feeling", "strained physical and mental health", and a "tense and even violent working environment" for some categories of personnel. Working conditions were deemed difficult, mainly for personnel in charge of sales and "customer interventions". Given heavy media coverage, these findings were the source of major contention about working conditions.
Access to some sites limited[edit]
In 2011, following complaints by Internet users, Megaupload accused Orange of not providing sufficient connectivity to its site, thus severely limiting throughput from France, an allegation Orange denied.[105]
Accusations of false advertising in France[edit]
In November 2009, three users lodged a complaint against Orange for false advertising concerning its "Unlimited 3G Key" service.[106] These customers criticised the operator for the misleading way in which this service is presented, since it isn't in fact unlimited. While it is true that there is no time limit, the user cannot download more than 1 gigabyte per month, thus limiting browsing. Unaware of this, the three plaintiffs browsed beyond plan limits and had to pay additional fees as a result.
Corruption in Tunisia[edit]
In March 2011, the information website OWNI uncovered a questionable financial deal that enabled the Orange group to acquire a 3G license.[107]
Anticompetitive practices in French overseas departments[edit]
On 28 July 2011, the Competition Authority fined France Télécom €27.6 million for having improperly impeded the development of new competing operators in the French overseas departments (primarily Réunion).[108]
France Télécom used its dominant position, resulting in particular from its former monopoly, to take unfair advantage of its competitors.
The practices identified by the Authority were:

excessive rate levels
as operators of the quasi-totality of the telecommunication infrastructure local loops, making use of the data which they have access to, France Télécom has targeted former subscribers who had switched to a competitor, in order to win them back, offering them specific deals.
margin squeeze on broadband Internet offers
maintaining call barring services inconsistent with the prior selection of an alternative operator

SMS and MMS propagation of 1 January 2011 in France[edit]
On 1 January 2011, Orange users’ SMS and MMS were sent and billed multiple times. The operator agreed to reimburse the excess costs to consumers, explaining that the error came from a "third party operator"[109] (which turned out to be Bouygues Telecom),[110] said not to have sent acknowledgements, which caused the messages to be resent. A computer problem at the Bouygues platform was blamed.[111] During the night of 31 December 2010 to 1 January 2011, more than 930 million text messages were exchanged in France (for the three operators combined), setting a new record compared with the peaks of the previous years.[112]
Controversies in UK regarding the quality of service[edit]
On 21 March 2007 Watchdog, a television series by the BBC focusing on consumer protection, published the results from a broadband survey they held. According to the survey Orange is the worst ISP in the UK. 68% of Orange customers that took part in the survey said they were unsatisfied with Orange's customer service, it was voted as the most unreliable broadband provider, and it had the highest number of dissatisfied customers. Two thirds of Orange customers experienced problems cancelling their Orange broadband.[113]
In response to the problems with Orange UK broadband and 3G broadband during March 2009 and April 2009 the 3G data network has been upgraded to 3.5G and increased signal coverage. This new network can be seen in action on many mobile phones which display network for instance the Nokia N95, when the phone detects the higher speed. The Orange UK mobile broadband USB adapter works with the new network. The 3G networks for all telecommunication suppliers still struggle to get the throughput that was originally advertised when these networks were announced. The UK Telecoms Regulator[114] has reported on the challenges for all suppliers.
A consumer organisation forum web site known as OrangeProblems.co.uk focuses on the poor level of service provided by Orange Broadband in the UK. Initially set up as WanadooProblems.co.uk, the site focuses on the infamous Orange local loop unbundling and poor customer service but covers a wider range of Orange operations such as lost email, significantly delayed SMTP and outages, suspicions of eavesdropping, et al.[citation needed]
Orange Mobile has been criticised during a Channel 4 News investigation for a lack of security which potentially exposed customer records to fraud.[115]
In August 2007 Orange was criticised for summarily deleting email accounts tied to old Freeserve and Wanadoo 'pay as you go' dial-up accounts with no warning.[116]
In August 2008, after well publicised problems with iPhone 3G performances, customers compared their download speed and discovered that Orange in France was capping 3G download bandwidth. Orange admitted capping to 384kbit/s, well below the theoretical 7.2Mbit/s provided by the iPhone.[117][118] Orange uncapped 3G and 3G+ by mid-September 2008.[119]
Accusations of antisemitism and calls for boycott[edit]
The French chairman and CEO of the Orange telecommunications company, Stephane Richard said in Cairo regarding his company operations in Israel, "Believe me, I would cancel the contract tomorrow if I could. We want to end this and to fix this; we don't want it." [120] Later, Orange announced desire to discontinue use of popular brand name by its Israeli operator Partner Communications Company.[121] The president of the State of Israel Reuven Rivlin said in response "Just yesterday Israel faced attacks from anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bodies, who have chosen to delegitimize the state of Israel, and to launch rockets at us from the Gaza Strip. We must face these challenges together, right and left," Rivlin said.[122][123] Israeli culture minister Miri Regev said, "I call on Jews of France and the world to disconnect from Orange unless Stephane Richard takes back his words. The time has come for them to understand that Jews in the world and sane voices that oppose anti-Semitism and racism also have power."[122][124] The statement on the company's website announced in response that "The Orange Group is a telecoms operator and as such its primary concern is to defend and promote the value of its brand in markets in which it is present," the statement began. "The Group does not engage in any kind of political debate under any circumstance."[120] Later, Richard visited Israel to clarify his remarks. He met Israeli PM Benyamin Netanyahu and former president, Shimon Peres. Richard told both Netanyahu and Peres that Orange has not and will not support anti-Israel boycott efforts, and insisted that its announced decision to abrogate its relationship with Partner was purely commercial and not political.[125]
On 30 June 2015, Orange and Partner announced a change to their 10-year licensing agreement. Orange paid Partner €40 million to add an opt out clause to the contract,[126] with which Partner conducted a market survey which is determine the best course of action moving forward.[127] In the first year only Partner can opt out, with either party being able to opt out in the second year.[128] Regardless of which party opts to exercise the out clause, Orange will pay Partner an additional €50 million to end the arrangement.[129] Orange stated that the money paid to Partner was purely for re-branding purposes and affirmed their previous statement that their wish to leave Israel is based on desire to discontinue license agreements and maintain only subsidiaries that they control, rather than a boycott.[130] Orange would make the relevant payments over the course of two years and charge it to their books as a mix of marketing, sales, customer services and related expenses.[131] As part of the agreement Orange's research and development activities within Israel would transition to the Orange name, but would be restricted from entering the telecommunications services market.[132]
In September 2015, Orange reaffirmed their commitment to Israel with an investment in Hola, a video distribution network.[133]
In February 2016, Orange and Partner decided to cut the agreement and remove the brand from Partner.[134] Since then, the rebranding happened and Orange Israel became "Partner".

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Orange Polska Q2 2017 Results Conference Call on the 27th of July. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. I will now hand over the conference to Mr. Leszek Iwaszko. Please go ahead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello? Yes. Hi. Sorry. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Orange Polska results conference call for the second quarter of 2017. My name is Leszek Iwaszko. I am the head of Investor Relations. Today, we have with us CEO of Orange Polska, Jean-François Fallacher; and CFO, Maciej Nowohonski. Our results have been published yesterday evening, and they are available on our IR website. Now let me hand the floor to Jean-François to start the presentation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much, Leszek. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. So welcome to this quarterly results conference. I will, as usual, start with highlights of the quarter. And then I will pass the floor to Maciej Nowohonski, which will tell you more on the financial side. And at the end, of course, we will welcome your question and hopefully give some answers to you.So let's start with the overall results of the quarter. As you can see, they are solid. Our EBITDA was in a small decline, almost flat versus last year. How was this achieved? Actually, I will mention 4 factors. First of all -- and we will come back on that. I mean, we are very happy with the start of Orange Love, our new convergent offer that we launched in the middle of February. That allows us to achieve our commercial costs -- goals, sorry, at low cost actually. Second reason for that good performance, we have lowered the handset subsidies in line with what's happening on the Polish market. Our mix is supporting commercial costs of the nation. And finally this quarter as you probably have seen, we closed quite a number of real estate transactions, which are also helping for a good EBITDA performance of Q2.So on the next page, I would like to spend a little bit more time on our commercial achievements. So first of all, I will comment convergence. So it's been now a bit -- this product has been becoming our flagship proposal on the Polish market. You know that today, still a majority of the households in Poland are buying media and telecom in different providers. Obviously with this offer, we want to change this, and we are I mean doing that concretely. Because Orange Love, our new flagship product has acquired 200,000 customers in the course of actually a bit less than 5 months. So we believe this is really a good convergence. So that's the first thing I would like to comment. You have to know as well that 80% of these new 200,000 customers actually have purchased at least 1 additional service from Orange. So there is really value creation through this new offer.Read MoreAs you can see on this graph, the convergent base has increased also by 16% this quarter. We are now exceeding 1 million convergent customers. And actually a majority, as you can see there, of our sales of fixed broadband and mobile are now done via these convergent offers, so much more than in the past. So I believe that this strategy of convergence is really starting to bear its fruit, is starting to work.Now let's have a closer look on mobile. So I'm going to comment the graphs -- the bottom graphs on the left side. The net additions were rather good, as you can see there. They're a little bit lower than last year. That you can see on the graph, simply because we have been trying this quarter, like the first quarter, to have a more balanced strategy between volumes and value. And as you understood very well, we have been putting emphasis on value. The [MNP] outlook in the second quarter is still positive for us in postpaid. It's marginally, I would say, worse than last year because we have come to 27,000 positive [MNPs] versus 32k. So that's quite in a -- that's quite good and comparable to last year.On mobile broadband, you will see in this graph that the net additions are negative, and that obviously we are losing mobile broadband customers. So these are the customers that are using only dongles or devices that are pure data devices. This category loses appeal on the market simply because I would say 2 reasons. First of all, it's probably linked to the success of our fixed broadband offers; and second, due also to the fact that with smartphones we are giving now more and more abundant data packages, which are making probably the use of these offers redundant.And last but not least, I would like to comment on our performance on the fixed broadband side. So these are two other slides. The transformation of our customer base is continuing. The net additions, as you can see, are very positive, thanks to FX, the fixed wireless and of course fiber. So the fiber net additions that you can see on the right chart on the bottom are good. They are slightly below the ones in Q1. This is something, if you remember well, we warned you about, simply because this quarter has been containing in Poland a lot of days off each month, long weekends, which has been actually slightly weighting. And that explains the slight decrease that we were expecting. If you remember well in Q2, overall we are really on track with the sales. And you will see later more in detail that the penetration of fiber customers inside our deployments is also raising, which is positive news.I would like to comment also 2 other topics that happened in the second quarter which I believe are important for the future of Orange Polska. The first one is so-called Poland operational program, Digital Poland Operational Program, POPC. So for those of you who are Polish, you are aware of this. This is a program which is funded by European funds to deploy broadband in wide areas in Poland. We are extremely happy that we have been the winner, actually, in 18 vendors organized by the government out of, if I remember well, something like 70 vendors. The program is actually heaved subsidized, as you can see. These are very important investments because we are going to deploy a total number of households which will be more than 360,000 households for a total investment of PLN 1 billion. And you will notice that out of this PLN 1 billion, 70%, so PLN 700 million, will be financed by the European Commission.So we believe this is for us a unique opportunity to deploy FTTH in areas which are, I would say, more smaller cities or suburbs of the big cities. Because we are extremely happy as well that we won the suburban areas of Warsaw [in December]. And that actually allows us to deploy again fiber in areas where we obviously wouldn't have deployed without this European funding. These are important investments because you will see that PLN 1 billion is a more than 1-year investment in fiber at the current speed we are having. So that's really a significant event that we would like -- and a very positive one that we would like to stress to you.We assume ARPU actually will be comparable in these areas and in other locations where we deploy fiber, while we believe also the adoption rates should be higher, simply because there would be much less presence of cable companies and competitors. So based on the experience we already have on such smaller cities, we believe the monetization will be good and -- as good on our other fiber investments. So we are very pleased that we have won these 18 cities and that we can also contribute to the development of the local communities in Poland and will improve the digitalization of Poland through this important investment that I remind will concretely happen in 2018, 2019 and 2020.The last topic I would like to comment here is the fact that we have announced a few days ago the acquisition of the electricity distribution business of Multimedia Polska. So obviously, this is not a very big acquisition. This is very modest, but I would like to take the opportunity that you are here to comment it. It's a small acquisition, but nevertheless strategically important. You will remember that we have started an energy reselling business at Orange Polska. That is going well. It's growing. And through this acquisition, we actually will accelerate our business of energy electricity reselling. So we will grow the base to 100,000 customers through this acquisition. That will make us the leader of the alternative energy market in Poland. And by this acquisition, actually, we are, I would say, gaining 1 year versus our original business case. That allows us to accelerate this very specific business. With this acquisition, we are buying just paying customers who, by the way, are having average 3 years contract. And we are not taking any costs nor employees because we are buying the customer base. So basically, I would believe this is a good move. A modest one but a good move that will accelerate our again electricity reselling business in Poland.That's all for me now. I will give the floor to Maciej Nowohonski.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Jean-François. Hi to everyone. So we are on Page 11 of the presentation with the financial highlights. You can see that the top line dynamics now reflect more year-over-year situation, which is comparable on the installments front. For the EBITDA, this is supported by our more value oriented approach combined with very good achievement on the sale of the real estate front. And finally, cash has rebounded above the trend that we have seen in Q1, and it is now better.So let's go to the next page where we see more information on the revenue of the group. Here we are down year-over-year after 2 quarters of growth. But I -- as I was mentioning, we were flagging it already to you that installments year-over-year situation is not comparable. It became finally much apple-to-apple situation right now. And right now, you can see the trend which is with us after equalization of the installments impact. So with this quarter, the base of the previous quarter is finally comparable.In fixed business, the dynamics are slightly improving. And this is thanks to the fixed broadband, which has started to grow, while legacy area obviously continues to hit us quite significantly. I will come back on that the legacy when commenting the EBITDA as well.So now maybe let's look -- let's take a look at the mobile revenue in more detail, because it's an interesting set of information on Slide 13. Let me explain maybe first the title of this slide. What do we mean by more value oriented approach? As you remember in the previous 2 years, we were very active in customer acquisitions, which was successful. We reported record-high net additions. We gained market shares, but obviously, it cost us as well, considerably. So since the beginning of this year, as Jean-François already mentioned, we aim to be more balanced between volumes and value.We have been gradually limiting handset subsidies, making sure we will still remain competitive. And yet, we are able to maintain customer net additions at good and even satisfactory level. Why? It is mainly thanks to Orange Love, which was already mentioned by Jean-François, which allows us to differentiate vis-à-vis the competition. So it is making a real difference. And Orange Love also interestingly decreases the direct price competition in mono products, in mono mobile offers. And the majority of the mobile subscriptions in B2C are now made through Orange Love. So also customers are increasingly buying smartphones on open markets and exchange them less frequently than in the past. And as a result in Q2, that volume of commercial acts, both acquisitions and retentions, was higher year-over-year, but significantly increased also proportion on the SIM-only offers that we are selling. So thanks to lower handset subsidies and on the other hand, more SIM-only commercial acts, we are able to generate more value. Of course we are closely monitoring the situation, the commercial situation on the market. And we will leave for ourselves flexibility in that respect in the future, especially regarding the subsidy policy. So more SIM-only offers, more installment offers, more convergent discounts, which are allocated to mobile part of the business. It is all weighing on our evolution of ARPU. And that will continue to be so.So looking forward to the second semester, and I think especially in Q3, we expect some negative impacts coming from implementation of the roaming, especially by the fact that Q3 and months of July and August are high vacation seasons for Polish people. So a lot of them will travel, and a lot of them will use the data versus not using the data in the past. So here, we can expect some weigh on the EBITDA of Q3 especially.So then a couple of seconds on fixed broadband on the next slide. So here we clearly show a continued transformation of this part of our business. And we confirm that the trend of the revenue is sustainable, so it is growing. On the base front, ADSL losses are increasingly offset with fiber and wireless for fixed solutions. And those 2 categories are clearly for us the growth drivers. And this growth is obviously facilitated by the offer by the Orange Love, by our flagship, and good quality of our mobile network which is supporting a lot of the customer experience that we see among our customers.Interestingly, the usage of the wireless for fixed, the usage of data is quite high. And we are able to accommodate this usage. It's more than 30 gigs per month. So those customers are really active on the data front. And in terms of the overall evolution of the customer base, it is up 10% with growing categories, the growth areas, wireless for fixed and fiber, VDSL constituting now almost 40% of our base. So it's a sharp, sharp, positive evolution of the structure of our base. According to our internal estimates, in the first semester, we managed to stabilize the total market share and we continue to grow the market share in fast fixed broadband category.Now a couple of things on the fiber front, Page 15. So here, all the production of the network and the customer take-up progress as scheduled. We extend the coverage of the fiber faster and the -- we use the infrastructure of the other operators while doing so. So in the second -- in the first semester, around 20% of our production relates to third-party infrastructure from operators like (inaudible) or Netia. And our fixed fiber broadband is available right now in almost 2 million households, which represents a coverage of 40% of households in big cities in Poland. So it's a considerable chunk already, and please note that we still continue.And a few interesting facts here for the coverage, that the highest coverage we have today is in Lublin. It is 65% of all households in Lublin. There are some 5 other cities that we already exceed the coverage by 50%. So these are Bydgoszcz, Elblag, Opole, Radom and Szczecin. And volume-wise, the highest coverage is obviously in Warsaw, in the capital, where we have more than 400,000 households connectable already. And that gives us around 40% of the coverage in Warsaw. So the average customer adoption rate was, at the end of first semester, at 7.4% and is obviously growing. And this is a good development that we are able to report to you. And in 5 cities, among the ones that we have already invested in fiber, the adoption rate is surpassing the level of the 10%. So we will continue to work on the improvement of the monetization of the fiber network in the second semester, especially in the peak commercial season, which is for us Q4.Then let's go to the financial front on the EBITDA. And here, as Jean-François mentioned already, the EBITDA was almost flat year-over-year. And it was mainly thanks to the better evolution of our direct margin. Just to recall you, the direct margin is the difference between the revenues and the direct costs. And those direct costs are commercial costs like customer acquisition and retention costs, content costs and interconnect. And better performance on the fixed broadband and mobile allowed us to compensate better the drop related to the legacy business. And the legacy drag, you can see it on the graph, is still with us, will be with us the in future. Our main objective right now is to make this compensation as good as it is only possible.Mobile benefited from more value-oriented strategy that we have already discussed, and you can also see the decrease of the commercial costs. The biggest improvement was the fixed broadband. And here, it is not only the revenue which is growing, but also the direct margin, which started to grow. Simply, the volume is -- positive volume evolution is surpassing the current commercial costs that we invest into this category.Good news on the indirect costs this quarter were supported by exceptionally good sales of the real estate. And we are really satisfied with the result achieved so far. Second semester is again very ambitious for us in our plans. But as usual, no guarantee of success because of the complex process of -- which is standing behind such every sale of the real estate.For the second semester, we would like to continue the good commercial trends that we have. Especially subsidy policy plays its important role here in the second semester. However, we will remain for ourselves the flexibility and the right to make proper decisions vis-à-vis the different tactical situations on that front. Uncertainties will be with us, especially on the roaming front because here we are in the new situation, as all operators are, as the whole market. And we will have to see what are the developments in the -- especially in Q3, because this is the high season.And obviously, the real estate remains for us important component of the EBITDA evolution, however, by its natural nature, uncertain.Then on Page 17, you can see the net income, which is better, and it is supported by better evolution of the EBITDA, by lower depreciation. Here the lower depreciation, the reasons are known to you because they are not new. They've been with us in the previous quarters. And the commercial costs are finally also slightly lower.Financial costs, financial costs. CapEx, first semester was clearly the picture of the turnaround and the fact that we are investing in the turnaround. The fiber CapEx is up 45% year-over-year. So we continue at a very high pace of production. And fiber is 1/3 of our CapEx overall in the first semester. So at the same time in all other areas, we try to be lean as much as possible. These categories are down 20% year-over-year. And it is the result of the optimization that is an ongoing task for us, and completion of certain projects, which were with us last year and are not anymore.And in terms of the fiber CapEx, please note that the unitary CapEx is very similar year-over-year, apples to apples. So we keep a good control over the cost of the investments that we have behind the fiber.Then the cash flow on the next page. Of course, I already mentioned it is better and it rebounded after Q1. And it was thanks mainly to EBITDA, much lower cash CapEx, and very high proceeds from the sale of the real estate. Year-on-year, of course, you can see some working capital still being a drag. This is coming mainly from the fact that the mix of the purchased handsets is changing. Right now, we are selling more expensive handsets. This is what customers actually want to buy, and we have adjusted our purchases. And we are paying for that faster than we recover the installment fee, which will be coming to us in 2 years perspective. Then we gradually optimize the spendings on the handsets. I guess, we can expect Q3 being lower in purchases of the handsets. It's a little bit of the seasonality, but also the fact that we adjust to more SIMO situation. We should not forget that overall this year, cash flow generation is under the influence of still dropping EBITDA year-over-year and very high CapEx investments. So you should not expect outstanding cash performance in such situation. This is basically natural.We are continuously working on the working capital improvement. Right now, as we speak, we have around PLN 150 million of the working capital in the supply chain financing model. So this is helping us to optimize the payment terms quite significantly. And not excluded that in the second semester, we will make some further progress in that respect.Then very quickly on the net debt on the next page, it is broadly stable, we can say. It is around 2.3x net debt to EBITDA. There is still in the first semester, a negative impact of the cash because of the Q1 not fully compensated by a good Q2. One additional news -- not news really, but really information is about the European Commission fine. Of course it can, in the future, weigh on our leverage. However, the Court of Justice plans to issue judgment in another case before ours. And the timing of this decision has not yet been set, this decision in front of us. So this increases the probability that the verdict in our case may be delayed, well even until 2018.So that's all on my side. Thank you for your attention. And I hand the floor back to Jean-François for conclusion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Maciej. So let me give you a brief conclusion in the second quarter, our commercial results confirm the with confidence the success of the Orange Love offer. That really differentiates us on this very competitive Polish market. It also helps to monetize our fiber investment and transform, I would say, the turnaround of fixed mobile business.On the financial front, you have understood it, we are quite satisfied with these good results. And actually, we are reiterating with confidence our full year guidance. However, as Maciej has been stating it, there are certain risks ahead of us, especially in Q3 as roaming, the famous new roam-like-home implementation is quite a key risk because this is the high season of roaming. All -- a lot of Polish people going abroad, so there is still a bit of uncertainty there, and definitely a risk.As concerns the back-to-school period and the Christmas commercial period, we believe they will be very intensive. We are currently working towards making our proposals for this period. Even more simple, and the same time taking care of value that it is bringing to us. Again, we are pursuing a value strategy and not a volume strategy anymore.Last but not least, a quarter ago, I told you that we would give our strategic update alongside these Q2 results. However, we received some feedback from some of you that as we are in the middle of the summer, we prefer to postpone it to September 4. So immediately after this, we will meet investors on road shows and conference. So actually, I would like to invite you all for the special event that we will hold on September 4 on the Warsaw Stock Exchange where we will comment our plan for the coming 3 years.Now, it reminds me to thank you for your attention. That concludes our presentation, and we give you the floor for questions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. As usual, we start the questions on the floor. So I encourage.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pawel Puchalski, Dom Maklerski BZ WBK S.A., Research Division - Head of Equity Research [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pawel Puchalski, BZ WBK. I've got couple of questions. First of all, you mentioned roam-like-at-home. What's the expected amount of negative impact on EBITDA starting in quarter 3? The other question would be on working capital. I just want to be sure -- well, I would like to know whether your working capital would decline, or your negative working capital input will decline below PLN 100 per quarter as of quarter 3 or not? The other question would be one of the first pages, you show the impact of fiber in -- falling from 29,000 to 28,000. And you are commenting that it slows down because of the calendar days, et cetera. Well, fiber is pretty new for you. The number -- the growth should be accelerating quarter after quarter. So actually, that would be a good explanation for a very mature business, but not for expanding line of business. And fiber should be expanding, fiber business, in your case. So please explain me once again why is it only 28,000?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I will take this last question. And then I will give the floor to Maciej who will answer the 2 first, if you allow me. So again I mean if you'll remember when in Poland in April, May, June, we had very long weekends of 4 days each month. In a day where sales happen basically from Monday to Saturday, when you have this kind of very long weekend, it really is weighting, believe me. That's one. Second explanation is if you remember well until mid of Feb, we still had prepaid registration. Prepaid registration as the -- was a big opportunity to sell because we had a lot of traffic in our shops from customers of ours that were coming to register their prepaid. So we had quite good sales in fiber as well as in Q1. So those are really the 2 explanations. Again, we are not disappointed by the sales. And if you compare them with the sales of last year, they are already from a totally other order of magnitude. So the fiber, I would say, sales are really there. They are really growing. So we are absolutely confident on this one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So regarding your question on roaming. Today, I'm not in the position to give you a concrete impact of that, because, well actually, we have a certain element of uncertainty how the adoption of the data roaming usage will actually happen during the vacation period. It's important for us because this is around 40%, 45% of the total traffic for the year. So we will see. We nevertheless should factor in the fact that the margin of Q2, margin of Q1 for that activity will not repeat, for sure. We will have more costs. We will have a little bit less revenue on that. We may have some positive impact coming from the fact that the usage in Poland will be higher for guests from abroad. Of course, it is not the same type of the total traffic. Because users in Poland from abroad represent probably 1/5 or 1/7 of that who is traveling from Poland to abroad. So there will be a positive traffic, but we can assume that the trend will be distorted by some tens of millions, above 30 million in Q2 -- Q3, Q3. Then regarding working capital, I think that the structural thing that is still weighing on the working capital and will remain a weight is the fact that we still sell more installments than we receive the cash from the existing installments in our portfolio. So the balance sheet position on the installments monthly sale, quarterly sale is still growing and will be growing throughout the second semester, will be growing as well most probably through the first semester of 2018. And then we expect some kind of stabilization that cash-ins from that category will start to equalize to new contracts that we are signing on that front. So this is a structural thing. On the payables front and the handsets, I've already commented that we should see an easing situation here. And as we mentioned already, we have some additional action plan to increase the supply chain financing, which should help. But the structural drag is coming from the installments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Any more questions? Any more questions from the room? Pawel.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pawel Szpigiel, Dom Maklerski mBanku S.A., Research Division - Analyst [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pawel Szpiegiel from mBank. And my question, I have one question. Lower base -- lower cost base this quarter resulted from a change in clients acquisition policy. But I hardly recognize any material cuts in any other cost lines. And the room for cost cut in Orange Polska is ample, in my opinion. For instance, compared to annual revenue generated per 1 employee in Orange Polska and in your competition, the productivity gap is so visible for me. And so I just want to ask what you, as management, want to do with this overstaffing in so-called legacy business. Even today, you mentioned that the trends, you cannot actually change the negative trends in the legacy business, yes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So first of all, please be cautious enough not to compare a pure mobile business' benchmarks with, I would say, a former incumbent fixed business, which obviously has nothing to do. So please do us a favor and compare ourselves with some of our peers everywhere else in Europe or in Eastern Europe. That's a fair comparison. The second topic is you know we are still, I mean plans this year to release employees in Orange Polska. So that's going at a quite a high pace. If you look year-on-year, we have 1,000 less employees than last year. So this is obviously ongoing. We are well aware and I -- of the fact that we still need to work on our costs. This is part of the things we will talk about on September 4 actually. Part.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company. I have 3 questions. First one concerns roam-like-at-home regulation. My question is have you renegotiated, or do you plan to renegotiate the wholesale rates with your parent company? Because probably you could be offered much better rates than at least 2 competitors in Poland, so it may a competitive advantage for you. All right, so maybe the first one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So if I can be a little bit vague in that respect because this is a commercial story and a commercial discussion. So we will be really glad to report to you any changes in that, if they will be significant when they come. And we will not flag upfront the movements because we don't want to jeopardize any discussions that we could have on the interconnect front with actually all operators across Europe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I take the opportunity to also come back on the meat that I see on this market, that some operators, because they would be part of big European groups would be actually subsidized by their mother companies, which obviously not at all the case. So I heard this a few times that we, Orange, would actually not suffer from this simply because we are a part of a large group. This is absolutely not the case. However, you are right. We are in the process in the course, as Maciej is saying, to renegotiate our agreement with other operators. That's very clear. And especially when we look at our roaming profile, the first destination of roaming for Polish people is Germany. So we are obviously, at least starting now, working on optimizing, looking at the new volumes. The cost of buying these minutes and these megabytes for us in Germany, that's very clear but as Maciej is saying, at this stage, we can't give you more details. But that's obviously ongoing, going on and with the aim, obviously, to reduce these prices with the new volumes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. But do you mean, there is like no competitive advantage in that you are a part of the international group?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, because we are a company which is listed on the stock. 49% is listed on the stock. We are stand-alone, and we don't seek subsidies for the group for whatever reason that we are part of the group. That's not working like this. So we are competing at the same -- I would say, with the same weapons and also with the same, I would say, issues sometimes than our competitors in the Polish market.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And when considering the impact from roam-like-at-home regulation, you've guided that it would be like PLN 50 million in second half of the year. So like PLN 100 million annually or something like that? Or how do you think it could be in situation where we have unlimited roaming tariffs? So it should be probably considered to be more than that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think that today, we do not have to say more on that front. I guess this is the floor situation that we could have the impact stronger. But as I say, it is very difficult estimate as of today. And don't forget that it's, in our view, a short-term situation. Because there are many things that operators can do in the future to stabilize the margin on the roaming front in the future, many things, but more long term than short term.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Is there some regulatory solutions to stop losing money on roaming or the compensation?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I believe we can be very clear and bold. I mean, something we are selling for free, which is costing us is never going to be money making, that's clear. Roaming in Europe will not be money making because it is free, okay? But let's look at things positively. I mean, this regulation is brand-new. It's been put in place very recently in Poland. Obviously, as we said, we are going to negotiate prices we pay to other operators. That's one. Second of all, it's yet another reason why the Polish market should be keen on, I would say, some kind of repair on the prices front. Because after the very high price of licenses a few year ago, now we are all hit by roam-like-home, all of us. So that's also, I would say, positive. We can look at things positively as well. I think in the longer term, this is not going to be a sustainable situation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, okay. Could you comment on KPIs of the mobile segment, because you've lost over 800,000 of prepaid SIM cards as, like only acquired only 120,000 of postpaid customers. And why KPIs in mobile segment are so weak? I know there is some impact of the prepaid (inaudible) registration still. Okay, it's got -- because you've mentioned about it in the presentation. But what exactly happened to the KPIs, and thus, the cut in subsidies have impact on lower acquisition on all the mobile customers?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So we have not especially commented prepaid this time, because -- but if you remember well in the previous conferences, we were really explaining that there would be 2 prepaid markets. There would be the prepaid market before registration with some dynamics. And there would be a prepaid market after registration. Now we clearly are after registration, and the dynamics are not at all the same, especially on the gross adds side. So you can understand very well that the number of new prepaid cards acquired in the quarter is not at all the same than it used to be, simply because people need to show their papers, their ID papers before they are buying the prepaid card. So the level of gross adds in the prepaid business is not at all the same. It's uncomparable now in this new environment than it used to be before. So that is basically explaining this decline. Believe me, we are obviously watching very closely prepaid. If we look at actually the base, which is the active prepaid base, there is no issue at all in the evolution of our active prepaid base if we comparing Q2 to Q1. So there is no warning outside the fact I must admit that these KPI the way we all report it, market, mobile market, is declining. But it's simply due again to this registration effect. There is no, I would say, strong impact on our prepaid business as such.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And my last question is concerning -- would you like to say something? Just last quarter you saw that. So starting from Q3, it should normalize, okay, for (inaudible).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I mean, it was 12 months since the registration process started.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Piotr Raciborski, Wood & Company Financial Services, a.s., Research Division - Analyst [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My last question concerns CapEx, your plan to further cut CapEx ex fiber or...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As I was saying, it is our everyday job to optimize the CapEx. We do it not only on the business-as-usual front, but also on the fiber front. It's an ongoing activity of the management. Every week, we are working on the investment acceptance. And every week, we have the effects of that. Long-term perspective is I guess quite positive for us. But we need to take into account that in the future, we may have some additional transformation costs in the CapEx, which are not existing today because we will have to transform the business, but more on that will be in September.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Any more? So I suggest to switch to our teleconference listeners. Operator, please.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Ondrej Cabejšek from Berenberg.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ondrej Cabejšek, Berenberg, Research Division - Analyst [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My first question is a follow-up on the fiber to the home net adds. So I was wondering if you sort of normalize this quarter for the working days comparative to previous quarters, what your net adds would look like, if you have an estimate? And second question would be if you could break down in terms of your commercial adds in mobile in terms of subsidies SIM-only and installments? What was the share this quarter and what was it say a year ago? And how big of a risk do you think that subsidies returning to the market eventually is? And what would trigger that potentially?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ondrej, this is Maciej speaking. The -- I'm not sure I fully understood the first question. This is about the normalization of the sales of the fiber, yes? And predictions for the second semester of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ondrej Cabejšek, Berenberg, Research Division - Analyst [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, exactly. So if you took out the bank holidays and all the long weekends that you said were impacting the fiber net adds this quarter, and you had a normal quarter in terms of work days, and thus, days where you sell this product, what would be roughly the number of fiber-to-the-home net adds that you would have had in the quarter (inaudible)?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, we will not be guiding by weeks ourselves. I think it's more comfortable for everybody to take a look at the longer perspective. For ourselves, the second semester is comprising of 2 periods basically. There is a period until the end of August. And this is, for many, our customers or future customers, a vacation period. And then from September, what starts really is the back to school. And then the next commercial season is the Christmas season. So we will have most probably 2 different types of dynamics in those 2 seasons. So it's -- sorry, they do not fit exactly the quarter realization, but that's the reality that we have.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry, if we would normalize the sales would be higher, basically, and the daily sales are increasing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, the second question of Ondrej was about the importance of the SIM-only in adds. Right now, we have 2/3 of our adds in SIM-only. Last year, it was around half. Does it answer your question?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ondrej Cabejšek, Berenberg, Research Division - Analyst [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It does partly. Break down the remaining 1/3 in terms of installments and subsidies, or is that something that you don't want to comment on?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, then the rest is subsidies, basically -- excuse me, installments. There is no almost anything sold on the subsidized, typical subsidized front. It is installments.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Anna Kazaryan from VTB Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Kazaryan, VTB Capital, Research Division - Equities Analyst [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Could you please share your view on the current competitive environment on Polish telecom market? And do you see that T-Mobile is still aggressive? And do you see a room for price increases in mobile segment? It's my first question. And second question is about handset sales. Could you share what's the gross margin on handset sales after the latest price increases, in probably a rough number?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shall I take this one? So talking about the Polish market. First of all, on the prepaid market, we see quite some aggressiveness from players. We have decided actually not to follow. We are a strong player on prepaid. So some of them have been, actually been very aggressive on the low end vendors and lowered the price on the first prepaid packages. We decided not to follow. Our sales are good, and we want really not to enter in this small price war on prepaid. That's one. On postpaid, yes, T-Mobile is still aggressive. We are, as you understood, cautious. We believe that looking at everything that is happening on this market, and especially the new roam-like-home, this is not the moment to fuel a price war. So we are extremely cautious about defending our value. If you look at our sales, they are good. Our net additions on mobile are quite strong. So there is no reason at all for us to change the strategy at this point of time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So regarding the margin on the subsidies, we will not guide you very precisely here. But we are still slightly subsidizing the whole activity. It is the level of the subsidy which diminished very significantly, in our view, around 6x. And still the overall margin on the activity is below the water. So we are still slightly subsidizing, but much, much less versus what we have been doing a year ago.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And as concerns your question about price increases, we would not see it like that. We would not see it like that. But we would rather believe that in this market, there is space for what we call more for more basically. And that's -- obviously we don't know what the other players and competitors are going to do and how they're going to behave. But we definitely believe that there is space for such a strategy in Poland.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna, you wanted to ask one additional question, yes?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anna Kazaryan, VTB Capital, Research Division - Equities Analyst [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. I just want to clarify, so just about handset sales. So what's the level of the gross margin of this particular segment of your revenue?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is not very different from being close to a 0 situation, but still some millions of subsidy in Q2.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from (inaudible).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My question was regarding your fiber monetization. You said you continue to work on it. Could you expand on how you plan to do that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, with pleasure. We are very much in line our business case that we have presented to the market quite a time ago. And just to recall you, the main coordinates of this business case, we want to reach between 25% to 30% of the customer coverage on the production that we do. We want to have payback within 8 to 12 years depending on the level of the competition that we have. And the IRR on overall business case should be higher by -- higher than the WACC of the company, significantly higher. So these are the elements that are still valid as of today. Of course, there are some differences, a little bit lower ARPU, a little bit lower costs. So all of that still flies within the original business case.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question is coming from Vera Sutedja from Erste Bank.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maria Veronika Sutedja, Erste Group Bank AG, Research Division - Analyst [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My question is related to the real estate sale. Is this the second quarter figure is part of a bigger deal of, let's say, bigger package in term of the sale? You said that you have an ambitious plan in the second half. What is the realistic case? Are we expecting similar or even bigger than the second quarter? The second question related to your presentation on page 22, where you mention the flexibility for commercial spending in the peak season. Is this related specifically to Orange Love, to fiber, or to mobile? And I'm wondering -- I'm trying to figure out the balance here between what you said focus on value versus this flexibility on for commercial spending because they are in contrary to each other.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vera, so I will take the answer to the question number one, real estate second semester expectations. It is not connected what we expect to achieve in the second semester with the transactions closed in the first semester. And thus by definition, it is subject to quite high uncertainty how the results will look like in reality. But we shoot high with our targets. We shoot really high.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maria Veronika Sutedja, Erste Group Bank AG, Research Division - Analyst [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. May I just add on that question? For example, if this real estate in the second half does not come true, the guidance of the EBITDA PLN 2.8 billion to PLN 3 billion will not be in danger, right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------No, it's -- with all risks and opportunities that we have, the guidance that we present to you, that we reiterate by the way today, it's PLN 2.8 billion to PLN 3.0 billion, is something that we are going to achieve.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------To come back on your first question on the subsidies, clearly, we are stating this because Q4 is always a very strong period. The Christmas period is a very strong sales period. Attached to the very strong sales is attached, of course, strong, big commercial costs. That's the reason why you heard this comment earlier. When we are saying we want to defend value is where you understood it, much more careful with the subsidies than we used to be in the past. And it is not that we are not subsidizing anymore our offers. We are, but some of them we are not, some of them we are less. And obviously, we put emphasis on what is strategic for us. So the emphasis is put on Orange Love, our convergent offers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [50]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from (inaudible).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------My question is on your net additions in broadband. You showed some increase in Q2. But if I dig deeper into the figures, I see that actually if you were to exclude the wireless book fixed, then your net additions will be approximately 0. So my question is actually if you consider this CapEx (inaudible) replacement CapEx, or if you actually point your CapEx strategically right? Because actually, if you take the real fixed broadband and net add is 0, this is simply a replacement. And what people want to buy is wireless for fixed. So if you could comment on this.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, my first comment is that wireless fixed is real. Fixed broadband seen from a customer point of view, because customers don't really care on how we are providing, but more the experience they have. So that's the first point. So you cannot just exclude this by stating this is not real. However, I get your question, and it's obviously a good question. You're right. If we would exclude the wireless, then we are almost at equilibrium. I would like to remind that the way we have done this fiber investment in the past still is we have done this investment on areas which are mostly large cities where our market share is not that high because the cable competition has been playing its role. So I remind you that in the last quarter, 70% of our gross adds have been customers taken from competition. So that's one of the things you need to remind as well when looking at these fiber numbers. This is an aggressive weapon towards competition. This is not, I would say, fiber is not the weapon where we are migrating our ADSL base. So that explains also this. I think this is something you should really keep in mind. Obviously across the time, this can change.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So do you believe that you can come to a point when the increase will -- net adds will be higher than 0? I mean if fiber will be taking up more clients than ADSL will lose? (inaudible).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [54]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not only we believe, but we are working very hard to reach there. Believe me. So not only we believe again, but we are really working hard to do that on products, on distribution channels, on -- also on the TV, on the content that we are providing on fiber. So that's -- we more than believe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [55]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All right. So this should improve over time. And then the other follow-up is are you able to really charge a premium over ADSL with fiber? How do they compare the price for the old spectrum technology to ADSL, VDSL and fiber?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jean-François Fallacher, Orange Polska S.A. - President of the Management Board and CEO [56]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is not the case. This is not the case because we are in a very competitive market in Poland. And obviously, it's not a fight against ourselves. The question is not pricing of fiber versus pricing of ADSL. The question was what products are we putting on the market and how competitive it is. So now we have with fiber a competitive product, which is priced accordingly to, I would say, to the market conditions in Poland. So unfortunately, I cannot tell you that actually there is a big, I would say, price delta with ADSL. I remind that our strategy is convergence. And there, we are creating value. So the strategy is by convergence, getting additional RGUs, getting additional products from a given family, from a given household, thanks to this convergence strategy. That's where our strategy is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [57]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As we do not have any questions from teleconference, just space for one more follow-up from the floor please. Pawel?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unidentified Analyst, [58]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Question on presenting of your results. You are a telecom company, not real estate disposal agency. You present all the figures in an appropriate way. I like your Excel, et cetera. But you still include your gain on assets disposal in adjusted EBITDA, which is inappropriate. Your adjusted EBITDA margin is not appropriate because it's affected with one-off disposal of assets, which happened in quarter 2, which would be actually weaker quarter on quarter. And these disposals provide 1/3 of bottom line and 1/3 of your net free cash flow for the quarter. So maybe it's time to adjust your adjusted EBITDA for non-telco activity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Maciej Nowohonski, Orange Polska S.A. - Member of the Management Board & CFO [59]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much for the question, first of all, and recommendation, second of all. I will very elegantly disagree with you because the nature of the telco business is as it is. Incumbents are as they are. They are coming from the past, very similar for each incumbent. And you will find a similar activities of real estate optimization in each incumbent. So it is inherent part of our business. We have to optimize that. And this is the optimization that we are doing. Previously, we needed maybe a building to contain our network infrastructure in a given city. Right now, it is just a container. It's a natural way of progressing with the network, not only quality, but the network infrastructure costs as well. So I will once again disagree with recommendation, but thank you for the question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Leszek Iwaszko, Orange Polska S.A. - Director of IR Department [60]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you very much for your attention. And welcome -- would like to invite -- reiterate our invitation for our special event on the 4th of September on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Thank you very much and have a good day.
