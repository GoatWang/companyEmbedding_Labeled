This document may contain statements that could constitute forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the Company's expectations for its future performance, revenues, income, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends, liquidity and capital structure; the effects of its debt restructuring process; the impact of emergency laws enacted by the Argentine Government; and the impact of rate changes and competition on the Company's future financial performance. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "projects," "intends," "should," "seeks," "estimates," "future" or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect the Company's expected results. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the impact of emergency laws enacted by the Argentine government that have resulted in the repeal of Argentina's Convertibility law, devaluation of the peso, various changes in restrictions on the ability to exchange pesos into foreign currencies,  and currency transfer policy generally, the "pesification" of tariffs charged for public services, the elimination of indexes to adjust rates charged for public services and the Executive branch announcement to renegotiate the terms of the concessions granted to public service providers, including Telecom. Due to extensive changes in laws and economic and business conditions in Argentina, it is difficult to predict the impact of these changes on the Company's financial condition. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, the evolution of the economy in Argentina, growing inflationary pressure and evolution in consumer spending and the outcome of certain legal proceedings. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as the date of this document. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events and circumstances after the date of this press release, including, without limitation, changes in the Company's business or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are encouraged to consult the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F, as well as periodic filings made on Form 6-K, which are filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for further information concerning risks and uncertainties faced by Telecom.

Argentina is home to Latin America's third largest economy, with one of the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita incomes in the region. While the country's economic performance has been very volatile, the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange has become one of the region's most important securities exchanges over the past several years.The MERVAL (MERcado de VALores) is the most important stock index in the country, making it a key barometer for the country and region's economy health.









 As of September 2015, the MERVAL index had 13 components valued at 9,631.94 Argentine dollars. Over the past seven years, the index has appreciated from about 2,000.00 towards the end of 2008 to these levels today.Components of the MERVAL IndexThe MERVAL index consists of 13 different components that were selected by market share, number of transactions and quotation price. With a base price set on June 30, 1986 at 0.01 Argentine pesos, the index is updated every three months based on market share during the previous period in order to ensure the index is adequately diversified.As of September 2015, components include:Aluar Aluminio Argentino SAICPetrobrasBanco Macro SASociedad Comercial del Plata SAEmp. Dist. Com.NorteTernium SiderarBBVA Banco FrancGrupo Financiero Galicia SAPampa Energia SAPetrobras Argentina SATanaris SAYPF SAInvesting in the MERVAL IndexU.S. investors looking for exposure to the MERVAL index have a couple different options.



 Many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer exposure to Argentina's economy and are likely to be overweight in these 13 companies, while American Depository Receipts (ADRs) offer a more direct way to build exposure to some of the index's components.Argentina's primary ETF is the Global X Funds FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE: ARGT), which includes the 20 largest and most liquid companies that directly participate in the Argentine economy, but are not listed in Argentina.









 Many of the companies held by the ETF are ADR versions of the members of the MERVAL index.Some popular ADRs to directly invest include:Tenaris SA (NYSE: TS)Banco Macro SA (NYSE: BMA)Telecom Argentina SA (NYSE: TEO)YPF SA (NYSE: YPF)Petrobras Argentina SA (NYSE: PZE)Important Risks to ConsiderInvestors should be aware of several risks before committing money to the MERVAL index components or other Argentine stocks or ETFs. From a volatile political and economic environment to high exposure to certain companies, investors should carefully weigh these risks before investing in any of the aforementioned options.Here are some risks to consider:The Global X Funds FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE: ARGT) is overweight in energy (39.76%), financials (16.83%), and information technology (13.28%), while Tenaris SA accounts for 19.98% of its portfolio and YPF SA accounts for 13.51% of the total.The country faces a number of geopolitical risks, including poor fiscal policy, high public debt, an unstable currency and bouts of high inflation at times, which have led to a number of revolts, including the economic collapse in 2001.The country's leaders have a history of intervening in the currency and capital markets in order to effect changes. For example, President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner has imposed limits on currency flows to try and artificially stem inflation.










Key Takeaway PointsArgentina is home to Latin America's third largest economy, making it a popular investment destination for many international investors.Investors can build exposure with the Global X Funds FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE: ARGT) and many ADRs that trade on U.S. exchanges.Investors should be aware of the many risks associated with investing in Argentina, ranging from political risk to inflation risks.
