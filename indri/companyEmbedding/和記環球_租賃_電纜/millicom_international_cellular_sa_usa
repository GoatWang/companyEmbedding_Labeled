      Millicom International Cellular: Tigo Pesa and Worldremit Enable Easy 
      International Money Transfers for the Tanzanian Diaspora
    





August 19, 2015 03:18 AM Eastern Daylight Time



STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Millicom, (NASDAQ:MICC) (STO:MIC), today announced that Tigo Pesa, its 
      Mobile Financial Services in Tanzania, has joined with WorldRemit, the 
      London-based online peer to peer money transfer service. The partnership 
      will enable the Tanzanian diaspora to directly send money to families 
      and friends back home through their smartphones, tablets and computers.
    


      Announcing the launch in Dar es Salaam today, Tigo Head of Mobile 
      Financial Services, Ruan Swanepoel, said Tigo Pesa is now the most 
      common receive method for international remittances to Tanzania for 
      WorldRemit customers, having overtaken cash pick-ups, airtime top up and 
      transfers to bank accounts.  
    

      Ruan said: “Working with WorldRemit is part of the company’s strategy to 
      fully integrate Tigo Pesa to the international payment system. Our 
      vision is to make Tigo Pesa customers enjoy making unlimited financial 
      transactions both locally and internationally from the convenience of 
      their phones. WorldRemit provides not only increased transfer speed but 
      also offers better rates as compared to other available money transfer 
      services.”
    

      There are about 250,000 Tanzanian emigrants living abroad, according to 
      the latest World Bank data, with the United Kingdom, United States and 
      Canada having the highest numbers of Tanzanians living outside of Africa.
    

      The World Bank also portrays Tanzania as an important receive market for 
      remittances. In 2014 the country received a total of US$64 million from 
      Tanzanians living abroad. The top sender countries responsible to 
      Tanzania include Kenya, United Kingdom, Uganda, Canada, United States, 
      Australia and South Africa.
    

      Jeff Pietras, VP for International Product Development, WorldRemit said: 
      “WorldRemit is revolutionising the tired world of money transfers 
      through our online and mobile only service. People around the globe can 
      send money instantly to Tigo Pesa wallets with just a few clicks or taps 
      on their smartphone and enjoy fair, transparent pricing.”
    

      WorldRemit is a leader in online money transfers to Mobile Money 
      services, which is now the preferred method for receiving money in many 
      countries. Transfers to Mobile Money services in Africa have grown by 
      more than 200% over the past year, and represent over 30% of all 
      WorldRemit’s transfers originating in Europe and the USA.
    

      To be able to send money directly to their family members or friends in 
      Tanzania with Tigo Pesa accounts, a person living abroad should visit: 
      https (https://www.worldremit.com/en/tanzania/tigo-mobile-wallet):// (https://www.worldremit.com/en/tanzania/tigo-mobile-wallet)www.worldremit.com/en/tanzania/tigo-mobile-wallet

      or Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worldremit.android) 
      .
    

      This is the second international money transfer service to be launched 
      by Tigo Pesa following last year’s launch of money transfer service with 
      currency conversion to Rwanda. Tigo Pesa is also integrated with the 
      financial services of leading commercial banks in the country enabling 
      Tigo customers to withdraw or deposit money from their e-wallets to 
      their bank accounts and vice-versa.

Millicom International Cellular SA is an international telecommunications and media company. It offers a wide range of digital services to more than 63 million customers primarily under the Tigo brand in fourteen markets in Africa and Latin America. Its online partnerships are active in more than 40 markets.
Millicom was one of the earliest pioneers of mass consumer mobile telephony and was formed in 1990 when Millicom Incorporated merged with the Swedish investment company Industriforvaltnings AP Kinnevik. Since then, the firm has seen annual revenue grow to $7.2billion, driven mainly by mobile phone services and, increasingly, by data, with an expanding portfolio of cable, satellite, broadband, e-commerce, Mobile Financial Services, B2B and other media.
In March 2015 it was announced that Mauricio Ramos, formerly of Liberty Global, would become the company's new Chief Executive from 1 April 2015.
The same year, Millicom announced a new business strategy around monetizing data and building cable,[2] with the stated ambition to become the 2nd largest Pay-TV operator in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Millicom's cable footprint grew in 2015 to 7.6 million homes passed and is expected to exceed 8 million by the end of 2016.
The company's Mobile Financial Services account for more than 40 per cent of the total number of active mobile money subscribers in Latin America. In Africa, Millicom set up the continent's first ever universal interoperable mobile money network through its Tigo Pesa brand in Tanzania that includes Airtel, Zantel and Vodacom. Tanzania is considered to be a world leader in terms of mobile money customization.
Millicom employs 15,800 people, has corporate offices in London, Miami and Luxembourg, and is listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm under the symbol MIC_SDB.

History[edit]
Millicom originated as a company set up by Jan Stenbeck to operate voice and data distribution networks via cellular radio. [3][4] In Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.[5] it received one of three of the first cellular development licenses awarded by the FCC.
After two years of planning, the company began operations when the founders completed a $131,000 share purchase in May 1982. The firm took over paging company, Meta Systems in October 1982 and then raised $9 million in its first round of financing, managed by Chief Executive Officer, Orhan Sadik-Khan and Kevin Kimberlin.[6][7]
Since 92% of the world population had no phone service at the time, Millicom promoted mobile technology on a global basis.[8] To do this, Millicom created joint-ventures with local and strategic partners.
On December 13, 1982, a joint-venture with Racal Electronics was awarded a cellular license for Great Britain. To enable Millicom to earn its 10% royalty from Racal-Millicom, a controlling shareholder, Stenbeck commissioned a start up with two employees, Technophone, to develop the world’s first pocket-sized mobile phone.[9] Highlighting its plans to offer the Voice and Data phone (predecessor to the smart phone), his Racal-Millicom joint-venture was renamed Vodafone.[10]
On October 12, 1983, Millicom Inc. created China Telecom Systems (HK), a joint-venture with partners China Resources Ltd. and Comvik, a Swedish mobile firm also controlled by Jan Stenbeck.[11] China Telecom held the first cellular telephone contract in China, making its service available to the public on May 20, 1985.[12]
In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchinson Telecom.)[13] Microtel was awarded a personal communication network (PCN) license to compete with Vodafone in Great Britain, a service launched in April 28, 1994 under its brand name, Orange.[14] This venture was acquired in October 1999, at which time Orange and its new parent, Mannesmann, were in turn both taken over by Vodafone. At a value of $202 billion,[15] the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone was the largest transaction in corporate history.[16][17] Orange (formerly Microtel) was then sold to France Telecom, which subsequently changed its corporate name to Orange.[18][19]
To better manage their respective mobile interests, Millicom Inc. combined with Comvik’s international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA in 1990, which now operates under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.[20]

Millicom International Cellular SA is an international telecommunications and media company. It offers a wide range of digital services to more than 63 million customers primarily under the Tigo brand in fourteen markets in Africa and Latin America. Its online partnerships are active in more than 40 markets.
Millicom was one of the earliest pioneers of mass consumer mobile telephony and was formed in 1990 when Millicom Incorporated merged with the Swedish investment company Industriforvaltnings AP Kinnevik. Since then, the firm has seen annual revenue grow to $7.2billion, driven mainly by mobile phone services and, increasingly, by data, with an expanding portfolio of cable, satellite, broadband, e-commerce, Mobile Financial Services, B2B and other media.
In March 2015 it was announced that Mauricio Ramos, formerly of Liberty Global, would become the company's new Chief Executive from 1 April 2015.
The same year, Millicom announced a new business strategy around monetizing data and building cable,[2] with the stated ambition to become the 2nd largest Pay-TV operator in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Millicom's cable footprint grew in 2015 to 7.6 million homes passed and is expected to exceed 8 million by the end of 2016.
The company's Mobile Financial Services account for more than 40 per cent of the total number of active mobile money subscribers in Latin America. In Africa, Millicom set up the continent's first ever universal interoperable mobile money network through its Tigo Pesa brand in Tanzania that includes Airtel, Zantel and Vodacom. Tanzania is considered to be a world leader in terms of mobile money customization.
Millicom employs 15,800 people, has corporate offices in London, Miami and Luxembourg, and is listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm under the symbol MIC_SDB.

History[edit]
Millicom originated as a company set up by Jan Stenbeck to operate voice and data distribution networks via cellular radio. [3][4] In Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.[5] it received one of three of the first cellular development licenses awarded by the FCC.
After two years of planning, the company began operations when the founders completed a $131,000 share purchase in May 1982. The firm took over paging company, Meta Systems in October 1982 and then raised $9 million in its first round of financing, managed by Chief Executive Officer, Orhan Sadik-Khan and Kevin Kimberlin.[6][7]
Since 92% of the world population had no phone service at the time, Millicom promoted mobile technology on a global basis.[8] To do this, Millicom created joint-ventures with local and strategic partners.
On December 13, 1982, a joint-venture with Racal Electronics was awarded a cellular license for Great Britain. To enable Millicom to earn its 10% royalty from Racal-Millicom, a controlling shareholder, Stenbeck commissioned a start up with two employees, Technophone, to develop the world’s first pocket-sized mobile phone.[9] Highlighting its plans to offer the Voice and Data phone (predecessor to the smart phone), his Racal-Millicom joint-venture was renamed Vodafone.[10]
On October 12, 1983, Millicom Inc. created China Telecom Systems (HK), a joint-venture with partners China Resources Ltd. and Comvik, a Swedish mobile firm also controlled by Jan Stenbeck.[11] China Telecom held the first cellular telephone contract in China, making its service available to the public on May 20, 1985.[12]
In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchinson Telecom.)[13] Microtel was awarded a personal communication network (PCN) license to compete with Vodafone in Great Britain, a service launched in April 28, 1994 under its brand name, Orange.[14] This venture was acquired in October 1999, at which time Orange and its new parent, Mannesmann, were in turn both taken over by Vodafone. At a value of $202 billion,[15] the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone was the largest transaction in corporate history.[16][17] Orange (formerly Microtel) was then sold to France Telecom, which subsequently changed its corporate name to Orange.[18][19]
To better manage their respective mobile interests, Millicom Inc. combined with Comvik’s international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA in 1990, which now operates under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.[20]

Millicom International Cellular SA is an international telecommunications and media company. It offers a wide range of digital services to more than 63 million customers primarily under the Tigo brand in fourteen markets in Africa and Latin America. Its online partnerships are active in more than 40 markets.
Millicom was one of the earliest pioneers of mass consumer mobile telephony and was formed in 1990 when Millicom Incorporated merged with the Swedish investment company Industriforvaltnings AP Kinnevik. Since then, the firm has seen annual revenue grow to $7.2billion, driven mainly by mobile phone services and, increasingly, by data, with an expanding portfolio of cable, satellite, broadband, e-commerce, Mobile Financial Services, B2B and other media.
In March 2015 it was announced that Mauricio Ramos, formerly of Liberty Global, would become the company's new Chief Executive from 1 April 2015.
The same year, Millicom announced a new business strategy around monetizing data and building cable,[2] with the stated ambition to become the 2nd largest Pay-TV operator in Spanish-speaking Latin America. Millicom's cable footprint grew in 2015 to 7.6 million homes passed and is expected to exceed 8 million by the end of 2016.
The company's Mobile Financial Services account for more than 40 per cent of the total number of active mobile money subscribers in Latin America. In Africa, Millicom set up the continent's first ever universal interoperable mobile money network through its Tigo Pesa brand in Tanzania that includes Airtel, Zantel and Vodacom. Tanzania is considered to be a world leader in terms of mobile money customization.
Millicom employs 15,800 people, has corporate offices in London, Miami and Luxembourg, and is listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm under the symbol MIC_SDB.

History[edit]
Millicom originated as a company set up by Jan Stenbeck to operate voice and data distribution networks via cellular radio. [3][4] In Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.[5] it received one of three of the first cellular development licenses awarded by the FCC.
After two years of planning, the company began operations when the founders completed a $131,000 share purchase in May 1982. The firm took over paging company, Meta Systems in October 1982 and then raised $9 million in its first round of financing, managed by Chief Executive Officer, Orhan Sadik-Khan and Kevin Kimberlin.[6][7]
Since 92% of the world population had no phone service at the time, Millicom promoted mobile technology on a global basis.[8] To do this, Millicom created joint-ventures with local and strategic partners.
On December 13, 1982, a joint-venture with Racal Electronics was awarded a cellular license for Great Britain. To enable Millicom to earn its 10% royalty from Racal-Millicom, a controlling shareholder, Stenbeck commissioned a start up with two employees, Technophone, to develop the world’s first pocket-sized mobile phone.[9] Highlighting its plans to offer the Voice and Data phone (predecessor to the smart phone), his Racal-Millicom joint-venture was renamed Vodafone.[10]
On October 12, 1983, Millicom Inc. created China Telecom Systems (HK), a joint-venture with partners China Resources Ltd. and Comvik, a Swedish mobile firm also controlled by Jan Stenbeck.[11] China Telecom held the first cellular telephone contract in China, making its service available to the public on May 20, 1985.[12]
In December 1989, Millicom set up Microtel Communications Ltd. by teaming up with Pacific Telesis and British Aerospace (later bought out by Hutchinson Telecom.)[13] Microtel was awarded a personal communication network (PCN) license to compete with Vodafone in Great Britain, a service launched in April 28, 1994 under its brand name, Orange.[14] This venture was acquired in October 1999, at which time Orange and its new parent, Mannesmann, were in turn both taken over by Vodafone. At a value of $202 billion,[15] the takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone was the largest transaction in corporate history.[16][17] Orange (formerly Microtel) was then sold to France Telecom, which subsequently changed its corporate name to Orange.[18][19]
To better manage their respective mobile interests, Millicom Inc. combined with Comvik’s international cellular operations to become Millicom International Cellular SA in 1990, which now operates under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.[20]
