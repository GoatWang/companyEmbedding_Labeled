O2 Czech Republic uses additional frequencies to boost 4G LTE speeds in Prague
27 Jul 2017

Czech Republic


Mobile operator O2 Czech Republic says it is using its new frequency blocks in the 1800MHz band to help deliver what it claims are the fastest mobile internet services in Prague, while simultaneously preparing its network for the future. In recent months, the cellco has built a number of new transmitters, increased network capacity, and utilised more capacity layers at a time, it said in a press release, resulting in a 33% improvement in average 4G LTE speeds in the capital since the beginning of this year. O2 Commercial Division Director Jindrich Fremuth said that by dint of the large contiguous spectrum allocation it has at 1800MHz by exchanging frequencies with other operators, it can offer higher capacity and network speeds in the Republic.
In recent years O2 CR has invested billions of Czech crowns in developing its new network and buying frequency rights. Earlier this month, the Czech Telecommunication Office (Cesky telekomunikacni urad, CTU) announced that O2 CR was one of four companies – the others being Vodafone Czech Republic and new entrants Nordic Telecom 5G and PODA – awarded spectrum in the 3.7GHz band (3600MHz-3800MHz) following an auction process that began on 13 June. The 3.7GHz frequency blocks will be used for ultra-high speed wireless data networks and future building of fifth-generation networks. The auction generated revenue of CZK1.015 billion (USD44.4 million) for state coffers, with the CTU selling off a total of five 40MHz blocks of frequencies, priced at CZK203 million each; the reserve price was set at CZK145 million per block. Nordic Telecom 5G won two blocks, and the other winners took one each.
O2 Czech Republic’s 4G LTE network currently comprises 5,329 transmitters in the Czech Republic, of which 635 are in Prague and 220 in Brno. In both cities, O2 also uses a 2CC and 3CC bundle connection to achieve higher order connection speeds and higher network capacity, it said.

O2 Czech Republic (operating under the O2 brand) is a major integrated operator in the Czech Republic. It is now operating more than six million lines, both fixed and mobile, making it one of the Czech Republic’s leading providers of fully converged services. O2 Czech Republic operates a fixed and mobile network including a 3rd generation network, CDMA (for data), UMTS and EDGE, enabling voice, data and video transmission. O2 Czech Republic is also a provider of ICT services
Previously two companies, fixed-line operator Český Telecom and mobile operator Eurotel, it was acquired by the Spanish company Telefónica in 2005 and merged into a single legal entity and given its present name on 1 July 2006.
In 2013 it was announced that Telefónica would sell its stake in the company to PPF and the company would continue to use the O2 brand for a maximum of four years.[2]
As of 1 June 2015 the separation of O2 Czech Republic as two mutually independent companies has been in force. Therefore, there are now two new telecommunications companies with two different lines of business: the retail operator O2 and the wholesale infrastructure provider CETIN. The separation includes commercial and managerial leadership and management of both companies, including security, IT and control systems. [3]
History[edit]
The company was initially known as SPT Telecom (Státní telekomunikační podnik, state-owned telecommunications company), and used to have a monopoly for providing fixed-line services. It was reorganized and renamed Český Telecom (Czech Telecom), after the Velvet Divorce saw Czechoslovakia separate into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.
Its mobile subsidiary, Eurotel, was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between SPT (51%) and the American joint-venture Atlantic West (between US WEST International, Inc. and Bell Atlantic International Inc.). On launch, it received an exclusive five-year licence to operate a public data network, and a 20-year licence for the 450 MHz band to operate an analogue NMT mobile phone network, and automatically also a right to buy a licence to the future GSM network.
In 2001, it won a license to the third-generation UMTS network. It paid 1 billion korunas immediately and promised to pay an additional 2.5 billion korunas annually. It also agreed to launch the service commercially, at least in Prague, by 1 January 2005. In 2003, it received a one-year extension in exchange for faster payments. In 2005 it was granted another year-long extension due to the granting of a third licence to Vodafone. In the event, UMTS services launched on 1 November 2005. On 1 May 2006, the company launched HSDPA services on top of UMTS services.
In 2004 it launched CDMA/1xEV-DO broadband wireless service (data-only) at 450 MHz, leveraging its legacy NMT network.
