WEB DISCLAIMER 


NOTICE: ONLINE ACCESS TO PROSPECTUS


By accessing the electronic Prospectus, you agree to and acknowledge reading these terms. If you would like us to send you a copy of the Prospectus and/or the Application Form (when available), please contact: 


Investorlink Securities Limited (Joint Lead Manager)


Tel: (02) 9276 2000 or +61 2 9276 2000 (from outside Australia)


Or


PAC Partners Pty Limited ( Joint Lead Manager)


Tel: (03) 8633 9831 or +61 3 8633 9831 (from outside Australia)


Or


Link Market Services Limited (Registry)


Tel: 1300 857 499 or +61 1300 857 499 (from outside Australia)


during the period in which the offer for Chess Depository Interests (CDIs) in Enice Holding Company Limited (Company) (Offer) remains open and a copy will be sent to you free of charge.


1. Prospectus





The Company lodged a Prospectus dated 26 August 2015 (Prospectus) with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The electronic copy of the Prospectus available on this website is a substantially faithful copy of the paper copy lodged with ASIC. The Prospectus contains details required by investors to acquire CDIs in the Company under the Prospectus. The paper form of the electronic Prospectus (including its attached Application Form) accessible through this website was lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on that date.


2. Important information


This notice does not form part of the Prospectus. You must read it before you attempt to access the electronic version of the Prospectus on this website and indicate your agreement or otherwise at the bottom of this notice.


The Prospectus is an important document that should be read in its entirety. Potential investors should read the entire Prospectus and, in particular, in considering the prospects for the Company, investors should consider the risk factors that could affect the performance of the Company. Investors should carefully consider these factors in light of their personal circumstances (including financial and taxation issues) and seek professional advice from a licensed investment adviser. Neither ASIC nor ASX Limited takes any responsibility for the contents of the Prospectus or the investment to which it relates. The Prospectus expires on 26 November 2016. No CDIs will be issued on the basis of the Prospectus after that expiry date.


3. Persons to whom the Offer is available


The electronic Prospectus on this Website must only be accessed from within Australia. If the electronic Prospectus is accessed by a person from outside Australia, it should not be downloaded or printed, nor should any application be made by that person for CDIs in the Company, unless the CDIs have been offered to an investor in any jurisdiction where to do so would not be in breach of the securities law requirements of the relevant jurisdiction. 


No action has been taken to register or qualify the Prospectus, the CDIs or the Offer in any jurisdiction outside Australia. The Prospectus does not constitute an offer of CDIs in any jurisdiction where, or to any persons to whom, it would be unlawful to issue this Prospectus or to make an offer of CDIs. In particular, the CDIs have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (US Securities Act) and may not be offered or sold in the United States except in transaction exempt from, or not subject to, registration under the US Securities Act and applicable US state securities laws. The contents of this Prospectus have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority in Hong Kong. You are advised to exercise caution in relation to the Offer. If you are in any doubt about any of the contents of the Prospectus, you should obtain independent professional advice.


The distribution of this Prospectus outside of Australia may be restricted by law and persons who come into possession of it should seek advice and observe any such restrictions. It is the responsibility of any applicant outside Australia to ensure compliance with all laws of any country relevant to that applicant's jurisdiction. Eligible CDI holders who are nominees, trustees or custodians are therefore advised to seek independent advice as to how they should proceed.


4. Application for CDIs


(1) printing and completing the Placement Application Form attached to or accompanied by the electronic Prospectus;


(2) and then lodging the Placement Application Form and the application moneys in accordance with the details set out in the Prospectus and the Application Form.


5. Acknowledgement 


The information on this website is provided for informational purposes only and subject to change without notice. Nothing contained on this website or in the Prospectus constitutes investment, legal, business, taxation or other advice, nor is it to be relied on in making an investment in the CDIs. The information on this website and in the Prospectus does not take into account your investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs.


Subject to the terms contained in this notice, an electronic copy of the Prospectus may be viewed or downloaded. You should ensure that any copy you view or print is complete.


I confirm have read and understood this Notice and agree to the terms and conditions above.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read and understood Investing.com AU's comment guidlines and agree to the terms described.
