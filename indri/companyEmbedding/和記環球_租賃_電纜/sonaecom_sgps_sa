Retailing Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Retailing is defined as any company involved in the sale of product or services. There are many ways to sell products. One can sell products online, in a storefront or by mail/catalog. Most brick and mortar stores have become chain stores that undercut mom and pop shops by purchasing large quantities in bulk and spread across multiple stores or in regions. 
	 Similarly, companies involved in selling products online or via mail/catalog are able to store product off premise and utilize replenishment systems or logistic companies to ship from off site locations.
Proper research can allow small businesses to expand their reach by creating an ecommerce store front or selling online. Retail outlets can be any product or service being sold. Convenience Stores, gas stations, home stores, technology stores, warehouse clubs, department stores, discount stores and chain stores are most well known. Having a strong base of suppliers is pivotal for the success of any retailer. Retailers can be affected by consumer confidence, personal income and interest rates on either credit cards or loans. Developing an in depth understanding of the parameters of retailing will aid in ensuring any company the success in a marketplace.
