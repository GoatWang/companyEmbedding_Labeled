Corporate History[edit]
On 19 October 1999, Maxis introduced the popular prepaid brand "Hotlink".
In 2002, Maxis acquired TimeCel, a rival mobile service provider, from TimedotCom Berhad. Prior to the purchase, Maxis offered prefix number beginning with 012, and TimeCel 017.
On 27 April 2007, an offer was made to buy out Maxis and privatise the company in preparation for expansions into the Indonesian, Indian, Mexican and Ecuadorian markets. The deal was offered by Ananda Krishnan, who pledged Maxis RM17.46 billion (US$5.1 billion and €4.25 billion) in exchange for all remaining shares of the company. The offer is to be formally made by Usaha Tegas, a company owned by Krishnan, on 3 May 2007, while the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange suspends trading of the company's shares until 3 May.[10][11][12][13][14]
Under the urging of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, Maxis announce that it will re-list the company in Bursa Malaysia on 11 November 2009. The initial public offering, which constitute 30% of the company and involve its Malaysian operations, will raise at least MYR 11.7 billion.[15]
On September 2013, Maxis prepaid, Hotlink launched its #Hotlink plan, which is basically the first telecommunications company to offer free internet services on cellular networks, Hotlink calling it "Free Basic Internet" which offers download speeds up to 64kbit/s and which the management says is enough for checking Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia on mobile optimised sites and also essentially eliminating data overage charges which as previously implemented at MYR 0.10/10KB.[16]
Majority Stakeholders[edit]
Maxis Communications is part of Ananda Krishnan's business empire. In 1996, the company launched Malaysia's first three satellites; MEASAT 1, 2 and 3. The fourth satellite, MEASAT 1R, was damaged during transport to the launch site and is currently under reconstruction. Saudi Telecom Company bought a 25% stake of Maxis.[citation needed]

The Maxis Communication Berhad Marketing Essay

To outline the who, what, where, when, why, and how
This report was commissioned to examine why Maxis has an opportunity to produce their own bran smart phone, since none of all telecommunication company has the same strategy yet and a way to recommend ways of increasing sales and revenue.
Who is the company targeting? Of course we separate the market according to different market segmentation. So we will target most on teenagers and low income market, which are under demographic segmentation.
What product is the company selling? The company is selling its own brand Smartphone. Instead of sub selling other manufacturer’s Smartphone, they decided to produce a Smartphone of their own name; first entry of their own produce may have dominated the market.
Where is the company doing the promotion? The company are going to promote their product according to demographic segmentation, which is more focusing on teenager where university and colleges around Malaysia. Furthermore they also are setting up booth in a mall where teenagers used to hang around.
When is the product launched and releasing? The product is releasing at end of year 2013, and will be launched at the same time.
Why is the company come out with this idea, It is because as said at the beginning of this proposal, first entry of the market will lead to market domination. Plus, there also will be more opportunity for the company to success.
And lastly how this product is going to success, there is few steps for how the product is going to success, firstly show it to potential buyers, next is determine the correct price, and third is to compare the product with other product on the market. And lastly is to take the product to a trade show. A sixth way to test market a product or service is take it to a trade show. There are 15,000 trade shows per annum all over the country. Sophisticated buyers go to trade shows and they will tell you rapidly whether or not you have a winner.
2.0 Company Overview
2.1 History/Background
Maxis Communication Berhad is the leading telecommunications service provider that started in the year 1993. Maxis Communication Berhad is the son Company of Usaha Tegas Group Holding Berhad, majority stake of the company, 70%, owned by Malaysian tycoon Tatparanandam Ananda Krishnan (richest man in Malaysia) Maxis have possession of 40% market share of telecommunication industry which converts to 10 million of users out of 28 million of population of Malaysia.
Since the commencement of commercial operations, Maxis provide varieties of mobile telecommunication products and services such as broadband, international roaming, MMS and so on. They started with the phone number starting with the prefix 012. Later they purchased Timecel which is another mobile services provider and that is when they started offering phone number starting with prefix of 017.
In 1999, they introduce the prepaid service. As competitors such as Digi, Celcom Telecommunication which offer lower prices and lots of offers and promotion, this forced Maxis to sell their prepaid starter pack as low as RM8.
In addition, the company also operates in international gateway services. Its geographical operations spread across Malaysia, Indonesia and India. In2006, Maxis achieves prestigious from the public. The readers of the Wall Street Journal Asia have rated Maxis as Malaysia’s most admired company in The Wall Street Journal Asia 200 survey in 2006.

This is what we at Maxis strive for every single day. It might seem a tall order, but at Maxis, we believe in setting high goals and standards. By pushing the limits and breaking new ground, we will become the company we aspire to be.
2.3 Mission
The mission of Maxis is:

The Objectives of Maxis is:
Connected to mainstream Information and Communications Technology (ICT) development Enabling an empowering these "connected communities"
Bring about socio-economic development for those communities in the various sectors such as agriculture, education, health, and business, amongst others.
3.0 Market Opportunity
3.1 Maxis’s Smartphone
After a long term discussion, we believe that one of the opportunity of Maxis is to produce their own brand smartphone, after a series of research, we found out that among the competitors of Maxis, nobody had joined this market, so we do believe that smartphone will be a good opportunity for Maxis, since Maxis provide smartphones services, they can make some promotion for example Discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone service package. Nowadays, telecommunication industry expands rapidly due to change of customer behavior and preference. More and more people tend to use smartphone and tablet online instead of netbook and notebook because smartphone are easier to carry compare to notebook. By providing the new technology 4G, Maxis will have more advantage by competing with other competitors. Now is a new generation of smartphone internet service in Market, 4G, it is a fourth generation of smartphone communications standards. It can provide you to online anytime and anywhere you want. So why don’t Maxis provide their own smartphones, by focusing on making it become a complementary product, we do believe that Maxis have the opportunity to earn more income in the market.
According to the Malaysia budget 2013, there are good news to Malaysia SME and younger generation. Firstly, the announcements of one-off smartphone RM200 rebate to individual age 21 to 30 with a monthly income of under RM 3,000. Within the rebate, RM300mil will be allocated for this initiative targeted to benefit 1.5 million youths nationwide. This will increase smartphone sales in future and also use of smartphone online services. Although this will cause short term drop of sales before the implementation of the rebate as consumer will stop to buy smartphone until 2013, but it will not affect the sales in the long run. Smartphones have become a necessity for us to connect, network, learn and do work. It should be a market opportunity for maxis to provide better package of smart phone online services before a coming boost up smart phone sales. According to Google Malaysia communications and public relation department head Zeffri Yusof, by signed up for the Google Malaysia " Get Malaysian Business Online" (GMBO) program can get more SMEs to use internet as a marketing platform to their products. He says that there are currently more than 17.5mil Malaysian Internet users who regularly search for products and services via online but there are not much local SME products that could be found on the World Wide Web.
By showing the research that we find, we once again make sure that by providing Maxis own mobile phone, it has a great potential to boost up their sales and lead up from the other competitors.
3.2 Market Growth Opportunity
In 2013, we have reached another level on technology era, from the newest research, we found that one quarter (23%) of teens 12 to 17 indicate that their phone is a smartphone, while 54% have a regular cell phone (or not sure what kind of phone they have), and another 23% of teens do not have a cell phone at all. From here we can see the potential of create a new phone by maxis.
Smartphone ownership is highest among older teens, as 31% of teens ages 14-17 have a smartphone, compared with just 8% of youth ages 12-13. The data suggest a cell phone ownership evolution by age. However, overall sales of mobiles phones fell 2.3% in the quarter as consumers held out of forthcoming devices. According to analyst firm Gartner "Demand slowed further in the second quarter of 2012," "the challenging economic environment and users postponing upgrades to take advantage of high-profile device launches and promotions available later in the year slowed demand across markets. Demand of feature phones continued to decline, significantly weakening the overall mobile phone market."
As the result we found, we know that, most of the teenagers are using smartphone now, so if Maxis do really can provide their own product. It will be the best opportunity to over pass their competitor and boost up the sales.
4.0 Target Market
Nowadays, most people have mobile phones and many have smartphones. Due to the technology innovations, telecommunication industry had launched smartphones instead of mobile phone. With the existing of smartphone, people do not have to bring their laptop or sit in front of the desktop to do their tasks since smartphones have combined multiple computing capabilities.
Maxis decide to focus on teenagers market. From the newest research, we found that one quarter (23%) of teens from 12 to 17 years old is using smartphone, while 54% have a regular cell phone (or not sure what kind of phone they have), and another 23% of teens do not have a cell phone. From here we can see that there have a number of teenagers prefer to use smartphone. However, most of the application of smartphone will function only when connecting with internet. Smartphones is very useful for teenagers’ todays. For example, Student’s text book is become more expensive especially for the students of University and college. So they like to download e-book through the smartphone to get the information instead of buying books. Besides that, teenagers need to keep up with their friends or colleagues by using smartphone with the social networking sites, Facebook. They can keep in touch and chat with their friends or have a discussion on Facebook via the smartphone wherever they are. So, Maxis will launch a package by given discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package. This package will more focus on another 23% of teens that do not have a cell phone and for the 54% of teens whose maybe want to change their cell phone to smartphone. By using this package, teenagers can have a smartphone and use it online everywhere or do their work with no worry for the network connection.
Apart from that, Maxis also decide to focus on low income market. In recent years, the importance of emerging markets and increase of competition among companies are pushing most of the companies to serve the low income group. According to the Malaysia budget 2013, individual age between 21 and 30 and earning under RM 3,000 can purchase smartphone with the RM 200 government rebate. This rebate is given a chance to those low income people who have not own a smartphone. On the same time, Maxis will launch some packages with phone by given discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package. This can increase the sale of smartphone in future and also the people use of smartphone online services. Discount and the price of the package are set affordable by all level income customers especially for low income customers for easily get attraction from them. By using this package, they can enjoy the online services with affordable price.
In conclusion, Maxis will more focus on teenagers and low income markets which are under Demographic Segmentation. With the constant technological innovation, almost everything can be done by using a smartphone and it is become more importance in our daily life. So, Maxis brand’s smartphone can be a good opportunity for them to boost up their sales
5.0 Marketing Mix Strategies
5.1 Product Strategies
Before Maxis announce the smartphone they produced, we will analyze the market needs which needed to fulfill. This is because Maxis have to fulfill the market needs to confirm the sales of the smartphone that we had produced.
Normally customer will purchase the smartphone according to their needs and budget. In this case, Maxis have to produce the smartphone to fulfill different level needs. For example, Maxis can produce the smartphone with high performance specification to fulfill the users who need smart phone to play games. Maxis also can produce the smart phone for the business usage user. This kind of smartphone will more focus on battery life time and office use function.
Other than that, Maxis also can choose to cooperate with smartphone manufacture to produce the phone with lower cost. Telecommunication providers from other country also use this strategy to produce the smartphone with lower cost. For example, AT&T from US had cooperated with Samsung to produce a special edition of Galaxy S2 for their sales usages. Maxis also can try to do so to reduce the cost of produce the smartphone.
Besides that, Maxis also can cooperate with those artist or designer to produce some special edition phone. In case of this, the sales of the smartphone will be increased because of the artist or designer reputation. For example, mobile phone manufacture from South Korea, LG had cooperated with Girls’ Generation, a famous female artist group from South Korea to promote their smartphone. Few years ago, Celcom also cooperate with LeeHom Wang, a Chinese artist from Taiwan to promote their product.
Maxis also find produce the smartphones that fully utilize the service that they provided. Nowadays, smartphone in the market mostly cannot fully utilize the technology that had introduced. In this case, Maxis can produce the smartphone which can fully use the technology in the market. By this, Maxis can fix the smartphone place in the market. For example, Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC One XL are the phones which can fully utilize the technology which is the 4G LTE. So, Maxis can try to cooperate with these smartphone manufactures to produce the smart phone which have this specification.
Packaging of a product also is an important issue for the product marketing. In case of this, Maxis can package the phone with some special design. For example, China mobile phone manufacture XiaoMi, they had packaged smartphone that they produced with a strong packing which can withstand 180kg of weight even it built with eco-friendly materials. With this kind of packaging, smartphone purchaser can have more
Confident to purchase online without worrying damages of product during transportation was done.
5.2 Pricing Strategy
Even that the product strategy is very important, pricing strategy of the product also very important for the new smartphone that Maxis will produce. As above there had mentioned that smartphone will produce to fulfill the different level needs, Maxis also have to price the smart phone according to the market that the smartphone have to face.
Maxis can choose the price leadership strategy as the pricing strategy. Price leadership strategy is an observation made of oligopolistic business behavior in which one company, usually the dominant competitor among several, leads the way in determining prices, the others soon following. The context is a state of limited competition, in which a market is shared by a small number of producers or sellers. In case of this, Maxis can price the smartphone produced in different price of other phone manufacture’ phone.
Other than that, Maxis also can apply the bundle pricing strategy as the pricing strategy. As we know, Maxis is the telecommunication provider in the market. They also provided the internet service for user. In case of this, Maxis can bundle the smartphone that they produced with the talk and internet plan that they launched. By this, users can purchase the smartphone and the talk and internet plan at the same time.
Product line pricing strategy also can be applied as the pricing strategy in Maxis. Maxis can price the smartphone according to the market that the smartphone focused with. For example, smartphone for entry level user should be priced at the low price which allowed for the users who wish to entry and try the smart phone.
Loyalty of customer also can be a point to price the product. For the customer who had used the service long term can provide discount for them. Maxis One Club is the best example of this. Maxis can price the smart phone that produced into this club with a cheaper price and as rewards for the loyal customer.
Psychology pricing strategy can be introduced in this case. Normally purchaser only will purchase product that they felt cheaper and worth for it. In case of this, Maxis can price the phone with the price that can make user or purchaser felt that the phone is cheaper than other competitors. For example, a smartphone that having market price of RM1400, Maxis can price it as RM1399 or RM1299 that can make consumer feel cheaper even that actually Maxis do not have any loss in the case.
5.3 Place Strategy
In an increasingly competitive and complex communication industry, the pace of technological innovation is such that no single company can survive if it operates alone. And Maxis has long recognized the need to work with a range of different partners locally and globally to broaden our range of offerings and to enhance capabilities as the preferred communications solution provider. Thus, it is also can be a platform for Maxis to establish smartphone not only inside the country but also to the other country.
The strong distribution channels that work with Maxis are ZyXEL Communication Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd, Advanced Broadband Communication Sdn. Bhd, TechScience Consultants & Services Sdn. Bhd. All of them we already know they were also a company that provide a solution for communication. For example, ZxXEL is providing the architecture of making a modem to the Telekom Malaysia (TM). So, Maxis have found this is an opportunity to distribute the new smartphone to this company. In addition, because this is a new innovation by Maxis they can see a potential that is created by them so they tend to expand their product globally. It is possible because they already have strong partners and alliances including outside the country. It should not be a problem for them.
Another chances that Maxis have is by the used of internet as their marketing platform. Here they can place not only the smartphone but including the other entire product under their company. By doing so, people can neglect all the suspicious information about the product because each features about Maxis’s product is briefly showed. A series of research found that there are currently 17.5 million Malaysian Internet users who regularly search for products and service via online. This is from area inside the country but can we figure out what will happen if people from other country which is also as the Internet Users who regularly seeking for products and service. This is sure to make profitable for Maxis.
Besides, the headquarters which is main office of particular area can distribute these products. In addition, they also can pace the product to all the other offices which belong to their area. This is to make sure their product will be separated and expanded regularly.
From researched we’ve found, most of the smartphone users were highest among older teens, which is 31% of teens ages 14 – 17 have a smartphone. Thus, we look up this thing as a big opportunity for established our new product, smartphone to the teenagers. Maxis including whole the organization are work together on looking a place which is the most popular place for teens go. We already identified the potential places and we suggest placing the product on carnival, universities colleges around Malaysia.
For example, ‘Jom Heboh Carnival’ is a place that many people go especially teenagers and we also can focus on mall or supermarket where teenagers used to hang around. We can explain and describe briefly about the product and hope they will show an interested on our product.
5.4 Promotion Strategy
Promotion is the business of communicating with customers. It will provide information that will assist them in making decisions to purchase a product or service. The pace and creativity of some promotional activities are almost alien to normal business activities.
Maxis provide a variety of mobile communication products and services. They offer prepaid calls plans, monthly subscription plans, international roaming, mms, wap, residential fixed line services and broadband internet plans. All these have been done great fully and they just do a stunning work. Maxis comes these entire product with make some promotion. Therefore, the same method will be used to the new smartphone. This is because we found out that among the competitors of Maxis, nobody had joined this kind of market, so we believe that smartphone will be a good chance for Maxis. Since Maxis provide mobile services, they can make some promotion. As example, they can give discount on smartphone if customers purchase their mobile service package.
Another method that can be used is advertising. Maxis can make an agreement with the advertising sources like printing media , television , radio are effective ways to entice customers and make them aware of the brand’s existence. In addition , billboards , hoarding , banners installed intelligently at strategic locations like heavy traffic areas , crossings , railway stations , bus stands attract the passing individuals towards our product. Beside, taglines also increase the recall value of the product among the customers.
Word of mouth is the most important method in our promotion strategy. We do believe that one satisfied customer brings ten more customers along with him whereas dis-satisfied customer takes away ten more customers. That’s the importance of word mouth. Positive word of mouth goes a long way in promoting our product among customers.
Another method that can be implemented is sponsorship. The meaning is, in this case, Maxis have to pay an organization to use their brand and logo .This organization usually has a high profile so that Maxis know that their product and brand will be seen by a large audience. Most common use of sponsorship is with sporting events. But seem that it is not suitable for Maxis. Maybe they can use sponsorship with celebrity awards events or any musical events as the events will attract wide audience around our country.
The next method is selling. Put simply, selling is the exchange of goods or services for an agreed of money. There have several stages that can be implement but Maxis take only the suitable for the goodness of their company. They can use presentation and demonstration approach. Here, presenting and demonstrating the features and benefits of their product which is smartphone in order to convince the prospect that people want or need can be satisfied.
The handling objections, closing and follow – up are the important elements that must have in a sale person or team.

In the year 2013, Maxis had sold 50 million units of the smartphones. Maxis have 50% of sales volume, which has a lower volume of their sales. This is because Maxis is just launch the smartphones in the market. Since Maxis brand smartphones is unknown to the public, Maxis will use some promotions to stress information about the features of the smartphones. For examples Maxis use media advertising such as newspaper, television, radio and billboards advertising to reach audiences in different ways. Besides that, Maxis also implement sponsorship to attract wide audience. Sometimes the smartphones may discover some technical problems and get financial loss at the beginning as Maxis need to spend money on advertising.
In the year 2014, Maxis had sold 80 million units of smartphones and the sales volume of the smartphones will increase rapidly to 80%. The sales volume has increase 30% compare to year 2013 as the promotions are effectively reaches to the audiences. This will attract new customers to make purchases and some customer may make repurchases. Besides that, Maxis offer some sales promotion such as give discount on smartphone if purchase their smartphone services package. This can encourage hesitant customers to try their product and will boost up the sales.
In the year 2015, the forecast sales volume of the smartphones will increase to 90%, which has increase 10% compare to previous year. Maxis have created customer loyalty on the smartphone and those customers will influence other people to buy our smartphone. Most of the customers are more loyal to Maxis brand’s smartphones. Besides that, Maxis will focus on improve the quality and services of the product or redesign the product to maintain the sales volume of smartphones.
6.2 Marketing Budget
The graph shows the marketing expense budget of Maxis Berhad for the smartphones from the years 2013 to 2015.
In the year 2013, Maxis will have a higher marketing expense budget which cost RM 80million. Since the smartphones is first launch by the Maxis, it needs more costs to enter a new market. To promote customers awareness, Maxis has use advertising such as newspaper, television, radio, billboards, hoarding or banners advertising. Other than that, Maxis had implemented sponsorship to attract wide audiences. This will cost a very high cost in marketing a product.
In the year 2014, the marketing expense budget has decrease to the amount of RM 60million. They do not need to spend more marketing costs than previous year as most of the customer already aware of the new product launch by the Maxis through the promotion. However, Maxis still need to offer some sales promotion to attract the hesitant customers to try their products.
In the year 2015, there have a decrease to the amount of RM 20 million. Maxis already create customer’s loyalty and word of mouth advertising will take place in this stage to help Maxis to promote their products. So, Maxis will tend to reduce some expenses on promotion.
7.0 Conclusion

Maxis will also grow its smartphone business; invest selectively in its own fixed-line footprint and leverage on the HSBB initiative.

                                Report abuseTranscript of MAXIS BERHADMAXIS BERHADHISTORYMaxis Mobile Sdn Bhd, which started operations in 1995, is the leading telecommunications service provider in Malaysia. Being the leader within the telecommunication industry, the corporation is the fifth largest Public Company in Malaysia with total subscribers of 6.4million, providing a wide range of innovative mobile, fixed and international network services to their customers. The head office is located within Menara Maxis, an elegant 49 storey building adjacent to the Petronas Twin Towers Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The building is the headquarters of the Tanjong Plc Group of Companies, Maxis Communications Berhad and their associated companies. Maxis Mobile Sdn Bhd first used the Cardax System (CC Unix) since 1998 when they moved their operations into Menara Maxis, owned and managed by Tanjong City Centre Property Management (Tanjong Plc Group of Companies). The building house over 585 Contactless Mifare Readers across 49 floors and Visitor Turnstiles with some offices having additional readers within their office premises for additional security.Maxis Mobile Sdn Bhd, which the founder is Ananda Krishnan who are one of the richest man in Malaysia. Generally, they provide varieties of mobile telecommunication products and services. They started with the phone number starting with the prefix of 012. Later they purchased the Timecel which is another mobile services provider and thats when they started offering phone number starting with prefix of 017. However only corporate company or businessman are able to afford this kind if services as the charges are high. Only in year 1999, they introduced the prepaid services. As competitors such as DiGi Telecommunication which offer lower prices and lots of offers and promotion, this forced Maxis to sell their prepaid starter pack as low as RM8. Currently, according to our own research and experiece working in related companies, Maxis currently hold most of the market share following by Digi. However it is found that most student range from 7-18 are using Digi. While the user range of 19-35 are using Maxis. In the other hand, with the support of government, celcom are able to survive in the market as it is linked to Telekom Malaysia and it is made compulsory to government officers and workers to use celcom as mobile service provider.BACKGROUNDBACKGROUNDPRODUCT & SERVICESCORPORATE STRACTUREMISSIONPRODUCTPRODUCT& SERVICESPERSONNELFull transcriptMore presentations by

3.3.1 Intertype competition
Intertype competitions define as competitions among firms in different type of businesses but which both firms selling the same product.
As we know that, Maxis Berhad offered the iPhone4 subscription plans to consumers and the company sells its iPhone4 to the customers with its own package.(Refer Appendices 1) Furthermore, the Apple Company is the manufacturer for the iPhone4. Apple Company also offers its iPhone4 to mobile shops. Thus, mobile shops are directly competed with Maxis Berhad and both of them are from different industry. It means that, the relationship between the Maxis Bhd and mobile shop are intertype competition. Basically, the customers will buy for Maxis Bhd Company rather than the other mobile shop. The reason is because of the successful for the promotion package that setting by the Maxis Berhad Company
3.3.2 Intratype competition
Intratype competition defines as competition among firms in the same type of business. Example Competition between Maxis and Digi which both of them is from the same business field that selling the same product which is mobile communication.
Maxis and Digi operating in the same business field which provide mobile communication services to customers. Digi targeted on teenagers by providing a entertainment service for this group consumers such as provide free internet connection with no cost for Digi consumers to view Facebook everyday by using stated link. Besides, Maxis doesn't provide this kind of opportunity for their consumers because most properly they target on those working populations. Maxis promoting family plans package that charges low cost for family member who using the same network to encourage family member sign up the package to save their cost.(Refer Appendices 15) Otherwise, Digi has come out with a package that is once we have send message more than RM 2 each day the continue cost will be free as consumers message to the same network .It only charge RM 2 each day if consumers fulfil the package condition.
3.4 Technological Forces
Maxis Berhad internet communication should improve their Maxis broadband by upgrade their internet connection speed. Even though Maxis broadband is convenience because we can online and bring to anywhere, but during peak season the internet connection will down and it cause a lot consumers complain about this matter. Thus, if Maxis Berhad can improve their internet connection it will bring a lot opportunity for their firm. Before Maxis Berhad provide 3G function customers just can use mobile phone to communicate with each others. But today Maxis Berhad has provide 3G function that allow consumers to communicate and look at each other by using mobile phone and it also can use as videoconferencing for companies meeting. Maxis Berhad also pronounce that their company is going to launch 4G function soon to keep improving their technologies to meet with modern times.

Maxis marketing practices and business decisions are significantly influenced by the regulatory forces in Malaysia. So, Maxis has some restriction in conducting its business. In order to adapt to this regulatory environment, Maxis has followed all the laws that are stated and adjusted its activities in conducting business.
Maxis Bhd is not a dominating company in the telecommunication industry in Malaysia. Malaysian's competition act 2010 has contained forbiddance of anti-competitive behaviour and prohibition of the misuse of a dominated market position in order to protect competition. So, the business competition is fair and encouraged in Malaysia. However, it also has been shaped a heavily competition environment. Thus, Maxis is always striving to be efficient and innovative in its practices. Besides that, it also always improves its research and development of new services and techniques in order to compete with its competitors and create the best value to the customers.
In addition, Maxis is also governed by the product-related legislation which attempts to protect both company and consumer. The patent law and the copyright law provides maxis the right to keep out other from producing, using or selling that violate the patented creation and the exclusive right of its own work. Example, the slogans and the advertisements of Maxis are the copyright of the Maxis, so only Maxis can use it and customers are easily to identify Maxis when they see the particular advertisements and slogans. Maxis is not allowed to infringe others rights as well. Due to the Consumer labelling and consumerism act in Malaysia, Maxis is required to list out all the terms and conditions of all its products and services when it promotes to the customers. Maxis and its customers are also protected by the trademarks act that ensure the consumers are purchasing the true product and guarantees the company has the exclusive right to the word, name and symbol. So, the word 'maxis' and its symbol will appear on its every product, in order to make customers to recognize and identify it from other company, no others can use the word 'maxis' in their products.
To boot, there is no fixing price allowed in Malaysia. In fact, whatever price of talking rate, SMS charge, and even the monthly charge of broadband provided by maxis are different with other same industry company. This situation proves that there is no anti-competitive behaviour in this field. The competition is very fair and healthy among the several companies. So, price discount is used by Maxis in order to compete with other, for example you will get cheaper talking charge if you talk more.
Maxis Bhd has made many exclusive dealings as its marketing practices, this distribution action is allowed in Malaysia. For example the maxis shops only sell the maxis packages, broadband and related products and services.
Also, Maxis is not engaging in the deceptive or misleading advertising which is illegal. Maxis advertisement is always correspond to the true of what it intended to let customers know.

7.0 Recommendations
After we analyzed the factors affect the Maxis marketing environment, the segmentation and marketing mix. We've found that there are some Maxis weaknesses in the certain part, which have to implement or adjust in order to improve the Maxis bhd. There are some recommendations that can lead Maxis Bhd to be more successful.
7.1.1 Innovation of new product
4G, the latest mobile internet service with voice has been launched by YTL communications sdn bhd. By comparing with other companies 3G package rate, it offers the lowest rate in the Malaysia market. Besides, the speed, coverage and benefit are advanced than 3G. Maxis bhd has to be awareness on the changing of competitor environment, understands the strength and weaknesses of competitors. Maxis bhd has to create the new product that can compete with the strong competitor, it also need to come out with the new idea of product to attract the buyer. Even though it might spend a lot of time and involve highly cost of research and development to create a new product, but the return of huge profits are able to cover all the costs involved and to boot the Maxis market share.
7.1.2 Improve the quality of the products and services
We've discovered that the Maxis Berhad has received some complaints from the customers about its 3G service. Even though the quality of Maxis service has been deemed to excellent in Malaysia, but, the 3G service is yet to be enough stable to reached the customers expectation. The 3G service of Maxis often drops to edge, and sometimes is very slow and even has no connection. So, we strongly recommend Maxis to put more effort in developing the more stable and qualified 3G service to the customers. Other than that, the 3G available place should be expanded in order to get more customers who stay at rural areas. Because nowadays the 3G is very important, customers tend connect to internet wherever and whenever by using the 3G service, so, the stability of 3G will be the important criteria for customers in choosing the telecommunication service. With a better 3G service and wider coverage, Maxis will have the competence to compete with the strong competitors, for example P1 wimax is a competitor of Maxis who offers cheaper packages.
7.1.3 Innovation in advertisement
Maxis Bhd should expand the advertisement in other fields rather than only focus on the advertisement in the soccer games, because not all the people are interested in football game. The company should make its advertisement in a popular style in order to adapt to majority customers' taste. For example, badminton is another popular game in the Malaysia, and Maxis could apply the star effect advertisement strategy to advertise its products and services. Dato' Lee Chong Wei, who is a popular badminton player in Malaysia, could be considered by Maxis to make him become the spokesperson of the Maxis Berhad. Through his reputation, Maxis could obtain more subscribers. Besides that, if the popular actors and singers could be a part in the Maxis advertisement, the younger customers could be attracted to subscribe the Maxis service.
7.1.4 Involve in more social activities
Nowadays, the reputation of a company is become more and more important in conducting business. Customers are concerning about the reputation of the company and not only the quality of products and services. So, we recommend Maxis should involve more in the social activities, and make the company has a good image. For example the company could be a part in the environmental protection program, to show that the company is concerning about our earth. Besides that, to build higher reputation, Maxis berhad has to reinforce the link between the organization and public relation.
7.1.5 Improve the customer service
Customer service plays an important role in the business especially in the telecommunication industry, with good customer service, it's able to retain the existing customers and attract more potential customers to subscribe the Maxis services. We've found that, although the distribution of the Maxis outlet is very wide and available in many places, but, not all the Maxis outlet is able to provide the sufficient customer service. For example, some of the Maxis centre is only able to let customer make the payment and deal with some small case, and customers need to travel to urban areas to get further services. For example, the small Maxis firm is unable to help the customer if the customer has loss his simcard and want and get back the number, he might need to go to the Maxis centre in order to get this service. We recommend Maxis to make the Maxis centre t become one-stop service in order to facilitate the customers and make them to be more satisfied with the Maxis service.
7.1.6 Utilize pricing strategy to gain market share
We know that, Maxis Berhad is the first choice of telecommunication service of Malaysian, but, many people subscribed Digi Berhad service as well, this is because the Digi offers extremely low price services compared to Maxis. So, in order to gain more market share, Maxis Berhad has to utilize the pricing strategy. First, Maxis could make customer to feel that the price it charges is not very expensive. Effective pricing strategies are needed to be applied to deal with this matter. Maxis Berhad could use more the psychological pricing strategy to give an emotion to customers that the price charges is reasonable. For example, the monthly subscription package of the new iPhone4, Maxis Berhad offers the package with more expensive price compared to the Digi Berhad. To deal with this, Maxis could lower down the monthly subscription fee but make the payment period longer. This will be no different to the company but do make the customers have an emotion that is cheaper.
