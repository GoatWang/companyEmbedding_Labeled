It provides GSM (Voice, 2G, 3G, 4G) mobile services, fixed line broadband and voice services, DTH depending upon the areas of operation. Reliance Communications is the sixth largest telecom operator in India with 83.70 million subscribers as of March 2017.[4]

Reliance Communication IT Support is provided by Reliance Tech Services and Telecom network is maintained and operated by Ericsson, transmission towers are maintained by its subsidiary Reliance Infratel. Reliance Infocomm laid the largest Optic Fiber Cable network in the country in 2003 to 2005, approximately 135,000 km, and touched almost all top broadband cities with the help of their Franchisee's - Local Cable Operators (LCO's). On an average 1900 large LCO's were connected to the Reliance Infocomm network to provide Voice, Data and Video services known as Triple Play on IPTV platform. After the split of the Telecom business venture between Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani, the telecom business was handed over to Anil Ambani, who later christened the company as "Reliance Communications Limited".

History[edit]
Reliance Communications Ltd. was established in 2002. The same year, it launched CDMA services nationwide. In 2008, Reliance Communications launched GSM services. In the 2010 spectrum auction, Reliance Communications paid ₹ 58,642.9 million for 3G spectrum in 13 circles Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, North East and Jammu & Kashmir.[5]
On 25 May 2012, RCom announced a price reduction of 51% on its 3G services.[6] In 2011, Reliance provided up to 28 Mbit/s data rate in India with its MIMO technology.[7] On 31 January 2013, RCom announced its partnership with Lenovo to market co-branded smartphones in India.[8] The smartphones were said to use the Android operating system and have dual-core processors.[8] In 2015, it launched CDMA in REV. B technology in non 3G circles.
In April 2016, RCom informed its CDMA subscribers that it would be shutting down its CDMA operations, and that all CDMA subscribers would be migrated to GSM and LTE networks.[9] The company announced that the migration had been completed in September 2016.[10]
Acquisition of MTS India[edit]
On 14 January 2016, RCom announced that it had acquired Sistema Shyam TeleServices Limited (SSTL), doing business as MTS India, in an all stock deal, in which SSTL received a 10% stake in RCom, after paying off its existing debt. RCom would assume the liability for installments that SSTL had to pay the government from purchasing spectrum. The liability amounted ₹392 crore annually for 10 years. As a result of the deal, Reliance acquired MTS India's subscribers, as well as SSTL's spectrum in the 850 MHz band.[11]
The merger deal was approved by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in February 2016.[12] SEBI cleared the deal by March, and SSTL shareholders approved the deal on 18 March.[13] By mid-August, the deal was approved by tax authorities and the shareholders and creditors of RCom and SSTL.[14] The merger was approved by the Rajasthan High Court on 30 September 2016,[15] and the Bombay High Court on 7 October 2016.[16] The merger is expected to be completed in mid-2017. In April, RCom laid off 600 employees in preparation for its merger with MTS and Aircel.[17]

History[edit]
1960–1980[edit]
The company was co-founded by Dhirubhai Ambani and his brother Champaklal Damani in 1960s as Reliance Commercial Corporation. In 1965, the partnership ended and Dhirubhai continued the polyester business of the firm.[10] In 1966, Reliance Textiles Industries Pvt Ltd was incorporated in Maharashtra. It established a synthetic fabrics mill in the same year at Naroda in Gujarat.[11] In 1975, the company expanded its business into textiles, with "Vimal" becoming its major brand in later years. The company held its Initial public offering (IPO) in 1977.[12] The issue was over-subscribed by seven times.[13] In 1979, a textiles company Sidhpur Mills was amalgamated with the company.[14] In 1980, the company expanded its polyester yarn business by setting up a Polyester Filament Yarn Plant in Raigad, Maharashtra with financial and technical collaboration with E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., U.S.[11]
1981–2000[edit]
In 1985, the name of the company was changed from Reliance Textiles Industries Ltd. to Reliance Industries Ltd.[11] During the years 1985 to 1992, the company expanded its installed capacity for producing polyester yarn by over 145,000 tonnes per annum.[11]
The Hazira petrochemical plant was commissioned in 1991–92.[15]
In 1993, Reliance turned to the overseas capital markets for funds through a global depositary issue of Reliance Petroleum. In 1996, it became the first private sector company in India to be rated by international credit rating agencies. S&P rated Reliance "BB+, stable outlook, constrained by the sovereign ceiling". Moody's rated "Baa3, Investment grade, constrained by the sovereign ceiling".[16]
In 1995/96, the company entered the telecom industry through a joint venture with NYNEX, USA and promoted Reliance Telecom Private Limited in India.[15]
In 1998/99, RIL introduced packaged LPG in 15 kg cylinders under the brand name Reliance Gas.[15]
The years 1998–2000 saw the construction of the integrated petrochemical complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat,[15] the largest refinery in the world.
2001 onwards[edit]

The in-place volume of natural gas was in excess of 7 trillion cubic feet, equivalent to about 1.2 billion barrels of crude oil. This was the first ever discovery by an Indian private sector company.[12][18] In 2002–03, RIL purchased a majority stake in Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd. (IPCL), India's second largest petrochemicals company, from Government of India.[19] IPCL was later merged with RIL in 2008.[20][21] In the years 2005 and 2006, the company reorganized its business by demerging its investments in power generation and distribution, financial services and telecommunication services into four separate entities.[22] In 2006, Reliance entered the organised retail market in India[23] with the launch of its retail store format under the brand name of 'Reliance Fresh'.[24][25] By the end of 2008, Reliance retail had close to 600 stores across 57 cities in India.[12] In November 2009, Reliance Industries issued 1:1 bonus shares to its shareholders. In 2010, Reliance entered Broadband services market with acquisition of Infotel Broadband Services Limited, which was the only successful bidder for pan-India fourth-generation (4G) spectrum auction held by Government of India.[26][27] In the same year, Reliance and BP announced a partnership in the oil and gas business. BP took a 30 per cent stake in 23 oil and gas production sharing contracts that Reliance operates in India, including the KG-D6 block for $7.2 billion.[28] Reliance also formed a 50:50 joint venture with BP for sourcing and marketing of gas in India.[29] In 2017, RIL set up a joint venture with Russian Company Sibur for setting up a Butyl rubber plant in Jamnagar, Gujarat to be operational by 2018.

Controversies[edit]
Main article: List of Reliance scams
De-merger of RIL in 2005–2006[edit]
The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL.[74] Since its inception, the company was managed by its founder and chairman Dhirubhai Ambani. After suffering a heart attack in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of the company to his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of the company was taken up by both the brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having differences with his brother Anil over 'ownership issues'.[75] He also said that the differences "are in the private domain". The share prices of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal splitting the RIL group business into the two parts.[76] In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalized. Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received telecom, power, entertainment and financial services business of the group. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group includes Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Power.[77][78]
The division of Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in de-merger of 4 businesses from RIL.[79][80] These businesses immediately became part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies.[22]
Relationship with ONGC[edit]
In May 2014, ONGC moved to Delhi High Court accusing RIL of pilferage of 18 billion cubic meters of gas from its gas-producing block in the Krishna Godavari basin.[81] Subsequently, the two companies agreed to form an independent expert panel to probe any pilferage.[82]
