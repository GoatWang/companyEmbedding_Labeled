Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: December 06, 2006

 An investor is scrutinizing the financial statements of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (MTS). The investor notices that MTS faces several significant challenges in the short and long-term. MTS's credit ratings on its senior debt are rated at investment grade BBB high and BBB+ but are two notches from falling into the speculative grade rating. Worse, both DBRS and S&P have a negative trend rating on MTS's debt. MTS's stock price has fallen about 20 per cent from during the past five months. This case discusses the impact a pension plan can have on a firm's financial flexibility.

Bell MTS (formerly Manitoba Telecom Services) is a subsidiary of BCE Inc. that operates telecommunications services in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The company's head office is located in MTS Place on Main Street, in Downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba.
MTS is the descendant company of Manitoba Government Telephones, which went into operation in January 1908 after the government of Manitoba bought Bell Canada's Manitoba operations. The Crown corporation became Manitoba Telephone System in 1921, and eventually absorbed all private telephone operations in the province. In 1996, the Provincial government of Premier Gary Filmon decided to sell the Manitoba Telephone System to private shareholders. The decision to privatize was seen as controversial, as it marked a significant departure from the Progressive Conservatives' earlier position that MTS should remain provincially owned.[3]
On March 17, 2017, Bell re-gained control of MTS after closing its $3.9 billion acquisition of the provider. For regulatory reasons, Bell will divest approximately a third of MTS's wireless business (including subscribers and retail outlets) to Telus, and a smaller portion to the new entrant Xplornet. Under Bell ownership, Bell MTS will serve as the headquarters of Bell's telecom businesses in Western Canada.
Bell MTS is the naming rights holder of two venues in Winnipeg; Bell MTS Place and Bell MTS Iceplex.

1950s[edit]
At midnight on June 21, 1959, Winnipeg was the first urban area in North America to implement the 9-9-9 emergency telephone number.[4]
Also in the late 1950s, MTS located one of its administrative offices on Empress St. near the newly opened Polo Park Shopping Centre complex. In 2001 these employees were moved to 333 Main St., commonly known as MTS Place, where 1200 employees now work. This formed part of the Province's Downtown First strategy.
1970s[edit]
In the late 1970s, similar to policy changes implemented by AT&T in the U.S., MTS allowed its customers to purchase their own telephone equipment and with this, provided free installation of RJ11 telephone jacks.
In the Spring of 1979, MTS announced that it would be a pioneer in Telidon-based two-way electronic information services. The trial was called "Project IDA" and ran from 1980 to 1981.
1980s[edit]
MTS was a pioneer in offering videotex at the commercial level. In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to DATAPAC. Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak.
They opened MTS Phone Centre stores in shopping malls to sell residential and business phones and services, and in 1984 opened two MTS Business Centre locations (Commodity Exchange Tower lobby and Empress St. office) to provide sales of business-level equipment.
In the mid-1980s, MTS started a subsidiary known as MTX, which had invested in telecommunications in Saudi Arabia. However MTX was forced to shut down after controversy about the company back in Manitoba after MTX lost $27 million on the venture.
In the late 1980s MTS launched MTS Mobility providing cellular and paging services in Manitoba.
1990s[edit]
In 1996 in a controversial decision, the Provincial government decided to sell the Manitoba Telephone System to private shareholders. The vote to privatize MTS was held in early December 1996.
In January 1999 MTS partnered with Bell Canada to form Intrigna, a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) which was created to expand telecommunications options for the business market in Alberta and British Columbia. As part of the deal, Bell Canada gained 20% ownership of MTS. They set up a jointly operated office in Calgary. By the summer of 1999, fibre optic cable had been laid in Edmonton and Calgary, and later extended to Vancouver.[5]
In August 1999 MTS completed work on a new trunked (digital) radio system known as FleetNet 800, technology licensed from neighbouring SaskTel.[5]
In the Fall of 1999 MTS began to offer DSL high-speed Internet service in Winnipeg and Brandon, which later expanded to other areas of the province.[5]

2000s[edit]
The CRTC met with the various telecommunications providers in Canada and required of them to implement a Service Improvement Plan (SIP). This meant that MTS had to improve service to northern remote areas that even by the 21st century had poor quality phone service. Customers in northern Manitoba complained that the microwave system could not handle data communications (modem, fax) well. This, as well as the collapse of a microwave relay tower linking Churchill in early January 2000, lead MTS to initiate upgrades to the Radisson-Churchill corridor with fibre optics and the Lynn Lake-Thompson corridor with a digital microwave system to replace the outdated equipment.[6] Cellular telephone service is currently available to 98% of population in the province.
In 2002, Intrigna changed its name to Bell Intrigna. Calgary-based telecommunications supplier Intrigna and Bell Nexxia announced strategic changes to enhance their market presence in western Canada and better serve customers in the west. The changes include closer coordination of their activities to serve all segments of the western Canadian business telecommunications market, and the renaming of Intrigna to Bell Intrigna.[citation needed]
In 2003, MTS purchased the naming rights for the True North Centre in downtown Winnipeg, renaming it the MTS Centre. The 10-year deal between True North Sports & Entertainment and MTS, which was MTS's single largest advertising expenditure, was extended when the arena became a National Hockey League venue in 2011. [7] MTS also owns the naming rights to the MTS Iceplex, another ice hockey complex owned by True North.
In February 2004, MTS made a $230 million pre-tax profit on the sale of its stake in Bell West Inc., the Calgary-based provider of business services. MTS sold its 40% of Bell West to Bell Canada, a subsidiary of BCE Inc., which held 22% of MTS.[citation needed]

In April 2004, MTS acquired Allstream,[8] the successor to the transcontinental railways' telegraph businesses. It renamed the main subsidiary to MTS Allstream Inc. until 2012, when it was split as MTS Inc. and Allstream Inc.
In July 2004, Bell Canada and MTS settled and unwound ownership agreements to conclude ownership in Manitoba Telecom Services Inc.[citation needed]
On December 7, 2005, former BCE executive Pierre Blouin was named Chief Executive Officer of Manitoba Telecom Services and of MTS Allstream, replacing longtime CEO Bill Fraser.[citation needed]

On March 31, 2011 MTS officially launched a HSPA+ wireless network along with the availability Apple's iPhone series of smartphones starting with the iPhone 4. The wireless network had claims it would provide data speeds up to 21Mbit/s.[9] In September 2012, MTS launched LTE, with it initially rolling out in the cities of Winnipeg and Brandon.
MTS' older CDMA network continues to work with CDMA handsets. According to the MTS website, MTS plans on shutting down its CDMA service by the end of 2016.[10]
In May 2013, Allstream was to be sold to Accelero Capital, with the deal expected to close by the end of the year.[11] However, on October 7, 2013, the Canadian government blocked the sale over national security concerns, declining to mention the specific concerns.[12]
In November 2014, Jay A. Forbes was appointed as CEO effective January 1, 2015.[13][14][15]
On November 23, 2015 it was announced that Allstream Inc would be sold to Zayo Group in a cash transaction deal worth $465 million.[16]
Acquisition by Bell[edit]
On May 2, 2016, BCE Inc. announced that it would acquire MTS in a $3.9 billion all-stock deal, paying $40 per-share and assuming $800 million in debt. Following the closure of this purchase pending regulatory approval, the company will operate as Bell MTS, a subsidiary of Bell Canada; the acquisition was expected to be closed in late-2016 to early 2017. Bell committed to investing $1 billion over five years into expanding broadband service in Manitoba, and upgrading MTS's infrastructure to support new services, including Bell Fibe and LTE-Advanced. Bell will also base its Western Canadian operations out of Bell MTS in Winnipeg, increasing its staff to 6,900 employees. As a condition of the sale, Bell agreed to divest one-third of MTS Mobility's wireless subscribers and MTS retail locations to Telus; the divestment aimed to give the three national carriers (Bell, Rogers, and Telus) a roughly equal market share in Manitoba.[17][18][19][16]
The deal has faced criticism for the possibility that it will result in a higher cost of services. Due to the market positioning of MTS as a fourth major wireless carrier in the region, the three major national carriers have historically offered lower prices in Manitoba to remain competitive. As such, with the removal of a competitor, there would no longer be an incentive to do so.[17][16][18] A similar business climate exists in Saskatchewan, where the three national carriers must compete against the dominant, government-owned regional carrier SaskTel. MTS CEO Jay Forbes disagreed with the concerns, stating that "one could easily argue that the presence of three nearly equal size competitors may actually have a more interesting business dynamic than the presence of two larger and two very small players in the marketplace."[17] A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 61% of those surveyed moderately or strongly disapproved of the deal.[20] Bell has stated that it intended to maintain MTS's existing pricing structure for at least a year after the closure of the acquisition.[21]
On December 20, 2016, the CRTC approved the sale of MTS's broadcast distribution undertakings to Bell.[22] On February 15, 2017, the deal was approved by the Competition Bureau and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. To relieve concerns over the reduction of wireless competition in Manitoba post-merger, Bell additionally agreed to divest 24,700 customers, 6 retail locations, and wireless spectrum to rural internet provider Xplornet so it may launch its own competing wireless business. Bell will provide Xplornet with "expedited access" to its towers for five years, as well as roaming and handset stock. This aspect of the deal will maintain the presence of four competing wireless providers in Manitoba, with the fourth being a new entrant to the market.[23][21]
The acquisition closed on March 17, 2017; at this time, Dan McKeen (who led the integration of Bell Aliant into the company's national operations) was installed as the new head of the division, replacing the outgoing Jay Forbes. Along with the closure of the deal, Bell launched LTE service in Churchill, Manitoba.[24]
Facilities[edit]
The administration offices are located at 333 Main St., in the former Bank of Montreal Building. The complex is now known as MTS Place.
The MTS Long Distance Gateway is located in the J. F. Mills Building on Corydon Avenue near what is locally known as Confusion Corner. One of its functions is to transmit local television signals from Winnipeg to retransmitters throughout the province.
Services[edit]
MTS TV[edit]
Bell MTS operates an IPTV service, MTS Ultimate TV, which is available in Brandon, Carberry, Dauphin, Killarney, Minnedosa, Neepawa, Oakbank, Portage la Prairie, Selkirk, Steinbach, The Pas, Thompson, and Winnipeg. MTS Classic TV was the company's legacy digital television service; it was discontinued in 2015 due to its incompatibility with the mandatory National Public Alert System.[25][26]
Bell MTS offers cable television service in Carman, Holland, Manitou, Miami, Morris, Notre Dame de Lourdes, Plum Coulee, St. Claude, St. Jean Baptiste, and Treherne. Digital cable is available in Altona, Morden, and Winkler.[27]

BCE Inc. continues to report impressive numbers at its wireless division even as it attracts fewer new Internet and television customers in the face of competition from its cable rivals.Canada’s largest communications company said Thursday it added 88,611 new contract wireless customers in the second quarter, outpacing analyst estimates in the range of 70,000. BCE also posted a better than expected reduction in subscriber turnover and a surge in the average revenue each customer brings in.

Profit at the company declined by 2.3 per cent in the period to $762-million, which BCE attributed to higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to its acquisition of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of 88 cents per share, edging out average analyst estimates of 87 cents.Read more: BCE reports wireless strength as IPTV, Internet subscribers slowRevenue increased 6.7 per cent to $5.7-billion in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA grew 5 per cent to $2.38-billion (EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Both were boosted in part by the acquisition of MTS.Momentum in the company’s results was largely driven by its wireless division, where revenue grew 12.9 per cent to $1.96-billion as it attracted – and kept – more customers, who spent more on higher-value service plans with bigger mobile data caps. CEO George Cope said the company saw a 26-per-cent year-over-year increase in high-speed Internet usage on its wireless network.Average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 4.6 per cent to $67.28 and BCE’s rate of contract customer turnover – known as churn – declined to 1.08 per cent, its lowest quarterly churn rate in 11 years.On the residential side, the company added just 1,407 new Internet customers and 16,427 IPTV (Internet protocol television) subscribers, both down from the same period last year. It said it faced “highly aggressive” offers from cable companies – its primary residential competitors are Rogers Communications Inc. and Quebecor Inc.’s Videotron – and also saw an increase in students disconnecting service at the end of the school year.BCE’s wireline division – which includes residential and enterprise services and is the company’s largest business line – reported revenue growth of 4.8 per cent to $3.12-billion.“Wireless saves the day again,” wrote Desjardins Securities analyst Maher Yaghi in a note to clients Thursday morning, adding the wireless numbers were a “positive surprise in terms of both subscribers and ARPU.”Mr. Yaghi said BCE’s net additions and margins at its wireline business didn’t get a lift despite what he characterized as reduced promotional activity from Rogers.BCE is in the midst of an expensive investment in building fibre-optic service directly to customers’ homes in the Greater Toronto Area as well as Montreal. Mr. Yaghi said the company’s wireline results should improve next year as the GTA build nears completion.Revenue at Bell Media was up 2.2 per cent to $796-million which it attributed to growth at its outdoor advertising business even as ad revenue from television and radio was softer.
