	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 




	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the
	meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In addition, we, or our
	executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors
	or others. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations,
	future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking
	statements. The words "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "predict," "believe,"
	"think," "plan," "will," "should," "intend," "seek," "potential"
	and similar expressions and variations are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
	contain these identifying words.


	 


	Forward-looking statements in this report are subject to a number of known and unknown
	risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those described
	in the forward-looking statements, in this report as well as in the other documents we file with the SEC from time to time, and
	such risks and uncertainties are specifically incorporated herein by reference.


	 


	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Except
	as required under the federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the SEC, we undertake no obligation to update or revise
	forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking
	information. We caution you not to unduly rely on the forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in
	this report.



	 












	 











	 PART I—FINANCIAL INFORMATION




	 






	ITEM 1.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	The financial statements of SigmaBroadband Co. ("SigmaBroadband Co." or the
	"Company") as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to
	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, certain information and note
	disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
	have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are
	adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all
	adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods.
	The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.

	Note 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 



	Organization



	 


	SigmaBroadband Co. ("Sigma" or the "Company") was incorporated in
	Georgia in October 2012.  The Company has been in the development stage since inception and has not generated any revenue
	to date.  The Company is a full service, facilities-based broadband service provider, local exchange and inter-exchange
	carrier serving residential and commercial customers with a special focus on rural areas.


	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information.  Certain information and footnote disclosures
	normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have
	been condensed or omitted pursuant to such principles and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q.  All
	adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, have been made which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for
	a fair presentation of the results of interim periods.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily
	indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year because of, among other things, seasonality factors in the retail
	business.  The unaudited financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
	statements and notes thereto  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
	services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability
	is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company:


	 


	Revenue will be recognized at the time the product is delivered or services are performed.  Provision
	for sales returns will be estimated based on the Company's historical return experience.  Revenue will be presented
	net of returns.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
	in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Segment Information


	 




	The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
	280, "Segment Reporting".  The Company currently operates in a single segment and will evaluate additional
	segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.


	 



	Net Loss Per Common Share



	 


	Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted average common
	shares outstanding during each reporting period.  Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted average
	common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock, warrants,
	stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock.  There were no common
	stock equivalents at June 30, 2015.

	Note 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences
	between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at
	each year end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
	to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is recognized when, based on the weight of all available evidence,
	it is considered more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Income
	tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.


	 


	ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely
	than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical
	merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant
	information.  A tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest
	amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.


	 



	Stock-Based
	Compensation



	 


	The Company accounts
	for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.  ASC 718 requires
	all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing
	model.  ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from initial estimates.


	 


	Equity instruments
	granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity.  The final measurement date for the fair
	value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument
	is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.


	 











	Cash and
	Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers
	all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 







	Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments



	 


	Pursuant to ASC
	No. 820. "Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures," the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial
	instruments included on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2015. The Company's financial instruments consist of cash. The Company
	considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term
	nature of these financial instruments.

	Note 2. LOAN PAYABLE - STOCKHOLDERS


	 


	At June 30, 2015 a stockholder and officer of the Company was owed $17,538 by the Company
	for funds he had advanced to pay for certain expenses.  The loan bears no interest and is payable on demand.

	Note 3. NOTE PAYABLE


	 


	In December 2013, the Company signed an agreement to purchase certain telecommunications
	equipment for $10 million.  The agreement called for the Company to sign an installment agreement for $1,000,0000.  The
	installment agreement, as amended in January 2015, calls for this balance to be amortized over a six year term with interest accruing
	at 8% per annum.  Additionally, under the terms of this modification, payments will begin 48 months after the signing
	of the original agreement (December 2013) at which time all interest accrued until that time will be due and payable.  Interest
	only payments will begin in month 49 and will continue through month 72 at which time a balloon payment of the principal and any
	unpaid interest will be due.


	 


	The Company has the option to pay the remaining $9,000,000 balance in the Company's
	common stock at par value 12 months after the signing of the agreement or to pay it in equal monthly installments over a 60 month
	term with interest at 12% per annum.


	 


	Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $40,000.


	 


	Note 4. STOCKHOLDERS'
	EQUITY


	 


	The Company has authorized 490,000,000
	shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.  At June 30, 2015, 24,576,000 shares of common stock were
	issued and outstanding.


	 


	The Company has
	authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with no par value.  No shares were issued or outstanding at June 30,
	2015.


	 


	Note 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


	 


	The Company currently leases its offices on a month to month basis from the Company's
	President and stockholder for $500 per month.


	 


	Rent expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, totaled $3,000 and $3,000,
	respectively, and was capitalized as additional paid-in capital.

	Note 6. INCOME TAXES (continued)


	 


	As of June 30, 2015, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately
	$2,321,000.  This loss will be available to offset future taxable income.  If not used, this carryforward
	will begin to expire in 2033. The deferred tax asset relating to the operating loss carryforward has been fully reserved at June
	30, 2015.


	 


	Note 7. BASIS OF REPORTING


	 


	The Company's financial statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates
	the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.


	 


	The Company has experienced a loss from operations during its development stage as a
	result of its investment necessary to achieve its operating plan, which is long-range in nature.  For the period from
	October 19, 2013 (inception) to June 30, 2015, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $2,321,000.  In addition,
	the Company has no significant assets or revenue generating operations.


	 


	The Company currently does not have sufficient cash to sustain itself for the next 12
	months, and will require additional funding in order to execute its plan of operations and to continue as a going concern.  To
	meet its cash needs, management expects to raise capital through a private placement offering.  In the event that this
	funding does not materialize, certain stockholders have agreed, orally, to loan, on a non-interest bearing demand basis, sufficient
	funds to maintain the Company's operations for the next 12 months.


	 


	The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
	effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
	the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with (i) our financial statements
	for the nine months ended June, 2015 and 2014 together with the notes to these financial statements; and (ii) the section entitled
	“Business” that appears elsewhere in this report.  The following discussion contains forward-looking statements
	that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward
	looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed
	below and elsewhere in this report. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only
	as of the date of this report.  Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance
	with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.


	 


	THIS FILING CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "ANTICIPATED,"
	"BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "PLAN," "INTEND," "SEEK," "ESTIMATE," "PROJECT,"
	"WILL," "COULD," "MAY," AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.
	THESE STATEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, INFORMATION REGARDING FUTURE OPERATIONS, FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND FUTURE NET CASH
	FLOW. SUCH STATEMENTS REFLECT THE COMPANY'S CURRENT VIEWS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND INVOLVE
	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN FOREIGN, POLITICAL,
	SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE FURTHER
	MARKET PENETRATION AND ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS, AND VARIOUS OTHER MATTERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. SHOULD
	ONE OR MORE OF THESE RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES OCCUR, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY
	VARY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, OR OTHERWISE INDICATED. CONSEQUENTLY, ALL OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS FILING ARE QUALIFIED BY THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE ACTUAL RESULTS
	OR DEVELOPMENTS.


	 


	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with "Selected
	Financial Data" and our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this registration statement.
	Portions of this document that are not statements of historical or current fact are forward-looking statements that involve risk
	and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in
	this registration statement should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this
	registration statement. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors
	that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include those discussed in "Risk Factors,"

	General Overview



	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. is a registered Georgia company. The Company has several million
	dollars in technology assets and is to be engaged in the business of providing voice, data, and digital video as a triple play
	bundled service to rural markets in the United States of America. We plan to offer our customers traditional cable video programming,
	Internet services, telephone services and IPtv, as well as advanced video services such as on demand,


	high definition
	(“HD”) television and digital video recorder (“DVR”) service. We plan to provide national and international
	long distance service. Our business plan include goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our goals, we will actively
	invest in our network and operations in order to improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer.

	SIGMABROADBAND CO. has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership,
	and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, has not made any significant purchase
	or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is not a blank
	check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific
	business plan, purpose and substantial assets.


	 


	Since our inception, we have been engaged in business planning activities, including
	researching the industry, identifying target markets for our services and developing our SIGMABROADBAND CO. models and financial
	forecasts, performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for establishing our
	offices and identifying future sources of capital.


	 


	Currently, SIGMABROADBAND CO. has officers and directors who have assumed responsibility
	for all planning, development and operational duties, and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages of the Company.
	Other than the Officers/Directors and other management team, there are no employees at the present time. We do anticipate hiring
	regular employees when the need arises.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. currently has no intention to engage in a merger or acquisition with
	any unidentified company. However, we may pursue strategic acquisitions that complement our current business model within the
	technology industry which may allow us to expand our activities, capabilities, advance our production and revenue.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO.’s fiscal year end is December 31.


	 



	Industry Background



	 


	Approximately 100 million Americans do not have broadband at home today and most of
	them are living in rural communities across America. We intend to be a leading provider of cost-effective and reliable technology
	services for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create value to our shareholders.




	 


	We intend to deliver innovative communications,
	information and entertainment. Our voice, data and video products and services offer over intelligent wireless, wireline, cable,
	fiber, broadband and global IP networks that meet customers' growing demand for speed, mobility, security and control. As a committed
	corporate citizen, we use our advanced communications services to address important issues confronting our society today, especially
	in rural America. We plan to follow a strategy of being first to our regional markets with technology and services first introduced
	in metropolitan areas by national service providers.


	 


	We intend to be a full service, facilities-based cable operator, local exchange and
	inter-exchange carrier serving both residential and commercial customers by providing voice, data and digital video services.
	We intend to employ the newest technology available in the marketplace today, which provides quality of service (QoS), reliability,
	security, redundancy and continuity of service always. In the future, we will be recognized as a leader in the data network, IP
	telephony and cloud-based services. Our potential customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities to families
	living in rural communities. We intend to establish a dominant national presence in the triple-play broadband, cable and telecom
	industry in America.


	 



	Plan of Operation



	 


	We are a development stage company, incorporated
	on October 19, 2012 and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. However,
	we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services.


	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe
	there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our auditors’ opinion
	is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the fact that we have
	not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash
	at this time is investments by others in our Company.

	12



	 









	 








	Our Officers and Directors are responsible for our managerial and organizational structure
	which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls
	are implemented, they will be responsible for the administration of the controls. Should they not have sufficient experience,
	they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the
	Securities and Exchange Commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.


	 


	Since incorporation, the Company has financed its operations originally through private
	capital and then, loans from stockholders and executives of the Company. As of June 30, 2015 we had

	$1,783

	cash on hand.  We
	had total expenses of

	$565,453

	which were related to general and administrative costs (See “Financial Statements”).


	 


	To date, the Company has not fully implemented its planned principal operations or strategic
	business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate enough to insure continued
	operations.  


	 


	Our intended plan of operations is to offer voice, data, and video services and implement
	the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND CO. does not produce sufficient cash
	flow to support its operations over the next 12 months, the Company will need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock
	in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to attain such financing.
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be obtained or, if obtained, that it will
	be on reasonable terms. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for operations to continue and any investment
	made by an investor would be lost in its entirety.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek
	to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary capital for its business.  


	 


	Our management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve (12) months as needed. Currently,
	the Company believes the services provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this time.


	 


	The Company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors.  Additionally
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next twelve months.


	 


	The Company has no plans to seek a business combination with another entity in the foreseeable
	future.


	 



	Impact of Inflation



	 


	We believe that the rate of inflation has
	had negligible effect on us.  We believe we can absorb most, if not all, increased non-controlled operating costs by
	operating our Company in the most efficient manner possible.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	We have generated no significant revenues since inception; we have incurred operational
	expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 in the amounts of

	$565,453

	and

	$573,416

	respectively. These
	expenses were attributed to continuing startup costs including general and administrative expenses.


	 



	General Trends and Outlook



	 


	We believe that our immediate outlook is extremely favorable, as we believe the competition
	is very limited in our market niche for broadband voice, data and video in the rural markets and only a limited number of companies
	competing with us in the marketplace. However, there is no assurance that such national competitor will not arrive in the future.
	We do not anticipate any major changes in the triple-play telecommunications industry. We believe that 2015 and beyond will be
	a significant growth year(s) for us. As we gain strength and stability in the regional rural markets we intend to expand our influence
	in markets throughout the U.S.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	The financial statements have been prepared
	assuming the company will continue as a going concern as per its business plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the company
	has a net loss

	$565,453

	. The company has financed its activities from private funding and proceeds from the issuance of
	its common stock.


	 


	The company intends to finance its future
	business and development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities until such time that
	funds generated from operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.



	 





	ITEM 3:    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK



	 


	Market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument, derivative
	or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Changes in these factors
	could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we are not exposed to
	interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.



	 





	ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 


	Based upon the required evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our President
	and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June 30, 2015 our disclosure controls and procedures
	were adequate and effective to ensure that information was gathered, analyzed and disclosed on a timely basis. There has been
	no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
	Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
	affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures



	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
	of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at June 30, 2015, such disclosure controls and
	procedures were not effective, based on our delinquent filings. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures
	that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act
	is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
	and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure.


	 



	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 



	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
	control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
	by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s
	board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
	in the United States of America and included those policy and procedures that:


	 




	•




	Pertain to the
	maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transaction
	and dispositions of the assets of the company.

	•




	Provide reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of finical
	statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
	in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and






	•




	Provide reasonable
	assurance regarding prevention for timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
	or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
	financial statements




	 


	A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable,
	not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions, regardless of how remote,
	and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
	of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
	prevented or detected. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
	reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.


	 


	As of June 30, 2015 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over
	financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated
	Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance
	on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such
	internal controls and procedures were effective to detect the appropriate application of US GAAP rules.


	 


	Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,
	no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected.
	Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, management concluded that our disclosure controls
	and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system
	were met.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	No change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting occurred during
	the quarter ended June 30, 2015, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
	control over financial reporting.

	The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings and is not aware of any pending
	or threatened claims.


	 


	The Company expects and may be subject to
	legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to, claims of
	alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by the Company and its licensees.
	Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.



	 





	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	There have been no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended June 30,
	2015.


	 


	During the six month period ended June 30,
	2015, there was no modification of any instruments defining the rights of holders of the Company's common stock and no limitation
	or qualification of the rights evidenced by the Company's common stock as a result of the issuance of any other class of securities
	or the modification thereof.

	Simultaneously with the filing of this form 10-Q, the Company is
	filing a form 8-K regarding the dismissal of David A. Aronson, CPA, P.A. (“Aronson”) as the Company’s independent
	registered public accounting firm. Consequently, the unaudited financials included in this 10-Q were not reviewed by an independent
	public accountant in accordance with 17 C.F.R. §210.8-03. The Company is in the process of retaining a new independent registered
	public accounting firm, and will file an amended 10-Q when the unaudited financials are reviewed by the new firm.


	 


	The Company does not have any other material information to report with respect to the
	six month period ended June 30, 2015.

	The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing

	EXPLANATORY NOTE




	 



	The sole purpose of this amendment to our
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission on July 15, 2016, is due to the Company mistakenly filing this form 10-Q prior to the completion of the review of our
	unaudited interim financial information by our registered independent accountants.  As a result, our previous filing was
	considered deficient and not in compliance with rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  We are filing this amendment
	to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a result of the final completion of the review of our interim financial information by
	our outside independent accounting firm.  No other changes have been made to the original filed information within this 10-Q. 


	 


	This Amendment is presented as of the filing
	date of the Original Filing. Other than as set forth above, this Amendment does not modify or update disclosures in the Original
	Filing and does not reflect events that may have occurred after that date.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS




	 







	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
	Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve substantial risks
	and uncertainties. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements
	in reports and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or in connection with oral statements
	made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including statements
	regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives
	of management are forward-looking statements. The words "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "predict,"
	"believe," "think," "plan," "will," "should," "intend," "seek,"
	"potential" and similar expressions and variations are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not
	all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.


	 


	Forward-looking statements in this report
	are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements
	to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, in this report as well as in the other documents
	we file with the SEC from time to time, and such risks and uncertainties are specifically incorporated herein by reference.


	 


	Forward-looking statements speak only as of
	the date the statements are made. Except as required under the federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the SEC, we
	undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes
	in other factors affecting forward-looking information. We caution you not to unduly rely on the forward-looking statements when
	evaluating the information presented in this report.

	The financial statements of SigmaBroadband
	Co. ("SigmaBroadband Co." or the "Company") as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 included herein have been prepared
	by the Company, without audit, pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the
	SEC. In addition, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although
	the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These financial statements
	reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
	fairly the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative
	of the results for the full year.

	Note 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 





	Organization





	SigmaBroadband Co.
	("Sigma" or the "Company") was incorporated in Georgia in October 2012.  The Company has been in
	the development stage since inception and has not generated any revenue to date.  The Company will be a full service,
	facilities-based broadband service provider, local exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving residential and commercial customers
	with a special focus on rural areas.


	 













	Basis of
	Presentation



	The accompanying
	unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim
	financial information.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
	prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such principles
	and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q.  All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
	adjustments, have been made which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim
	periods.  The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
	be expected for a full year because of, among other things, seasonality factors in the retail business.  The unaudited
	financial statements contained herein should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto  for
	the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.































	Long-Lived
	Assets



	The Company reviews
	its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
	may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the
	use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.  Based on this analysis an impairment
	loss of $8,000,000 was recognized at December 31, 2015.


	 















	Revenue
	Recognition



	In general, the Company
	will record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred,
	the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect
	specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company:


	 












	Revenue will be recognized
	at the time the product is delivered or services are performed.  Provision for sales returns will be estimated based
	on the Company's historical return experience.  Revenue will be presented net of returns.


	 









	Use of
	Estimates



	The preparation of
	financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates.


	 











	Segment
	Information



	The Company follows
	Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting".  The Company currently operates
	in a single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.


	 









	Net Loss
	Per Common Share



	Basic net (loss)
	income per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period.  Diluted
	net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur if common
	stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock, warrants, stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were exercised
	or converted into common stock.  There were no common stock equivalents at March 31, 2015 or 2016.

	Income
	Taxes



	Deferred income taxes
	are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
	for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory
	tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance
	is recognized when, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that all, or some portion,
	of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change
	in deferred tax assets and liabilities.


	 
















	ASC 740, Income Taxes,
	requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not (which is defined as a likelihood of more than fifty
	percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities
	will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information.  A tax position that meets this more
	likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent
	likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.


	 















	Stock-Based
	Compensation



	The Company accounts
	for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.  ASC 718 requires
	all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value using an option pricing
	model.  ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual
	forfeitures differ from initial estimates.














	Equity instruments
	granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity.  The final measurement date for the fair
	value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument
	is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.


	 











	Cash and
	Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers
	all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 







	Fair Value



	Pursuant to ASC
	No. 820. "Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures," the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial
	instruments included on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts
	payable and accrued expenses, loans payable - stockholders, and note payable . The Company considers the carrying value of such
	amounts in the financial statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.


	 

















	Reclassifications



	Certain prior year
	amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.


	 







	Recent
	Pronouncements



	In May 2014, FASB
	and IASB issued a new joint revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all GAAP guidance on revenue recognition.  The
	core principle of the standard is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an
	amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  The
	new standard is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017, and the effects of the standard on the
	Company’s financial statements are not known at this time.

	In March 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-03.  The amendments in this Update make the guidance in Updates 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014-07, and
	2014-18 effective immediately by removing their effective dates. The amendments also include transition provisions that provide
	that private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the first time they elect the accounting alternatives within
	the scope of this Update.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU.


	 
















	In March 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
	award transactions.  The guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within that year.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU.


	 












	In April 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customer, the principle of which is that a company should recognize revenue
	to record the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company
	expects to be entitled for the transfer of those goods or services by applying the following steps:


	 












	1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.


	2. Identify the performance obligations
	in the contract(s).


	3. Determine the transaction price.


	4. Allocate the transaction price to the
	performance obligations in the contract.




	5. Recognize revenue when, or as, the
	company satisfies a performance obligation


	 






	The guidance will
	be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year.  The
	Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU.

	Note 4.  NOTE PAYABLE


	In December 2013,
	the Company signed an agreement to purchase certain telecommunications equipment for $10 million.  The agreement called
	for the Company to sign an installment agreement for $1,000,0000.  The installment agreement, as amended in November
	2015, calls for this balance to be amortized over a six year term with interest accruing at 8% per annum.  Additionally,
	under the terms of this modification, payments will begin 48 months after the signing of the original agreement (December 2013)
	at which time all interest accrued until that time will be due and payable.  Interest only payments will begin in month
	49 and will continue through month 72 at which time a balloon payment of the principal and any unpaid interest will be due.  At
	March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued interest on this note totaled $224,187 and $204,187, respectively.

	(Unaudited)


	 


	The Company currently
	has no federal or state tax examinations in progress, nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception.  All
	of the Company's tax years are subject to federal and state tax examinations.  The Company is only subject to state
	taxes in Georgia.


















	 


	Note 8.  BASIS OF REPORTING




	The Company's financial
	statements are presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business.








	 


	The Company has incurred
	losses from inception of approximately $10,366,000, which among other factors, raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability
	to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management's
	plans to raise additional capital from the sales of stock and receiving additional loans from related parties.










	 


	The financial statements
	do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
	amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

	In May 2016, the
	Company issued the 50,000 shares of common stock that were authorized in March 2016 for services provided to the Company. (Note

	General Overview



	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. is a registered Georgia
	company. The Company has certain technology assets which had been fully impaired as of December 31, 2015. The Company is to be
	engaged in the business of providing voice, data, and digital video as a triple play bundled service to rural markets in the United
	States of America. We plan to offer our customers traditional cable video programming, Internet services, telephone services and
	IPtv, as well as advanced video services such as on demand,


	high definition (“HD”) television and digital
	video recorder (“DVR”) service. We plan to provide national and international long distance service. Our business
	plan include goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our goals, we will actively invest in our network and operations
	in order to improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer.

	SIGMABROADBAND CO. has never declared bankruptcy,
	it has never been in receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated,
	has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations.
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities
	Act of 1933, since it has a specific business plan, purpose and substantial assets.


	 


	Since our inception, we have been engaged
	in business planning activities, including researching the industry, identifying target markets for our services and developing
	our SIGMABROADBAND CO. models and financial forecasts, performing due diligence regarding potential geographic locations and acquisitions
	most suitable for establishing our offices and identifying future sources of capital.


	 


	Currently, SIGMABROADBAND CO. has officers
	and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning, development and operational duties, and will continue to do so
	throughout the beginning stages of the Company. Other than the Officers/Directors and other management team, there are no employees
	at the present time. We do anticipate hiring regular employees when the need arises.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. currently has no intention
	to engage in a merger or acquisition with any unidentified company. However, we may pursue strategic acquisitions that complement
	our current business model within the technology industry which may allow us to expand our activities, capabilities, advance our
	production and revenue.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO.’s
	fiscal year end is December 31.


	 



	Industry Background



	 


	Approximately 100 million Americans do not
	have broadband at home today and most of them are living in rural communities across America. We intend to be a leading provider
	of cost-effective and reliable technology services for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve and to create
	value to our shareholders.




	 


	We intend to deliver innovative communications,
	information and entertainment. Our voice, data and video products and services offer over intelligent wireless, wireline, cable,
	fiber, broadband and global IP networks that meet customers' growing demand for speed, mobility, security and control. As a committed
	corporate citizen, we use our advanced communications services to address important issues confronting our society today, especially
	in rural America. We plan to follow a strategy of being first to our regional markets with technology and services first introduced
	in metropolitan areas by national service providers.


	 


	We intend to be a full service, facilities-based
	cable operator, local exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving both residential and commercial customers by providing voice,
	data and digital video services. We intend to employ the newest technology available in the marketplace today, which provides
	quality of service (QoS), reliability, security, redundancy and continuity of service always. In the future, we will be recognized
	as a leader in the data network, IP telephony and cloud-based services. Our potential customers are located in some of the country’s
	largest cities to families living in rural communities. We intend to establish a dominant national presence in the triple-play
	broadband, cable and telecom industry in America.

	Plan of Operation



	 


	We are a development stage company, incorporated
	on October 19, 2012 and have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. However,
	we have substantial technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we plan to provide our services.


	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion.
	This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve
	(12) months. Our auditors’ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability to establish profitable operations. The opinion
	results from the fact that we have not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations.
	Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our Company.


	 


	Our Officers and Directors are responsible
	for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the
	Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls are implemented, they will be responsible for the administration of the controls.
	Should they not have sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us
	to be subject to sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.


	 


	Since incorporation, the Company has financed
	its operations originally through private capital and then, loans from stockholders and executives of the Company. As of March
	31, 2016 we had

	$270

	cash on hand.  We had total expenses of

	$85,230

	which were related to general and
	administrative costs (See “Financial Statements”).


	 


	To date, the Company has not fully implemented
	its planned principal operations or strategic business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets
	to increase operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that it will be able to enter into sufficient business operations
	adequate enough to insure continued operations.  


	 


	Our intended plan of operations is to offer
	voice, data, and video services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. does not produce sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next 12 months, the Company will need to raise additional
	capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as a going concern. There are no formal or informal
	agreements to attain such financing. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be
	obtained or, if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely
	for operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would be lost in its entirety.


	 


	SIGMABROADBAND CO. currently does own significant
	plant or equipment that it can seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if not able to raise necessary
	capital for its business.  


	 


	Our management anticipates hiring employees
	over the next twelve (12) months as needed. Currently, the Company believes the services provided by its officers and directors
	appear sufficient at this time.


	 


	The Company has not paid for expenses on behalf
	of any directors.  Additionally SIGMABROADBAND CO. believes that this policy shall not materially change within the next
	twelve months.


	 


	The Company has no plans to seek a business
	combination with another entity in the foreseeable future.


	 



	Impact of Inflation



	 


	We believe that the rate of inflation has
	had negligible effect on us. We believe we can absorb most, if not all, increased non-controlled operating costs by operating
	our Company in the most efficient manner possible.

	Results of Operations



	 


	We have generated no significant revenues
	since inception; we have incurred operational expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 in the amounts of

	$85,230

	and

	$285,120

	respectively. These expenses were attributed to continuing startup costs including general and administrative
	expenses. The decrease in

	$250,000

	depreciation and the increase of

	$50,000

	in expenses offset the operational expenses.


	 



	General Trends and Outlook



	 


	We believe that our immediate outlook is extremely
	favorable, as we believe the competition is very limited in our market niche for broadband voice, data and video in the rural
	markets and only a limited number of companies competing with us in the marketplace. However, there is no assurance that such
	national competitor will not arrive in the future. We do not anticipate any major changes in the triple-play telecommunications
	industry. We believe that 2016 and beyond will be a significant growth year(s) for us. As we gain strength and stability in the
	regional rural markets we intend to expand our influence in markets throughout the U.S.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	The financial statements have been prepared
	assuming the company will continue as a going concern as per its business plan. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the
	company has a net loss

	$85,230

	. The company has financed its activities from private funding and proceeds from the issuance
	of its common stock. As of March 2016 and December 2015 the Company had

	$270

	and

	$275

	in cash on hand respectively.


	 




	The company intends to finance its future
	business and development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity securities until such time that
	funds generated from operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 



	There are no Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.



	 





	ITEM 3:    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
	DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK




	 







	Market risk represents the risk of changes
	in value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates
	and equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows. In the ordinary
	course of business, we are not exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.



	  





	ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 







	Based upon the required evaluation of our
	disclosure controls and procedures, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of
	March 31, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures were inadequate and not effective to ensure that information was gathered,
	analyzed and disclosed on a timely basis.


	 


	There has been no change in our internal control
	over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal
	quarter ended March 31, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
	over financial reporting.

	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures



	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation
	of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the
	effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e)
	under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
	at March 31, 2016, such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, based on our delinquent filings. Disclosure controls
	and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
	reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
	communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions,
	as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Management's Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting




	 



	The Company's management is responsible for
	establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under
	the Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal
	financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
	purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and included those policy
	and procedures that:


	 







	·




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
	the transaction and dispositions of the assets of the company.










	·




	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of finical statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
	and










	·




	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention for timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
	use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
	the financial statements





	A control system, no matter how well conceived
	or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential
	conditions, regardless of how remote, and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations
	in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
	if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.


	 


	As of March 31, 2016 management assessed the
	effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial
	reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway
	Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that,
	during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the appropriate application
	of US GAAP rules.


	 


	Our disclosure controls and procedures are
	designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Because
	of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues,
	if any, within a company have been detected. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, management
	concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives
	of our disclosure control system were met.

	1. Business Background




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	is a registered Georgia company. The Company has certain technology
	assets which had been fully impaired as of December 31, 2015. The
	Company is to be engaged in the business of providing voice, data,
	and digital video as a triple play bundled service to rural markets
	in the United States of America. We plan to offer our customers
	traditional cable video programming, Internet services, telephone
	services and IPtv, as well as advanced video services such as on
	demand, high definition (“HD”) television and digital
	video recorder (“DVR”) service. We plan to provide
	national and international long distance service. Our business plan
	include goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our
	goals, we will actively invest in our network and operations in
	order to improve the quality and value of the products and packages
	that we offer.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in receivership,
	and it has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings.
	Since becoming incorporated, has not made any significant purchase
	or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers,
	acquisitions or consolidations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is not a blank
	check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of
	Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific
	business plan, purpose and substantial assets.




	 




	Since
	our inception, we have been engaged in business planning
	activities, including researching the industry, identifying target
	markets for our services and developing our SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	models and financial forecasts, performing due diligence regarding
	potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for
	establishing our offices and identifying future sources of
	capital.




	 




	Currently,
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. has officers and directors who have assumed
	responsibility for all planning, development and operational
	duties, and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages
	of the Company. Other than the Officers/Directors and other
	management team, there are no employees at the present time. We do
	anticipate hiring regular employees when the need
	arises.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	is currently is engaged in talks with several other companies for a
	possible merger or acquisition.. Also, we may pursue other
	strategic acquisitions that complement our current business model
	within the technology industry which may allow us to expand our
	activities, capabilities, advance our production and
	revenue.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND
	CO.’s fiscal year end is December 31.

	Industry
	Background




	 




	Approximately 100
	million Americans do not have broadband at home today and most of
	them are living in rural communities across America. We intend to
	be a leading provider of cost-effective and reliable technology
	services for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we
	serve and to create value to our shareholders.




	 




	We
	intend to deliver innovative communications, information and
	entertainment. Our voice, data and video products and services
	offer over intelligent wireless, wireline, cable, fiber, broadband
	and global IP networks that meet customers' growing demand for
	speed, mobility, security and control. As a committed corporate
	citizen, we use our advanced communications services to address
	important issues confronting our society today, especially in rural
	America. We plan to follow a strategy of being first to our
	regional markets with technology and services first introduced in
	metropolitan areas by national service providers.




	 




	We
	intend to be a full service, facilities-based cable operator, local
	exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving both residential and
	commercial customers by providing voice, data and digital video
	services. We intend to employ the newest technology available in
	the marketplace today, which provides quality of service (QoS),
	reliability, security, redundancy and continuity of service always.
	In the future, we will be recognized as a leader in the data
	network, IP telephony and cloud-based services. Our potential
	customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities
	to families living in rural communities. We intend to establish a
	dominant national presence in the triple-play broadband, cable and
	telecom industry in America.




	 




	Plan
	of Operation




	 




	We are
	a development stage company, incorporated on October 19, 2012 and
	have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues
	from our business operations. However, we have substantial
	technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we
	plan to provide our services.




	 




	Our
	auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our
	auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as
	an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our
	auditors‟ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability
	to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the
	fact that we have not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must
	raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other
	source for cash at this time is investments by others in our
	Company.




	 




	Our
	Officers and Directors are responsible for our managerial and
	organizational structure which will include preparation of
	disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
	2002. When these controls are implemented, they will be responsible
	for the administration of the controls. Should they not have
	sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and
	implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to
	sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission which
	ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.




	 




	Since
	incorporation, the Company has financed its operations originally
	through private capital and then, loans from stockholders and
	executives of the Company. As of December 31, 2016 we had $167 cash
	on hand. We had totaled operating expenses of $47,615 which were
	related to general and administrative costs (See “Financial
	Statements”).




	 




	To
	date, the Company has not fully implemented its planned principal
	operations or strategic business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is
	attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase
	operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that it
	will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate
	enough to insure continued operations.




	 




	Our
	intended plan of operations is to offer voice, data, and video
	services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to
	begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND CO. does not produce
	sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next 12
	months, the Company will need to raise additional capital by
	issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as
	a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to
	attain such financing. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any
	investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be obtained or,
	if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Without
	realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for
	operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would
	be lost in its entirety.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can seek
	to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations if
	not able to raise necessary capital for its business.




	 




	Our
	management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve (12)
	months as needed. Currently, the Company believes the services
	provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this
	time.

	The
	Company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors.
	Additionally SIGMABROADBAND CO. believes that this policy shall not
	materially change within the next twelve months.




	 




	The
	Company is plans to seek a business combination with another entity
	in the foreseeable future under the right
	circumstances.

	for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we serve
	and to create value to our shareholders.

	FCC
	Broadband Report Synopsis:




	As per
	the U.S. Federal Government, Broadband is the great infrastructure
	challenge of the early 21st century. Like electricity a century
	ago, broadband is a foundation for economic growth, job creation,
	global competitiveness and a better way of life. It is enabling
	entire new industries and unlocking vast new possibilities for
	existing ones. It is changing how we educate children, deliver
	health care, manage energy, ensure public safety, engage
	government, and access, organize and disseminate
	knowledge.




	 




	But
	broadband in America is not all where it needs to be. According to
	the FCC Broadband Report Synopsis,

	a


	pproximately
	100 million


	 


	Americans
	do not have broadband at home

	. Broadband-enabled health
	information technology (IT) can improve care and lower costs by
	hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decades, yet the
	United States is behind many advanced countries in the adoption of
	such technology. Broadband can provide teachers with tools that
	allow students to learn the same course material in half the time,
	but there is a dearth of easily accessible digital educational
	content required for such opportunities. A broadband-enabled Smart
	Grid could increase energy independence and efficiency, but much of
	the data required to capture these benefits are inaccessible to
	consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. And nearly a decade after
	9/11, our first responders still lack a nationwide public safety
	mobile broadband communications network, even though such a network
	could improve emergency response and homeland
	security.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	was created to take advantage of the market demand for
	communications and entertainment bundled services priced within the
	reach of all consumers. We are deploying voice, data, digital video
	and other broadband related services to Rural America. We are
	positioned to provide services to 45,000 homes in Arizona and
	another 3,000 homes in Missouri. We plan to extend the Missouri
	network to another 15,000 homes bringing the total in our
	franchised area to 18,000. Our intended $99 per month triple-play
	service standard package of voice, data and digital video will
	provide a compelling offer that will attract many new subscribers
	and be a competitive advantage going forward. None of our known
	competitors have such an offer and if they choose to follow, they
	will erode their existing revenue base.




	 




	Market
	Pricing Strategy




	 




	Our

	key market
	pricing strategy is to bundle our services to provide a more price
	competitive package to the customers

	. The

	"all inclusive and flat
	rate"

	billing we promote, allow customers to plan for and
	budget a fixed price for all their monthly telecommunication
	services. This billing strategy sets us apart from all of our
	existing competitors. We intend to provide optimum support and
	service using state-of-the-art technology and innovative customer
	care, building long-standing partnerships with our customers,
	ensuing mutually beneficial returns.

	Services
	and Product




	 




	Our
	technology allows us to provide Broadband triple-play services to
	any market nationwide. Our core business objective is to offer a
	bundling of services to include telephone service, Internet access,
	cellular and cable television nationwide; and also providing cloud-
	based and IPtv services. The Bundled Service or T3

	(Triple Play)

	will be made available to
	the public at a prepaid fixed cost of $99 per/month with no taxes,
	no contract, no deposit and no credit needed to the low income
	families, retirees, unserved, underserved, underprivileged and
	rural communities, in order to help bridge the technology usage gap
	in these areas. The potential customer base is extensive, as it
	literally consists of businesses, residential and rural customers-
	throughout the 95% of the U.S. covered by our network
	infrastructure.




	 




	Competition




	 




	Across
	the United States, Multiple Systems Operators (MSOs) compete with
	Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) providers and incumbent telecom
	companies. We believe that we compete with other providers in three
	product categories: Video, Voice, and Data.




	 





	We are poised to compete with any competitor
	that enters our market in terms of price, quality of service and no
	term contract.

	Since our operations are in rural areas, we
	may not have to compete with any regional and national carriers,
	except for local independent operators and DBS
	providers.




	 





	Market Strategy


	:


	Rural vs. Urban Markets





	 




	In
	rural markets, cable and DBS are often the only providers of video
	services. Recently, cable companies have been losing video share to
	DBS, primarily due to the fact that DBS has a greater number of
	high-definition channels and provides better customer service. We
	are trying to make up ground by pushing bundled services to
	customers (HSD and telephony). The current trend of RBOCs providing
	FTTN or FTTP will mostly affect competitive dynamics in urban
	markets not in rural markets, as the high amount of CAPEX being
	spent can only be justified in areas with high
	density.




	 





	We will be the only major triple play service
	provider in all of our rural markets where our cable/hubs
	infrastructure will be located at present time.

	The
	competitive dynamics between RBOCs and Cable MSOs in rural areas,
	where FTTN and FTTP are not available, favors cable. We will
	continue to have a competitive advantage in high speed data, voice
	and digital video. Traditional RBOC services generally do not
	include video, which will allow us a large bundling advantage.
	Wireless substitution is most likely to continue, though the rate
	of substitution will be less in rural areas, where users are more
	likely to keep wireline phones because of cellular signal issues.

	We believe that Cable MSOs like
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. operating primarily in rural markets will face
	more favorable competitive dynamics than those in urban

	Our
	Triple Play Price Strategy and Differences




	 




	We set
	ourselves apart from the competition not only by providing a superb
	customer care and quality of service but also offers our customers
	a flat rate service at $99/month including all applicable taxes and
	without any term contract ever for the exact same services that the
	competition may provide in areas we serve.




	 




	Operating
	Strategy




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	offers a quality consumer experience, at a reasonable price for
	entertainment, communications and all broadband services. We intend
	to always value our customer’s needs and their requests,
	while balancing the requirement to meet our financial
	responsibility. Our focus will be greater than customer service; it
	will be on serving the customer and our strategic
	assets.




	 




	Our key
	to success is to bring the strength of our business development
	experiences, well trained personnel and cutting-edge technologies
	in every segment of our core businesses to increase profit margin
	and increase investors‟ satisfaction, while we deliver value
	from diversity and promote sustainability for economic and social
	development.




	 




	Regulation
	Challenges




	 




	There
	are multiple and intense regulatory battles over triple-play
	services as incumbent telephone companies and incumbent cable
	operators attempt to keep out new competitors - since both
	industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory
	capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have
	been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete
	with telephone companies for local voice service, but want to
	discourage telephone companies from competing with them for
	television service. Incumbent telephone companies want to deliver
	television service but want to block competition for voice service
	from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for
	favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor
	the public interests.

	Business
	Challenges




	 




	The
	challenges in offering triple-play are mostly associated with
	determining the right business model, backend processes, customer
	care support and economic environment rather than technology. For
	example, using the right billing platform to address a variety of
	subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber
	density to financially justify introduction of the service are a
	few factors that affect decisions to offer triple-play
	services.




	 




	In
	addition to the challenges mentioned above, there are a number of
	technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple play
	services. Broadband voice, digital video and high speed data all
	have different characteristics and place different burdens on the
	network that provides access to these services. Voice services are
	greatly affected by jitter, whereas packet loss has a greater
	effect on digital video and data services. In order to use a shared
	network resource such as cable or DSL, we may use network equipment
	that employs quality-of-service mechanisms to adjust to the
	requirements of the different services.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	creates a bridge between local exchange carrier and cable service
	provider all into one network and from one provider, which in turns
	help reduce the customer’s cost, better quality of service
	and best customer service experience.




	 




	The
	other challenge for us is to provide superior service at a price
	value point that will attract customers away from existing telecom
	and cable operators in areas where we compete. We are confident
	that we will be very competitive with our multiple channels of
	basic video, a minimum 1.5d/2.0 Mbps Internet connection together
	with an unlimited local/domestic long distance package all for $99
	per month and no other hidden cost to the customer in one network
	will attract many customers to our Company.




	 




	Our
	financial forecasts reflect a rigorous marketing approach that
	takes advantage of being the newest broadband triple-play provider
	in the market we serve. This will create a baseline for a
	significant marketing program should we reach the top of the
	interest curve.




	 




	Our
	Technology




	 




	We
	intend to operate Class 4/5 voice switching, routers, digital
	multiplexers among others and a cable network which allowing us to
	lower the cost of IP and TDM voice termination to our customers. To
	date, we have access from 23 head-end locations capable of serving
	well over 30 rural counties and communities. The current network
	without expansion spans 923 linear miles, covering more than 8,000
	square miles, utilizing 732 miles of fiber optic cable or 4 million
	feet of fiber infrastructure.




	 




	Employees




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	with the exception of its officers and directors has no other
	employees, however, works with several outside consultants who have
	substantial industry experience and who have dedicated time and
	effort on behalf of the Company.




	 




	The
	Company may be required to hire an attorney on a consultancy basis
	to navigate permit and licensing requirements, but otherwise
	SIGMABROADBAND CO.‟s Officers and Directors intend to do
	whatever work is necessary to bring the Company to the point of
	earning revenues from the sale of our services or further
	acquisitions. All operational functions such as customer service
	representatives, telemarketing, warehousing and fulfillment are
	planned to be outsourced. Human resource planning will be part of
	an ongoing process that will include constant evaluation of
	operations and revenue realization.

	The
	following discussion should be read in conjunction with (i) our
	financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016
	together with the notes to these financial statements; and (ii) the
	section entitled “Business” that appears elsewhere in
	this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking
	statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our
	actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the
	forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
	to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
	discussed below and elsewhere in this report. You should not place
	undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply
	only as of the date of this report. Our financial statements are
	stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with
	United States Generally Accepted Accounting
	Principles.




	 




	The
	statements in this report include forward-looking statements. These
	forward-looking statements are based on our management’s
	current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and
	uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
	from expectations. You should not rely upon these forward-looking
	statements as predictions of future events because we cannot assure
	you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements
	will be achieved or will occur. You can identify a forward-looking
	statement by the use of the forward-terminology, including words
	such as “may”, “will”,
	“believes”, “anticipates”,
	“estimates”, “expects”,
	“continues”, “should”, “seeks”,
	“intends”, “plans”, and/or words of similar
	import, or the negative of these words and phrases or other
	variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology.
	These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: our
	sales, results of operations and anticipated cash flows; capital
	expenditures; depreciation and amortization expenses; sales,
	general and administrative expenses; our ability to maintain and
	develop relationship with our existing and potential future
	customers; and, our ability to maintain a level of investment that
	is required to remain competitive. Many factors could cause our
	actual results to differ materially from those projected in these
	forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to:
	variability of our revenues and financial performance; risks
	associated with technological changes; the acceptance of our
	products in the marketplace by existing and potential customers;
	disruption of operations or increases in expenses due to our
	involvement with litigation or caused by civil or political unrest
	or other catastrophic events; general economic conditions,
	government mandates and conditions in the advertising industry in
	particular; and, the continued employment of our key personnel and
	other risks associated with competition.




	 




	For a
	discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ
	materially from the forward-looking statements see the
	“Liquidity and Capital Resources” section under
	“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations” in this item of this
	report and the other risks and uncertainties that are set forth
	elsewhere in this report or detailed in our other Securities and
	Exchange Commission reports and filings. We believe it is important
	to communicate our expectations. However, our management disclaims
	any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as
	a result of new information, future events or
	otherwise.




	 




	General
	Overview




	 




	We are
	a development stage company, incorporated on October 19, 2012 and
	have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues
	from our business operations.




	 




	We
	intend to engage in the business of providing voice, data, and
	digital video services as a triple play bundled service to rural
	markets in the United States of America.




	 




	Since
	our inception, we have been engaged in business planning
	activities, including researching the industry, identifying target
	markets for our services and developing our SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	models and financial forecasts, performing due diligence regarding
	potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for
	establishing our offices and identifying future sources of
	capital.




	 




	Currently,
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. has officers and directors who have assumed
	responsibility for all planning, development and operational
	duties, and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages
	of the Company. Other than the Officers/Directors, there are no
	employees at the present time. We do anticipate hiring employees
	when the need arises.




	 




	Our
	auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our
	auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as
	an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our
	auditors‟ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability
	to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the
	fact that we have not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must
	raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other
	source for cash at this time is investments by others in our
	Company.




	 






	 




	9










	 






	 






	Results
	of Operations




	 




	Our
	Officers and Directors are responsible for our managerial and
	organizational structure which will include preparation of
	disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
	2002. When these controls are implemented, they will be responsible
	for the administration of the controls. Should they not have
	sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and
	implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to
	sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission which
	ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.




	 




	Since
	incorporation, the Company has financed its operations through
	private placement capital. As of December 31, 2016 we had $167 cash
	on hand. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had
	total operating expenses of $47,615 and $1,041,643, respectively
	which were related to general and administrative costs (See
	“Financial Statements”).




	 




	To
	date, the Company has not fully implemented its planned principal
	operations or strategic business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is
	attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase
	operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that it
	will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate
	enough to insure continued operations.




	 




	Our
	intended plan of operations is offer voice, data, and video
	services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to
	begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND CO. does not produce
	sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next 12
	months, the Company will need to raise additional capital by
	issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as
	a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to
	attain such financing. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any
	investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be obtained or,
	if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Without
	realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for
	operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would
	be lost in its entirety.




	 




	  SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. currently does own significant plant or equipment that it may
	seek to sell in the near future.




	 




	Our
	management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve (12)
	months as needed. Currently, the Company believes the services
	provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this
	time.




	 




	The
	Company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors.
	Additionally SIGMABROADBAND CO. believes that this policy shall not
	materially change within the next twelve months.




	 




	The
	Company has no plans to seek a business combination with another
	entity in the foreseeable future.

	We have
	not generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the
	years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Operating expenditures
	during the period covered by this report include general and
	administrative costs (See “Financial

	Cash Flows from Investing Activities

	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	 




	We have

	a majority shareholder of the company. Such capital contribution
	was utilized to pay 2016 operating expenditures.

	Material

	There
	were no material commitments at December 31, 2016.




	 




	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements




	 




	We do
	not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
	reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
	financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
	expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
	capital resources that are material to investors.




	 




	Critical
	Accounting Policies




	 




	Our
	financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in
	accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
	principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of
	financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
	accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
	the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.




	 




	We
	regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we
	use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management's
	estimates are based on historical experience, on information from
	third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that
	are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates made by
	management.




	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	We
	consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We have
	no cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we do not
	have any cash equivalents.




	 




	Use of Estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and
	disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 




	Intangible Assets




	 




	There
	were no intangible assets during the period at December 31, 2016.
	The Company’s policy is to evaluate the recoverability of
	identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in
	circumstances indicate that an intangible asset’s carrying
	amount may not be recoverable. There was no impairment loss of
	intangible assets for the period from inception through December
	31, 2016.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes as outlined in ASC 740
	“Income Taxes”, which was previously Statement of
	Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for
	Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of
	Statement 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to
	differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
	existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
	rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences
	are expected to be recovered or settled.




	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	Company considers that the carrying amount of financial
	instruments, including accounts payable, approximates fair value
	because of the short maturity of these instruments.

	Share Based Payments (included in ASC 718 “Compensation-Stock

	In
	December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
	Payment,” which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB
	Opinion No. 25. Under SFAS No. 123(R), companies are required to
	measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation
	arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the
	costs in the financial statements over the period during which
	employees or independent contractors are required to provide
	services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock
	options and warrants, restricted share plans, performance-based
	awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase
	plans. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
	107, or “SAB 107”. SAB 107 expresses views of the staff
	regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC
	rules and regulations and provides the staff's views regarding the
	valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies.
	SFAS No. 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements
	using one of two methods. On April 14, 2005, the SEC adopted a new
	rule amending the compliance dates for SFAS 123(R). Companies may
	elect to apply this statement either prospectively, or on a
	modified version of retrospective application under which financial
	statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent
	with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under
	SFAS 123.




	 




	The
	Company has fully adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and
	related interpretations as provided by SAB 107. As such,
	compensation cost is measured on the date of grant as the fair
	value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if
	any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the
	share-based payments.




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	The
	Company has adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements.
	The adoption of the accounting pronouncements, including those not
	yet effective, is not anticipated to have a material effect on the
	financial position or results of operations of the
	Company.




	 




	Going
	Concern




	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
	which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and
	discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
	foreseeable future. The Company has yet to demonstrate sustainable
	profitability and it does not currently have the funding to fully
	implement its business plan. Future losses are anticipated in the
	continued development of its business, raising substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or,
	obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
	come due.




	 




	Management intends
	to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with
	existing cash on hand, loans from directors or stockholders or
	through debt or equity financings.




	 




	The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
	possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
	assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may
	result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a
	going concern.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To the
	Board of Directors and Stockholders of SigmaBroadband
	Co.




	 




	We have
	audited the accompanying balance sheets of SigmaBroadband Co. as of
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of
	operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
	for the each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
	2016. SigmaBroadband Co.’s management is responsible for
	these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an
	opinion on these financial statements based on our
	audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
	Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
	assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
	material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor
	were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
	financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
	control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
	procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
	the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
	company’s internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
	well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
	believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
	opinion.




	 




	In our
	opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
	in all material respects, the financial position of SigmaBroadband
	Co. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its
	operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
	period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the
	Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 8 to
	the financial statements, the Company has a history of operating
	losses, has limited cash resources, and its viability is dependent
	upon its ability to meet future financing requirements. These
	factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
	to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard
	to these matters are also described in Note 8. The financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Note
	1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Organization




	SigmaBroadband Co.
	("Sigma" or the "Company") was incorporated in Georgia in October
	2012. The Company has been in the development stage since inception
	and has not generated any revenue to date. The Company is a full
	service, facilities-based broadband service provider, local
	exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving residential and
	commercial customers with a special focus on rural
	areas.




	 




	Equipment, net




	Equipment is stated
	at cost. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized while
	maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the lives of the
	respective assets, are expensed when incurred. Depreciation is
	computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
	straight line method of accounting.




	 




	The
	Company has estimated the useful life of the equipment to be 10
	years.




	 




	The
	cost and accumulated depreciation for equipment sold, retired, or
	otherwise disposed of are relieved from the accounts, and any
	resulting gains or losses are reflected in income.




	At
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, the assets have been fully impaired.

	Use of
	Estimates





	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
	notes. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 




	Segment Information




	The
	Company follows Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280,
	"Segment Reporting". The Company currently operates in a single
	segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure
	requirements as it expands its operations.




	 




	Net Loss Per Common Share




	Basic
	net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the weighted
	average common shares outstanding during each reporting period.
	Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the weighted
	average common shares for the potential dilution that could occur
	if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and preferred stock,
	warrants, stock options and restricted stock shares and units) were
	exercised or converted into common stock. There were no common
	stock equivalents at December 31, 2016.




	 




	Income Taxes




	The
	Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for
	future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets
	and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between
	the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their
	corresponding tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income
	tax assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to
	a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not
	that such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future
	income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
	rates and laws expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets
	are to be either settled or realized. The Company’s effective
	tax rate approximates the Federal statutory rates.




	 




	Stock-Based Compensation




	Stock-based
	compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC
	718,”Compensation – Stock Compensation”, when
	applicable. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718,
	companies are required to measure the compensation costs of
	share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair
	value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the
	period during which employees are required to provide services.
	Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
	restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
	appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such,
	compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair
	value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the
	respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies
	this statement prospectively.




	 






	 




	F-6










	 






	 




	Equity
	instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than
	employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the
	instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification
	No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity
	Based




	 




	Payments to
	Non-Employees defines the measurement date and recognition period
	for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when
	either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b)
	the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii)
	the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the
	instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and
	circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB
	Accounting Standards Codification.




	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and
	cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
	The amount of cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015
	were nil.




	 




	Reclassification of Prior Period Financial Statements




	Certain
	items previously reported have been reclassified to conform with
	the current year's presentation.




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	The
	Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
	accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
	of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material
	impact on our financial condition or the results of its
	operations.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-03. The amendments in this
	Update make the guidance in Updates 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014- 07, and
	2014-18 effective immediately by removing their effective dates.
	The amendments also include transition provisions that provide that
	private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the
	first time they elect the accounting alternatives within the scope
	of this Update. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
	impact of the adoption of this ASU.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation, which
	is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for
	share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be
	effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016,
	including interim periods within that year. The Company is in the
	process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this
	ASU.

	During
	2016 and 2015 a stockholder and officer of the Company advanced the
	Company $16,805 and $16,711, respectively, to pay for certain
	expenses. The loan bears no interest, is payable on demand and had
	a balance of $34,342 at December 31, 2016.

	Note
	4. NOTE PAYABLE




	 




	In
	December 2013, the Company signed an agreement to purchase certain
	telecommunications equipment for $10 million. The agreement called
	for the Company to sign an installment agreement for $1,000,0000.
	The installment agreement, as amended in November 2015, calls for
	this balance to be amortized over a six year term with interest
	accruing at 8% per annum. Additionally, under the terms of this
	modification, payments will begin 48 months after the signing of
	the original agreement (December 2013) at which time all interest
	accrued until that time will be due and payable. Interest only
	payments will begin in month 49 and will continue through month 72
	at which time a balloon payment of the principal and any unpaid
	interest will be due. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
	accrued interest on this note totaled $284,187 and $204,187,
	respectively.




	 




	The
	amendment stipulates that the remaining $9,000,000 owed by the
	Company will be paid by the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the
	Company's preferred stock within 36 months from the date of the
	amendment.

	5. STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT




	 




	The
	Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a
	par value of $0.0001 per share. At December 31, 2016, 24,724,000
	shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.




	 




	The
	Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with no
	par value. No shares were issued or outstanding at December 31,

	discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
	foreseeable future. The Company has yet to demonstrate sustainable
	profitability and it does not currently have the funding to fully
	implement its business plan. Future losses are anticipated in the
	continued development of its business, raising substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or,
	obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
	come due.




	 




	Management intends

	through debt or equity financings.




	 




	The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
	possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of

	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
	ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports
	that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
	"Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
	Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is
	accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
	allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing
	and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
	recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
	designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of
	achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a
	reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required
	to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
	of possible controls and procedures.




	 




	As
	required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under
	the supervision and with the participation of our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the end of our fourth fiscal quarter
	covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
	controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
	assurance level.




	 




	There
	has been no change in our internal controls over financial
	reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
	internal controls over financial reporting.




	 





	 


	MANAGEMENT’S
	REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
	REPORTING





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
	internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
	financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)
	promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process
	designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s
	principal executive and financial officer and effected by the
	Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel,
	to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
	external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles and includes those policies and procedures
	that:




	 











	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions




	of the
	assets of the Company;








	 











	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
	permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
	expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
	and








	 











	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
	unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial
	statements.








	 




	Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
	any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
	the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
	conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	The
	Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
	December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, the Company’s
	management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	(“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (COSO
	2013 framework). The COSO framework is based upon five integrated
	components of control: control environment, risk assessment,
	control activities, information and communications and ongoing
	monitoring.




	 




	Based
	on the assessment performed, management has concluded that the
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as of
	December 31, 2016, control environment is not currently effective
	and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its
	financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
	Further, management has not identified any material weaknesses in
	internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
	2016.

	progress, growth and profitability depend, to motivate these
	persons to achieve long-term company goals and to more closely
	align these persons' interests with those of our other shareholders
	by providing them with a proprietary interest in our growth and
	performance. Our executive officers, employees, consultants and
	non-employee directors will be eligible to participate in the plan.
	We have not determined the amount of shares of our common stock to
	be reserved for issuance under the proposed equity incentive
	plan.

	The

	opportunity becomes available, such person may face a conflict in
	selecting between our business interest and their other business
	interests. The policy of the Board is that any personal business or
	corporate opportunity incurred by an officer or director of the
	Company must be examined by the Board and turned down by the Board
	in a timely basis before an officer or director can engage or take
	advantage of a business opportunity which could result in a
	conflict of interest.




	 




	None of
	the following parties has, since the date of incorporation, had any
	material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction with the
