	First Media Tbk PT operates within the Telephone communications, exc. radio sector.
	
	In addition to historical fundamental analyses, the complete report available to purchase compares First Media Tbk PT with three other
	telecommunications providers in Asia:
		
	Welldone Company
	
		of Taiwan
		(2016
	sales of 3.36 billion Taiwanese Dollars [US$111.09  million]
		),
	
	Quadrant Televentures Limited
	
		of India
		(5.62 billion Indian Rupees [US$87.62  million]
		), and
	
	Vivocom Intl Holdings Bhd
	
		which is
		
		based in Malaysia
		(365.90 million Malaysian Ringgits [US$85.45  million]
		of which 74%
		was Construction Services).
	
	Sales Analysis. 
	
		During the year ended December of 2016, sales at
		First Media Tbk PT were 1.31 trillion Indonesian Rupiahs (US$98.12 million).
	
		This
		
			is
		
				an
			
			increase of 23.1%
		
		 versus 2015, when the company's sales were 1.06 trillion Indonesian Rupiahs.
	
		Despite this increase, sales are still
		
			well
		
		below the level achieved in 2014, when First Media Tbk PT
		reported sales of 2.03 trillion Indonesian Rupiahs.
	
		Sales of Cinema saw an increase
		
			that was more than double the company's growth rate: sales were up
		63.0% in 2016, from
		176.94 billion Indonesian Rupiahs to 288.37 billion Indonesian Rupiahs.
