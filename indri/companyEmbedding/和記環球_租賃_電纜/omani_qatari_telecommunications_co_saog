Ooredoo Offers New Levels of Convenience with Launch of Widget Feature








        Muscat, Oman
      

        Celebrating its role as Salalah Festival Gold Sponsor, Ooredoo has revealed that it will treat visitors to the annual international event with a spectacular fun-filled programme of entertainment. A cornerstone of the Ooredoo community calendar, the highly popular festival gives the data experience leaders the opportunity to connect with subscribers and tech-fans as it shares the excitement of connectivity and showcases the very latest in mobile technology.
      

        'Ooredoo is delighted to reprise its role as Gold Sponsor at the much loved Salalah Festival and to add to the exceptional atmosphere and excitement with our inspiring action-packed extravaganza of family fun,' said Raed Mohamed Dawood, Director of Government Relations and Corporate Affairs at Ooredoo.
      

        He added: 'Amongst the amusements planned for festival-goers are fun stage performances and exciting competitions along with face painting, balloons and magic shows for both youngsters and the young at heart. There will be LED walkers, stilt walkers and unicyclists roaming around too; showing off their extraordinary skills. We know that as visitors join in the fun, there will be plenty of memorable moments they want to share with family and friends. So, to make sure they stay connected and share the enjoyment of the internet, they can share photos and stream videos of the Festival at any time; we'll be providing uninterrupted hi-speed WiFi at the Ooredoo stand.'
      

        Dawood went on to explain that the Ooredoo Salalah Festival programme will also feature a special raffle draw. Exclusively for those who take advantage of the value-packed Ooredoo offers available during the Festival and purchase any product or service, the draw will have two star prizes of free of data up to 36GB for a year, along with a host of other treats for runners up, including must-have handsets and recharge cards. 'Of course, there'll be plenty of the always in demand Ooredoo souvenirs to give away too,' he added.
      

        Open to all, the Ooredoo Salalah Festival activity programme will take place over a series of weekends, beginning with a special celebration of Renaissance Day on Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 July. After this, Ooredoo invites the Salalah community as well as visitors and tourists to join them again on Thursday 3 and Friday 4 August, Friday 11 and Saturday 12 August and Thursday 17 and Friday 18 August.
      

        A proud member of Omani society, Ooredoo participates in and supports a range of community and family oriented events and activities every year. In addition to Salalah Festival, Ooredoo is a long-standing partner of Muscat Festival and the Ministry of Sports Affairs Summer of Sport Programme, all continuing expressions of its core values of caring, connecting, and challenging.

Our Company




As a company, Ooredoo embodies extensive global and local expertise with talented, caring people. While we are a state-of-the-art full service telecommunication provider, we have a deep understanding of the Omani culture and the diverse population living in the Sultanate, allowing us to provide our customers with the highest levels of user-friendly technology and customer satisfaction, while giving our people opportunities to grow and develop their abilities.
Ooredoo is looking for ambitious team players that can bring an international mindset to our local company. In turn we are providing a unique working environment, a chance to grow professionally and the opportunity to cultivate an exciting future with constant skill development.
Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company SAOG was founded and registered in the Sultanate of Oman in December 2004. After launching its service in March 2005 as the challenger mobile operator in Oman, the company began operating under the now familiar name of Ooredoo. Ooredoo was awarded the second fixed licence in Oman in 2009 and launched its international gateway in April 2010, its corporate fixed and broadband services in May 2010, and its home broadband services in June 2010. Since 2010 Ooredoo has been an integrated services telecommunications operator and is currently serving around two million customers across the Sultanate. Following a successful IPO, Ooredoo listed on the Muscat Stock Market (MSM) under the “nwrs” ticker in November 2010.  Ooredoo is majority owned by the Qtel Group and also has a number of significant Omani shareholders which ensures that the company is strongly integrated into the Omani society.
Ooredoo has won a number of awards including Innovation in HR Strategy 2011 from Asia’s Best Employer Brand Awards, Outstanding Leader from TMT Finance Middle East 2011, Best IPO in the Middle East from emeafinance magazine and Strategic Leadership Award from Global HR Excellence Awards 2011.

Ooredoo Oman, a top telecom provider in the Sultanate, opened its first franchise store in the Wilayat of Bidiyah, marking the seventh to be operated by Khimji Ramdas and the 20th overall.
The new store was opened under the auspices of Mahmood bin Abdullah Al Saeedi; Wali of Bidiya, with Ooredoo's director of Consumer Sales, Feras bin Abdullah Al Shaikh, in attendance.
Al Shaikh said: "The Wilayat of Bidiyah has grown into one of the most vibrant communities in the Governorate of North Al Sharqiyah and a major destination for tourists looking to experience the wonders of the desert."
"Given its consistent development over the past few years and position as an important tourism area for Oman, it was important that we expanded our presence here to reach more customers and deliver the exceptional experience they have come to love. With our franchise partners Khimji Ramdas, we are thrilled to extend our retail footprint and champion the continued growth of this burgeoning community for years to come," he added. - TradeArabia News Service
