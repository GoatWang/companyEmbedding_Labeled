P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.52      Net Money Flow ($)  -1.14 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

How To Profit From China’s Economic Slowdown [China Mobile Ltd. (ADR), China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (ADR)]


 March 13, 2014 2:11pm  ETF BASIC NEWS 






Moe Zulfiqar: There’s a significant amount of pessimism towards the Chinese economy these days, and the reasons behind this are very understandable. The economic data suggests the country is headed toward an economic slowdown.




In 2013, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7%—barely better than the previous year and the estimates that were calling for the lowest growth rate since 1999. (Source: Yao, K. and Wang, A., “China’s 2013 economic growth dodges 14-year low but further slowing seen,” Reuters, January 20, 2014.) Keep in mind that despite beating the estimates, this GDP growth rate is much lower than the country’s historical average.
This isn’t all. A credit crunch is also in the making. We are now hearing how companies in China will have troubles paying their interest on the bonds they have issued. So far, we have seen one default on payment by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. This solar company, based in China, defaulted on a $14.7-million interest payment on bonds it issued two years ago. (Source: Wei, L., McMahon, D. and Ma, W., “Chinese Firm’s Bond Default May Not Be the Last,” The Wall Street Journal, March 9, 2014.)
Before this default, there was a slight hope that the government would come in and bail out the troubled companies—something that happened in the U.S. economy during the financial crisis in 2008. Now, with this default, there are speculations that we will see more of the same.
Furthermore, there are concerns that property values in the Chinese economy are going to see a correction. Over the past few years, there has been the mass development of ghost towns—these are cities that have been built with massive infrastructure, yet very few people are living there. It shows there’s a massive amount of supply in the property market—which, of course, results in lower prices.
In addition to all this, production in the country is declining. In February, the indicators of manufacturing activity in China like the HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Mangers’ Index declined to an eight-month low, showing there’s an outright contraction in the sector. (Source: “HSBC China Manufacturing PMI; PMI signals modest deterioration of business conditions in February,” Markit, March 3, 2014.)
In spite of the negativity towards China in the mainstream, I remain bullish on the country and believe investors may do very well there.
Let me explain…
Certainly, there are troubles that will come in the way in the near future, but the long-term perspective looks good. Many investors forget that China has the biggest population in the world and the middle class in the country continues to grow.
The recent troubles, according to my analysis, will create havoc in Chinese stocks in the short term, but they will also create buying opportunities in the well-known names that have massive market share.
Take China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL), for example; since the third quarter of 2013, the company’s stock price has declined roughly 20%. Recently, the stock broke below its long-term support level, and it may go down further. China Mobile has more than 700 million subscribers. To put this into perspective, that’s more than twice the size of the American population.
As more economic news comes out of China, investors should make a list of major companies that operate in China and trade on the key stock indices here in the U.S. When there’s a sell-off, certain companies get punished for no apparent reason—and that’s when they are worth buying. Chinese companies will be no different.
