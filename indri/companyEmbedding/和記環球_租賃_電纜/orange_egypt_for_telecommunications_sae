Orange claims that its coverage extends to more than 99% of the Egyptian population.
Recent changes[edit]
On September 21, 2011, Yves Gauthier has been appointed the new chief executive officer (CEO) of Mobinil, a change that took effect on November 15 of the same year. This followed the resignation of Hassan Kabbani.
On February 13, 2012, Orange S.A. announced its intent to buy Sawiris' biggest share in Mobinil for about $2 billion which could be the end of the long-standing dispute between the company's major shareholders.
On May 27, 2012, Orange S.A. acquired 94 percent of Mobinil, buying most of the shares it did not already own from its local venture partner, Orascom Telecom Media and Technology (OTMT). Orange executed its purchase of 93.9 million shares of the 100 million outstanding at a pre-agreed price of E£202.5 each, for a total transaction value of E£19 billion ($3.15 billion). OTMT agreed to keep a 5 percent stake in Mobinil.[4]
In February 2015, an agreement was reached between Orange S.A. and OTMT, where OTMT, then holder of 5% of Mobinil's shares, sold all of its shares and voting rights in the company to Orange S.A., thus raising Orange's ownership in Mobinil to 98.92%.
On March 8, 2016, Mobinil was officially rebranded to Orange.
On October 14, 2016, Orange acquired the fourth-generation (4G) internet services licence after signing a $484-million agreement with the national telecom regulator.[5]
