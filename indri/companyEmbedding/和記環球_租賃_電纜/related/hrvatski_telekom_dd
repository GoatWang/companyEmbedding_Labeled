      The new location, which adds to RedCloud Technologies’ existing presence 
      in the UK, France, and Morocco, will play a key role in its strategy for 
      changing the way in which financial services can be accessed in the new 
      digital economy.
    

      “Expanding our presence into Argentina is an important step in our 
      business growth strategy and reflects our commitment to building Banking 
      As A Platform throughout Latin America,” commented Justin Floyd, CEO, 
      RedCloud. “Argentina particularly has an international and advanced 
      technology landscape rich with talent. Our focus will be on further 
      expanding staffing and capabilities in our product and business 
      development teams to service current and future markets.”

      instrumental in defining, managing and implementing go-to-market product 
      plans for all major Argentinian banks across the entire VISA technology 
      portfolio.
    

      Almonacid also joins from Prisma Medios de Pago where as E-Commerce 
      Product Leader he lead the design and development of payments platform, Todopago. 
      Prior to that he was Development and Product Manager at Banelco for six 
      years, responsible for managing banking services, products and channels, 
      as well as identifying and deliver new products focused on financial 
      inclusion.
