A Skytrax certified 5-star airline
Video has no narration, no audio description








As an airline, Etihad has come a long way in a short time – just like its home Abu Dhabi. 

The airline was established by Royal (Emiri)
Decree in July 2003 and is wholly owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi with a
mandate to operate safely, commercially and profitably.
Etihad is a Skytrax 5-Star certified airline and
its guests are at the heart of everything it does. The airline is in a perfect
geographical position and offers its guests a network of over 110 passenger and
cargo destinations across six continents, with a young and environmentally
friendly fleet of more than 120 aircraft.
Etihad is also one of five key business divisions of the Etihad Aviation Group
(EAG). The diversified global aviation and travel group also includes Etihad
Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity
Partners.




OUR VISION
Etihad Airways’ vision is to be the best airline in the world,
connecting the globe via Abu Dhabi. 
The airline seeks to reflect its values of Arabian hospitality and
warmth- as well as enhance the reputation of Abu Dhabi as world class
business and leisure destination. 
Etihad is inspired by its Emirati values and benchmarks itself
against the world’s best hospitality establishments, not just other airlines.
The airline has  introduced a number of
signature travel experiences with world-class products and innovative service
offerings such as the Inflight Chef, Food & Beverage Managers and Flying
Nannies.




OUR PARTNERSWe are committed to a strategy of collaborative growth in order to gain the scale we require to be competitive in the global air transport market. Beyond our organic growth, this is being achieved through the development of a strong base of codeshare partnerships, and minority investments in strategically important airlines, which combined, provide access to hundreds of destinations we do not serve with our own aircraft.

Etisalat Group is one of the world’s leading telecom groups in emerging markets. Etisalat’s current market cap is over AED 152 billion (42 billion USD). With reported net revenues of AED 52.4 billion and net profit of AED 8.4 billion for 2016, Etisalat ranks amongst the most profitable telecom groups in the world. Its high credit ratings at AA-/Aa3 reflect the company’s strong balance sheet and proven long-term performance.


Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Etisalat was established four decades ago in the UAE as the country’s first telecommunications service provider. An international blue-chip organisation, Etisalat Group provides innovative solutions and services to 162 million subscribers in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa.


Etisalat Group’s mission is to provide a best-in-class total customer experience domestically and internationally, deliver attractive returns to shareholders while investing in the long-term future of the company, and supporting economic development in all the markets we operate in.


Aspiring to be the most admired telecom group in emerging markets, Etisalat strives to consistently foster innovation and deliver first-in-market technologies wherever it operates. This is evidenced by its expeditionary trials of 5G services in the UAE – the first-ever in the region – including coordinating the development, design and deployment of future ICT platforms for fifth generation mobile broadband. Abu Dhabi is the first capital in the world to be fully connected and has the highest speed fibre optic on the planet.


Such diverse technological expertise has helped Etisalat Group capture significant market share as it expands across Africa, Asia and the Middle East, most notably in Egypt, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, where the introduction of innovative mobile broadband services has changed market dynamics and provided affordable mobile internet access for millions of people.


Etisalat Group’s performance and services have been widely recognised by the industry. It has won many major awards, including the prestigious annual GSMA’s Global Mobile Awards for the past four years.

ESH attained financial demerger from Etisalat during 2008. The financial demerger implies independent financial systems and processes in each business unit, thus allowing Etisalat Services group to evolve, implement and monitor its business strategies.

Mr. Ali Al Sharid, CEO of Etisalat Services Holding, oversees the operation of eight Business Units that offer mission-critical telecommunications related services in the UAE, the MENA region and beyond.
