        Fourteen Malaysian firms on Forbes Global 2000
       
    
by eugene mahalingam















Maybank continues to lead the Malaysian group but its global rank has fallen from No. 362 last year to No. 390.























KUALA LUMPUR: Fourteen Malaysian companies made the cut for this year’s Forbes Global 2000 list, with Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) once again leading the group.

The Malaysian companies that are sharing the spotlight with some of the world’s biggest, most powerful and valuable public firms are:

Maybank (ranked 390th), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (490), Public Bank Bhd (632), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (671), Sime Darby Bhd (791), Genting Bhd (1,259), Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (1,319), RHB Bank Bhd (1,405), Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (1,472), Axiata Group Bhd (1,510), MISC Bhd (!,543), Maxis Bhd (1,596), AmBank Group (1,771) and Petronas Gas Bhd (1,881).

In a statement on Wednesday, Forbes said the ranking was based on a mix of four metrics, namely sales, profits, assets and market value.

Despite a slowing of the global initial public offering (IPO) market, Forbes said there were several newcomers to the list, with Asia leading the pack with 13 companies joining the Global 2000 ranks.

“The highest debut at No. 55 is Postal Savings Bank of China. The September 2016 IPO was the year’s largest, worth US$8.1bil (RM34bil). In the US, the most high-profile company to enter the list was Snap Inc. 

“The company’s US$24bil (RM103bil) market cap helped it earn a spot at No. 1,693.”

The top 10 companies on the list are: Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of America, Bank of China, Apple and Toyota Motor.

Forbes said the 2017 Global 2000 list faced much pressure amid unsteady geopolitical climates and slowing economies.

“Yet, in aggregate, these 2,000 companies have managed to come out stronger than last year, with increased sales, profits, assets and market values.

“Despite slowing gross domestic product figures, China and the US, whose companies make up more than 40% of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants.”

Jamaludin says with Mitsui in the fold, Smart is in a position to offer enhanced digital services that will leapfrog Cambodia’s digital economy.























KUALA LUMPUR: Telecommunication company Axiata Group Bhd’s unit, Axiata Investments (Cambodia) Ltd, is selling a 10% stake in Axiata (Cambodia) Holdings Ltd to Mitsui Co Ltd and its affiliate, M & Y Asia Telecom Holdings Pte Ltd for US$66mil (RM285.2mil).

Axiata (Cambodia) Holdings Ltd is the holding company of Smart Axiata Co Ltd.

In a statement, Axiata said post-transaction, it would hold a 82.5% stake in Smart Axiata.

“Under the agreement, Axiata granted Mitsui a call option to acquire an additional 10% interest, exercisable within 12 months from the completion of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close by end-May 2017,” said Axiata.

It said the deal met the group’s portfolio management strategy and brought financial value for Axiata and its shareholders, with the proceeds intended for general corporate purposes and repayment of existing debt in its balance sheet.

“For Axiata, the minority stake sale helps it to re-balance its group’s portfolio while retaining a majority control in Smart. The transaction also unlocks value for Axiata shareholders through healthy returns on its investments in Smart and contributes to enhancing Axiata’s balance sheet position,” it said.

Axiata president and group chief executive officer Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim said the strategic partnership with Mitsui would also support the growth efforts of Smart, particularly in the areas of digital services and Internet-of-things and its vision of becoming a new generation digital champion.

He said with Mitsui in the fold, Smart was in a position to offer enhanced digital services that would leapfrog Cambodia’s digital economy.

“We look forward to leveraging on synergies from this strategic partnership. As a long-term investor with a diverse portfolio in the region, we continuously review various options to optimise our capital allocation, balance sheet and group structure which includes a potential adoption of strategic partners to support the growth efforts,” he added.

Jamaludin said Axiata remained committed to maintaining its majority stake in Smart.

“It is a company that has consistently outperformed its competitors with its clear customer proposition, innovative product solutions and effective cost controls,” he added. - Bernama

Axiata Successfully Prices USD500 million Sukuk, with a Bid-to-Cover of 3.8 times
2015-11-13
Kuala Lumpur, 13 November 2015 - Axiata Group Berhad (“Axiata”) has successfully priced its 5-year USD500.0 million sukuk (“Sukuk Issuance”) which will be issued via its wholly-owned Malaysian-incorporated special purpose vehicle, Axiata SPV2 Berhad. The Sukuk Issuance is the second issuance under Axiata’s multi-currency sukuk issuance programme with an aggregate nominal value of USD1.5 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) (“Sukuk Programme”), established on 17 July 2012.The Sukuk Issuance has been assigned ratings of Baa2 and BBB by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services respectively. The Sukuk Issuance, which will be listed on Bursa Malaysia (under the Exempt Regime) and the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, is structured based on the Shari'a principle of Wakala whereby the underlying assets are airtime vouchers, representing entitlement to a specified number of airtime minutes on the mobile telecommunications network of subsidiaries of Axiata for on-net calls. The bookbuilding exercise commenced with an initial price guidance of U.S. Treasuries (“UST”) + 1.95%. Demand for the Sukuk issuance led to a revised guidance of UST + 1.75% - UST + 1.80% at Asian close/London mid with books in excess of USD2.0 billion. The Sukuk Issuance was finally priced at the tightest end of the price guidance, with a final book of over USD1.92 billion orders, representing a bid-to-cover ratio of close to 3.8 times, and a final yield of 3.466%. The issuance by Axiata attracted interest from a diverse group of Islamic as well as conventional investors, comprising asset management companies, financial institutions, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, with participation from more than 170 accounts.Commenting on the Sukuk Issuance, Axiata’s President & Group Chief Executive Officer, Dato’ Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim said, “Similar to the first series of RMB Sukuk issued in 2012 under the Sukuk Programme, we are pleased that the response for this Sukuk Issuance was positive. Despite the challenging business environment and volatility in the marketplace today, the strong participation from international investors is a testament to our solid fundamentals. Axiata is focused on our long term strategy to be a regional champion, and will continue to look towards opportunities in the capital markets to strengthen our capital base and support our aspirations.” Axiata’s Group Chief Financial Officer, Chari TVT, added, “Axiata has always been at the forefront of innovative product solutions, whether in telecommunications or otherwise, and as a strong proponent of Islamic financing, it was only natural for us to tap the Sukuk Programme. Axiata’s Sukuk Issuance saw strong cross-border participation from a wide and diverse base of investors, with 58% from Asia, 22% Europe and 20% from Middle East.” CIMB and Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch are the Joint Arrangers and Dealers of the Sukuk Programme, as well as Joint Lead Managers and Bookrunners for the Sukuk Issuance. The transaction structure and documents for the Sukuk Issuance have been approved by CIMB Islamic Bank Berhad and Dr. Hussein Hamed Sayed Hassan, the Shari’a Adviser of Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch.About Axiata Axiata is one of the largest Asian telecommunications companies.
