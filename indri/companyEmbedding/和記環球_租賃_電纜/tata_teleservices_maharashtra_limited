History[edit]
In November 2008, Japanese telecom giant NTT Docomo picked up a 26 per cent equity stake in Tata Docomo, a subsidiary of Tata Teleservices, for about ₹130.7 billion (US$2.0 billion) or an enterprise value of ₹502.69 billion (US$7.8 billion).[4] NTT DOCOMO announced on 25 April 2014 that they are going to sell 100% of their shares in Tata DOCOMO to Tata Teleservices and exit Indian Telecom. The reason for exit is because of huge loss of $1.3 billion.[5]
In February 2008, TTSL announced that it would provide CDMA mobile services targeted towards the youth, in association with the Virgin Group on a franchisee model basis. By April 1, 2015, all Virgin Mobile CDMA & GSM customers have been migrated into the umbrella Tata Docomo brand (Tata Indicom for Delhi NCR).
Currently Tata Teleservices provides mobile services under the following brand names:

Tata DoCoMo (CDMA & GSM mobile operator, wireless broadband)
T24 Mobile (GSM mobile operator)

Market data[edit]
Tata Indicom in April 2009, crossed the 35 million subscribers mark in the wireless category with an overall subscriber base of over 36 million.
Tata Teleservices is #2 in terms of market share in Delhi NCR region with a subscriber base of 5 million.
Business areas[edit]
Tata Teleservices offers multiple tariff plans in both the Post-paid and Pre-Paid category. It also offers Mobile Value Added Services to subscriberss.
Branding[edit]
Tata Teleservices launched the Virgin Mobile brand to target the youth segment.
Rural Telephony[edit]
TTSL also maintains a distribution network across villages, wherein people are appointed and trained by TTSL – who visit villages on a bicycle or a two-wheeler at defined times on defined days of the week, selling recharge vouchers and servicing equipment; each runner covers between 200 and 300 customers?
The company joined hands with Tata Chemicals, Tata Kisaan Sansar network, disseminating information through these centres and using them as local distributors.
Retail[edit]
The company's retail business has around 3,000 outlets nationally, comprising 600 TTSL owned stores and around 2,500 stores in the Franchisee format. Tata Indicom already covers the top 700 towns in India in terms of population through
Tata indicom also maintains an online portal for its customers i-choose where the customers can buy Tata Indicom CDMA post-paid connections and prepaid recharge vouchers with an upfront commitment of activation and delivery of the handset within 72 hours.
Value added services[edit]
Tata Teleservices, in October 2007 launched Tata Zone, an infotainment portal on Tata Docomo BREW-enabled mobile phones, in Hindi. This service has applications, pricing details, downloads and browsing instructions in Hindi.
The rationale behind this was simple: - 66% of all Indians speak Hindi, while less than 5% understand English.
Under its VAS bouquet, TTSL offers services such as News, Games, Faith and Prayers, Ringtones, Streaming TV, Fun Shows, Video Zone, Song Download Express, Cricket, Internet Surfing, Astrology, and Mobile Office among others.
Tata DoCoMo CDMA plans to provide m-commerce, mobile advertising and social networking under its VAS offerings.
NTT DoCoMo exit[edit]
NTT DoCoMo announced on 25 April 2014 that they are going to sell 100% of their shares in Tata Docomo to Tata Teleservices and exit Indian Telecom. The reason for exit is because of huge loss of $780 million during financial year ending 31 March 2014 .[6]

Dear Sir, 

Please refer to our teletalk regarding internet bill of above mentioned tata indicom account for the period of 15-10-11 to 14-11-11.

I have received my bill of Rs. 7092 for the above mentioned period, though my monthly rental is around Rs. 750 and my credit limit is just Rs. 1, 000/- and I have limited plan. Since it is my new connection and its my very first bill from TTML, I expected you to either inform me when I had reached to my credit limit or give me a facility to check my current bill as per my usage. but neither of them been done from your end. I didnt receive any call from you during the period, most importantly when I was reached at my credit limit. I had received a call from you for the first time on 23rd of November saying that my bill is Rs. 7, 000/-, plz pay to enable us to continue ur service smoothly. before that I wasnt informed by you during the period. 

Since its my new connection and its my very first bill and I have chosen internet plan as per my capacity, otherwise If I had knew that my usage will be higher then the plan den I wouldnt have chosen limited usage plan i.e. 10 GB, and rather then that I would have gone for unlimited plan of around Rs. 1150. instead of paying Rs. 7000. Sir, I do not want to spoil any relation with you as your client and I want to continue the relation with you as good customer. Ethically I am ready to pay what I had chosen i.e. Rs. 1, 000/-. n thats my maximam capacity. I request you to consider this matter as lack of communication from your end and for that I am not in a position to pay so much.

Also if above mentioned things are acceptable and I can continue your service, than kindly change my current plan i.e. DS350 new ADSL 2 Mbps limited plan to unlimited plan with 1 mbps speed and monthly bill would be around Rs. 1100 - Rs. 1200.

Please do the needful and revert back at your earliest.


Thanks & regards

Harrasing for non payment
I had taken an Internet connection from Tata tele services in October 2011. I had chosen a limited usage plan of monthly rental of Rs. 750 and my credit limit was set on Rs. 1000 as it was my new connection. after using it for few days, I got a call from the representative of Tata saying that I have crossed my usage limit and current bill is around Rs. 7,000/- hence kindly make the payment at your earliest to continue the service smoothly. I immediately told them to make a note that its your mistake that neither you have not informed me when I reached at my credit limit nor you have discontinued the connection as soon as I crossed my limit.

Then I asked Tata representative to define me the meaning of credit limit because If my credit limit is 1000 Rs. then where were you so far and waiting for my billing meter to reach so high. because I was in a state of mind that my usage are under my credit limit. then he agreed and said all right you pay Rs. 1000/- which is your limit and allow me to put you in a unlimited usage plan. then I agreed. but in the next month nothing was changed neither my plan nor my unpaid out-standings.
Finally they disconnected the connection, despite of solving the issue and stopped communicating.
After few weeks some other representative called me and said Sir, your bill is outstanding so kindly pay at your earliest. then I explained him that I dont have outstanding dues, its a issue which was left unsolved by ur some other representative. then this representative asked me to provide the details of the issue and assured me to solve this issue with the help of his seniors. but after that he never came back to discuss the issue.

Same way after couple of weeks some other representative called me up saying Sir, your bill is outstanding and please pay. I explained him again the same way like I did to the earlier representative.

Since then so many representative have called me to make the payment and I have given my time to them n told them the same issue to be solved. but non of them have tried to sort out this issue and never called back.

Today I got a call from no. 9571763936, saying he is an advocate from tees hazari court and calling me to either pay my outstanding dues of Tata Tele or be ready to face the legal action  which will cause me lots of money and I will have to comer there to attend the hearing in Tees Hazari Court.

I tried to put my side to him, but he didnt listen to me at all and said are you going to pay your bill or not? else be ready for the legal action.

I request you to take this complaint for not resolving the issue since so long and also harassing me by calling me to take legal action against me.
