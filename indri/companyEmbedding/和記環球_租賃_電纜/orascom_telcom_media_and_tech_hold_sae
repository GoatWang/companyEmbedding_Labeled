Ratios valuation of Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE ( OTMT | EGY)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power.

The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value. (Enterprise Value vs. Market Capitalization)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE is significantly lower than the median of its peer group: around 6.00. According to these financial ratios Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE's valuation is way below the market valuation of its peer group.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE is significantly lower than the average of its sector (Mobile Telecommunications): 7.05. According to these financial ratios Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE's valuation is way below the market valuation of its sector.The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio of Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE is significantly lower than its historical 5-year average: 3.5. The (current) company valuation of Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE is therefore way below its valuation average over the last five years.Valuation

E.g. Net Sales Growth, EBITDA Growth, EBIT Growth.- Profitability ratios measure the returns generated on sales and investment, hence the ability of the company to generate profits.Profitability ratios include margin ratios (such as profit margin or operating margin) and return ratios (such as return on equity or return on assets).- Capital structure and liquidity ratios measure the extent to which the company is relying upon debt to fund its operations, and its ability to pay back the debt. Capital structure ratios include debt to equity and debt to asset ratios, and liquidity ratios include coverage ratios and solvency ratios.- Asset utilization ratios, also called activity or efficiency ratios, measure how efficiently the company's day to day operations are managing inventory, selling and producing products, or using assets to generate revenue.Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies, between industries and also between a single company and its industry average or peer group average.Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE: Market multiple valuation (OTMT | EGY | Mobile Telecommunications) - Infinancials

More...Did you know ?On the Infinancials platform, there are two ways to identify the listed peers which most closely resemble a private firm:- with Peer Tracker if you already know a listed peer.Peer Tracker is a patented technology tool for building peer groups using industry classifications. The degree of similarity between two companies is calculated comparing their sector footprints and measured using comparability scores.- with Market Screener if you have no listed peer in mind.Market Screener is a dedicated interface for screening companies using multiple criteria, identifying peers, searching for comparable companies in a specific business sector.About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
