BR MALLS Participações SA : Fairly valued, but don’t skip the other factors 
June 1, 2016 by CapitalCube 


BR MALLS Participações SA relative valuation is now NEUTRAL. It was previously rated UNDERVALUED, and has a fundamental analysis score of 46.
Our analysis is based on comparing BR MALLS Participações SA with the following peers – Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliarios SA, Peru Holding de Turismo SAA, Jereissati Participacoes SA Pfd and Mitsubishi Estate Company, Limited Unsponsored ADR (MULT3-BR, PHTBC1-PE, MLFT4-BR and MITEY-US).
Relative Valuation
BR MALLS Participações SA is currently neutrally valued, as its previous close of USD 6.44 lies within the CapitalCube estimate range of USD 6.33 to USD 8.42. Over the last 52 week period, BR MALLS Participações SA has fluctuated between USD 3.93 and USD 7.60.


Company Overview

Compared to peers, relative underperformance last month is down from a median performance last year.


BR Malls Participacoes S.A. Sponsored GDR RegS’s current Price/Book of 0.69 is about median in its peer group.


The market expects BRML200-US to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.


BRML200-US‘s relatively high profit margins are burdened by capital inefficiency.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


Over the last five years, BRML200-US‘s return on equity has declined from above median to around median among its peers, indicating declining relative operating performance.


The company’s relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.


While BRML200-US‘s revenues growth has been below the peer median in the last few years, the market still gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median and seems to see the company as a long-term strategic bet.


The company’s equity capital investment program suggests it is under-investing in a business that is producing peer median returns.


 


Investment Outlook
BR MALLS Participações SA has a fundamental score of 46 and has a relative valuation of NEUTRAL. 
BR MALLS Participações SA’s Fundamental Analysis Score is about average at 46, thus not allowing for a specific classification into the Value – Price Matrix.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  36.69 (08/03/17)      EPS (TTM)  R$0.41      Market Cap R$1.57 B     Shares Outstanding 54.79 M     Public Float 27.03 M     Yield MLFT4 has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend R$0.45     Ex-Dividend Date 07/17/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Company numbers are TTM (trailing twelve months) or latest available. Share price data is previous day's close unless otherwise stated.OverviewBR Malls Participacoes S.A. Sponsored GDR RegS's current Price/Book of 0.82 is about median in its peer group.The market expects BRML200-US to grow at about the same rate as the peers and to maintain the median returns it currently generates.BRML200-US's relatively high profit margins are burdened by capital inefficiency.Compared with its chosen peers, the company's annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.Over the last five years, BRML200-US's return on equity has declined from above median to around median among its peers, indicating declining relative operating performance.The company's relatively high gross and pre-tax margins suggest a differentiated product portfolio and tight control on operating costs relative to peers.While BRML200-US's revenues growth has been below the peer median in the last few years, the market still gives the stock a P/E ratio that is around peer median and seems to see the company as a long-term strategic bet.The company's level of equity capital investment is relatively low and suggests it is milking the business.

("TmarPart"), pursuant to art. 157, paragraph 4, of Law No. 6,404/76 and Instruction No. 358/02 of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios – CVM), and in furtherance of the Material Fact published on March 26, 2015, informs that, in the shareholders' meeting scheduled for March 31, 2015, in accordance with the terms of TmarPart's Shareholders' Agreement, the management of TmarPart and Oi, respectively, received the approval to begin taking the applicable steps to adopt a set of measures to meet the main goals of the planned business combination of Oi, TmarPart, and Portugal Telecom, SGPS, S.A. ("PT SGPS"), as published on February 20, 2014, (the "Transaction"), according to the terms below.
The shareholders of TmarPart unanimously approved the adoption of an alternative share structure, after analyzing options and taking into consideration the current obstacles to a registration of TmarPart shares with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that would be necessary to allow the incorporacao de acoes ("Merger of Shares") of Oi and TmarPart, as described in the Material Fact of March 26, 2015. The adopted alternative share structure allows the main goals of the Transaction to be met, with Oi able to adopt the corporate governance best practices prescribed by the regulations of the Novo Mercado segment of the BM&F Bovespa S.A. – Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros ("BM&F Bovespa") and disperse its voting rights, keeping in mind the final objective of opportunely completing the Transaction with the result of listing the shares currently held by Oi shareholders, and, at a later point, those of the shares held by PT SGPS, on the Novo Mercado.
1. Measures Approved by the Shareholders of TmarPart to Meet the Goals of the Transaction
The alternative share structure includes a voluntary exchange of Oi's preferred shares for common shares (in other words, at the option of the preferred shareholder), at an exchange rate of 0.9211 common shares for each preferred share issued by Oi, as already published for the Merger of Shares between Oi and TmarPart, and used for the pricing of the public offering of shares by Oi on April 28, 2014. 
The voluntary exchange proposal requires that at least two-thirds of Oi's preferred shareholders (ex-treasury) agree to exchange their shares for common shares (the "Condition for the Exchange"), within a period of 30 days, commencing after the General Shareholders' Meeting of Oi at which the opening of the period for the exchange is deliberated (the "Voluntary Exchange of Preferred Shares").
As preliminary steps for the beginning of the period for the Voluntary Exchange of Preferred Shares, the following steps, which are closely related to one another, need to be approved and implemented simultaneously, concurrently and inseparable one from the other (the "Preliminary Steps"):

(i)  Merger of the entities that directly or indirectly own shares of Oi ("Simplification of Corporate Ownership");
(ii)  Approval of the new by laws of Oi, reflecting the improved standards of Oi's corporate governance;
(iii)  Election of Oi's new Board of Directors, with a term expiring at the General Shareholders' Meeting that approves Oi's financial statements for the year ending on December 31, 2017.

2. Main Steps of the Simplification of Corporate Ownership
The following corporate restructuring transactions will be completed with the goal of simplifying the share capital structure of Oi, and are to be deliberated during the shareholders' general meetings, to be held on the same date, and before the start of the period for the Voluntary Exchange of Preferred Shares: (i) merger of AG Telecom Participacoes S.A. ("AG Tel") into Pasa Participacoes S.A. ("PASA"), LF Tel S.A. ("LF") into EDSP75 Participacoes S.A. ("EDSP75"), and PASA and EDSP75 into Bratel Brasil S.A. ("Bratel"); (ii) merger of Valverde Participacoes S.A. into TmarPart; (iii) merger of Venus RJ Participacoes S.A. ("Venus"), Sayed RJ Participacoes S.A. ("Sayed") and PTB2 into Bratel; (iv) merger of Bratel into TmarPart; and finally (v) the merger of TmarPart into Oi.
As previously disclosed in the Material Fact, dated February 20, 2014, the Simplification of Corporate Ownership will be done without diluting the interests of the other shareholders that hold interests in the companies involved, given that the established exchange ratios solely take into account the direct and indirect interests between them and in Oi's share capital, observing the premise that these companies will not have, with the possible exception of goodwill recorded in relation to their investments, relevant assets or liabilities (or they will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fully repay such liabilities). Any goodwill, or other assets, recorded by the companies whose structure will be simplified may be transferred to Oi or to TmarPart, as the case may be, for the benefit of their shareholders, and these amounts will not be considered when establishing exchange ratios.
The TmarPart Shareholders' Agreements will terminate as a consequence of the Simplification of Corporate Ownership
3. Proposal for New Oi Bylaws
The shareholders of TmarPart approved the proposal for new by-laws of Oi that will be submitted to the Board of Directors and the General Meeting of Oi's shareholders, which will allow Oi to adopt improved levels of corporate governance, as well as to disperse the right to vote, in accordance with governance pledges made with to market.
Oi's new bylaws will include, among other things, the following main provisions:

(i)  A 100% tag along for common shares;
(ii)  Preferred shares without the right to vote, but would maintain the rights currently held by the preferred shareholders;
(iii)  Convertibility of the preferred shares, during the time periods and in accordance with the conditions approved by the Board of Directors;
(iv)  The voting rights of a single shareholder cannot exceed 15%;
(v)  As stipulated by the Regulations of the Novo Mercado, at least 20% of the Directors must be independent;
(vi)  A collective term of two years for the members of the Board of Directors, with exception to the first Board of Directors, which shall have a term of three years;
(vii)  Prohibition against the same person holding the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (except during the first three years from adoption of the new Bylaws);
(viii)  The Board of Directors is obligated to address any public offer to repurchase Oi's shares;
(ix)  The requirement to complete an offer to purchase common shares at a price at least equal to the economic value of the shares in the case of termination of the registration or exit from Level 1 Corporate Governance of the BM&F Bovespa, except in the event that Oi enters the Level 2 Corporate Governance or the Novo Mercado segment of the BM&F Bovespa;
(x)  Mandatory resolution of disputes or controversies through arbitration in front of the Market Arbitration Chamber (Camara de Arbitragem do Mercado).

The limitation on voting rights will cease to be in effect in the following events:

(i)  capital increase or corporate reorganization that results in a dilution of the current shareholder base of more than 50%;
(ii)  as a result of an offer to purchase all outstanding common shares of Oi in which the offeror acquires at least 20% of the outstanding common shares or such offeror or group of shareholders representing the same or related interest of the offeror by voting agreement comes to hold, either individually or together, an interest in excess of 50% of Oi's voting capital; or
(iii)  at any time, no shareholder of Oi or group of shareholders representing the same or related interest by voting agreement, holds, individually or together, an interest in excess of 15% of Oi's voting capital.

4. Commitment to Convert Shares Assumed by the Shareholders of TmarPart
The shareholders of TmarPart that hold shares of Oi, have committed to convert their preferred shares in Oi to common shares pursuant to the approved exchange ratio of 0.9211 common shares for each preferred share issued by Oi. This commitment will remain in effect until the earlier of October 31, 2015 and the end of the 30-day term for the completion of the conversion of Oi's preferred shares into common shares under the structure for the Voluntary Exchange of Preferred Shares, subject to implementation of the Condition for the Exchange.
5. Commitment to Merge the Shareholder Bases of Oi and PT SGPS
In addition, TmarPart, Oi and PT SGPS executed on the date hereof an amendment to the Terms of Commitment Agreement, dated September 8, 2014, which requires the parties to use their best efforts and take all reasonable steps to cause the listing of Oi's shares (or securities backed by the shares of Oi or its successor in the event of a corporate reorganization) on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon (a regulated market), in addition to the New York Stock Exchange and BM&FBovespa, where the shares of Oi are already listed.
6. Amendment to the Option Agreement with PT SGPS
In addition, Oi also adjusted an amendment to the Option Agreement with PT SGPS, in order to allow PT SGPS to assign its call option to purchase Oi's shares.  In consideration for the foregoing, Oi will have a right of first refusal exercisable prior to such assignment. The effectiveness of the amendment to the Option Agreement is subject to the approval at Oi's General Shareholders' Meeting at which holders of preferred shares will be entitled to vote and approval by the CVM, if applicable. Oi's General Shareholders' Meeting to deliberate on the amendment to the Option Agreement will be called on or prior to August 31, 2015 and held on or prior September 30, 2015.
The General Shareholders' Meeting of Oi to approve the amendment to the Option Agreement will take place within the above time frame, and if possible, during the same General Shareholders' Meeting at which the Preliminary Steps will be approved, unless the decision of the CVM is still pending with respect to the amendment to the Option Agreement.  Certain shareholders of TmarPart have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the above amendment during Oi's General Shareholders' Meeting that will vote on the amendment to the Option Agreement.
7. Conditions for Implementation, Approvals and other Information
Within the next few days, Oi and TmarPart's management, as the case may be, will initiate the appropriate actions, including the preparation of all corporate acts and relevant contracts, for the adoption of the matters described in this Material Fact to be submitted for approval in new Preliminary Meetings of shareholders to be called in due course.
In addition to the relevant corporate approvals, the transactions and matters described in this Material Fact are subject to prior approval of the National Telecommunications Agency (Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicacoes, or "ANATEL").
The Voluntary Exchange of Preferred Shares and the Preliminary Steps will also be submitted for consent to certain creditors and debenture holders, pursuant to their respective debt instruments, but are not, however, subject to their approval.
The other conditions of the transactions described in this Material Fact, notably the full terms of the merger of TmarPart into Oi, in the form required by CVM Instruction No. 319/99, will be disclosed in the form of a Material Fact after the approval of the transactions by the management of Oi and TmarPart.
8. Expected Timeline
It is estimated that the general meetings which will deliberate regarding the Preliminary Steps, as well as the opening date for the shareholders of Oi's preferred shares to express their intent to convert their preferred shares into common shares, will be called in approximately 130 days, subject to ANATEL's prior consent to the implementation of the transactions and matters described in this Material Fact."
The shareholders also set October 31, 2015 as the deadline for the implementation of the Preliminary Steps.

Consummation of the Exchange
Oi reports that, following the approval by its General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 26, 2015, the exchange contracted for on September 8, 2014 by Oi, TmarPart, PT SGPS, Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V. ("PT Finance") and PT Portugal, SGPS, S.A. ("PT Portugal") was consummated, under which PT SGPS transferred 47,434,872 Oi common shares and 94,869,744 Oi preferred shares to PT Finance; and Oi, through PT Finance, in turn, transferred to PT SGPS securities issued by Rio Forte Investments, S.A. in the aggregate principal amount of €897 million, without remainder (the "Exchange").
As a result of the consummation of the Exchange, PT SGPS's direct interest in Oi declined from 104,580,393 common shares and 172,025,273 preferred shares, representing 37.66% of the voting capital (ex-treasury) and 32.82% of the total share capital of Oi (ex-treasury), to 57,145,521 common shares and 77,155,529 preferred shares, representing 24.81% of the voting capital (ex-treasury) and 19.17% of the total share capital of Oi (ex-treasury). Oi's shares received by PT Finance as a result of the Exchange remain in treasury. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement entered into on September 8, 2014 between PT SGPS, PT Finance, PT Portugal, Oi and TmarPart, and amended on the date hereof, the call option to acquire Oi's shares granted to PT SGPS becomes exercisable from the date hereof for a period of six years, according to the terms and conditions already disclosed to the market.
