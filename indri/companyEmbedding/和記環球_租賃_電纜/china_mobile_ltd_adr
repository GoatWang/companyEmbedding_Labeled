Latest Developments



How was the Company's operating performance for 2016?






2016 was a robust year marked by accelerated strategic transformation for the Company.  The Company continued to promote entrepreneurship and innovative development amid a complicated competitive environment, making most earnest endeavours to bolster its core competences and innovative calibre.  Coupled with its redoubled efforts to further the integrated development of the "four growth engines", the Company managed to maintain relatively rapid and sound growth momentum and achieve encouraging overall results.
 
In 2016, operating revenue reached RMB708.4 billion, up by 6.0% compared to the previous year.  Of which, revenue from telecommunications services was RMB623.4 billion, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 6.7% that was a five-year high.  As a result of revenue growth and cost management, the Company's profitability in 2016 continued to be industry-leading.  Profit from operations was RMB118.1 billion, up by 14.7% compared to the previous year.  EBITDA was RMB256.7 billion and EBITDA margin was 36.2%, up by 0.3 percentage points compared to the previous year.  Profit attributable to equity shareholders was RMB108.7 billion and its margin was 15.3%.  Excluding the one-off gain on the transfer of Tower Assets in 2015, net profit increased by 10.5%.








How was the Company's mobile business for 2016?






The Company ended 2016 with continuing market leadership.  The total number of mobile customers reached 849 million, with a net addition of 22.66 million in 2016.  Mobile ARPU reached RMB57.5, representing an increase of 2.2% from the previous year.  The Company demonstrated comprehensive leadership in the 4G market, with its 4G customer base recording a net addition of 223 million from 2015 to reach 535 million.  Riding on the burgeoning growth of data traffic business, wireless data traffic became the biggest revenue source in 2016 for the first time in the Company's history, surpassing the combined revenue of voice, SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) with its 46.2% contribution. 
 
Building on its exceptional strategic visioning competence, the Company made a tactical move by proactively taking the initiative to cancel domestic long distance and roaming tariffs in 2016. By completely ceasing the sales of non-flat rate packages, the Company managed to migrate customers to flat rate packages in a balanced and orderly manner, leading to mitigation of operating risks.  In 2016, the number of flat rate packages took up 63.6% of the total.








How was the Company's 4G business for 2016?






To firmly and timely grasp the divergent growth opportunities arising from the current market, the Company has devoted great efforts to ramp up its 4G business in 2016, leading to a continuing enhancement to network quality and an expansion of customer base.  Harnessing these positive results, the Company has comprehensively established its 4G competitive edges.
 
The Company added 0.4 million 4G base stations in 2016, bringing the total number to 1.51 million.  As an operator boasting the world's largest 4G network, the Company provides coverage for a population of over 1.3 billion.  Meanwhile, the average download speed on urban roads has improved to 40Mbps, resulting in enhanced customer experience.
 
Thanks to the Company's considerable efforts to promote the migration of 2G/3G customers to the 4G network, the 4G penetration rate of its mobile customers has reached 63% and its market share for net additional 4G customers has exceeded 64% as at the end of 2016, enabling it to be the largest operator in the world in terms of 4G customer base.  The rapid development of the 4G business also led to a marked uplift in the Group's overall customer value, with 4G customer DOU maintaining its upward trajectory to reach an annual average of 1,027MB, which was 7.5 times as high as 2G/3G customer DOU.  These results have together provided a strong testament to the value of the Company's 4G network.
 
In addition to network upgrade, the Company also proactively developed signature 4G products. The Company has built the world's largest VoLTE (Voice over LTE) network, providing high quality VoLTE for commercial use in 313 cities and progressively enabling implicit, automatic connection within the entire network. 







How was the Company's wireline broadband business for 2016?






The Company's overarching strategy for its wireline broadband business is to expedite a boost to business quality and market competitiveness by consistently adopting a high-end marketing approach which aims at delivering products and services with enhanced network speed and quality and targeting at specific customer groups.  The total number of wireline broadband customers grew to exceed 77.62 million in 2016, of which, net additional customers amounted to 22.59 million and accounted for over 63% of the total net additions in the market.  Buoyed by the Company's focused efforts to promote mid to high-bandwidth products, the proportion of customers subscribing to products with bandwidth of 20Mbps or above has reached 76.9%.  An emphasis has been placed on raising returns on investment, and APRU has risen to RMB32.1.  In the meantime, the Company has devised plans to proactively tap into the household market and endeavored to establish its presence in homes with an expanding range of home broadband products.  It has recorded an encouraging result for its home digital product "Mobaihe", a set-top box that provides high-definition video-on-demand service, with the number of customers surpassing 22.80 million. The wireline broadband ARPU that included home digital services reached RMB33.8.







What was the Company's CAPEX in 2016?  What is the Company's CAPEX plan for 2017?






Capital expenditure amounted to RMB187.3 billion in 2016, slightly higher than the RMB186.2 billion budgeted at the beginning of the year.  The variance was mainly attributable to respective investments of RMB83.0 billion and RMB25.5 billion in the 4G and wireline broadband networks, as the Company stepped up efforts to strengthen these capacities particularly in response to the rapid growth of data traffic business in certain hotspot areas.
 
The Company will, at a reasonable pace, continue to prioritize investment choices with a refined direction to ensure investment efficiency in 2017.  Capital expenditure is expected to record a reduction of RMB11.3 billion from the previous year to RMB176.0 billion in 2017, with resources mainly invested in areas that, amongst others, align with the Company's endeavours to strengthen its competitive edge in the 4G network, establish a high-quality full-fibre broadband network, construct network infrastructure for the advance planning of future development and enhance IT integration capabilities, which are all central to the Company's plan to underpin its market leading position in network capabilities and customer perception.








What was the dividend payout for 2016?






Exceeding investors' expectations is the Company's overriding priority.  The Company hopes to create better returns for its shareholders and share with them the fruits of its success, while also securing the Company's development and maintaining shareholder value in the longer term.
 
To this end, the Board recommends the dividend payout ratio of 46% for the full financial year of 2016.  The Board recommends payment of a final dividend of HK$1.243 per share, together with the interim dividend of HK$1.489 per share paid earlier, this amounts to an aggregate dividend payment of HK$2.732 per share for the full 2016 financial year.  Taking into account the Company's financial position, its ability to generate cash flow and its capital demands for future development, the Company will maintain a stable dividend payout ratio for the full financial year of 2017, striving to attain a stable-to-rising dividend payout ratio to create higher shareholder value.








What are the Company's priorities for 2017?






2017 is the year of China deepening supply-side structural reform, and is also a milestone year for the implementation of the Company's "Big Connectivity" strategy.  To ensure effective implementation of the strategy, the Company will take a more macro and comprehensive view of the entire market and build a strong foundation that will enable the growth of its comprehensive network and leverage the opportunities arisen from network evolution.  In the meantime, it will further strengthen its capability and promote mechanism breakthroughs that generate greater synergies.  The Company will spare no effort, maintain the high standards investors expect of it and deliver more favourable results and returns to its shareholders.  In the event that the policy environment matches the Company's expectations, in 2017 China Mobile will strive to maintain revenue growth from telecommunications services above the industry average, while also delivering industry-leading profitability.

History[edit]
A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China[5] and also a public company that is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges,[2] China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception. As of 2010, China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share.[9] China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively.[9]
Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited,[1] China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecom.[10] (This company continues to provide mobile services, however.[9])
State control[edit]
The company likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China's government[11] but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs.[12] Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited,[13] which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors.[2] Established in 2000,[13] CMCC is China Mobile Ltd's current parent company as of 2011.[14]
Rural subscriber base[edit]

China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors.[16] By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population,[17] and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.[16]
It also offers services targeted at the rural market including an agricultural information service, which facilitates a variety of activities such as the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce and crops, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc.[18]
Overseas activities[edit]
The company branched out in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan[19] launching the Zong brand there a year later.[20]
In 2013, China Mobile eyed expansion into Myanmar expressing interest in bidding for one of two licences on offer in a partnership with Vodafone although this plan ultimately fell through.[21]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom[22] and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China[23] adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services.
Network[edit]
China Mobile operates a GSM network,[24] which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in Mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too.[2] GPRS is utilized for data transmission.[25]

3G

The company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market.[9] As of May 2012, its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base,[26] which is an increase from 3% in 2010.[9]
Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China as of 2010.[27]

4G

As of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP's Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, citywide demonstration networks in the future.[27] As of May 2012, such networks are in operation.[26]
While prior iPhone models couldn't use the China Mobile network due to the chipset relying on WCDMA-based networks, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012.[26] The iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s were sold through China Mobile starting in January 2014.[28]

Everest

In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest.[29]

Spratly Isles coverage

In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands.[30]
Nokia deal[edit]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[31][32]
Service brands[edit]
China Mobile uses other names to differentiate its offerings.
Mainland China[edit]
Mobile services are available in Mainland China under several brands as of 2007.[33] As of 2013, the below brands are scheduled to be slowly phased out and replaced by an all-encompassing new brand name—And[34]—whose logo combines an exclamation point, the Chinese character for "peace" (Chinese: 和, Hanyu Pinyin: Hé), as well as the English word "and".[35]

How To Profit From China’s Economic Slowdown [China Mobile Ltd. (ADR), China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (ADR)]


 March 13, 2014 2:11pm  ETF BASIC NEWS 






Moe Zulfiqar: There’s a significant amount of pessimism towards the Chinese economy these days, and the reasons behind this are very understandable. The economic data suggests the country is headed toward an economic slowdown.




In 2013, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7%—barely better than the previous year and the estimates that were calling for the lowest growth rate since 1999. (Source: Yao, K. and Wang, A., “China’s 2013 economic growth dodges 14-year low but further slowing seen,” Reuters, January 20, 2014.) Keep in mind that despite beating the estimates, this GDP growth rate is much lower than the country’s historical average.
This isn’t all. A credit crunch is also in the making. We are now hearing how companies in China will have troubles paying their interest on the bonds they have issued. So far, we have seen one default on payment by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. This solar company, based in China, defaulted on a $14.7-million interest payment on bonds it issued two years ago. (Source: Wei, L., McMahon, D. and Ma, W., “Chinese Firm’s Bond Default May Not Be the Last,” The Wall Street Journal, March 9, 2014.)
Before this default, there was a slight hope that the government would come in and bail out the troubled companies—something that happened in the U.S. economy during the financial crisis in 2008. Now, with this default, there are speculations that we will see more of the same.
Furthermore, there are concerns that property values in the Chinese economy are going to see a correction. Over the past few years, there has been the mass development of ghost towns—these are cities that have been built with massive infrastructure, yet very few people are living there. It shows there’s a massive amount of supply in the property market—which, of course, results in lower prices.
In addition to all this, production in the country is declining. In February, the indicators of manufacturing activity in China like the HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Mangers’ Index declined to an eight-month low, showing there’s an outright contraction in the sector. (Source: “HSBC China Manufacturing PMI; PMI signals modest deterioration of business conditions in February,” Markit, March 3, 2014.)
In spite of the negativity towards China in the mainstream, I remain bullish on the country and believe investors may do very well there.
Let me explain…
Certainly, there are troubles that will come in the way in the near future, but the long-term perspective looks good. Many investors forget that China has the biggest population in the world and the middle class in the country continues to grow.
The recent troubles, according to my analysis, will create havoc in Chinese stocks in the short term, but they will also create buying opportunities in the well-known names that have massive market share.
Take China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL), for example; since the third quarter of 2013, the company’s stock price has declined roughly 20%. Recently, the stock broke below its long-term support level, and it may go down further. China Mobile has more than 700 million subscribers. To put this into perspective, that’s more than twice the size of the American population.
As more economic news comes out of China, investors should make a list of major companies that operate in China and trade on the key stock indices here in the U.S. When there’s a sell-off, certain companies get punished for no apparent reason—and that’s when they are worth buying. Chinese companies will be no different.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

		- BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund
	
	

Equity - International and Global Equity




Product Details
The BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund (Fund) seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the price and yield performance  of the BNY Mellon Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index (Index). The Fund normally holds at least 95% of its total assets in depositary receipts (DR) that comprise the Index. The Index is capitalization-weighted and designed to track the performance of approximately 50 emerging market-based DRs. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. The Fund is an "index fund" that holds publicly traded DRs, negotiable U.S. securities that generally represent a non-U.S. company's publicly traded equity or debt, of non-U.S. companies in a particular geographic region or market represented by a specified relevant benchmark BNY Mellon ADR Index.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as a direct investment in foreign securities, and issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. The Fund may invest in foreign markets and because foreign exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the non-US securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or sell your shares. The Fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.  The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to terminate and liquidate the Fund – See "Termination of a Fund" in the prospectus for further information. In the event the Fund is terminated, the trading pattern of the Fund's Shares could be negatively affected. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI EAFE® Index are unmanaged indexes considered representative of stocks of developing countries; and stocks of Europe, Australasia and the Far East, respectively. These indexes are computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of the US stock market. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.

The funds referred to in this Website are authorized by the SFC for sale to the public in Hong Kong (the “Funds”). SFC authorization is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits or performances of the scheme.

The material contained in this Website has not been reviewed by the SFC or any regulatory authority in Hong Kong.
Investment involves risk and may lose value. If you are considering making an investment, you are advised to obtain your own independent professional advice and to carefully consider all relevant risk factors. The price of units or shares and the income from them in relation to any investment may go down as well as up and any past performance is not indicative of future performance. BlackRock does not guarantee the performance of the Funds.
An investment in the Funds often involves investing in international markets. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments involve the risk of losing all or part of any capital from unfavourable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. An investment in emerging markets also involves heightened other risks such as increased volatility and the possibility of lower trading volume.
When making an investment in the Funds which are listed on one or more stock exchanges, the price of the shares or units will be determined by supply and demand. It is not necessarily the same as the value per share or unit of that the Funds’ assets. At any time the share or unit price may be at a discount or premium to the asset value. However, because of the exchange-traded fund structure, it is expected that a significant discount or premium of price to asset value will not be sustainable over the long term. Any projections or examples (including calculations used therein) are for illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be accurate or complete. You should note that shares or units may only be redeemed directly from the Funds by persons or entities registered as participating dealers in very large redemption sizes. Listing of the shares or units of the Funds does not guarantee a liquid market for them.
Where a Fund's investment objective is to track an index, the Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by the relevant index provider. None of these companies make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Funds.
Important information about the Funds is contained in the prospectus for the Funds which is available upon request from BlackRock. BEFORE ACQUIRING THE SHARES OR UNITS OF ANY FUNDS BY PURCHASE OR EXCHANGE, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO READ THE FUNDS’ PROSPECTUS OR OFFERING MATERIALS.

	Dear Shareholders,



	I am pleased to say that despite an increasing swell of challenges, China Mobile has delivered promising results in the first half of 2016, affirming that we
	are indeed pursuing the correct strategy. This has been driven by our ongoing focus on innovation in all aspects of operation, as well as a business transformation towards value creation. This is a laudable achievement given that we are going
	through a period of rapid change where the industry is witnessing further integration and layers of complexity added to the competitive landscape. It has in turn created short- term operating pressures and more risk around those developments slated
	for the longer-term. However, China Mobile has made steady progress in the 4G, data traffic, wireline broadband and digital services business lines, delivering an outstanding overall performance in the period.

	Chairmans Statement



	 




	OPERATING RESULTS



	China Mobile has achieved encouraging growth both in terms of revenue and profit for the first half of 2016. The downward trend in revenue growth in
	telecommunications services that has been seen in recent years has been corrected, and the Company has once again beaten the average industry growth, underlining our market leading position.


	Compared to the same period of the year before, operating revenue increased by 7.1% to RMB370.4 billion, within which, revenue from telecommunications
	services accounted for RMB325.4 billion, up by 6.9%. We generated the largest operating revenue in the first half of 2016 amongst our industry peers, which is in line with our leading position in the market. EBITDA increased by 2.9% to RMB134.4
	billion. Our profitability also outperformed our industry peers, with profit attributable to equity shareholders reaching RMB60.6 billion, representing an increase of 5.6%.


	After considering the operating results in the first half of 2016 as well as the need for sustainable future development, the Board has declared payment of an
	interim dividend of HK$1.489 per share, according to the planned full year dividend payout ratio.


	The Board believes that the industry-leading
	profitability and the ability to generate healthy cash flow will provide substantial support for the Companys future development and provide good returns for our shareholders.





	MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN 4G



	In the first half of 2016, the Company maintained its competitive advantage in 4G business and of particular note was that we conducted the timely launch of
	the high quality 4G premium network, ahead of our market peers.


	We continued to enhance the stability, coverage and strength of our 4G network to ensure
	good customer experience at the core of our services. We added over 200,000 4G base stations, increasing the total number of 4G base stations to 1.32 million. Our 4G network has now been expanded to cover more indoor areas in a larger number of
	places. The strength of the network was enhanced by the launch of high quality VoLTE (Voice over LTE) in nearly 300 cities across the country. The application of Carrier Aggregation has also been rolled out in over 300 cities.


	Leveraging its strong existing network, China Mobile has focused its promotional efforts towards 4G upgrades and this campaign has successfully attracted a
	significant number of 2G/3G customers. In the first half of 2016, the monthly average net increase of 4G customers was over 19 million, pushing the total number of 4G customers to 429 million. 4G penetration rate of our mobile customers
	attained 51.2% while the Net Promoter Score, which measures the likelihood of customer recommendation, is industry-leading. In addition, the accelerated development of 4G capability and the level of adoption has brought growth in both data traffic
	and customer spending. During the period, 4G network handset data traffic as a percentage of the total handset data traffic increased to 88.0%. 4G DOU has increased by 31.9%, driving the growth in mobile ARPU. Data traffic reached a record-high
	level during the period.

	However, we cannot rest on our laurels in this strategically important area for our customers, our Company and
	our industry. We are sure to see increased 4G competition as a number of rival providers are collaborating in network expansion and increasing marketing efforts. Taking all these into perspective, the Company has planned to maintain what we deem
	sufficient levels of marketing expense in 4G for the rest of 2016 in order to maintain our lead in the market.



	DATA TRAFFIC REACHES A NEW MILESTONE



	During this reporting period, wireless data traffic revenue has for the first time exceeded traditional business (including voice and SMS/MMS) and is
	now notably the biggest revenue source for China Mobile.


	Internet access is becoming an indispensable commodity but at the same time the catalyst for
	economic and social development, driving up demand for a wider range of information services. For the Company, this clearly means growth opportunities, but also the need for continued service improvement and a relentless focus on customer
	experience. During the first half of the year the Company has been exploring this dual agenda of increasing the value of its data traffic business while meeting community and end- user needs better. This focused effort managed to successfully
	generate growth in both volume and revenue from data traffic.




	Leveraging our innovative operating model, offering a bigger range of products and supplying our data services
	to an ever-expanding customer base, China Mobile has been able to find a balance between charging lower fees, generating higher traffic volumes and still keeping the value of our services. The data traffic business performed strongly in the first
	half of 2016. Handset data traffic increased by 133.9% year-on-year, while wireless data traffic revenue increased by 39.7%, rising to 43.3% of the total telecommunications services revenue.


	There will be some challenges in data services that we are very aware of, in particular traffic profitability and growth bottleneck. Our future strategy will
	be a continued focus on data traffic business through enriching our service offerings and maximising the value of our services in order to boost revenue as far as possible from information services. Sustaining the success in data services will be a
	bedrock for China Mobile, while at the same time allowing the Company to transform to higher-value business areas in the future.

	HIGH QUALITY WIRELINE BROADBAND



	Chinas goal of becoming a Cyberpower has created huge development potential in the communications industry. The Company is exploring ways of
	sharpening its edge in wireline broadband that provides synergies with the other business lines, and improving our full service capacity. In the first half of 2016, China Mobile has seen a satisfactory level of growth in the number of wireline
	broadband customers, with a net increase of 10.81 million and the total number of customers reaching 65.84 million. The broadband business line is starting to show its value potential.


	China Mobile adopted the high-end approach to the development of its wireline broadband business, with an aim to grow our capability in household digital
	services. Emphasising our brand values, our key products will provide a minimum bandwidth of over 50M as standard, giving premium quality to our customers. We truly believe that our approach will promote strong and sustainable development of the
	wireline broadband business, hence benefiting the industry as a whole.


	In the second half of 2016, the Company will work on developing a smart home
	gateway under the China Mobile brand. This will be a crucial step in structuring our household digital service offerings and smart home product development plan. We see that there is significant potential in this area and China Mobile should work on
	obtaining a market leading position.





	PROACTIVELY EXPANDING DIGITAL SERVICES



	The Chinese governments Internet+ initiative, which aims to integrate the Internet with a range of traditional businesses in order to
	generate new opportunities, is another area of potential development for the communications industry. The Company has focused on building connections with corporate customers in the ICT (information and communication technology) market. We supported
	the growth of the businesses by helping them build out their information systems and facilitating the application of these developments in their industries. In the first half of 2016, we served over 3 million corporate customers.
	Telecommunications and informatisation services saw high growth in revenue, with IDC (Internet Data Centres) and data dedicated line revenue growing by 65.9% and 47.7% respectively. Revenue from corporate telecommunications and informatisation
	services equates to approximately one-third of the total market in China.

	Chairmans Statement



	 



	Our digital services are still at an early stage of development and more effort will be needed to drive new
	products and further strengthen our capabilities. Our business arms that are specialising in the development of designated professional services and emerging innovations have been making progress in the areas of mobile Internet, IoT (Internet of
	Things), cloud computing and big data. This is with a view to creating more synergy between our cloud resources and existing applications, while deepening our strength in data analytics and big data applications in order to uncover new sources of
	revenue growth. In the first half of 2016 we had over 80 million connections to the IoT. We would expect to see this number grow further during the rest of the year.


	We understand the importance of building up our own capability and streamlining our own systems. In response to the governments policy in promoting mass
	entrepreneurship and innovation, the Company encourages employees to participate in internal innovation incubators. Our professional business arms mentioned above and R&D centres are the core elements of this innovative drive, which will be
	focused on enhancing our core capabilities and product range. We will continue to implement necessary organisational and system reforms to promote technology and business innovation that is driven by market needs.




	We recognised the huge potential, both now and in the future, of mobile Internet and industrial IoT businesses
	and planned to establish an open source platform for external developers from different industries to share their innovation with end users. Internally this will benefit us as it will pool substantial industry resources on our platform, and enable
	vertical integration of technology developers and end customers to create a well-balanced business ecosystem.



	REGULATORY POLICIES



	The Company has rolled out a number of measures since the second half of 2015 in response to the speed upgrade and tariff reduction regulatory
	initiative. Some of the key considerations expressed by the government when formulating regulatory policies are the lowering of tariffs and upgrade of networks. This will be carried out primarily through promoting healthy market competition while
	working to encourage industry players to improve their efficiency, all with the ultimate result of driving economic growth.


	We will maintain regular
	communications with the regulators on the anticipated cancellation of long- distance and roaming tariffs. We will be proactive in meeting public expectation by migrating voice call tariff plans to flat rate packages and adjusting the tariffs in a
	balanced and orderly manner to satisfy market demand. This will also serve to enhance our competitiveness and speed up our transformation further up the value chain. We are keen to share our technology and network advancement with our customers and
	find the sweet spot between their needs and our short and long-term development plans.

	In addition, we are fully aware of the recent regulatory developments including the license granted to China
	Broadcasting Network, and the permissions to refarm the 2G/3G spectrums provided to some operators. We will closely monitor these ongoing developments and ensure that we grow in accordance with the industry regulations as well as meeting our
	responsibility to actively cultivate a sustainable ecosystem for the entire industry to prosper.



	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY



	Good corporate governance is one of the key elements of our continuing success. We endeavour to establish a sound and transparent governance system
	and continue to improve it to ensure consistent high levels of corporate governance throughout the business. We value effective two-way communications with the investment community to ensure clarity and mutual understanding. Our effort and
	commitment towards corporate governance and quality management has earned us a rise in the Forbes Global 2000 list this year from 20th to 18th position.


	We are fully committed to our social responsibility while continuing to provide quality products and services for all of our customers. China Mobile has been
	proudly involved with a range of social initiatives that include working towards narrowing the digital gap, safeguarding emergency communications, caring for the underprivileged, enhancing information security, as well as energy saving and emission
	reduction. Our efforts in the community have been widely recognised.





	FULL YEAR OUTLOOK



	This is a milestone year for the implementation of our Big Connectivity strategy that sees the Company expanding its connection to the Internet of Everything,
	and is therefore crucial in our fundamental shift of business focus to capturing future growth. We remain committed to expanding our network, furthering connectivity scale, optimising services and strengthening applications within our network as we
	lay the foundations for the next stage of development of China Mobile.


	The results show that we have experienced a good first half of 2016. However,
	competition around 4G business, the continued expansion of Internet companies into the communications industry, new regulatory policies and our change of business focus will all pose risks to our existing operations. The management knows that they
	must concentrate efforts on these areas by speeding up the business transformation in order to capture first-mover advantage in the emerging areas and always be on the front foot when it comes to the development of the Company.

	Our current strategy has the dual aspects of consolidation and future growth. For consolidation, we will be
	further building on our 4G advantages and increasing our 4G customers proportion. Our high- end approach with regards to wireline broadband will be maintained. We will challenge ourselves to obtain a one-third market share in the ICT business
	through expansion of our corporate customer base. In terms of future growth, we will take a longer-term perspective, looking towards our digital services and increasing the revenue by understanding the important role that this business line will
	play for the Company in the future.


	As we have always done, we will take a level-headed approach to market competition. We truly believe that reasonable
	competition benefits the wider development of the industry, and that the sustainable growth of individual companies relies on the health of the whole. We will mainly compete through enhancing the value of our existing customers and maintaining our
	focus on the furthering of the communications industry for mutual benefit. Our ultimate goal is to strike a balance between the interests of our customers, our shareholders and the public, as well as regulatory requirements when we are striving to
	meet our short-term goals and formulating long-term plans.


	For the rest of 2016, we remain committed to creating value for our shareholders and
	strengthening our market position to ensure that we maintain our lead in terms of profitability when compared to our peers.




	Dr. Lo Ka Shui resigned from the position of independent non-executive director in May 2016 after serving
	the Board for 15 years. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Lo for his invaluable contribution to the Company over the years.


	Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Board members and colleagues for their remarkable dedication. We have achieved encouraging results in the first half
	of 2016 and I look forward to working closely with all of them to create more success for our customers, shareholders and community in the period ahead.

	CAPITAL EXPENDITURE



	In order to further consolidate its
	leading advantages in 4G networks and effectively support the rapid development of its data traffic business, the Group actively promoted the optimization of 4G network infrastructure, improved its network quality and optimized its investment
	directions in order to ensure investment effectiveness. In the first half of 2016, the Groups capital expenditure was RMB83.0 billion, representing 25.5% of revenue from telecommunications services, of which RMB46.2 billion was invested in 4G
	networks, funded primarily by cash generated from operations.

	China Mobile Limited (the Company) was incorporated in
	the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong) of the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC) on 3 September 1997. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the
	Group) are the provision of telecommunications and related services in Mainland China and in Hong Kong (For the purpose of preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information, Mainland China refers to the PRC
	excluding Hong Kong, Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan). The Companys immediate holding company is China Mobile Hong Kong (BVI) Limited (incorporated in British Virgin Islands), and the Companys ultimate holding company is
	China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC). The address of the Companys registered office is 60th Floor, The Center, 99 Queens Road Central, Hong Kong.


	The shares of the Company were listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 23 October 1997 and the American Depositary Shares of
	the Company were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 22


	October 1997.


	The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information was approved for issuance on 11 August 2016.


	The Groups condensed consolidated interim financial information is unaudited, but has been reviewed by the Companys Audit
	Committee. The condensed consolidated interim financial information has also been reviewed by the Companys independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
	Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA). PwCs unmodified independent review report to the
	board of directors is included on pages 38 to 39 of this interim report.


	The financial information relating to the year ended
	31 December 2015 that is included in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2016 as comparative information does not constitute the Companys statutory annual consolidated
	financial statements for that year but is derived from those financial statements. Further information relating to these statutory financial statements required to be disclosed in accordance with section 436 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance
	(Cap. 622) is as follows:

	section 662(3) of, and Part 3 of Schedule 6 to, the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622).


	The Companys auditor has reported on
	those financial statements. The auditors report was unqualified; did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report; and did not contain a statement under sections

	BASIS OF PREPARATION





	The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information
	for the six months ended 30 June 2016 has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim financial reporting, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
	(IASB). IAS 34 is consistent with Hong Kong Accounting Standard (HKAS) 34, Interim financial reporting, issued by HKICPA and accordingly this unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information is also
	prepared in accordance with HKAS 34.


	The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information in conformity
	with IAS/HKAS 34 requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses on a year-to- date basis. Actual results may differ from
	these estimates.


	The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the Groups
	annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Groups policies on financial risk management were set out in the financial statements included in the Companys 2015 Annual Report and there have been no
	significant changes in the financial risk management policies for the six months ended 30 June 2016.


	The Groups unaudited
	condensed consolidated interim financial information contains explanations of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and performance of the Group since the annual financial statements
	for the year ended 31 December 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information does not include all of the information required for a full set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial
	Reporting Standards (IFRSs) or Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs).

	Acquisition of Target Assets and Businesses from China Tietong




	Telecommunications Corporation



	On 27 November 2015, China Mobile TieTong Company Limited (CM TieTong), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into
	an acquisition agreement with China Tietong Telecommunications Corporation (TieTong), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CMCC, under which CM TieTong has agreed to acquire, and TieTong has agreed to sell, certain assets, businesses and related
	liabilities as well as its related employees in relation to the fixed-line telecommunications operations (Target Assets and Businesses). The final consideration for the acquisition of the Target Assets and Businesses based on the
	acquisition agreement was RMB31,967,000,000. The acquisition was completed on 31 December 2015.


	The acquisition of the Target Assets
	and Businesses was considered as a business combination under common control as CM TieTong and the Target Assets and Businesses are both ultimately controlled by CMCC.


	Under IFRSs and HKFRSs, the acquisition of the Target Assets and Businesses was accounted for using merger accounting in accordance with the
	Accounting Guideline 5 Merger Accounting for Common Control Combinations (AG 5) issued by HKICPA. Accordingly, the acquired Target Assets and Businesses are stated at predecessor values, and were included in the unaudited
	condensed consolidated interim financial information from the beginning of the earliest period presented as if the Target Assets and Businesses acquired had always been part of the Group. As a result, the Group has restated the comparative amounts
	of the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the six months ended 30 June 2015 by including the operating results of Target Assets and Businesses and eliminating its transactions with the Target Assets and
	Businesses.


	The details of the acquisition and the reconciliation of the effect arising from the common control combination in connection
	with the acquisition of Target Assets and Businesses were set out in the financial statements included in the Companys 2015 Annual Report.

	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Except as described below, the accounting policies
	applied in the preparation of this unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.


	The following amended and annual improved standards are mandatory for the first time for the Groups financial year beginning
	1 January 2016 and are applicable for the Group:


	Amendment to IFRS/HKFRS 11, Joint Arrangements Amendment to IAS/HKAS 16,
	Property, Plant and Equipment Amendment to IAS/HKAS 38, Intangible Assets


	Amendment to IFRS/HKFRS 10,
	Consolidated Financial Statements


	Amendment to IAS/HKAS 27, Separate Financial Statements


	Annual Improvement to IFRSs/HKFRSs 2012-2014 cycle


	The adoption of the above amended standards did not have any significant impact on the Groups unaudited condensed consolidated interim
	financial information.


	In addition, the IASB and HKICPA also published a number of new standards and amendments to standards which are
	effective for the financial year beginning after 1 January 2016 and have not been early adopted by the Group. Management is assessing the impact of such new standards and amendments to standards and will adopt the relevant standards and
	amendments to standards in the subsequent periods as required.


	 





	4




	SEGMENT REPORTING





	An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in
	business activities from which the Group may earn revenue and incur expenses, and is identified on the basis of the internal financial reports that are provided to and regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker (the
	CODM) in order to allocate resource and assess performance of the segment. The CODM has been identified as the Executive Directors of the Company. For the periods presented, the Group as a whole is an operating segment since the Group is
	only engaged in telecommunications and related businesses. No geographical information has been disclosed as the majority of the Groups operating activities are carried out in Mainland China. The Groups assets located and operating
	revenue derived from activities outside Mainland China are less than 5% of the Groups assets and operating revenue, respectively.

	The fair values of interest in SPD Bank, IFLYTEK and True Corporation are based on quoted market prices (level
	1: quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets) at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs. As at 30 June 2016, the fair values of interest in IFLYTEK and True Corporation were above their carrying amount. As at
	30 June 2016, the fair value of investment in SPD Bank was RMB63,896,000,000 (as at 31 December 2015: RMB68,160,000,000), below its carrying amount by approximately 6.3% (as at 31 December 2015: exceeding by approximately 2.6%). Since
	the decline in the fair value of investment in SPD Bank is not significant or prolonged, there was no objective evidence of impairment as at 30 June 2016.


	The management has determined that there was no impairment indicator of the Groups interests in other associates as at 30 June 2016
	and 31 December 2015.


	In 2015, China Mobile Communication Co., Ltd. (CMC), together with State Development &
	Investment Corporation and China Mobile State Development & Investment Management Company Limited (45% of its registered capital is owned by CMCC), established China Mobile Innovative Business Fund (Shenzhen) Partnership (Limited
	Partnership) (the Fund). CMC committed to invest RMB1,500,000,000 in cash, which represents 58.8% equity interest in the Fund. As at 30 June 2016, CMC has contributed RMB721,000,000 to the Fund and has a commitment to invest
	RMB779,000,000 to the Fund upon the request by the Fund.


	There are no contingent liabilities relating to the Groups interest in the
	joint ventures.

	PROCEEDS RECEIVABLE FOR THE TRANSFER OF TOWER ASSETS





	On 31 October 2015, CMC
	completed the transfer of its telecommunications towers and related assets (Tower Assets) to China Tower. In return, China Tower issued 45,151,000,000 equity shares at a par value of RMB1 per share to CMC. In addition, China Tower shall
	pay CMC the remaining cash consideration of RMB57,585,000,000, within which China Tower has made the first payment of RMB5,000,000,000 in February 2016. The remaining balance of cash consideration amounting to RMB52,585,000,000 is deferred and to be
	settled before 31 December 2017. In addition, China Tower will pay interest associated with the unpaid cash consideration to CMC from 1 November 2015 at a pre-determined interest rate, which is 90% of the financial institutions one
	year benchmark lending rate announced by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) on the completion date of the transaction, i.e. 31 October 2015.


	The details of the transfer of Tower Assets were set out in the financial statements included in the


	Companys 2015 Annual Report.


	On 8 July 2016, CMC and China Tower finalised the leasing and pricing arrangement in relation to the lease of telecommunications towers
	and related assets, and entered into an agreement accordingly (the Lease Agreement). Pursuant to the Lease Agreement which covers a period of five years, the respective provincial companies of CMC and China Tower will enter into
	provincial company service agreements for the leasing of individual tower based on their actual service requirements.

	Transactions with other government-related entities in the PRC





	The Group is a
	government-related enterprise and operates in an economic regime currently dominated by entities directly or indirectly controlled by the PRC government through government authorities, agencies, affiliations and other organisation (collectively
	referred to as government- related entities).


	Apart from transactions with CMCC Group (note 17 and 24(a)) and associates (note
	24(c)) and the transaction to establish the Fund (note 12), the Group has collectively, but not individually, significant transactions with other government-related entities which include but not limited to the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	rendering and receiving telecommunications services, including interconnection revenue/charges

	


	 


	placing of bank deposits




	These transactions are conducted in the ordinary course of the
	Groups business on terms comparable to the terms of transactions with other entities that are not government-related. The Group prices its telecommunications services and products in accordance with rules and regulations stipulated by related
	authorities of the PRC Government, where applicable, or based on commercial negotiations. The Group has also established its procurement policies and approval processes for purchases of products and services, which do not depend on whether the
	counterparties are government-related entities or not.

	INTRODUCTION



	We have reviewed the condensed interim
	financial information set out on pages 11 to 37, which comprises the condensed consolidated balance sheet of China Mobile Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) as at 30 June 2016 and the
	related condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the six-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The Rules Governing the Listing of
	Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited require the preparation of a report on interim financial information to be in compliance with the relevant provisions thereof, and to be in compliance with either International Accounting
	Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board or Hong Kong Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (HKAS 34) issued by the Hong Kong
	Institute of Certified Public Accountants, depending on whether the issuers annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) or Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards
	(HKFRSs) respectively. As the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with both IFRSs and HKFRSs, the directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim financial
	information in accordance with both IAS 34 and HKAS 34. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information based on our review and to report our conclusion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with our agreed
	terms of engagement and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.



	SCOPE OF REVIEW



	We conducted our review in accordance
	with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
	financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
	accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

	CONCLUSION



	Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial information is not prepared, in all material
	respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and Hong Kong Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

	Pursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China (the Enterprise Income Tax Law), the Detailed
	Rules for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China and the Notice regarding Matters on Determination of Tax Residence Status of Chinese-controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises under
	Rules of Effective Management, the Company is required to withhold and pay 10 per cent. enterprise income tax on the distribution of the 2016 Interim Dividend to its non-resident enterprise shareholders. The withholding and payment
	obligation lies with the Company. In respect of all shareholders whose names appear on the Companys register of members as at the Record Date who are not individuals (including HKSCC Nominees Limited (HKSCC), corporate nominees or
	trustees such as securities companies and banks, and other entities or organizations, which are all considered as non-resident enterprise shareholders), the Company will distribute the 2016 Interim Dividend after deducting enterprise income tax of
	10 per cent. The Company will not withhold and pay the income tax in respect of the 2016 Interim Dividend payable to any natural person shareholders whose names appear on the Companys register of members as at the Record Date. Investors
	who invest in the shares in the Company listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange through the Shanghai Stock Exchange (the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect investors) are investors who hold shares through HKSCC and in accordance with the above
	requirements, the Company will pay to HKSCC the amount of the 2016 Interim Dividend after withholding for payment the 10 per cent. enterprise income tax.


	If any resident enterprise (as defined in the Enterprise Income Tax Law) listed on the Companys register of members which is duly incorporated in the
	PRC or under the laws of a foreign country (or a region) but with a PRC-based de facto management body, does not desire to have the Company withhold and pay the said 10 per cent. enterprise income tax, it shall lodge with Hong Kong Registrars
	Limited documents from its governing tax authority confirming that the Company is not required to withhold and pay enterprise income tax in respect of the dividend to which it is entitled at or before 4:30 p.m. on Friday, 2 September 2016.


	If anyone would like to change the identity of the holders in the register of members, please enquire about the relevant procedures with the nominees or
	trustees. The Company will withhold for payment of the enterprise income tax for its non-resident enterprise shareholders strictly in accordance with the relevant laws and requirements of the relevant government departments and adhere strictly to
	the information set out in the Companys register of members on the Record Date. The Company assumes no liability whatsoever in respect of and will not entertain any claims arising from any delay in, or inaccurate determination of, the status
	of the shareholders or any disputes over the mechanism of withholding.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Product Details
The BLDRS Asia 50 ADR Index Fund (Fund) seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the price and yield performance  of the BNY Mellon Asia 50 ADR Index (Index). The Fund normally holds at least 95% of its total assets in depositary receipts (DR) that comprise the Index. The Index is capitalization-weighted and designed to track the performance of approximately 50 Asian market-based DRs. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.
The Fund is an "index fund" that holds publicly traded DRs, negotiable U.S. securities that generally represent a non-U.S. company's publicly traded equity or debt, of non-U.S. companies in a particular geographic region or market represented by a specified relevant benchmark BNY Mellon ADR Index.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as a direct investment in foreign securities, and issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. The Fund may invest in foreign markets and because foreign exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the non-US securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or sell your shares. The Fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.  The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to terminate and liquidate the Fund – See "Termination of a Fund" in the prospectus for further information. In the event the Fund is terminated, the trading pattern of the Fund's Shares could be negatively affected. The economies of the countries in the Asia Pacific region are largely intertwined, if an economic recession is experienced by any of these countries, it will likely adversely impact the economic performance of other countries in the region. The MSCI Pacific Index and the MSCI EAFE® Index are unmanaged indexes considered representative of the developed markets in the Pacific region; and stocks of Europe, Australasia and the Far East, respectively. These indexes are computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of the US stock market. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.
