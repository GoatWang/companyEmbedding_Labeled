1 (one, also called unit, unity, and (multiplicative) identity) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement. For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1. It is also the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by 2.

Etymology[edit]
The word one can be used as a noun, an adjective and a pronoun.[1]
It comes from the English word an,[1] which comes from the Proto-Germanic root *ainaz.[1] The Proto-Germanic root *ainaz comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *oi-no-.[1]
Compare the Proto-Germanic root *ainaz to Old Frisian an, Gothic ains, Danish een, Dutch een, German eins and Old Norse einn.
Compare the Proto-Indo-European root *oi-no- (which means one, single[1]) to Greek oinos (which means "ace" on dice[1]), Latin unus (one[1]), Old Persian aivam, Old Church Slavonic -inu and ino-, Lithuanian vienas, Old Irish oin and Breton un (one[1]).
As a number[edit]
One, sometimes referred to as unity,[2] is the first non-zero natural number. It is thus the integer before two and after zero, and the first positive odd number.
Any number multiplied by one remains that number, as one is the identity for multiplication. As a result, 1 is its own factorial, its own square, its own cube, and so on. One is also the result of the empty product, as any number multiplied by one is itself. It is also the only natural number that is neither composite nor prime with respect to division, but instead considered a unit.
As a digit[edit]







The glyph used today in the Western world to represent the number 1, a vertical line, often with a serif at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom, traces its roots back to the Indians, who wrote 1 as a horizontal line, much like the Chinese character 一. The Gupta wrote it as a curved line, and the Nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a quarter turn to the right, this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the Gujarati and Punjabi scripts). The Nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small.[3] This eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral, but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the Roman numeral I. In some countries, the little serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke, sometimes as long as the vertical line, which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries. Where the 1 is written with a long upstroke, the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line.
While the shape of the 1 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures, the character usually is of x-height, as, for example, in .

Many older typewriters do not have a separate symbol for 1 and use the lowercase letter l instead. It is possible to find cases when the uppercase J is used, while it may be for decorative purposes.
Mathematics[edit]
Mathematically, 1 is:

in arithmetic (algebra) and calculus, the natural number that follows 0 and precedes 2 and the multiplicative identity element of the integers, real numbers and complex numbers;
more generally, in algebra, the multiplicative identity (also called unity), usually of a group or a ring.

Tallying is often referred to as "base 1", since only one mark — the tally itself — is needed. This is more formally referred to as a unary numeral system. Unlike base 2 or base 10, this is not a positional notation.
Since the base 1 exponential function (1x) always equals 1, its inverse does not exist (which would be called the logarithm base 1 if it did exist).
There are two ways to write the real number 1 as a recurring decimal: as 1.000..., and as 0.999....
Formalizations of the natural numbers have their own representations of 1:

in the Peano axioms, 1 is the successor of 0;
in Principia Mathematica, 1 is defined as the set of all singletons (sets with one element);
in the Von Neumann cardinal assignment of natural numbers, 1 is defined as the set {0}.

In a multiplicative group or monoid, the identity element is sometimes denoted 1, but e (from the German Einheit, "unity") is also traditional. However, 1 is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring, i.e., when an addition and 0 are also present. When such a ring has characteristic n not equal to 0, the element called 1 has the property that n1 = 1n = 0 (where this 0 is the additive identity of the ring). Important examples are finite fields.
1 is the first figurate number of every kind, such as triangular number, pentagonal number and centered hexagonal number, to name just a few.
In many mathematical and engineering problems, numeric values are typically normalized to fall within the unit interval from 0 to 1, where 1 usually represents the maximum possible value in the range of parameters. Likewise, vectors are often normalized to give unit vectors, that is vectors of magnitude one, because these often have more desirable properties. Functions, too, are often normalized by the condition that they have integral one, maximum value one, or square integral one, depending on the application.
Because of the multiplicative identity, if f(x) is a multiplicative function, then f(1) must equal 1.
It is also the first and second number in the Fibonacci sequence (0 is the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences.
1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number, but a unit, like −1 and, in the Gaussian integers, i and −i. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees unique factorization over the integers only up to units. (For example, 4 = 22, but if units are included, is also equal to, say, (−1)6 × 123 × 22, among infinitely many similar "factorizations".)
The definition of a field requires that 1 must not be equal to 0. Thus, there are no fields of characteristic 1. Nevertheless, abstract algebra can consider the field with one element, which is not a singleton and is not a set at all.
1 is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer (whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers, composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers, and zero is divisible by all positive integers). 1 was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians, using the definition that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself. However, this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, so modern definitions exclude units.
By definition, 1 is the magnitude, absolute value, or norm of a unit complex number, unit vector, and a unit matrix (more usually called an identity matrix). Note that the term unit matrix is sometimes used to mean something quite different.
By definition, 1 is the probability of an event that is almost certain to occur.
1 is the most common leading digit in many sets of data, a consequence of Benford's law.
1 is the only known Tamagawa number for a simply connected algebraic group over a number field.
The generating function that has all coefficients 1 is given by

1/1 − x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + …

This power series converges and has finite value if and only if, |x| < 1.
In category theory, 1 is sometimes used to denote the terminal object of a category.

The Roman numeral I often stands for the first-discovered satellite of a planet or minor planet (such as Neptune I, a.k.a. Triton). For some earlier discoveries, the Roman numerals originally reflected the increasing distance from the primary instead.

In philosophy[edit]
In the philosophy of Plotinus and a number of other neoplatonists, The One is the ultimate reality and source of all existence. Philo of Alexandria (20 BC – AD 50) regarded the number one as God's number, and the basis for all numbers ("De Allegoriis Legum," ii.12 [i.66]).

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Oi S.A. (the "Company"), in accordance with Art. 157, paragraph 4 of Law No. 6,404/76 (the "Brazilian Corporations Law") informs its shareholders and the market in general that, on this date, in conjunction with its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, Oi Movel S.A., Telemar Norte Leste S.A., Copart 4 Participacoes S.A, Copart 5 Participacoes S.A., Portugal Telecom International Finance BV and Oi Brasil Holdings Cooperatief U.A. (the "Oi Companies"), filed a request for judicial reorganization of the Oi Companies with the Court of the State of Rio de Janeiro, pursuant to Art. 51 of Law No. 11,101/05 and Art. 122 of the Brazilian Corporations Law, pursuant to an urgent measure approved by the Company's Board of Directors and the other authorized governing bodies of the Oi Companies at meetings held on this date.


As previously announced, the Oi Companies, together with their financial and legal advisors, are conducting efforts and studies to optimize their liquidity and indebtedness profile. The Company, together with its legal and financial advisors, also negotiated with its creditors and with Moelis & Company, a financial advisor to a group of bond holders, seeking mutual agreement as to the consensual restructuring of the Oi Companies' indebtedness and to strengthen their capital structure.
However, considering the challenges of the Oi Companies' economic and financial situation in connection with the maturity schedule of their financial debts, the threats to the assets of the Oi Companies represented by imminent attachments or freezings in judicial lawsuits and the urgent need to adopt measures that protect the Oi Companies, the Company decided that filing for judicial reorganization would be the most appropriate course of action at this time to (i) preserve the continuity of its offering of quality services to its customers, within the rules and commitments undertaken with the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency - ANATEL, (ii) preserve the value of the Oi Companies, (iii) maintain the continuity of operations and corporate activities in an organized manner that protects the interests of the Oi Companies and their subsidiaries, their customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, and (iv) protect the Oi Companies' cash and cash equivalents.
The request for judicial reorganization was filed due to challenges confronted by the Company's management in finding a viable alternative with its creditors that enables the Company to achieve the abovementioned purposes, and to adequately protect the Oi Companies against creditors while preserving the continuity of the Oi Companies' operations. The total claims of persons not controlled by Oi listed in documents filed with the request for judicial reorganization total, on this date, approximately R$65.4 billion. The Management of the Oi Companies intends to take all necessary measures and take the necessary actions in all appropriate jurisdictions to guarantee the effectiveness of this request for judicial reorganization.
The filing of the request for judicial recovery is another step towards the Company's financial restructuring, and the Company will continue working to secure new customers while maintaining its service and product sales to all market segments, in all of its distribution and customer service channels. Installation, maintenance and repair will also continue to be promptly carried out. The Company's entire workforce will maintain normal operations, continuing all commercial, operating and administrative activities. The Company maintains its focus on investing in structural projects that aim to promote quality customer service and to continue bringing technological advances, high-standard services and innovations to its clients.
General Meeting and Documents Available to Shareholders and the Market
The request for judicial reorganization will be submitted to a Company's General Shareholders' Meeting resolution, the call of which was approved on this date by the Board of Directors. The documents required under the Brazilian Corporations Law and by CVM norms applicable to this Material Fact's subject matter, including the petition through which the request for judicial reorganization was filed, are available to the Company's shareholders at the Company's headquarters and its website (www.oi.com.br/ri). Copies of these materials are also available on the CVM's Sistema Empresas.NET (www.cvm.gov.br), as well as the BM&FBovespa's website (www.bmfbovespa.com.br), and English-language translations of these materials will be furnished as soon as possible to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 6-K.  
Maintenance of the Company's Current Management and Other Information
There are no expected alterations to the management or staff structure of the Oi Companies during the judicial reorganization process, and if the request is accepted, all labor obligations and benefits will be maintained as usual. The Oi Companies expect that their operations will follow their natural course pursuant to industry dynamics, the macroeconomic environment and the businesses' strategic direction. The Company team will maintain its operational focus on the achievement of budgeted planned projects and the pursuit of goals planned for 2016. 
The Company reinforces its confidence in its operational and commercial capacities to successfully obtain approval for a judicial reorganization plan that will create value for the Company, as well as to maintain its high level customer service.  
The Company will keep its shareholders and the market informed about the development of the issues disclosed in this Material Fact, and will timely disclose, according to existing law and regulations, other information regarding the process of the judicial reorganization request.
