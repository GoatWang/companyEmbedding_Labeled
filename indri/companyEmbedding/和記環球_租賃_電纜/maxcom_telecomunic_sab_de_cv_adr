(ADR) (NYSE:MXT) Safeway first-quarter sales fall short, stock plummets (San Jose Mercury News)
Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY)’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations for the first quarter of the year, sending stocks plunging Thursday morning. The company announced sales of less than $10 billion for the first three months of 2013, which was below analyst projections of $10.14 billion and a slight dip from a year ago. News of the weaker sales sent stocks down more than 15 percent in the first hour of trading Thursday.
Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY) profits rose from last year, aided by tax benefits, and the company earned $118.9 million, or 49 cents per share. Excluding tax benefits, per-share earnings were 35 cents, up from $73 million, or 27 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts had predicted 36 cents per share for the first quarter. Regulators close Exide Technologies car battery recycler in Vernon; cite cancer risk, contaminated soil (89.3 KPCC)

Exide Technologies (NASDAQ:XIDE) recycles 22 million car batteries a year at its Vernon plant. The DTSC said Wednesday that it has suspended Exide’s operating permit. Last month, regional air regulators said arsenic in Exide’s emissions has raised cancer risks for people in nearby Maywood, Huntington Park and Boyle Heights. DTSC Director Debbie Raphael says video provided by Exide Technologies (NASDAQ:XIDE) shows that its wastewater pipes are leaking metals and other toxic substances into the ground.

Growth Rate Assumed by Market

			We did a reverse valuation to calculate the growth rate the market is assuming for MXT to be considered fairly valued at its current market price. 
			It's useful to compare this to the growth rate we're assuming for the Growth Price.
		
Future Free Cash Flow Growth Rate

			This is the annual growth rate we've applied to calculate MXT's Free Cash Flow for the next 10 years. 
			To calculate it, we looked at several time periods of the last 10 years. 
			Feel free to adjust it, but we limit the initial growth rate to 20% and slow it down over the years. Otherwise, long-term sustainability issues come into play.
		
Discount Rate

			The discount rate is the annual rate of return an investor requires to take the risk of investing in a single stock. 
			To account for that risk, this should be above 8-10%, as this is the avg. annual rate of return for the S&P500 over the past 100 years.

Very Poor Cash Return on Invested Capital over the past 5 years
	







 
		MXT has failed to generate positive returns on its investments in buildings, projects and equipment. 
				This could be due to poor management, lack of an economic moat or the capital intensive nature of the business.
				MXT has lost $0.62 of cash for every $100 invested.

				MXT operating in a highly competitive industry, or having a weak business in general.
				MXT has generated a $22.91 loss for every $100 of Shareholders' Equity.

Poor Business Performance over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT's inability to produce positive free cash flow for the majority of the past 10 years is concerning. 
				It should be a red flag, since this company does not have a track record of delivering results for shareholders. This could be due to poor management or the nature of its business.
				MXT has been losing money for the majority of the past 10 years.

Strong Balance Sheet








 
		MXT is financially strong with Current Assets covering Total Liabilities.
				It's in a fairly liquid position and dependent on the amount and saleability of any inventory; it may have the financial security to survive an economic downturn.

Low or No Reinvestment of Profits over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT has either been retaining a small amount of their earnings or has done so inconsistently.
				A lack of consistency could be due to MXT operating at a loss or them having such a strong economic moat they feel comfortable spending profits on growth.
				Be wary of future prospects and if applicable, inspect the moat's sustainability.

Loss Making Entity over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT has been unable to maintain profitability. It's Costs of Sales have outstripped Revenue consistently. 
				This is a huge red flag, unless the company has been investing heavily for the future. 
				However, even that is dubious since accurately predicting the future of a company like that is extremely difficult.
				$17.40 of every $100 of Revenue have been a loss, on average over the past 10 years.

Varying Pricing Power over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT has maintained substantial gross margins, suggesting that they have been able to set prices without consideration of the cost of goods sold.
					However, there is a substantial variation in their Gross Profit Margins from year-to-year, which indicates inconsistent performance.
					Look at reasons for this inconsistency to determine the likelihood of future sustainability.
					$59.32 of every $100 worth of sales have been Gross Profit, on average over the past 10 years.

High Capital Intensity over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT spends large amounts of capital buying new equipment or investing in new facilities to stay competitive. 
				Over the long term, those costs may have to be fuelled by debt. 
				Look at the growth of Shareholders' Equity to see if this strategy is having a positive or negative impact.3,356.63% of Profits are being spent on Capital Expenditures, like Property, Plant, & Equipment, required to run the business.

History of Stock Buybacks over the past 10 years
	







 
		MXT has some history of delivering increased value for shareholders in the form of stock buybacks. 
				These have helped improve financial metrics and increase each shareholders' relative ownership stake in the company, due to fewer shares outstanding and holding the same number of shares.
