By more than doubling the raw materials volumes processed at its sawmills, the group has become a leader in the production and sale of sawn timber in Russia.

Segezha Group is a vertically integrated international forest industry holding company that unites the logging and wood processing assets of Sistema JFSC since September 2014. Segezha Group comprises over 50 enterprises in Russia and seven other countries and employs around 10,000 people.

The company is second in Europe for brown kraft paper production and third in the world for total kraft paper production. The company accounts for 12% of the Russian wooden-building construction market and 9% in beams and wooden structures.

          The OIBDA margin was 34.8% for FY 2016 and 36.5% for Q4 2016. OIBDA margin growth was mostly driven by lower provisions for potential disputes with counterparties in relation to power transmission and sales.

        KEY OPERATING RESULTS:
      

          Electricity consumption in 2016 increased 2.2% year-on-year, driven by a rise in the number of new consumers and growth of Bashkortostan's gross regional product.
        

          In 2016, as a result of successful implementation of an investment programme and acceleration of power connections, Bashkirenergo added 24,232 new consumers, 11.3% more than in 2015.
        

          Power losses from distribution grids were flat year-on-year at 8.23%. A 410 MW combined cycle plant commissioned by LLC Novosalavatskaya CHP increased transit power flows between substations of LLC BGC along Bashkirenergo's power lines, leading to a significant increase in load losses. A number of measures to reduce commercial losses from Bashkirenergo's grids helped keep total power losses at virtually the same level as in 2015.
        

        BPGC's CEO and Management Board Chairman Dmitry Sharovatov said:
      

        'In 2016, BPGC achieved strong operating and financial results, thus confirming its status as one of Russia's most efficient electricity grid operators.   
      

        'While OIBDA and net results were affected by one-off provisions for outstanding disputes with counterparties in relation to power transmission and sales in 2015-2016, BPGC's strong performance was primarily due to operational efficiency both in terms of electricity production and implementation of technological policy and in terms of managing business processes.
      

        'The company is continuing to pursue a comprehensive equipment modernisation programme, and to successfully implement innovative solutions to enhance the reliability of power supplies and help reduce power losses.  
      

        'BPGC continues to invest in the construction of new power facilities. In 2016, two major substations, Zubovo and Irek (110 kV) and the 220 kV Gvardeyskaya substation, were commissioned in Ufa. Construction of three major 110kV substations in Bashkortostan is currently underway, with commissioning expected in 2017.'

Please go ahead, sir.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evgeniy Chuikov, Sistema PJSFC - VP, Head of Corporate Communications [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Welcome everyone to Sistema second quarter 2016 results call. On the line with us today we have Mikhail Shamolin, our President and CEO, Vsevolod Rozanov, Senior Vice President and CFO, and myself, Evgeniy Chuikov, Head of Communications.Before we turn to the call, let me remind everyone that we have a presentation accompanying this call on our website and you can find it at sistema.ru. And I will now turn over to Mikhail for his comments. Mikhail, over to you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you all for joining us today. On this call, I would like to provide an update on our progress in three key areas of Sistema's strategic focus, growing the value of our portfolio, strengthening our financial position, and further improving efficiencies at the corporate center, and finally increasing returns for our shareholders.In the second quarter, Sistema's consolidated revenue increased 8% year on year, driven by both new asset acquisitions and organic growth at our portfolio companies. In an environment where many businesses have been scaling back operations or leaving the market, 11 of Sistema's 13 key assets increased revenues year on year. Despite elevated competitive pressure MTS continued to outperform its peers with a revenue growth of 5%, mainly due to stronger retail sales and increased data traffic consumption in Russia and Ukraine. Mobile service revenues in MTS's core market of Russia have been sustained year on year versus declines for our major competitors. That being said, the Company's operating income was impacted negatively by macro factors, weaker mobile service usage and costs associated with the expansion of the retail network.Read MoreIn June we successfully monetized a minority stake in MTS selling 1.45% of the company for $123 million. While MTS remains our strategic asset and we intend to maintain a controlling interest in the company, this transaction will contribute to further diversification of our portfolio and support our investment and deleveraging initiatives. During the quarter, our main growth drivers were once again our non-listed assets. With revenue growth of 7% year-on-year they significantly improved OIBDA, which grew 121% helping sustain Sistema's OIBDA margin of 26% despite the subdued market environment.The contribution of non-public assets to Group's total OIBDA now is 15% compared to 7% in the second quarter of 2015. Our children's goods retailer Detsky Mir posted a 37% increase in revenues with 13% growth in like-for-like sales and two-fold growth of e-commerce sales. The company's OIBDA is up 156% year on year, reflecting good cost discipline. Detsky Mir's strategy to grow its market share in particular by displacing its key competitors has proved highly successful. This year the company plans to open at least 18 new stores, which should bring its total network to over 500 outlets.Our other major investment pulp and paper holding Segezha increased sales across its major product lines which on top of consolidation of a new wood processing plant in Siberia brought its revenue growth to 28% year on year. As an export-driven business with clear cost advantages, Segezha grew its OIBDA by 60% year on year. Segezha continues to add capacity and gain market share in key products by implementing an extensive RUB40 billion CapEx program. Major investments are the modernization and construction of its pulp and paper, paper sack and plywood plants, as well as upgrade to logging equipment.Our agricultural holding Steppe is gaining scale and rapidly being transformed into a multiple contributor to Group revenues and OIBDA with the support of assets acquired in late 2015 and the second quarter of 2016 in open-field crop production, dairy, fruit and vegetable production. Integration of the new businesses is going well and we're seeing solid operational results across the agricultural holding's major assets.This said Steppe's second quarter and six months performance still reflects strong seasonality of this business with most of the revenue to be recognized in the second half of the year. Within our portfolio we continue to work on the merger of SSTL telecom business in India with Reliance Communications. We expect to receive final approvals of the transaction from the Rajasthan and Mumbai courts in September, and according to our schedule we expect also a decision by the Supreme Court of India regarding (technical difficulty) spectrum continuity to be made in October and the final decision regarding approval for the transaction by the Department of Telecommunications in the fourth quarter of this year.Coming to the corporate center, we ended the quarter with a strong cash position of RUB38.8 billion with RUB8.5 billion on top of that in the form of deposits. During the second half of the year, we expect to receive more than RUB35 billion in dividends and cash returns from our subsidiaries, which will further strengthen our financial position and investment resources. Our key areas of focus remain optimization of our liabilities and leverage as well as controlling costs.During the second and third quarters of 2016, in line with our deleveraging plan we repaid debt guaranteed by Sistema at SSTL. We also closed an agreement with the Russian government to restructure its option on SSTL shares, allowing us to acquire the Russian Federation's stake in the Company over the course of five years with a very comfortable payment schedule and interest rate. In August, we exercised an early redemption of our more expensive bonds.As you can see on the slide 7 of our presentation, our deleveraging efforts together with the depreciation of the ruble resulted in the reduction of corporate center's total financial liabilities by 25% year to date. We plan to continue reducing our debt in 2016 and beyond.On the cost control side our performance continues according to plan. In the first half of the year, the corporate center's SG&A were flat year on year while during the second quarter costs were down by 6% year on year.To summarize, we see that financial performance of our portfolio remains strong while our cash-generating capabilities and monetization track record have further strengthened year on year. Together with the reduced leverage and with costs remaining under control, this makes Sistema a much more stable company, which we hope will be reflected in the total shareholder return.Earlier this year, we approved a new dividend policy, which we believe improves transparency around our shareholder returns while also creating a good basis for the growth of the dividend. The policy provides that our minimum dividend per year will be the higher of RUB0.67 per share or a dividend yield of 4% based on the weighted average price of our local shares. It means that any growth in our market cap resulting both from external factors benefiting Sistema or our operational and strategic progress will translate into increased dividend payouts. This mechanism has already begun to work as in August our Board of Directors approved our first interim dividend in accordance with the new policy totaling RUB3.7 billion calculated based on our weighted average share price for the first six months of the year.Finally, I would like to highlight that we continue to move towards strengthening the link between our shareholder return and management compensation. As you know, this year we adopted a new program for senior management to participate in the share capital of Sistema and Group companies. The implementation of the program is going according to plan as this summer our senior team invested over RUB218 million of their personal wealth into Sistema shares. Going forward, our senior executives will continue to invest part of their total annual income into the stock, thus ensuring each of us makes the best decisions aimed at adding value and improving the market cap.I will now hand over the call to one of our fellow co-investors, our CFO, Vsevolod Rozanov for the financial overview.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vsevolod Rozanov, Sistema PJSFC - SVP & CFO [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Mikhail and thank you all for joining us today. In the second quarter Sistema delivered healthy performance as we continued to make good progress in developing our portfolio assets to market-leading businesses, both in terms of scale and efficiency. Our consolidated revenues increased by 8% year on year and 2.2% quarter on quarter to RUB177 billion.The Group's OIBDA increased by 7% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter. The OIBDA margin was 26.1%, remaining substantially flat year on year and improving by 60 basis points quarter on quarter. I would like to reiterate that the sustainability of our OIBDA margins was very much driven by OIBDA of our non-public subsidiaries, which more than doubled year on year reaching RUB7.1 billion in the reporting quarter. The growth was particularly driven by robust growth of Detsky Mir and Segezha as well as significant reduction in the OIBDA loss at MTS Bank.Consolidated sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 11% year on year to RUB38.4 billion, reflecting higher SG&A at MTS and its retail network -- as its retail network continued to grow, as well as the expansion of Detsky Mir's business and consolidation of new assets.At the corporate center level the SG&A expenses remained well under control contracting by 6% year on year to RUB1.8 billion.Capital expenditures at the Group level in the reporting quarter decreased by 24% year on year, largely as a result of budgets and CapEx decrease at MTS and almost zero CapEx at Detsky Mir, which invested heavily last year to develop its logistics infrastructure.And on other subsidiaries, I would like to highlight the CapEx growth of Segezha, which is investing to upgrade and expansion of their production capacities.Now, let me discuss our debt and liquidity positions. As Mikhail mentioned, we are delivering well ahead of our optimization plan. The Group's total debt decreased by 7% in the reporting quarter and by [13%] during the first six months of the year to RUB886 billion. The majority of the Group's borrowing continues to be denominated in rubles with the share of ruble loans at 63%.The corporate center debt decreased by 4% comparing to the end of the first quarter and by 9% during the first six months of the year to RUB106 billion. The majority of the debt at the corporate level is public with ruble bonds and Eurobonds accounting for 62% of that while 38% represented by bank loans and other borrowings.At the end of the second quarter the share of dollar debt remained 37%, the same as in previous quarter. And the reporting quarter will finalize the restructuring of the put option on SSTL shares issued by Sistema to the Russian [stake].According to the agreement signed with the Rosimushchestvo we will acquire Russian Federation's stake in SSTL over the course of five years, with payments made to the budget as per the following proportions, [30% in 2016], 25% in 2017 and 15% in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. We have already paid [60%] of the first installment in July and the rest will be settled by the end of this year. This restructuring has significantly improved our financial position since the majority of the liability, i.e. 70%, was reclassified from short term to long term.Corporate center's total financial liabilities including debt, put option liabilities, and payables to Rosimushchestvo for SSTL shares declined by 25% year to date to approximately RUB151 billion. This decline resulted from the prepayment of SSTL debt, the aforementioned payment to Rosimushchestvo and the early redemption of our local bonds. Having paid the SSTL debt, the Group canceled all the respective guarantees of the corporate center which is in line with our goals of not to provides sureties against obligations of our subsidiaries.We are now confident that we will deliver against our commitment to reduce the corporate center gross financial liabilities by at least 30% in 2016 as we plan to further reduce debt and optimize other liabilities.As of the end of the reporting quarter, our liquidity levels remain comfortable as we have the cash position of RUB38.8 billion excluding additional RUB8.5 billion in deposits, which are expected to be monetized before the end of this year. Together with over RUB35 billion dividend and cash returns to be received in the third and fourth quarters, this positions us well for further deleveraging, increasing payouts to shareholders -- and increasing, sorry, payouts to shareholders and pursuing additional attractive M&A opportunities.As always you can find more detailed information on our debt maturity profile, the Group's financial results and breakdowns by individual companies in the presentation and press release published in our website.Thank you for your attention. I will now hand the call back to Evgeniy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evgeniy Chuikov, Sistema PJSFC - VP, Head of Corporate Communications [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Vsevolod. Operator, we're now ready to answer questions.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Ivan Kim, VTB Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ivan Kim, VTB Capital - Analyst [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Two questions from my side. Firstly, is there any update on potential monetization of SG Trans stake? And secondly do you plan to monetize your 1.7% stake in MTS, whatever it is, maybe in small portions to go back to 50% shareholding and maybe -- if no immediate plans you can probably talk just generally how you see your shareholding in MTS evolving over time? Do you think that you don't require 50% exactly anymore, you can stay a controlling shareholder with less than 50% stake maybe? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evgeniy Chuikov, Sistema PJSFC - VP, Head of Corporate Communications [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. Fair question. On SG Trans we are in very final stages of this transaction. We cannot announce that we closed yet, but we are very, very close. And if everything goes according to plan, you will be able to hear from us very soon.On monetization of MTS stake, no decisions have been made so far and also no decisions and no particular strategy on the rest of our holding in MTS. We're debating right now exactly what our strategy should be. And I think you will hear from us more about this by the end of the year.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie - Analyst [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably pretty much the same question on Detsky Mir. Can you please provide an update on what do you think regarding the IPO of the company? Do you think that now is the good time in the market to place shares and how do you feel about the performance of Detsky Mir and what sort of new plans you can share with us on the asset because it's quite a sizable part of your value? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Detsky Mir, from our perspective, is performing exceptionally well. If you see the growth in both revenue and especially EBITDA numbers, you see that it's very impressive. We believe that spring could be a very good option -- a window for an IPO. And certainly if the environment does not get much worse than it is right now, I think the IPO is likely. And I think if that is the case, we will have an opportunity to monetize part of our holding in Detsky Mir with significant return. So, so far we are pretty happy and we are with our plan to do an IPO.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alexander Vengranovich, Otkritie - Analyst [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. Just a quick follow-up here. As the current market conditions are pretty healthy, [can you please] tell us like what's the reason why you think to postpone the placement from this autumn to spring because the Company is in pretty good shape and even this autumn looks like really good timing for an IPO. I remember previously (multiple speakers) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The answer is very simple because in autumn we're going to be selling on the basis of EBITDA of 2016 and in spring we're going to be selling on the basis of planned EBITDA of 2017 which is going to be obviously higher than 2016 EBITDA. Therefore, we hope to get higher market cap and higher return.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A couple of questions. On MTS Bank I think you're saying in the press release and the presentation about additional recapitalization and subscription is offered to Sistema Group companies. Can you sort of suggest what would be the magnitude of the offering and which subsidiaries will be participating? And also just to understand how long do you think you will be -- I mean, how do you see this performance of [SSTL], how long do you expect to recapitalize it because there have been quite a few in the past couple of years?Second question on Targin, the growth has declined quite bit in quarter. I mean, if you look at year-on-year growth in revenues the rates have declined compared to the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy necessary and the outlook?And finally, if we look at smaller assets, which I think we talk less and less about lately such as Medsi, Binnopharm, Intourist maybe even utility, what is your medium to long-term strategy in those assets? Are you planning to looking to more likely dispose them or you actually trying to come up with some more sensible strategy for growth? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Your first question was on MTS Bank. MTS Bank, we have not yet determined the size of the recapitalization and thus we have not announced those numbers, but the intention clearly is even if this recapitalization will have to take place in 2016, it will be the last recapitalization of MTS Bank. We are not planning to recapitalize any further.MTS Bank now has a decent management team, a decent strategy and decent current performance. MTS Bank right now, if you exclude former provisions and issues with the mostly corporate bad loans, such as (inaudible) and a number of others, it is profitable and its retail business is developing very actively in conjunction with MTS. And a few of the new products that we recently launched has proven to be extremely successful, especially the debit card and the credit card type to MTS account, which provides customers with the free mobile service on the condition of a certain amount of card usage.And there are some other aspects like some of the real estate opportunities we're looking at for recapitalization purposes that may reduce cash outflow, but in any case it's not going to be a significant amount for Sistema if recapitalization is to take place in 2016. So we believe that MTS Bank -- the work is in the path and it's actually moving on an upward trajectory right now.For Targin, Targin is still performing very well. We expect EBITDA of Targin to be above -- well, let's say between RUB4.5 billion to RUB5 billion this year. There is a slight, of course, [decline] in Targin's OIBDA due to overall situation in the oil market because obviously oil price and decline in exploration influences oil services business across the market and Targin is actually one of the best performers that is suffering less from that than many others. But it in no way undermines the kind of overall Targin's strategy and we are still very certain that this company will continue to grow.The medium-term strategy for smaller assets like Binnopharm, Intourist and other, there is no single combined strategy. Each asset has a strategy of its own. Take Binnopharm, it's a small asset that nevertheless generates positive EBITDA this year. It will be above, let's say, between RUB300 million and RUB400 million. It is not taking money from Sistema. It has now a strong management which we recently replaced. We were able to attract a number of highly experienced and qualified individuals, both R&D and marketing area. And Binnopharm is now working on -- actively working on development of its own product portfolio. And we believe if our strategy goes as planned we'll be able to multiply several times fold the value of this asset. So at this point, it doesn't really make sense to sell because there are no adequate buyers for adequate price. It doesn't take money from Sistema so we're developing it organically.Intourist, the hotel business we're looking at a number of opportunities in hotel area. Russia is lacking quality hotels. Increase in domestic tourism drives demand and we believe that there are a few opportunities on the hotel market that we can potentially pursue. We have not made any acquisition decisions yet, but we are looking at a number of strategies respectively. So basically for every asset we have a strategy also. Of course we have assets like Segezha, agriculture, Targin and others which are growing quite rapidly and are relatively large. And other assets are growing slower but we're not looking to immediately dispose of any of them.Also including Medsi, which, yes, is performing slower than expected, but we still believe that there is huge potential in this asset which is yet to be realized.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry. I don't (inaudible) there are no questions. Can you also talk a little bit about the real estate? You've mentioned a couple of numbers on revenues and maybe your potentially return from that business now and if you could maybe elaborate what happened in the second quarter and also update us on the progress on [Zue] project and in general, how should we think about it this year and maybe next year?And the same questions about -- no, not the same, but agriculture also -- I think last time you mentioned some indications on where you would expect EBITDA to come. Are you still happy with those numbers or you can maybe update them a little bit after the second quarter? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------On real estate, it's actually quite simple. We have two assets, Leader-Invest and Business Nedvizhimost. Each of them we expect to generate around RUB1 billion kind of net result to Sistema, and both assets have strategies, both assets have opportunities to growth, but right now we're looking at them as sort of cash cows translating the real estate that they acquired from MGTS into cash by redeveloping partially and redeveloping and renting in the part of Business Nedvizhimost. So, so far we are pretty happy with our cash investments in this area, and we still -- we do have an upside which we're not disclosing (technical difficulty) projects, but we're kind of working on it.As far as I think your second question was about as about Zue. Is that right?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, that's correct. And also sort of you said it's a cash cow. Can you hint on what kind of dividends you are receiving from the real estate at the moment?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, that's what I said. We are planning to receive around RUB1 billion from each.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Olga Bystrova, Credit Suisse - Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(inaudible) dividends, okay. That's fine (multiple speakers)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's either dividends or return of loans that we've given them, but we're also kind of consider those loan returns as dividend because some of those loans we intended to give them as capital injection, but they were just given in the form of loans. So, you can call it dividends.And for Zue, there is not much to say. We entered into this project with a partner. There is still a number of additional partners who would like to invest. We're negotiating. We're planning to limit our cash exposure. I think I was giving you numbers around RUB1.5 billion, RUB1.7 billion. That's probably the extent of our participation as Sistema. And we will see how this project shapes up when we get there. So far our investment in this has been around RUB500 million.And your third question was for agro, agro, we maintain around RUB3.5 billion as in OIBDA forecast going up to around RUB5 billion next year, if everything goes according to plan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(inaudible) situation with the investment program and leverage, you mentioned that you are in the process of RUB40 billion investment program. First question is, how far through are you -- what part of the project is already completed and what part is remaining? And secondly taking into account that the leverage of this asset is visibly increasing, what level of leverage you consider acceptable for this asset? Thank you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The acceptable leverage level is no more than three time EBITDA and the timing for this leverage is no more than one year. So basically in our plan, we expect leverage going up to three-point times EBITDA and staying there at one year max. And we spaced out our RUB40 billion program in such a way that of course sort of first, I think it's RUB12 billion then it is another RUB15 billion and then it's the rest. And the first RUB12 billion are clearly designed for the projects that give, sort of, one and a half or two years payback, so very kind of quick turnaround. So we start receiving cash from those investments to fuel other investments and decrease debt to EBITDA ratio back to 1 to 1.5 maximum in two years, that's kind of the plan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Igor Goncharov, BCS Financial Group - Analyst [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What part you already invested roughly?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don't have those numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vsevolod Rozanov, Sistema PJSFC - SVP & CFO [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Less than two-third of this, so we are still in the process of leveraging.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mikhail Shamolin, Sistema PJSFC - President & CEO [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This year I think the amount is going to be around RUB7 billion.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. We have no further questions. Please continue with any further points you wish to raise.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evgeniy Chuikov, Sistema PJSFC - VP, Head of Corporate Communications [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. We will now finish this call. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Have a very good day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.
