TalkPool AB and Sigma Technology Solutions AB have signed a framework agreement for the supply of competence resources to ensure the development of future Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. The agreement involves a long-term partnership where Sigma Technology delivers professional expertise in software development and technical information; both consultants on-site and near-shore operations.
TalkPool works with advanced technologies and has created a unique leading position in the Low Power Wide Area Technologies (LPWA). This requires credible and stable partners. Sigma Technology is a reliable supplier of technology and software development, with a strong focus on the needs of their customers and high delivery quality.
“The new radio technology, optimized for long range and low power consumption, allows for more units to be connected than what was up until now economically viable or even possible. For example, smart homes, containers of various types, pallets and parking lots. It will be fascinating to see what new and exciting areas we will develop that improves our society and gives companies even better offerings,” says Robert Spertina, Head of IoT at TalkPool AB.
Earlier this year, Tele2 and TalkPool entered into a partnership with the goal of building an IoT network based on LoRaWAN Technology in Gothenburg. This will enable many exciting customer projects in the Gothenburg region.
“We are very happy and proud for the opportunity to help TalkPool with the development of the IoT solutions of tomorrow. For 30 years, Sigma has built a strong competence in software development and in recent years we have focused a lot on strengthening our expertise within IoT. Therefore, we look forward to cooperating with TalkPool and follow them in their ambitious goal to create innovative IoT services,” says Robert Åberg, Head of IoT Solutions at Sigma Technology Solutions AB.

Press Release
21 June 2017
TalkPool almost doubles revenues through the acquisition of a leading telecom network services hub in the Middle East
Today, TalkPool AG (“TalkPool”) announces the purchase of 100% of the shares in LCC Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd (“LCC PAK”). LCC PAK was founded in 2008 and has approximately 1,000 employees in Pakistan, which becomes TalkPool’s largest market.
LCC PAK is performing similar kind of network services as TalkPool. LCC PAK has a history of stable financial performance, and has revenues of approximately EUR 10 million. TalkPool has good understanding of LCC PAK as its board member. Stan Schreuder worked for Lightbridge Communications Corporation (LCC) during the period 2002 until 2015.
LCC PAK has also developed an IoT-based solution for the management of telecom sites. LCC PAK’s site solution manages the power from different sources such as solar panels, batteries, utility and generators in an efficient manner. Furthermore, the solution handles site access and surveillance. TalkPool has experience from implementation of sustainable energy site solutions and of IoT-integration from several markets. The acquisition of LCC PAK creates an opportunity for TalkPool to offer price-efficient telecom site services with IoT-functionality.
The acquisition fits well with TalkPool’s strategy to grow through acquisitions of profitable network services companies that are well positioned to distribute, integrate and support IoT-solutions. TalkPool has previously worked in many countries in the Middle East including Pakistan with good results, and this acquisition marks a return to this region.
Stan Schreuder, who managed LCC in Europe and Middle East during several years, says that “the LCC hub in Pakistan is a very well-functioning unit in a fast-growing economy, with skilled staff, good client relations and strong finances with substantial assets, including Intellectual Property. I’m looking forward to work together with the team in Pakistan again”. Stan has also committed to participate in the financing of the acquisition.
The transaction in detail
The transaction means that 100% of the shares in LCC PAK are being acquired for a total consideration of USD 5.2 million of which USD 4.0 million will be paid at closing. The remaining USD 1.2 million will be made in two instalments in 2018 and 2019 and will be financed through TalkPool’s future cash flow.
The payment in connection with the closing will be financed through a rights issue amounting to 32.9 million SEK and a convertible loan amounting to 500,000 CHF. The rights issue is underwritten to 81 percent through subscription undertakings corresponding to SEK 17.8 million and guarantee agreements corresponding to SEK 9.0 million.
LCC PAK will be consolidated into TalkPool’s financial reporting. Closing is expected to take place latest by 31st October, 2017 although we expect the closing to happen sooner. The closing is subject to regulatory approvals.

G&W Fondkommission is financial advisors and Setterwalls Advokatbyrå AB is legal counsel to TalkPool in connection with the acquisition. Alpen Capital (ME) Limited acted as financial advisors for LCC PAK.

Talkpool AB and Avnet Silica has entered a partner agreement for the distribution of Talkpool LoRaTM sensor devices used in evolving Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. This is an agreement to whereby Avnet Silica will offer Talkpool sensors on all Avnet Silica’s markets where LoRaWANTM is present. The two companies are additionally cooperating in enabling IoT solutions on the booming IoT Swedish market.
The Talkpool IoT team works with advanced technologies and offers IoT solutions, IoT networks and IoT products for Low Power Wide Area Technologies (LPWA) using LoRaTM. Avnet Silica adds on as a global and strong partner with leadership distribution of electronic components, products and services, that enables further reach of the Talkpool IoT product offering.
“The low power wide area network radio technology, that is optimized for very long range and years of battery powered devices, allows for millions of devices to be connected that previously wasn’t economically viable or even possible. Some example are, moisture detection in buildings, temperature and humidity readings in e.g. boats and mobile homes, CO2 levels in every street corner and many many more use cases. A very good ongoing example is Talkpool’s involvement in a consortium led by the City of Gothenburg within the strategic innovation program for environmental supervision of air and water in Gothenburg” , says Robert Spertina, Head of IoT.
“The Nordics continue to be at the global forefront of the IoT. The average number of connected things per person in the region is expected to be four times as many as in the rest of the world by 2021. We believe the bulk of the connections will not be consumer driven but industrial, smart city or agricultural applications. We are pleased to be able to offer turnkey sensor devices from Talkpool to our expanding customer base focusing on IoT “, says Kenneth Nilsson, Sales Manager at Avnet Silica Sweden.

Talkpool has during late 2016 and the beginning of 2017 celebrated break-throughs with several European network operators such as Deutsche Telekom, Belgacom, Vodafone and Orange – and order volumes have rapidly grown during the first four months of 2017. This client segment, which represented no revenues a year ago, is now TalkPool’s fastest growing customer group and biggest opportunity.
“TalkPool’s order intake from clients in Europe increased in the second half of 2016 and has continued to accelerate during the first four months of 2017 while order levels from clients in Africa and the Americas have remained stable. Europe generated almost a third of TalkPool’s overall orders in the first four months of 2017”, comments Erik Strömstedt CEO of Talkpool. 
During the period January to April 2017, approximately 26% of Talkpool revenues relates to the African market and originates from many countries, whereas the 42% of the total revenues relates to the Americas and stems from only two markets. 
Network services order volumes from Digicel in the Carribbean have remained unchanged during many years but its share has reduced to 37%, down from over 50% a year ago, as business from other clients is growing. Orders from China-based equipment vendor Huawei continue to increase while the share of orders from Swedish Ericsson, with whom TalkPool has a close relation, is continuing to decline. 
TalkPool continues to get a wide range of IoT orders but the order volumes are still modest. 
This information is information that TalkPool is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact person set out above, at 08.30 CET on 22 May, 2017.

Grand Master Plan
19 Jan, 2017
Eight months after its Initial Public Offering on Nasdaq First North, TalkPool’s Board of Directors hereby summarizes and clarifies the long term group strategy in this Grand Master Plan 

Eight months after its Initial Public Offering on Nasdaq First North, TalkPool’s Board of Directors hereby summarizes and clarifies the long term group strategy in this Grand Master Plan:
It took TalkPool 16 years to build a market presence with companies in 15 countries (in Europe, Africa and America) that assist large clients to adopt new communication technology. It will take less than half that time for TalkPool to attain global reach with approximately 30 companies. A handful hubs will be supporting the surrounding markets and the companies will develop local niche competences that are cross-sold to other TalkPool markets. We invite local partners to take ownership in TalkPool’s companies to foster entrepreneurship and risk sharing. This will result in increasing profit margins and growth. Headquarter costs will be kept low and focus will be on our most profitable operations, in particular on understanding and adapting to customer/industry needs and the eco-systems serving them. 
The money generated from TalkPool’s market companies are used to develop infrastructure solutions and skills for the information society, also called “Internet of Things”. The solutions include apps (for smartphone, tablets and computers), smart devices (embedded with electronics, software & sensors) and network connectivity. Each “thing” is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system and is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. The interconnection of these embedded devices, is expected to impact nearly all industries, or so called verticals, including smart cities, smart homes, transport and health. We will initially develop and market many different vertical solutions ranging from environment control to ski-school tracker and work-place management but we will eventually narrow in on a few vertical solutions, in which we become industry leaders. 
In addition to developing own vertical IoT solutions, TalkPool will integrate solutions made by other companies. We will come up with solutions to client problems, from design to integration of the different IoT building blocks. Many of the building blocks are under development, so we will need to be innovative and embrace new technologies when developing architecture for the emerging internet solutions. In addition to connecting client products to the internet, we will provide financed end-to-end packages that allows our clients to charge for their service rather than selling the product. 
In short we will 
1.   Expand our existing network services activities in profitable niches
2.   Use the cash to develop own solutions for the Internet of Things
3.   Assist our clients to convert from selling a product to selling a service 
We will be profitable in spite of making investments in IoT and we will avoid building up costly organizational structures and outperform markets as a listed company. We believe in thinking differently and challenging the status quo. We are building an organization that will help many clients gain total control of their business. 
Magnus Sparrholm, TalkPool board in January 2017.

TalkPool has previously worked in many countries in the Middle East including Pakistan with good results, and this acquisition marks a return to this region.
Stan Schreuder, who managed LCC in Europe and Middle East during several years, says that “the LCC hub in Pakistan is a very well-functioning unit in a fast-growing economy, with skilled staff, good client relations and strong finances with substantial assets, including Intellectual Property. I’m looking forward to work together with the team in Pakistan again”. Stan has also committed to participate in the financing of the acquisition.
The transaction in detail
The transaction means that 100% of the shares in LCC PAK are being acquired for a total consideration of USD 5.2 million of which USD 4.0 million will be paid at closing. The remaining USD 1.2 million will be made in two instalments in 2018 and 2019 and will be financed through TalkPool’s future cash flow.
The payment in connection with the closing will be financed through a rights issue amounting to 32.9 million SEK and a convertible loan amounting to 500,000 CHF. The rights issue is underwritten to 81 percent through subscription undertakings corresponding to SEK 17.8 million and guarantee agreements corresponding to SEK 9.0 million.
LCC PAK will be consolidated into TalkPool’s financial reporting. Closing is expected to take place latest by 31st October, 2017 although we expect the closing to happen sooner. The closing is subject to regulatory approvals.
Advisors
G&W Fondkommission is financial advisors and Setterwalls Advokatbyrå AB is legal counsel to TalkPool in connection with the acquisition. Alpen Capital (ME) Limited acted as financial advisors for LCC PAK.

NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, HONG KONG, JAPAN, SOUTH AFRICA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL OR WOULD REQUIRE REGISTRATION OR ANY OTHER MEASURES.

TalkPool AG (“TalkPool” or the “Group”) today announces the outcome for its private placement of shares in connection with its listing on Nasdaq First North, Stockholm (the “Offering”). The Offering attracted strong interest among investors and was subscribed to a total of SEK 100 million. Following the completed offering TalkPool has been approved for trading on Nasdaq First North Stockholm, trading will commence on May 24 with the ticker “TALK”.

The Offering in brief:


The Offering consisted of an offering to the general public in Sweden as well as to institutional investors in Sweden and internationally, with a price of the Offering of SEK 22 per share.

The Offering comprised up to 570,000 newly issued shares out of which 113,600 shares constituted an over-allotment option.

The newly issued shares comprised 21 percent of the outstanding shares after the Offering.

The Offering raised proceeds of approximately SEK 10.0 million and the over-allotment option raised proceeds of approximately SEK 2.5 million, in total SEK 12.5 million before transaction costs.

Approximately 800 investors have been allotted shares in TalkPool.

Trading on Nasdaq First North Stockholm will commence on 24 May 2016 with the ticker “TALK”.

Day of settlement for the Offering is 23 May, 2016.


Erik Strömstedt, CEO comments:
The raised proceeds and the listing will play an important part of our strategic development going forward. TalkPool has entered 2016 with a strong tailwind and a significant order backlog. This capitalization will strengthen our ability to gain further market share within IoT and further expand our joint venture and franchising offer – the Global Partnership Model. As important, the listing will support our efforts in recruiting more talents to the company.
Magnus Sparrholm, Chairman and founder comments:
The listing of TalkPool is certainly an important milestone for the company and will strengthen our platform for growth, both organically and through acquisitions. The board and owners are proud of the great support from investors. We look forward to a continued great journey for Talkpool as a long-term service partner to many of the world's leading telecom network suppliers and operators and the exceptional potential in the recently entered IoT-market.
