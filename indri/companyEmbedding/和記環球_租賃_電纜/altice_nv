All other subsidiaries delivering
              growth.






Delivering on global commitment to
          rapidly build state-of-the-art fiber networks:




Leading fiber[5] operator in France reaching 9.6
              million homes passed at the end of Q1 (+318k QoQ);
               




5-year "Generation GigaSpeed"
              commenced, upgrading Altice USA's network from fiber
              HFC to FTTH to ultimately deliver >10Gbps
              broadband speeds across entire Optimum footprint and
              part of Suddenlink footprint;  




On track to become the leading fiber
              operator in Portugal reaching 3.2 million homes
              passed at the end of Q1 (+248k QoQ, target c.4m homes
              end-2017);






Altice Group Adjusted EBITDA grew +9.5%
          YoY (+7.5% on a CC basis) in Q1 driven by the strong
          growth of Altice USA (Optimum Adjusted EBITDA +30.7% YoY,
          Suddenlink +19.6% YoY on a CC basis). Altice USA reached an Adjusted EBITDA margin of
          41.4% on a combined basis in Q1 (+7.5 % pts YoY vs. 33.9%
          in Q1 2016).




Altice Group Operating Free Cash
          Flow[6] grew +21.4% YoY (+18.8% on a CC
          basis) in Q1 driven by the strong growth of Altice USA
          (Optimum and Suddenlink grew +56.2% and +41.0% YoY on a
          CC basis, respectively).




Robust, diversified and long-term
          capital structure: Altice has refinanced over €29.6
          billion equivalent of its debt in the last twelve months,
          extending the weighted average life of the Group's debt
          by 20 months (6.5 years end-Q1), while at the same time
          reducing the average cost of debt.




Michel Combes, Chief Executive Officer of
      Altice, said: "We begin 2017 with
      another quarter of successful execution and accelerated
      growth. We continue to see the benefits of being a leading,
      transatlantic converged communications player with these
      results further validating the Altice Model. That is,
      reinvesting growing cash flows and attracting the best talent
      to provide the best customer experience, the best
      infrastructure, and the best content.  


In particular, we are delivering on our
      major global commitment to fiber with rapid network
      deployments progressing very well across the Group. Fiber is
      the future and, for Altice, that future is now.


In France, we have also substantially
      improved the quality of SFR's mobile network, including
      reaching 88% 4G population coverage, and have significantly
      expanded our content offers, supporting new customer growth.
      As we execute on the next phase of the company's
      transformation and focus on dramatically improving customer
      service, we are confident we will see a further improvement
      in fixed trends in 2017 as well.


Altice USA continues to grow faster than
      Suddenlink and Optimum had been growing prior to our
      acquisitions of those businesses with improved margins
      driving significant cash flow growth for the Group. We
      continue to execute on our efficiency and investment targets
      and we are very much looking forward to unlocking the next
      phase of growth."
