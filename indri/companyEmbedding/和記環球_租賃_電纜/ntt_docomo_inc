Customer’s Background


NTT DOCOMO unveiled its new DaaS offerings to the market in February 2011


NTT DOCOMO, INC., the largest mobile communications operator in Japan, has been an influential force in the evolution of mobile technologies and standards in Japan, and in providing leading-edge mobile services to its customers. Examples of the most advanced communications technologies introduced by NTT DOCOMO include the company’s trademarked i-mode, FOMA and Xi (read ‘Crossy’), and Japan’s first LTE (Long-Term Evolution)-based network services. In 2010, inspired by its corporate philosophy “We will create a new communication culture,” NTT DOCOMO implemented a new corporate vision “Pursuing Smart Innovation: HEART (2020 Vision)”. This marked the company’s intention of achieving further growth and delivering new value to its customers and society. In upholding that strong message, NTT DOCOMO is very active in fostering a range of activities to realize smart innovations.

As part of the company’s efforts to facilitate work related innovations, NTT DOCOMO wished to start a new service that would support mobile workers and bring significant improvements in their productivity and convenience. “Traditionally, bandwidth issues had remained the fundamental challenges in implementing cloud computing to a mobile computing environment,” explained Mr. Hiromiki Moriyama, Director, Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO, INC. “However, in recent years, we’ve been able to see significant advancements in network bandwidth, quality and speed. For example, NTT DOCOMO’s latest Xi service has made it possible to provide ultra-high-speed and stable internet connections. Those changes in the external environment presented the opportunity to us, and in May 2009, we decided to embark on a project which would provide a commercially available Mobile Secure Desktop. This would be aimed at delivering innovative cloud-hosted desktop computing to mobile workers,” continued Moriyama.

When NTT DOCOMO began working on the project, it wanted to develop the new service in a forward-looking manner. The intention was not only to accommodate existing customer needs, but also generate solutions for the future. “For further growth of our cloud-based service business, building a highly-secure, scalable and flexible cloud environment was one of our paramount goals to. That would allow us to quickly respond to change and diversity, and maintain our competitiveness in the global marketplace. At NTT DOCOMO we put effort into the design and development of the new service and in parallel we commenced infrastructure deployment planning,” said Moriyama.


NTT DOCOMO’s New Service Aimed at Mobile Workers


Mobile Secure Desktop achieves significant productivity improvements and enhanced data security


NTT DOCOMO’s Mobile Secure Desktop is a cloud-hosted virtual desktop service. It is designed to enable mobile workers to work more effectively and efficiently at any location in the world. They do this by accessing a centrally-managed desktop environment from their PCs, zero-client devices and tablets. Wherever they connect mobile workers use the same desktop environment and have work continuity without concerns about data security issues. Users are also freed from the threat of information leaks, as all important user data resides in a secure environment within the NTT DOCOMO datacenter, and not on the local devices. Mobile Secure Desktop also significantly reduces desktop administration effort and associated costs.

Ms. Chisa YoshidomiCloud Computing Platform (Service Promotion)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing DivisionNTT DOCOMO, INC.
Ms. Chisa Yoshidomi, a staff member in the Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO talked about the background and objectives of the company’s launch of the Mobile Secure Desktop service. “From the viewpoint of increased mobility, one of our urgent tasks was to address the common challenges that many businesses are facing in today’s society – enabling people to do their jobs more efficiently and productively. In particular allowing them to work on their PCs at any time from any location, inside and outside the office, without concern about data security problems. Since the introduction of the Protection of Personal Information Act [Personal Information Protection Law (Japan) enabled in 2003], organizations have been under increasing pressure to meet strict security compliance standards. Today, it’s estimated that as many as 70 percent of Japanese businesses have some sort of prohibition on employees taking their PCs away from the office. However, in examining real-world situations, that kind of excessive security policy is causing significant inconvenience to many employees and actually limiting their productivity. I believe NTT DOCOMO can help resolve such situations. With our new virtualized desktop service, we are aiming to address two heterogeneous goals. These are delivering improved productivity and tightening information security for our customers.”



Mr. Yasunori KondoCloud Computing Platform (Business Strategy)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing Division NTT DOCOMO, INC.
Before going to a vendor for help with infrastructure deployment, NTT DOCOMO spent over a year on thorough internal considerations, discussions, and evaluation of the concepts of the new service. “Maintaining the users’ point-of-view was we thought the most important factor when developing and evaluating the service. At NTT DOCOMO we created a test environment and evaluated the concepts of Mobile Secure Desktop with experimental user groups. In assuming that the service would be used in a mobile computing environment, one of our biggest challenges was to ensure an excellent browsing experience and stress-free communication even for users with low-bandwidth connections. To solve such challenges, we tried the Citrix client virtualization software and decided that the adoption of Citrix would be a great solution. The Citrix software provides a feature that enables differential data capturing and transmission between the Desktop Service environment and user terminals. This greatly improves communication efficiency as the least amount of data is transferred,” said Mr. Yasunori Kondo, a staff member in charge of business strategy, Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO, INC.



End-to-End Support from Fujitsu Enables the Mobile Secure Desktop Service


Comprehensive capabilities are the key in selecting an ICT partner to jointly drive the project

Mr. Takashi TodaCloud Computing Platform (Technical Management)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing Division NTT DOCOMO, INC.
 

NTT DOCOMO completed the definition of their Mobile Secure Desktop infrastructure after undertaking thorough testing and evaluation, including the monitoring of test results and market trends. They then started to look for an ICT partner they could work with. “We compared the capabilities of ICT vendors from many angles. To achieve a successful roll out of the new service NTT DOCOMO really needed a trusted partner with full strengths in SI and support capabilities. One that would not only help us deploy the core cloud foundation for our new service but also operate the new cloud environment. Taking many factors into consideration - for example, their existing line of products, strengths in solution deployments, and very importantly, rich experience and expertise in Citrix implementations, NTT DOCOMO concluded that Fujitsu would be the partner we could rely on,” says Mr. Takashi Toda, a staff member in the Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO. “We also really appreciated Fujitsu’s effort and ability in meeting our needs by completing the infrastructure deployment tasks in such a short lead time - as we didn’t have much time before rolling out the service,” continued Toda.


Mr. Teiju KonnoCloud Computing Platform (Business Strategy)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing DivisionNTT DOCOMO, INC.
Mobile Secure Desktop directly delivers a familiar Windows-based desktop environment to users - as a service. This enables them to start working on their virtualized desktop anytime and anywhere they wish. They simply log on using their own log-on account and password. In the Mobile Secure Desktop environment, OS installation effort is also no longer required for each individual local device.

In providing such services, it was essential for NTT DOCOMO to have sophisticated software license management, and there is still room to improve the existing software licensing models. “In the age of clouds and on-demand computing, there’s been a lack of standardization of approaches to software licensing. This is because not all software vendors provide cloud-ready licensing models. That’s the real situation today. NTT DOCOMO and Fujitsu, as a distributer, are now collaborating to resolve the technology barriers related to software licensing in the cloud,” said Mr. Teiju Konno, a staff member in charge of business strategy in the Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO.


Mr. Yuichi TanoguchiCloud Computing Platform (Service Development)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing DivisionNTT DOCOMO, INC.
With the new DaaS offerings, NTT DOCOMO wished to support every day business activities and mobile worker communication. As a result, ensuring usability was another priority development area of the Mobile Secure Desktop. “In the process of developing Storage Service, which is NTT DOCOMO’s proprietary on-line application for Mobile Secure Desktop, we relied on Fujitsu to design and develop the service screens and a set of management tools. We gave Fujitsu lots of requirements, some of which I believe were very challenging to meet. But Fujitsu really came up with the goods for us, in a very responsive manner. Thanks to comprehensive support from Fujitsu, we were able to get the job done within the given short time period and without compromising usability of the service,” recalled Mr. Yuichi Tanoguchi, a staff member in the Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO, INC.

In July 2010, the Mobile Secure Desktop project entered its actual cloud deployment phase. With all the effort put in by NTT DOCOMO in conjunction with Fujitsu, the cloud infrastructure was successfully built within a mere 8 months. NTT DOCOMO chose to adopt Citrix XenDesktop virtualization software to create the virtualized desktop environment. For the underlying hardware, the company selected Fujitsu’s hardware products, which are well recognized as meeting customer demands for higher reliability. These included: Fujitsu PRIMERGY BX922 blade servers, Fujitsu ETERNUS DX90 storage systems and the ETERNUS NR1000 F3140 network disk array. NTT DOCOMO also understood the high density consolidation capabilities of Fujitsu PRIMERGY, its complete set of server management tools and the advanced features in the ETERNUS storage, including data deduplication. With this great combination of versatile virtualization technology and high reliability hardware the resulting cloud foundation, built in the NTT DOCOMO datacenter, achieved greatly scalable and a secure environment for multi-tenancy.



Business Benefits and Future Scenarios

Supporting expanded use of cloud computing in society

In February 2011, Mobile Secure Desktop was made available commercially, and immediately following the service launch, NTT DOCOMO received overwhelming responses from the market. The company assumes that the exclusive advantages provided by Mobile Secure Desktop are drawing user attention. One user benefit is the minimum level of initial investment. The service can be implemented by purchase of a single user account that comes with standard desktop features such as Microsoft Office Suite, email and anti-virus software. Mobile Secure Desktop users are also provided with access to the Storage Service that allows them to upload/download files and manage their address books. If a user device is lost or stolen, the associated user account can be remotely locked out to prevent unauthorized access to the device. These features are all included in the service, enabling the users to achieve significant ROI.


Mr. Yasushi MoriManagerCloud Computing Platform (Business Strategy)Solution Business DepartmentCorporate Marketing DivisionNTT DOCOMO, INC.
 

“The response to Mobile Secure Desktop has been immense. Of course, the service is now used by many mobile workers who need to work outside of the office or at multiple sites. In addition to such orthodox usage, we are striving to expand the use of the service for wider purposes. For example, some of our customers have expressed great interest in implementing Mobile Secure Desktop for trial purposes, to test the concepts of clouds before they actually move into a full cloud environment. We are also excited to see the expansion of our service into non-traditional fields such as SOHOs, schools and in-home medical care. Previous introduction of such advanced technology was a challenge due to small user volumes and budget constraints,” said Mr. Yasushi Mori, Manager, Solution Business Department, Corporate Marketing Division at NTT DOCOMO, INC.

Looking forward, Moriyama is very excited with the many possibilities that Mobile Secure Desktop will bring. “I strongly believe this solution is a great example of the power of mobile cloud computing, which will be a driving force in supporting technological evolution in Japan. We will soon move into a new age where desktop PCs are consumed as a service, not as a physical asset to purchase. At NTT DOCOMO, we are thrilled to accelerate our effort to expand the Mobile Secure Desktop business and continue to make our services better and better. To realize our vision and aims, we greatly look forward to continued work with Fujitsu.”

NTT DOCOMO, INC. is striving to cultivate unlimited possibilities in mobile communications and provide future-generation services to its customers. As a trusted ICT partner of NTT DOCOMO, Fujitsu is one-hundred percent committed to providing end-to-end support to facilitate the innovations of NTT DOCOMO and help the company take on new challenges.

Human Centric Innovation
NTT DOCOMO, Japan's largest mobile network provider, transformed its customer data management system, 'ALADIN', which handles around 65 million customer contracts and related information. Fujitsu has worked with NTT DOCOMO to develop a robust system framework that enables flexible system upgrades without compromising their services. This framework has reduced the time for application upgrades by 30 to 70%. NTT DOCOMO now has an agile system that supports its business by quickly responding to customer needs in the fast paced mobile market.

System upgrade for better services and growth
NTT DOCOMO is Japan's largest mobile network operator with around 65 million subscribers. DOCOMO is working towards its vision of creating a new communication culture, and introduced the world's first third generation (3G) mobile network services in 2001. Beginning with the DOCOMO iMode services, the company was a pioneer of the mobile internet market.
DOCOMO's ICT system is also one of the most advanced in terms of performance in Japan. Its customer data management system, ALADIN, is an example. The system connects the DOCOMO information centers with its shops all over Japan, controlling all procedures for contracting and sales, for example entering customer information and checking credit risks. Processing one of the biggest volumes of customer data in Japan, ALADIN also integrates and manages network usage statistics, tariff plans, and the application of discount services of each subscriber.
For many years, DOCOMO has worked hand-in-hand with Fujitsu to upgrade ALADIN, which is essential for expanding DOCOMO's business and services. The two companies embarked on a project to develop the second generation of ALADIN in 2006. In the same year, a new regulation was introduced in Japan, allowing mobile phone users to switch providers much more easily. The ALADIN system had to be transformed to meet this new challenge.
Over time, large systems become more complicated, and ALADIN was no exception. Repeated upgrades and changes had left the system applications bloated and made further upgrades more difficult.There are normally four major service releases per year to introduce new services. Each of these took four months from design through development and testing. Even a minor service release between the major releases took over two months to produce. ALADIN could not keep pace with the speed of DOCOMO's business needs, becoming a bottleneck for growth.
A flexible, robust framework for business agility
The target of ALADIN transformation was to halve the time and costs for new service releases. In order to reduce the testing time, it was crucial to identify clearly which elements within ALADIN would be affected by the system upgrade. It was also required to maintain the structural integrity of the application despite the repeated upgrades. To respond to these two challenges, DOCOMO collaborated with Fujitsu to jointly develop a new foundational framework for ALADIN, named 'xFramework'.
xFramework has two main features. First, it can adapt to changes flexibly. xFramework places the business layer as the core, comprised of Business Process Management (BPM(*1)) and Business Rule Management System (BRMS(*2)) functions. Any newly developed business flows and rules are reflected to the program in the business layer. This enables new functions for new services to be implemented in ALADIN with quick turnarounds. Second, xFramework is highly robust, built on logical data objects. DOCOMO defined a structured data object of all the information, such as a tariff plan and a model of mobile phones, in ways it is linked to each subscriber's phone number. ALADIN designers and developers use this data object to maintain application integrity under repeated system upgrades.
Removing the bottleneck and building on success
After the introduction of the second generation of the ALADIN system, unnecessary program development and testing were eliminated, because information from the system upgrade clearly shows where to change in the application structure. As a result the development time for major service releases was reduced by 30% and finished within three months. Simultaneously, the time required for minor releases was cut by 60 to 70% to just three weeks. In June 2014, DOCOMO introduced two new tariff plans: one was the first flat rate plan for voice calls, and the other was the shared mobile data plan for families. The new ALADIN system enables DOCOMO to release attractive plans first to market prior to the competition.
While the total development workload decreased by 40%, the company has become able to respond to 50% more demands for functional upgrades, resulting in a 2.5 times productivity improvement. The productivity gains mean that DOCOMO can now finish updates to the ALADIN system faster than many other activities associated with the launch of a new service, such as staff training or brochure creation. The ALADIN system is no longer a bottleneck. It is transformed to support the business with agility.
Leverage the success of ALADIN
DOCOMO continues to improve ALADIN to meet the demands for new tariff plans and new services tailored to customer lifestyles. The possibilities of mobile services are unlimited. DOCOMO continues to develop new services, including the dMarket cloud service for their smartphone and PC users. xFramework has also been applied to these services as well. DOCOMO is expanding the scope of business, transforming itself from a mobile network operator to an integrated service provider.

NTT DoCoMo, Inc.




In addition to the "i-mode Filter," a filtering service that restricts access to harmful sites such as dating sites and adult sites so as to allow children to use mobile phones with peace of mind, NTT DoCoMo offers a "URL-containing e-mail rejection setting" as a countermeasure against unwanted e-mail. These two services are supported by NetSTAR's URL database, which encompass not just PC sites but also mobile phone sites.




NTT DoCoMo Inc. (hereafter referred to as "DoCoMo") is an industry pioneer, for example commercializing mobile phone services equipped with i-mode, an internet access function, before any of its competitors. The increase in the number of minor users of mobile phone services such as i-mode increases has been accompanied by a rise in the number of crime victims and incidents triggered by browsing of dating sites and adult sites. As a countermeasure, starting in 2003, DoCoMo began offering Kid's i-mode (currently, "Kid's i-mode Filter), an optional service for minors that restricts access to sites other than i-mode menu sites, as part of efforts to address social needs for security. However, these days elementary schools increasingly put up their own websites, and in the case of filtering with blanket denial of access to sites other than i-mode menu sites, customer needs are not served, so URL filtering is now gathering attention as a new countermeasure. Starting in 2005, DoCoMo has been offering Kid's i-mode Plus (currently named "i-mode Filter"), a service for restricting access to sites falling under specific categories such as dating sites and adult sites.

This service blocks access to sites such as dating sites and adult sites that are considered harmful to the sound development of minors, through filtering that uses NetSTAR's URL databases, while allowing access to sites offering useful information for life such as school websites. Moreover, as changes such as the cancellation of access restriction services or lowering the restriction level require parental consent, this service is highly praised and trusted by all quarters as a revolutionary service that can drastically restrict misuse of mobile phone sites by minors. Further, starting in 2007, DoCoMo changed the name of its "Kid's i-mode Plus" service to "i-mode Filter" to reflect further evolution of this service to answer a wider range of filtering needs including for example corporate customers wishing to reduce communication costs caused by unnecessary access by others in addition to minors. This new service is enjoying a very favorable reception.
"Business needs for access management are greater than anticipated, and the majority of corporate contracts for the batch introduction of mobile phones elect to use the i-mode Filter." (Ito) 


Along with dating sites and adult sites, unwanted e-mail is a major annoyance for mobile phone services. At DoCoMo, in addition to original unwanted e-mail countermeasures, we started in 2007 to apply filtering using NetSTAR's URL databases, which we had used thus far for the i-mode Filter, to unwanted e-mails. This resulted in the addition of the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting to our service menu. 
Although initially we just thought about providing the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting as one of our unwanted e-mail countermeasure setting menu items, upon actual introduction, the effectiveness of this service was very clear to see, and since it was easy to set, we find it to be effective for promotion to customers who are not comfortable with handling devices, whose number is on the rise," says Inoue, attesting to a favorable reception of this service that went beyond DoCoMo's expectations. 

The reasons why DoCoMo chose to use NetSTAR are the quality and track record of its databases. Since before the i-mode Filter, DoCoMo used NetSTAR for blocking specific sites for its "mopera U" Internet service for FOMA, and the quality of NetSTAR's databases had been demonstrated. Regarding the provision of the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting, Ito says, "we selected NetSTAR based on its trustworthiness for mopera U and i-mode Filter. However, since there are unwanted e-mail specific URLs, we newly established the category of 'unwanted e-mail links'," describing selection and determination of categories according to the purpose of a service.


The "i-mode Filter" and "URL-containing e-mail rejection setting" are both provided free of charge due to the wish for "peace of mind" striving to avoid having DoCoMo mobile phones be the cause of experiences with harm. However, "before, during consultations regarding unwanted e-mail countermeasures, we would have to provide guidance regarding setting contents such as individual reception/blocking setting, after having heard how the customer uses e-mail, now, we can just recommend the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting, says Yamada, expressing high regard for the effect on raising customer satisfaction. For DoCoMo, which attaches great importance to the "peace of mind" of its customers, both the i-mode Filter and URL-containing e-mail rejection setting services will see their importance grow in the future.







"We conducted thorough testing to ensure that top items appearing on multiple search sites can be 100% guarded," says Takashi Ito (Platform Development Manager, Platform Department, Product & Service Division). 





"Since we make 'peace of mind' one of our sales points, i-mode Filter and URL-containing e-mail rejection setting are both important services," says Akiko Inoue (First Security Promotion In-Charge, Contents & Customer Department).





"Demand for the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting has been steadily increasing since its introduction," says Megumi Yamada (First Security Promotion In-Charge, Contents & Customer Department).














In order to maintain and improve filtering accuracy, NetSTAR operates the industry's first dedicated mobile phone site URL collection team. Full-time researchers working year round classify links included in e-mails through visual check at a URL Research Center equipped with mobile phones for monitoring purposes. Along with information sharing with the High-Tech Crime Fighting General Center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the Nippon Information Communication Association, and other organizations, high filtering accuracy is realized by updating the database day by day, moment by moment.












 



Established in August 1991 as NTT Mobile Communications Planning Co., Ltd., the company currently deploys a wide range of businesses centered on a mobile phone business and PHS business. Based on the corporate principle of "creating a new age communication culture," DoCoMo actively promotes the shift of mobile phones from "communication infrastructure" to "life infrastructure," aims to further increase customer satisfaction through the provision of communication services based on the spread and growth of the FOMA service.

NTT DOCOMO（日語：NTTドコモ）是日本一家電信公司。「DOCOMO」這個名字的意思是取“Do Communication over the Mobile network”（電信溝通無界限）中的首字，且其發音和日語单词どこも（无所不在）相同。台灣與中國的分公司將品牌名字譯為「都科摩」（台北與北京）或「都客梦」（上海）。
DOCOMO是日本電信電話株式會社（NTT）的特定子公司。而日本國政府介由NTT間接持有其20%以上的股份。目前主要營業務是以FOMA（3G）為主的各種移動通信服務。過去DOCOMO曾提供有PHS服務，但已於2008年1月7日結束服務[1]。此外，2G方式通訊服務mova和DoPa也已在2008年11月30日停止接受新用戶，並將在2012年3月31日停止服務[2][3]。而從2010年12月24日起，DOCOMO開始提供使用3.9G（基於LTE方式）方式的移動通訊服務Xi。
2008年7月，其下屬各地區分公司合併，公司體制改為全國1社體制。在此之前，DOCOMO是統括NTT DOCOMO集團的核心公司，同時也是管轄關東地方及甲信越地方業務的公司。為與整個NTT DOCOMO集團區別，曾常簡稱該公司為「（NTT）DOCOMO中央」。隨著公司體制改為全國1社，其商標也由NTT DoCoMo改為目前使用的NTT docomo。2010年，公司的正式英文名稱也由NTT DoCoMo, Inc.改為NTT DOCOMO, INC.[4][5][6]。

目前提供W-CDMA方式、HSDPA方式3G和3.5G手機服務「FOMA」和PDC方式的2G手機服務「mova」。2010年12月24日開始，在日本國內的通信公司中率先提供LTE方式的3.9G手機服務「Xi」。
郵件和i mode服務[编辑]
DoCoMo於1997年12月開始提供10元郵件（10円メール）服務（2008年2月結束），1999年2月開始提供i mode（iモード）服務[8]。這兩項服務廣受好評，提高了DoCoMo的市場佔有率。
在i mode的普及期的1999年至2001年期間，當時的i mode郵箱地址曾是「 手機號碼@docomo.ne.jp 」。但有不良業者大量發送垃圾郵件，加上接收郵件需要向收信人收取費用，因而成為重大的社會問題。因此，2001年7月開始，DOCOMO開始了一系列垃圾郵件對策。用戶也可以自行組合郵件地址，並且可以拒收垃圾郵件。同時，面對競爭的激化，NTT DOCOMO從2001年8月開始，毎月的流量在400流量以下的用戶可免收流量費。2008年6月開始，i mode的基本使用費調整為與其他公司相同的每月315日元。
2010年9月開始，推出了在智能手機上也能使用i mode郵箱地址的「sp mode」（spモード）服務。
mova至FOMA的移行[编辑]
DOCOMO於2001年10月開始推出了世界最早的W-CDMA方式第3世代手機通訊服務「FOMA」。2004年，以帶有大量最新功能的900i系列手機的發售為契機，FOMA被定位為DOCOMO的主要服務。之後通過一系列促進「mova」用戶轉為「FOMA」的措施，自2004年4月開始到2008年6月末為止，其第3世代手機用戶純增数連續50個月排名第一。2006年7月，FOMA用戶數超過mova用戶數。2008年11月，mova服務停止接受新用戶。預計將於2012年3月31日停止mova手機通訊服務。
FOMA的高速化及LTE的導入[编辑]
FOMA的數據通信速度在2001年10月開始啟用時是通話時上行及下行最高速度均為64Kbps，上網時下行最高速度為384Kbps上行最大速度為64Kbps。之後，手機的上行最快速度達到64Kbps。2006年8月，開始提供名為FOMA High Speed的服務[9]。其通信規格是HSDPA，下行最快速度3.6Mbps，上行最快速度384Kbps。2008年4月，FOMA High Speed的下行最快速度提高至7.2Mbps；2009年6月，隨著HSPA規格的導入，上行最快速度也提高至5.7Mbps。2011年6月開始，FOMA High Speed的下行速度提高至14Mbps（理論値14.4Mbps）。
DoCoMo於2010年12月24日開始提供基於第3.9世代的通信規格LTE的手機通訊服務「Xi（クロッシィ）」。這一服務將從東京、大阪、名古屋開始，逐步擴大到政令制定都市及全日本。隨之「Xi」的導入，部分室內最快通訊速度可達75Mbps，其他地區最快通訊速度可達37.5Mbps。
其他[编辑]




「HT-03A」是日本最早的安卓系統手機


DoCoMo於2004年開始提供名稱為「i mode FeliCa」的服務。這一服務的暱稱是手機錢包（「おサイフケータイ」）。之後還提供了基於手機錢包技術的「手機西瓜」服務。「手機錢包」後也授權給其他公司使用。
2006年10月開始電話號碼可攜服務（MNP）後，DoCoMo曾面臨苦戰，2006年11月，其用戶數首次減少。2007年8月度，出現創業以来第2次用戶數減少。為改變這一情況，DoCoMo於2008年7月開始對其品牌進行了全面刷新。2008年11月，其手機分類方式由過去的「90X・70X」兩個系列改為docomo PRIME series、docomo STYLE series、docomo SMART series、docomo PRO series四個系列。並積極擴大FOMA區域及FOMA High Speed區域，以求提高顧客滿意度，2008年夏季之後，其轉出數及解約率均明顯下降。同年12月，實現MNP制度開始以来首次轉入超過轉出[10]。2009年3月，獲得數據通信業務用戶滿意度首位[11]；2009年7月，其用戶純增数獲得首位，2009年度全年純增数時隔4年再次獲得首位[12]。 另外在2010年，其首次在JD Power的顧客滿意度調査中獲得首位[13]。
2008年度開始，DoCoMo開始發售1100系列，在docomo PRO series中發售Windows Mobile、BlackBerry、Android等智能手機。2010年夏季開始，智能手機自PRO series分離中獨立，改以DoCoMo智能手機（ドコモ スマートフォン）的名稱發售。同時開始提供智能手機用的ISP服務sp mode（spモード），並且銷售帶有手機電視和手機錢包功能的智能手機。並且和大日本印刷合作，設立了面向該公司智能手機用戶的電子書籍網站「2Dfacto」以求擴大銷量。2011年9月開始，新設平板電腦的分類DoCoMo平板電腦（ドコモ タブレット」。另外，DoCoMo在2011年4月之後銷售的手機均可解除SIM卡與手機綁定的功能[14]。
從2011年冬季新款手機起，其功能型手機被統合為「docomo STYLE series」。智能手機成為銷售主力，並且將帶有手機電視和手機錢包等傳統手機功能的智能手機劃入「docomo with series」；面向追求高機能手機用戶的智能手機則劃入「docomo NEXT series」。
其他業務[编辑]
DOCOMO於1998年自NTT個人獲得PHS業務。其PHS用戶最多時曾超過200萬，是PHS市場佔有率第二大企業。不過PHS業務多年赤字。2005年4月30日，DOCOMO停止接受新的PHS用戶。2008年1月7日24時之後，DOCOMO停止PHS服務。
DOCOMO曾是日本唯一一家在全國各都道府縣提供傳呼機業務的公司。DOCOMO在其開業當初，傳呼機用戶曾多於手機用戶。不過在1996年之後，隨著手機和PHS價格的下降及手機也同樣具有短信功能，傳呼機用戶逐漸減少。2004年6月30日，DOCOMO停止接受新的傳呼機用戶。2007年3月31日，停止提供傳呼機服務。
DOCOMO也有提供名稱為Wide Star（ワイドスター）的衛星電話服務。其通位於赤道上空36,000公里處的兩個静止軌道衛星 （N-STAR）提供電話服務。2010年5月時，共有38,100名服務。其服務區包含了日本的領土、領海、經濟水域中可在正午時能看到太陽的區域。主要在山小屋、船舶等手機和固定電話均難以收到信號的地區使用。2004年3月之前，還曾在飛機內提供服務。由於衛星軌道較遠，打電話時會發生約0.2秒的延遲。此外因通信時所需功率較大，其電話機的體積和重量也十分龐大，最小的可搬型也有1.7千克。衛星電話所使用的電話機有可搬型、車輛型、船舶型三種類型。
DOCOMO提供有名稱為WORLD WING的國際漫遊服務。其用戶前往外國時，可以直接使用日本的手機進行通話和郵件。且已覆蓋世界上的大多數國家。而所有的DOCOMO手機也都提供名為WORLD CALL的服務，可往海外撥打電話。
DOCOMO於2005年12月1日入股三井住友信用卡公司，並開始提供名為「iD」的非接觸式信用卡服務。2006年5月26日，DOCOMO開始提供可在iD上使用的信用卡服務DCMX。2009年1月，iD的用戶超過1000萬。DCMX的用戶數也在同年8月24日超過1000萬人。目前，日本各大主要便利店和麥當勞、AEON、友都八喜等均可使用iD支付。此外，在一些可口可樂的自動售貨機上也能使用iD。
除此之外，DOCOMO還有提供網際網絡（ISP），其服務品牌是mopera和mopera U。DOCOMO也有提供名稱是Mzone的公共無線上網服務，但需付費。其服務範圍是日本收費公共無線網絡中最大的。2009年3月，Mzone在全日本設置了3000個服務區。

Qualcomm Announces NTT DOCOMO as First Operator to Adopt New Qualcomm Snapdragon Sense ID Biometrics Platform     | Qualcomm










Press ReleasePress ReleasesQualcomm Announces NTT DOCOMO as First Operator to Adopt New Qualcomm Snapdragon Sense ID Biometrics Platform    –New Technology Supports Improved Mobile Payment and Content Experiences for End-Users–
2015年5月26日SAN DIEGOQualcomm products mentioned within this press release are offered by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), today announced that NTT DOCOMO INC. (DOCOMO), is the first operator to adopt and implement the Qualcomm® Snapdragon Sense™ ID biometrics platform. The platform, which is currently supported in the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 810 processor, is being utilized alongside third-party biometric sensors for DOCOMO’s mobile biometric authentication service starting on May 27, 2015 in Japan. The DOCOMO service including “docomo ID login authentication and carrier billing payment” will help provide DOCOMO customers with improved and enhanced security, as well as ease of authentication when making mobile payments and accessing DOCOMO’s content and services. With the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform, DOCOMO has provided customers with a solution that is designed to address the inherent limitations of passwords and pin codes. The unique advantages and benefits of the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform have led DOCOMO to deploy this service across their entire network.
DOCOMO is expected to launch the DOCOMO online authentication service with smartphones from Sharp and Fujitsu utilizing the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform on May 28, 2015 and plans to expand its biometric authentication offering to additional high-end devices in the winter. It is anticipated that many Android devices launching on the DOCOMO network with services, including “docomo ID login authentication and carrier billing payment,” will utilize the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform.
“We are pleased with DOCOMO’s recent launch of authentication services based on the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform in order to offer its consumers an improved authentication and mobile payment experience on their mobile devices,” said Raj Talluri, senior vice president, product management, QTI. “Users want more effective and convenient ways to access their mobile devices and services with easier yet stronger authentication, and QTI is setting the standard when it comes to innovative solutions that directly address those concerns.”
“DOCOMO is excited to be the first operator to offer its consumers a new and differentiated way to authenticate to their mobile devices,” said Seiji Maruyama, senior vice president and managing director of product department, NTT DOCOMO, INC. “By collaborating with Qualcomm Technologies on the deployment of the Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform, our customers can now unlock their phones without having to key in a pincode, and can make mobile payments with a quick glance.”
The Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform consists of QTI’s secure authentication framework and QTI’s certified implementation of the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) protocol. The authentication framework provides secure processing and storage of biometric data, whereas QTI’s UAF implementation provides secure authentication and connection among FIDO-enabled devices and services. This platform is managed by Qualcomm® SecureMSM™ technology, which is the security foundation for devices powered by Snapdragon processors, providing a high level of security and robustness while achieving a balance of high performance and optimal power efficiency. The Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform supports the ultimate in convenient mobile authentication and biometrics.
The Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform is part of a comprehensive end-to-end authentication and security solution with the option to further improve authentication simplicity using Qualcomm® Snapdragon Sense™ ID 3D fingerprint sensor technology, designed to allow OEMs to easily integrate QTI’s leading ultrasonic fingerprint sensor technology and algorithms into their smartphone designs, enabling enhanced authentication capabilities, usability and integration over legacy capacitive touch-based fingerprint technologies. Snapdragon Sense ID 3D fingerprint technology is an innovative approach to authentication that creates and verifies a detailed 3D image of a user's fingerprint using ultrasonic sound technology to confirm user identify with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.
The Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform offers enhanced authentication capabilities and usability over existing commercial methods of authentication by providing password-less authentication, enhanced security of biometric data and data processing, improved interoperability among FIDO-enabled devices, and addressing the challenge of creating and remembering multiple pin-codes and passwords. The Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform benefits operators and manufacturers by offering superior enhanced security, biometric usability and the most flexible integration options for their customers. These benefits result in faster development time, decreased costs of development, higher quality devices, valuable differentiation and increased demand from end-users. 
End users and consumers benefit from the technology’s ease of use, and from reduced reliance on passwords, and pin numbers. They also benefit from improved security and privacy, as well as the ability to easily interface with DOCOMO services along with “docomo ID login authentication and carrier billing payment,” as well as existing and future FIDO-enabled devices and services.

                    Momentum Is Gaining for Cellphones as Credit Cards                
People already use their cellphones to read e-mail messages, take pictures and play video games. Before long, they may use them in place of their wallets. By embedding in the cellphone a computer chip or other type of memory device, a phone can double as a credit card. The chip performs the same function as the magnetic strip on the back of a credit card, storing account information and other data necessary to make a purchase.

                    NTT DoCoMo Says Profit Declined 6% In First Half                
NTT DoCoMo reported today that its profit fell 6 percent for the most recent six-month period from a year earlier as price-cutting rivals lured customers away from the company, Japan's top provider of mobile phone service. In a market with nearly every potential mobile phone user already seeming to own one, DoCoMo is trying to fend off an assault by smaller rivals that are eager to capture a piece of its dominant market share.











                    One Bid Is In; Cell Company Awaits Others                
Cingular Wireless submitted a $35 billion bid yesterday for AT&T Wireless, according to people close to the auction, while Vodafone was putting the final touches on its offer and Nextel was said to be considering one. But NTT DoComo, which owns about a 17 percent stake in AT&T Wireless and had indicated that it was exploring a bid, has decided against participating in the auction, these people said.















                    NTT DoCoMo Earnings Aided By Sales of New Wireless Gear                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., the world's second-largest wireless carrier after Vodafone, said today that it earned 197 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in the three months to June, thanks to a new lineup of handsets with cameras and growing demand for high-speed phone service. DoCoMo is trying to regain its footing this year after two rough years in which new subscriptions to its mobile phone service slowed and investments overseas soured. The company has been badly outflanked by rivals who were quicker to offer phones with cameras and cheaper high-speed Internet connections, trends that have hurt DoCoMo's third-generation phone service.











                    Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: DoCoMo Reverses A Loss                
Helped by sales of its popular camera phones, NTT DoCoMo Inc. of Japan said yesterday that it earned 213 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company said it expected profit to nearly triple but revenue to grow just 1.9 percent this year. Ken Belson (NYT)











                    NTT DoCoMo Reports a Slight Profit                
NTT DoCoMo Inc. barely returned to profitability in the half-year to September, it said today, but it slashed its full-year forecasts. Its overseas investments soured, and its latest phones failed to catch on with finicky consumers. The dismal numbers cast a shadow over DoCoMo's ambitious introduction a year ago of what it hoped would be the world's first full-fledged third-generation phone network. The company, Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, hoped that by rolling out the technology ahead of competitors, it could corner the market on phones that offer video services, global roaming and higher speeds for sending data.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nippon Considers Write-Offs                
The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation will discuss with third parties whether it needs to book losses on the overseas investments of NTT DoCoMo Inc.in the six-month period ending Monday, the president of NTT, Norio Wada, left, said. His comment came after The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that DoCoMo is expected to book 500 billion yen ($4.07 billion) in valuation losses on its shareholdings in overseas companies. The NTT group will discuss the matter with third parties including auditing and consulting companies and investment banks, Mr. Wada said. DoCoMo said earlier that it would carry out any write-downs if necessary after it conducts an overall study of its businesses, including the value of overseas partners' shares and other factors.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Cellphone Shipments Plunge                
Shipments of mobile phones plunged in May as the Japanese market approached the saturation point. Japanese handset makers shipped 3.24 million units in May, 28 percent fewer than in May 2001. It was the 12th consecutive decline. NTT DoCoMo Inc. remains Japan's largest carrier with more than half of the market, but the company's third-generation phone technology has yet to catch on.

                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Loss For Telecom Concern                
Japan's leading mobile phone operator, NTT DoCoMo Inc., will probably post a loss for the fiscal year ending today, because of larger-than-expected losses on overseas investments. DoCoMo, the largest stock by capitalization on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will lose 100 billion yen ($758 million), the company's first full-year loss, according to a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun. DoCoMo is expected to take a one trillion yen ($7.6 billion) one-time loss, including a write-down of its $9.8 billion investment in AT&T Wireless Services. A decision on a write-down may be made today, the company's president, Keiji Tachikawa, said. Ken Belson (NYT)











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Faster Cellphones                
A leading operator of mobile phones, NTT DoCoMo Inc., expects to begin faster cellphone service in Europe in the second half of 2002, said its president, Keiji Tachikawa. DoCoMo expects Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd., the British-based telecommunications unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., led by the the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, to start the services. DoCoMo owns 20 percent of Hutchison 3G. DoCoMo, based in Tokyo, has spent about 600 billion yen ($5 billion) for stakes in European cellphone companies.











                    Japan Plan On Wireless To Be Delayed                
NTT DoCoMo Inc. said today that it would delay plans for the full commercial introduction of its next-generation wireless service, dealing a setback to the mobile communications industry. The company said it would miss the May 30 starting date for its much-anticipated third-generation, or 3G, wireless service. While the delay is expected to have little effect on DoCoMo's finances, it raises questions about when such services might be profitable.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA

                    BANK LOANS TO FINANCE AT&T STAKE                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's dominant cellular phone company, said it was borrowing 1.2 trillion yen ($10.3 billion) from five Japanese banks to pay for the 16 percent stake it is acquiring in AT&T Wireless Group. According to regulatory filings in the United States, the company plans to repay the loans in part with cash raised from the sale of 460,000 new shares of stock, which analysts expect the company to begin marketing to global investors today. DoCoMo turned to the banks after a 40 percent plunge in its stock price last fall limited its ability to sell new stock.

                    RAISING CASH FOR GROWTH                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., the Japanese mobile phone giant, has approached bankers about a possible sale of as much as 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) worth of new shares as it seeks ways to finance global expansion. The company is also considering listing its shares in the United States. Speculation about a big NTT DoCoMo offering has helped depress the Japanese stock market because of fears that there is not enough investor appetite to absorb all the new shares.

                    Momentum Is Gaining for Cellphones as Credit Cards                
People already use their cellphones to read e-mail messages, take pictures and play video games. Before long, they may use them in place of their wallets. By embedding in the cellphone a computer chip or other type of memory device, a phone can double as a credit card. The chip performs the same function as the magnetic strip on the back of a credit card, storing account information and other data necessary to make a purchase.

                    NTT DoCoMo Says Profit Declined 6% In First Half                
NTT DoCoMo reported today that its profit fell 6 percent for the most recent six-month period from a year earlier as price-cutting rivals lured customers away from the company, Japan's top provider of mobile phone service. In a market with nearly every potential mobile phone user already seeming to own one, DoCoMo is trying to fend off an assault by smaller rivals that are eager to capture a piece of its dominant market share.











                    One Bid Is In; Cell Company Awaits Others                
Cingular Wireless submitted a $35 billion bid yesterday for AT&T Wireless, according to people close to the auction, while Vodafone was putting the final touches on its offer and Nextel was said to be considering one. But NTT DoComo, which owns about a 17 percent stake in AT&T Wireless and had indicated that it was exploring a bid, has decided against participating in the auction, these people said.














                    NTT DoCoMo Earnings Aided By Sales of New Wireless Gear                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., the world's second-largest wireless carrier after Vodafone, said today that it earned 197 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in the three months to June, thanks to a new lineup of handsets with cameras and growing demand for high-speed phone service. DoCoMo is trying to regain its footing this year after two rough years in which new subscriptions to its mobile phone service slowed and investments overseas soured. The company has been badly outflanked by rivals who were quicker to offer phones with cameras and cheaper high-speed Internet connections, trends that have hurt DoCoMo's third-generation phone service.











                    Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: DoCoMo Reverses A Loss                
Helped by sales of its popular camera phones, NTT DoCoMo Inc. of Japan said yesterday that it earned 213 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company said it expected profit to nearly triple but revenue to grow just 1.9 percent this year. Ken Belson (NYT)











                    NTT DoCoMo Reports a Slight Profit                
NTT DoCoMo Inc. barely returned to profitability in the half-year to September, it said today, but it slashed its full-year forecasts. Its overseas investments soured, and its latest phones failed to catch on with finicky consumers. The dismal numbers cast a shadow over DoCoMo's ambitious introduction a year ago of what it hoped would be the world's first full-fledged third-generation phone network. The company, Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, hoped that by rolling out the technology ahead of competitors, it could corner the market on phones that offer video services, global roaming and higher speeds for sending data.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nippon Considers Write-Offs                
The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation will discuss with third parties whether it needs to book losses on the overseas investments of NTT DoCoMo Inc.in the six-month period ending Monday, the president of NTT, Norio Wada, left, said. His comment came after The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that DoCoMo is expected to book 500 billion yen ($4.07 billion) in valuation losses on its shareholdings in overseas companies. The NTT group will discuss the matter with third parties including auditing and consulting companies and investment banks, Mr. Wada said. DoCoMo said earlier that it would carry out any write-downs if necessary after it conducts an overall study of its businesses, including the value of overseas partners' shares and other factors.

Shipments of mobile phones plunged in May as the Japanese market approached the saturation point. Japanese handset makers shipped 3.24 million units in May, 28 percent fewer than in May 2001. It was the 12th consecutive decline. NTT DoCoMo Inc. remains Japan's largest carrier with more than half of the market, but the company's third-generation phone technology has yet to catch on.

Japan's leading mobile phone operator, NTT DoCoMo Inc., will probably post a loss for the fiscal year ending today, because of larger-than-expected losses on overseas investments. DoCoMo, the largest stock by capitalization on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will lose 100 billion yen ($758 million), the company's first full-year loss, according to a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun. DoCoMo is expected to take a one trillion yen ($7.6 billion) one-time loss, including a write-down of its $9.8 billion investment in AT&T Wireless Services. A decision on a write-down may be made today, the company's president, Keiji Tachikawa, said. Ken Belson (NYT)

DoCoMo owns 20 percent of Hutchison 3G. DoCoMo, based in Tokyo, has spent about 600 billion yen ($5 billion) for stakes in European cellphone companies.

NTT DoCoMo Inc. said today that it would delay plans for the full commercial introduction of its next-generation wireless service, dealing a setback to the mobile communications industry. The company said it would miss the May 30 starting date for its much-anticipated third-generation, or 3G, wireless service.
