United Kingdom (VDSL)

British Telecom and resellers:

Openreach, the Access Network delivery arm of BT Group conducted successful trials of VDSL using FTTC technology in the Muswell Hill area of North London. Following this trial national rollout commenced under the banner of NGA (Next Generation Access) starting with selected exchange areas around the UK. The product initially offered downstream bit rates of up to 40 Mbit/s and upstream of up to 10 Mbit/s dependent on the distance between the new DSLAM street-cabinet and the end user's premises, and by late 2012, this had increased to downstream bit rates of up to nearly 80 Mbit/s and upstream of up to 20 Mbit/s.[82] Alongside this Openreach are conducting additional trials into the deployment of FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) which although more expensive and complex to implement, can provide downstream rates of up to 110 Mbit/s and is thought to be more future proofed than FTTC. Recently this has been improved to 330 Mbit/s downstream and 30 Mbit/s upstream. Original projections indicated that FTTC was significantly cheaper to implement than FTTP; however, current thinking is that the cost difference between the two technologies may be smaller than first envisaged.
As of 2011, the Openreach product is also resold by other ISPs.

Other providers:

A number of smaller regional ISPs also exist and sell VDSL based services.

The network offers up to 40 Mbit/s downstream and up to 10 Mbit/s upstream with an assured level of service. The infrastructure consists of FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) with sub loop unbundling to provide the last mile connection to the consumer via existing copper.




United Kingdom (VDSL2)

This has been achieved by increasing ANFP spectrum usage to 17 MHz. BT announce FTTP On Demand — a GPON based service to extend the fibre overlay in FTTC areas direct to the home to subscribers willing to pay (install costs not yet announced expected to be in high hundreds of pounds).

On 8 October 2009, it was revealed that Virgin Media will trial VDSL2. Residents of Higher Pill, in Saltash, and nearby Hatt will be offered free broadband via a VDSL2 line to a roadside cabinet. The cabinets will be linked to Virgin Media backhaul via new fibre laid by Vtesse Networks through BT's local exchange, 5 km away.[90]

The trial eventually resulted in Vtesse networks running the final service without Virgin Media's involvement under their own brand on 1 October 2010.

Digital Region Ltd, an EU government-backed project formed by the four main councils in South Yorkshire – Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley, along with the Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, have rolled out VDSL2 services to over 80% of the county. The network was shut down in August 2014 having never passed 5,000 subscribers. The street furniture was disconnected from the power circuits (it piggybacked off streetlighting) in September through November.
LittleBigOne also joined the network in 2011, offering 40Mbit/s VDSL services, including the first UK IPTV over VDSL service, which launched in early 2012. They will also be offering an "up to 100Mbit" service starting in May 2012.[needs update]
On 14 April 2010, Rutland Telecom announced that it is to deliver broadband speeds up to 40 Mbit/s using a fibre to the cabinet solution in the Welsh notspot village of Erbistock. The initiative, backed by private investment, will be the first time that VDSL2 technology has been used in a Welsh rural village.[91]

Canada (VDSL)


VDSL is offered in urban areas by MTS in Manitoba, SaskTel in Saskatchewan, Telus, Lightspeed, WestNet and Nucleus (ISP) in Alberta and British Columbia, Bell Internet, Nexicom, Acanac, Contact[92] and TekSavvy in Ontario, Bell Internet and Telus in Quebec, Bell Aliant in Atlantic Canada, and Bell TV's service in some large multi-residential buildings in certain urban centres.




Canada (VDSL2)


SaskTel, a crown corporation of the province of Saskatchewan, has officially announced the deployment of VDSL2. SaskTel is using VDSL2 to increase the amount of bandwidth to its customers, allowing more HDTV streams with its MAX Entertainment Service. The extra bandwidth also allows SaskTel to offer their "Ultra" service providing 25 Mbit/s download and 2 Mbit/s upload to non-IPTV customers.
Bell Canada is currently offering VDSL2 in some areas of Ontario and Quebec with speeds reaching 50 Mbit/s download and 10 Mbit/s upload, marketed as Bell Fibe Internet, or part of the Bell Fibe TV package. For Fibe TV distance from cabinet to receiver must be equal to or less than 900 meters. Bell originally deployed Lucent Stinger remote SLAMs which did not conform to ITU G.993.2 spec and as a result is not compatible with standard VDSL2 modems and requires a custom firmware from modem vendors. Bell has recently started to deploy Alcatel-Lucent 7330 remote SLAMs which do conform to ITU G.993.2 spec and customers served on those are able to use standard VDSL2 modems.
TELUS is offering VDSL2 in a large percentage of its footprint in British Columbia, Alberta and parts of Québec with speeds reaching 25 Mbit/s download and 5 Mbit/s upload, marked as TELUS High Speed Turbo 25 (on the 8b profile), or part of a TELUS Optik TV package. The 17A profile is now being deployed everywhere with a 50Mbit/s download and 10Mbit/s maximum upload. If the residence does not qualify for the 17A profile then they are also deploying a pair bonding solution if the address has two available cable pairs using the Actiontec V2000H router. Both services (pair bonding and single pair) are marketed as High Speed 50 or Optik 50.[93][94] TELUS is the third company in the world to deploy a commercial VDSL2 Bonding solution and to offer speeds up to 50 Mbit/s.
Lightspeed Communications is offering VDSL2 in a large percentage of its footprint in British Columbia and Alberta with speeds reaching 100 Mbit/s download and 20 Mbit/s upload, where supported.[95]
[Bell MTS], Bell MTS operating in the province of Manitoba, Offers VDSL2 in multiple communities. They currently offer VDSL2 speeds of up to 50 down and 5, depending on distance this is sometimes achieved via pair bonding. Bell MTS also provides POTS and IPTV over this network on both copper and fiber, typically using the Arris 5168 modem or the new Home Hub HH3300. They can provide up to 100 down, but rarely do this on the aging copper network. The company claims "65 per cent of Manitoba households will have access to very high-speed Internet delivered by FTTH or VDSL technology." Communities with Fiber service can be provided with 25,50,100,150,300 or 1GPS download speed. The other communities outside of VDSL2 or fiber are generally able to qualify for ADSL service.

New Zealand (VDSL)


VDSL2 is widely available in towns and cities throughout New Zealand that have been cabinetised as part of Chorus' NGN (Next Generation Network) rollout. Available profiles are 8B (50 Mbit/s) and 17A (100 Mbit/s); which profile is deployed is determined automatically by a process called Dynamic Line Management and may change due to changes in the stability or noise levels on the line.[102] All plans are upload speed limited to 10 Mbit/s.
VDSL2 was made available to some business customers of Vodafone New Zealand utilising the network assets of TelstraClear[103] (which Vodafone acquired in 2012). Vodafone went on to make VDSL available to all customers on January 23, 2014.[104]




New Zealand (VDSL2)


TelstraClear (now Vodafone NZ) has begun offering VDSL2 through 140 cabinets on its own Next IP Network in seven city centres. The VDSL2 service is currently available in business districts of Wellington, Hamilton, Tauranga, Napier, Wanganui, New Plymouth, Lower Hutt, and parts of Auckland, offering download speeds up to 30 Mbit/s and upload speeds up to 7 Mbit/s. TelstraClear plans to expand coverage by Christmas 2008 to Dunedin, Palmerston North, Christchurch, Auckland, North Shore, Manukau and Waitakere.

						Drive-Away Awnings
                        	
					

						
                        At Outwell we aim to provide maximum choice of quality drive-away awnings to suit all needs and our portfolio now features four superb collections: Smart Air Touring, Air Crusing, Touring and Crusing.  The luxury Smart Air Touring drive-away awnings feature our new Advanced Air System that incorporates our tried and tested One-go Inflation Technology for fast inflation from a single point. The new Air Crusing awnings use our new Rigid Air System for even simpler and easy erection. Touring and Crusing feature traditional pole systems that have stood the test of time and still remain popular with many motorhomers. Various attachment heights and features, like our Link Access Zone System, make an Outwell drive-away awning the intelligent, versatile choice for smaller units like campervans and conversions.
					










									        Smart Air Touring Tent Collection
								        



								Outwell Smart Air Touring Collection inflatable drive away awnings can be left freestanding to secure the site pitch on days out. For 2017, two new models are added with all the easy pitching drive-away awnings benefiting further from our drive for perfection. Featuring the Advanced Air Tube System with One-go Inflation Technology, awnings can be pitched swiftly – a real plus, particularly in bad weather. All awnings come packed in a durable carrybag with sturdy zip and handles.

For 2017, our Outwell Link Access Zone with Side Door sees the full-length connection element now elasticised, a tension strap added to the bottom, a firmer attachment of the awning groundsheet to vehicles with an attachment height of 180-220cm and 240-290cm for the tall version using magnets and the awning door direction turned for greater convenience. The result is a neater, fuss-free connection of the valance that ensures effective closure of the gap between the ground and vehicle, cutting out draughts and complementing the Outwell Sealed Ground System

								The versatile Outwell Touring Collection of drive-away awnings offers extra storage and living space for couples and families on the move. As freestanding designs, campers can rely on the steel poles, Outwell Easy Pegging System and patented Outwell Wind Stabilizer System to ensure their awning will be stable and secure when left on its own for the evening or on days out exploring. For 2017, our enhanced Outwell Link Access Zone with Side Door sees the full-length connection element now elasticised, a tension strap added to the bottom, a firmer attachment of the awning groundsheet to vehicles using magnets and the awning door direction turned for greater convenience.
