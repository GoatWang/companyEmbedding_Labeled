Everything just works. Under both asterisk systems, I would routinely get dropped calls and/or lose outbound audio. I have a commercial 50/10 Comcast cable Internet connection and use Vitelity as my VOIP provider. Both Comcast and Vitelity were blamed by various parties as the problem. The Cisco UC320W works fine with both. I replaced my collection of Polycom phones with Cisco SPA504's and SPA525's. System setup took about 5 hours.While Digium charges 2K for the AA50 appliance and wants another 400.00 dollars or so a year after the first year in maintenance, Cicso charges about 700.00 for the UC320W and no annual maintenance. Digium does not advise you to place your AA50 directly on the Internet, while Cisco expects you to. The Cisco is also a fine firewall/router/wireless hostspot if you want a single box Internet edge solution.My total cost for 6 SP504 phones, a SPA525 phone, and the UC320W was $1818.00! That included next day shipping from Amazon. That's 182.00 less than the AA50 appliance by itself.Update April 2012.The Cisco system is still working great. No dropped calls, no significant audio distortion, regular firmware updates, and Cisco just added ring down support so you can add things like door phones.Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsAvoid at all costs.ByAndrewon August 31, 2015Verified PurchaseThis system has a lot of quirks and is a bear to install.  The concept of this unit is that it can act as your wireless router + your phone system.  However its features as a router are quite weak and you probably already have one that is already set up and working fine.  However it is very difficult to get this to work with an existing router because it requires that you connect two ethernet cords from it into your router in a way such that it creates a network loop and disables your entire network until your router is properly configured.  And that 2nd ethernet cable by the way is there purely so that the system can download updates (which there are none anymore) and set its own time from the internet.  You will likely end up needing to buy a new cisco managed switch or cisco router to get this to work if the router isn't up to the task.  Much of the product documentation is unavailable unless you sign up to become a "cisco partner."  It only works with 2 types of cisco phones, and the less expensive one has an interface which isn't so great.  I though that Cisco made top notch products until I bought this.  The system also does not support remote extensions (for employees working from home for example) in case you need it.  The bottom line is that Cisco products are not intended for the end users to install and support themselves.  They really are quite a bit more complicated to set up and require people that are trained and certified by Cisco to handle.  Once installed properly, it works well fine, but there have got to be better solutions out there.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsPart of our new phone systemByEEPon August 29, 2012Verified PurchaseWe have a small office with about 5 employees. I needed a phone system that worked well for us. I went out to local suppliers and they all tried to ripe me off. I looked at the different systems and decided I wanted the Cisco system. I did not want to pay the outragious prices they quoted so I bought it myself through Amazon. With the help of a local IT person to help me install it.  I ended up with a great system and spent about $3000 total which saved me about $3500+. It was a little difficut to install but once we figured everything out it works great.Read more0Comment|

It was initially difficult to set up, but as soon as we were able to figure out the VLAN aspect of the configuration, it was smooth sailing from there.We used this in-tandem with a few 525G/525G2 IP Phones, the features are fantastic. I will recommend these combination to anyone seeking to implement IP phone in their establishments.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat system for the price!ByE. Walkeron January 23, 2013Verified PurchaseEasy to install. A bit different then other VoIP systems, but everyone has differences. Has a video to watch upon first log-in for installation/configuration tips. I had to upgrade the firmware, but it almost did it itself. Had a few minor issues with FXO line group assignment and the page connection was tricky ( more the amp then the UC320W).All in all great product, great price.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat SystemByBradon October 10, 2013Verified PurchaseI set this up at my church about 2-3 years ago, and there has not been any problems in any of the 10 or so Cisco phones or with the phone system itself.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsLasted about 6 monthsByRicardo Castilloon November 15, 2013Verified PurchaseStopped working after 6 months, no repair possible.

By Bianca Allery,  Google+ profile
Posted on : May 07, 2014, Last modified on : June 16, 2015
 


LONDON, UK and PARIS, FRANCE 07 MAY 2014 – 3CX, developer of the award-winning Windows VoIP PBX 3CX Phone System, announces that the interoperability testing with the French VoIP Service Provider, Keyyo, has proven successful, allowing 3CX customers to use Keyyo as a VoIP Provider.
The success of the interoperability testing guarantees full operation of all 3CX Phone System’s features enabling 3CX customers to make cost-effective calls. With the technical support provided by both 3CX and Keyyo, as well as regular testing of the configuration templates, customers can be reassured of an excellent service.
Setting up Keyyo as the VoIP Provider of choice is very easy, meaning that IT Administrators can complete the process in minutes with a few clicks of the mouse. 3CX Phone System customers can select Keyyo SIP trunking service from within the VoIP Providers’ node of 3CX Management Console, which will automatically configure their inbound and outbound rules to make and receive calls.

Keyyo

Large internet and IP telephony carrier based in France
Formerly known as Phone Systems & Network

Siemon Products/Services

VersaPOD Data Center Cabinets
Zero-U Vertical cable management and patching solutions


Challenge
Keyyo is a large French internet and IP
telephony carrier and thanks to strong
growth, their two data centers were
bursting at the seams. They needed a
third data center and needed it fast.
Their only option was to rent colo
space.
With colo space being expensive, it was
critical for Keyyo to maximize their colo
investment by fully utilizing the floor
space with as much equipment and
infrastructure as they could reliably
manage.
Solution
Siemon's VersaPOD data center cabinet
was an ideal solution. VersaPOD's Zero-U
vertical cable zones gave them plenty of
space to route and manage their high-density
cabling channels with room to grow.
Vertical patching also gave them ability to
preserve horizontal mounting space for
equipment by moving patching needs to
the vertical zero-u space.
For Keyyo, cable management wasn't just
about network cabling The ability to vertically
mount PDUs allowed them to shorten
power cords and eliminate a major source
of congestion to improve air flow.
Results
VersaPOD's additional space allowed
Keyyo to make the most of their colo
space, creating a high density environment
without compromising the ability to
manage this infrastructure and fully support
their customers' high-performance
internet and VoIP needs.
Keyyo was so pleased with VersaPOD
that they actually use the installation as a
showcase for potential clients.
