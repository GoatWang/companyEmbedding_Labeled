Polyester and Synthetic Fiber





		 

		The textile business was the very first foundation-laying operation of Far Eastern Group. Beginning with spinning and weaving and later expanding to the upstream polyester synthetic fiber line, it is Taiwan's first textile and polyester manufacturer to complete vertical integration.

		 



		The textile industry is one of the basic commodity industries and was also the Far Eastern Group's first business fields. Far Eastern Textile, the Group's core textile business, was established in 1949 (it was renamed to Far Eastern New Century in 2009), and accounts for one-fourth of the Group's total revenues.

		With the goals of global positioning and maximum total efficiency, Far Eastern New Century has established polyester industry and textile industry groups. Companies operated under the polyester industry Group include: Far Eastern New Century's Hsinpu fiber plant and Kuanyin plant in Taiwan, Far Eastern Industries (Shanghai), and Wuhan Far Eastern New Material. The Group's 2011 polyester production capacity is over 2 million tons, making Far Eastern one of the world’s five largest polyester manufacturers. Products include polyester chip, PET bottles, PET films, polyester fiber, and more. Far Eastern New Century also is the first company that endeavors to achieve green production in the industry. In addition to using recycled polyester materials and biodegradable materials, the company is actively developing biomass materials to replace traditional petrochemical materials. In 2008, the Far Eastern Group acquired full ownership of Far Eastern Fibertech—the biggest nylon 66 manufacturer—expanding the scope of the Group's polyester and nylon operations.

		The Textile Industry Group has operations in Taiwan, Southeast Asia and China. Production locations for cotton, knitting and dyeing, industrial fabrics, and apparel, have been established in China since 1997. The green products produced by Far Eastern New Century have become international brand names' top choice due to the combined advantages of vertical integration and outstanding R&D capabilities. >
		
			The Group's Sino Belgium Beer (Suzhou) introduced the innovative beer packaging material CoolerpakTM, an energy-saving, carbon-reducing, safe and hygienic PET beer bottle. There is no question that this new product will set a new trend and start a new era in the PET industry.
