Hong Kong Listed Companies Beware – First Ruling in Relation to New Disclosure Obligations
December 1, 2016




The Hong  Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal (MMT)  has made its first finding of breaches of the disclosure obligations that were  introduced in 2013. In its decision in  relation to AcrossAsia Limited (AcrossAsia),  the MMT found the company and its senior executives had failed to disclose  information in relation to proceedings in Indonesia as soon as reasonably  practicable. The decision was made on 7  November 2016 with the report and orders being handed down on 30 November 2016.
The Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) commenced proceedings against AcrossAsia in July 2015 alleging a failure to  disclose what the SFC described as highly sensitive inside information as soon  as reasonably practicable. The SFC has  also commenced proceedings against the Chairman, Albert Saychuan Cheok, and  CEO, Vicente Binalhay Ang, for their reckless or negligent conduct causing  the alleged breach.   
The  proceedings were the first to be commenced under the disclosure regime that  came into effect on 1 January 2013. The  information in question related to litigation between AcrossAsia and a  subsidiary in Indonesia which had resulted in an insolvency petition being  filed against AcrossAsia. The relevant  dates in relation to the disclosure of the information were: 

20 December 2012 – the petition in the  proceedings was filed 
2 January 2013 – the petition and other relevant  court documents (which was in Bahasa Indonesia) was received by the company in  Hong Kong 
4 January 2013 – English translations of the  court documents were provided to Cheok and Ang 
9, 10, and 14 January 2013 – Cheok and Ang  attended hearings of the petition in Indonesia 
15 January 2013 – the Indonesian court granted  the orders sought by the petition and AcrossAsia sought a suspension of trading
17 January 2013 – the Company disclosed the  information in relation to the petition to the market. 

Following  the disclosure of the information and the resumption of trading on 22 February  2013, the share price fell by 22.5%.
All three of  the defendants made admissions as to the facts and agreed that they had failed  to disclose inside information as soon as reasonably practicable. Cheok and Ang also admitted that they  were negligent in failing to cause AcrossAsia to disclose the information in a  timely manner. As a result of the  admissions, the SFC did not pursue recklessness as a grounds against the two  individuals. After considering the  evidence, the Tribunal agreed to proceed on that basis and in doing so took  into account the fact that the individuals were construing newly introduced  legislation and the court documents were not in English and related to foreign  proceedings with which they were not familiar. 
An  interesting part of the MMT’s Report relates to the date at which the failure  to disclose arose. The SFC’s case was  that the failure arose on 4 January 2013 when the documents were made available  in English, whereas AcrossAsia and Cheok argued that it should be 8 January  2013 when legal advice was obtained in relation to the documents. The MMT took the view that the wording of the  section, specifically “as soon as reasonably practicable” suggested that it was  appropriate for legal advice to be obtained before any disclosure was required  to be made. The Tribunal agreed that it  would have been unrealistic to expect an announcement on 4 January 2013 before  the company had had the opportunity to seek legal advice and went on to say  “[c]learly you cannot announce what you don’t understand”. That finding should provide some comfort to  listed companies, although it will not protect a company that delays in  obtaining legal advice about such issues.  
The MMT  found that the appropriate fine in each case should be HK$800,000 but  discounted the fine issued to AcrossAsia and Ang to HK$600,000 in recognition  of fact that their admissions had been offered at an earlier stage than Choek’s. Cheok and Ang were also  ordered to complete a training program on compliance with the inside  information disclosure requirements. Costs were awarded, both in respect of the MMT proceeding and the SFC  investigation. The MMT specifically  noted that, although this was the first case to be decided under the new  provisions, it was not appropriate for it to impose a deterrent sentence  disproportionate to the level of culpability in this case.  
There are a  number of other pending cases in relation to alleged breaches of the disclosure  obligations as the SFC continues to focus on compliance by listed companies  with the disclosure obligations and, if the SFC is successful, it will be  interesting to see how the penalties compare.

Probability Of Bankruptcy AnalysisFor stocks, Probability Of Bankruptcy is normalized value of Z-Score. For funds and ETFs it is derived from a multi-factor model developed by Macroaxis. The score is used to predict probability of a firm or a fund experiencing financial distress within next 24 months. Unlike Z-Score, Probability Of Bankruptcy is the value between 0 and 100 indicating the actual probability the firm will be distressed in the next 2 fiscal years.ACROSSASIA Probability Of Bankruptcy  = Normalized     Z-Score  = 51 %More About Probability Of Bankruptcy | All Equity AnalysisAbout Probability Of BankruptcyProbability of Bankruptcy SHOULD NOT be confused with actual chance of a company to file for chapter 7, 11, 12 or 13 bankruptcy protection. Macroaxis simply defines Financial Distress as an operational condition where a company is having difficulty to meet its current financial obligations towards its  creditors or to deliver on the expectations of its investors. Macroaxis derives these conditions on a daily bases from both public financial statements as well as analysis of stock prices reacting to market conditions or economic downturns including short term and long term historical volatility. Other factors taken into account include analysis of liquidity, revenues patterns, R&D expenses and commitments, as well as public headlines and social sentiment.Compare to competitionBased on  latest financial disclosure  ACROSSASIA has Probability Of Bankruptcy of 51%. This is 18.52% higher than that of the Technology sector, and 17.62% higher than that of Wireless Communications industry, The Probability Of Bankruptcy for all stocks is 32.43% lower than the firm.
