Telus Corporation (TSX:T)(NYSE:TU) is one of the top telecommunications companies in the country, and 2017 will bring much of the same success that 2016 had in store.
The stock grew 11.8% last year, and it has started the new year positively, growing slightly as it put itself in a position to succeed moving forward. Telus is one of several companies looking to the future by testing the cutting-edge data technology for mobile devices known as 5G which will soon dominate the telecommunications industry.
Customers will not be happy to hear that the company is slashing the monthly savings rate for home services bundles by $2-3 per product as of March 1 due to increased costs of the product’s infrastructure. However, plenty of good will come from such a sacrifice: its networks and services will be better than ever as their speed and reliability will be improved.
Telus is shifting its attention towards home services, which currently exist in Alberta and British Columbia. The company injected $370 million into a Vancouver infrastructure, $275 million in Edmonton, and $130 million in Calgary about eight months ago. Additionally, it was the first telecommunications provider to roll out 4K TV in western Canada this past July.
Another move that spells success in the future for the company was improving Moto Z devices by updating its Android operating system to Nougat about three weeks ago. Improved features of the operating system include multi-window support, bundled notifications, and compatibility with virtual-reality platform Daydream.
Telus is a partner company of HTML500, which is an event where you can learn how to code for free. This creation will begin in Toronto on February 18 before reaching Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Victoria, Saskatoon, and three other cities. The move proves the company’s commitment towards technological advancement as 2,500 people of all ages will participate. More than 50% of these will be women.
The company recently added an update to its servers that allows smartphone owners to make phone calls using Wi-Fi if connected. This marks a nice alternative to using data that many top companies in North America are using. Naturally, texting and receiving calls and multimedia messages can still be used through Wi-Fi.
Philanthropy has also become a part of  Telus’s philosophy as the company recently donated $5 million to Child Health BC Initiative. This will ensure that children that are part of BC Children’s Hospital will have expanded access to health tech throughout the province. The company also donated $5,000 to create a recreation trail between Vernon and Kelowna in BC.
Investors are set to cash in on T stock as the company has an impressive dividend yield of 4.4% and a market capitalization of $25.86 billion to go along with a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.59. The stock has a consensus price target of $45.50.
It was a good end to 2016 and it’s been a good beginning to 2017 for Telus, which continues to be as relevant as ever. With the moves to advance its TV, internet, and smartphone services, the company has offerings that plenty of customers are set to enjoy, despite higher prices for its services.

NEW! This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon In 1997

For only the 5th time in over 14 years, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner just issued a Buy Recommendation on this recent Canadian IPO. 
Stock Advisor Canada’s Chief Investment Adviser, Iain Butler, also recommended this company back in March – and it’s already up a whopping 57%!

This Recent “Buy” Alert Is Already Up 235% -- But It’s Not
Too Late To Get In! -- Click Here To Find Out More!

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Abstract:

 The chief financial officer (CFO) of TELUS Corporation (Telus) has just been informed that Moody's, a bond rating service, has downgraded the firm's credit rating to one notch below investment grade. The CFO's challenge is to determine what specific actions, if any, to recommend to the firm's audit committee. First, this case facilitates a discussion on how changes in capital structure impact a firm's earnings, stock price and flexibility to carry out plan. Second, students learn about how bond ratings are set and how a firm's bond rating affects its bond yield. Last, by focusing on the situation faced by Telus during challenging market conditions in 2002, students learn how to manage relationships with investors while in the midst of change.

Listened to customers' feedback and put
        them first by simplifying fees


TORONTO -As part of the company's
        commitment to putting customers first and being fair and
        transparent, TELUS today announced it will no longer charge
        a $35 activation fee for new customers or a $25 equipment
        exchange fee for renewing customers who purchase a new
        device. TELUS is the first of the established brands to
        eliminate activation fees as part of the company's ongoing
        efforts to make the customer experience clear, simple and
        easy.


As part of its clear and simple pricing initiatives,
        TELUS is  continuing its journey to be fair and
        transparent and help customers understand when they are
        paying for tangible products or value-added services.
        Effective November 1, TELUS will begin charging $10 for SIM
        cards to cover the product cost that was previously
        included in their renewal and activation fees. With the new
        SIM card charge factored in, new and renewing customers can
        breathe a sigh of relief knowing that they will see a net
        upfront saving. A new SIM card is only
        required when customers don't already have a compatible
        TELUS SIM card for their device.


"The wireless industry and competitive landscape have
        changed over the years and with that, our customers' needs
        have evolved," said Brent Johnston, vice-president,
        Mobility Solutions, TELUS. "Our customers have told us they
        feel activation and renewal fees are unfair. We have been
        listening and that's why we're giving them exactly what
        they've asked for."


TELUS is putting customers first and embracing new
        ideas to make the TELUS experience better. By listening to
        customers, TELUS has not only eliminated activation fees,
        it has dramatically simplified its entire fee schedule.
        This builds on a series of improvements made over the past
        several years where TELUS has also eliminated carrier 911
        and system access fees on all its Clear and Simple rate
        plans, reduced bill shock with Flex Data Plans, Data
        Notifications and Worry-free Travel, added Caller ID and
        Voicemail as standard on all TELUS rate plans, simplified
        device pricing with Anytime Upgrades and revolutionized
        mobility contracts by introducing a Device Balance instead
        of the dreaded contract termination fee.
