Globacom is the latest player in the expanding mobile telecommunications market in Nigeria. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) awarded the company the fourth Nigerian digital mobile licence in August 2002 for US$200m, along with the permission to construct the second fixed line network in the country. 
Globacom was pronounced by the NCC as the 'second national operator' (SNO). Driven by the success of Globacom and GSM in Nigeria, the NCC is now considering a new round of GSM licensing and expects to award new licenses in 2006.
Globacom's GSM system was officially launched in the Nigerian capital Abuja, followed by the cities of Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt and Ijebu Ode in late 2003. These met the terms of the licence requiring the provision of facilities for 150,000 mobile telecoms subscribers in the first year. By 2004 the company had a 25% market share and were prepared for even greater expansion.
Globacom currently has 5.2 million subscribers and now has capacity for 12 million more. This covers areas of population concentration and makes provision for services to be available to outlying regions of the country as well. The company is making investments into the GSM system in excess of NGN91.11bn ($724m). 
Globacom still has the only 2.5G GSM network in Nigeria, although Starcomm has recently signed a deal with Chinese Huawei to construct a 3G CDMA 2000 1 × EV-DO network, which could put Globacom's nose out of joint. Globacom itself is consolidating and has signed an interconnectivity agreement with MTN, another large Nigerian operator, allowing customers to use both networks. The company has also appointed 350 dealers across the country to pull in subscribers.
NETWORK EXPANSION - MICROWAVE ANTENNAS
Siemens was commissioned to expand Globacom's GSM network into northern Nigeria in 2004. The system uses Radio Frequency Systems (RFS) equipment. RFS supplies high and ultra high performance antennas to build up a microwave backbone system for the new mobile network. The solid body antennas range in diameter from 6ft to 15ft and can provide link distances of up to 50km.
Delivery of the first batch of RFS microwave antennas was scheduled for May 2004, with installation and commissioning by Siemens to continue into early 2005. The resulting network extension provided GSM coverage to more than 20 cities and roads in the north of Nigeria. This project has now been completed with great success and Globacom is considering expanding its microwave system to improve coverage even further.
GSM NETWORK UPGRADE AND EXPANSION
Alcatel already has a good relationship with Globacom, having carried out a previous expansion project in Nigeria involving the upgrade and expansion of the GSM network to over 32 Nigerian cities in late 2003/early 2004. The deal involved the provision of an additional 100,000 fixed wireless local loops, three international gateways, a fibre optics backbone ring and additional transmission equipment across the country. 
Included was the provision of Alcatel's Intelligent Network (IN) solution and messaging suite. This allowed enhanced mobile voice and data services, including 2.5G high-speed data rates and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS).
FIXED AND MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
The latest Alcatel project in Nigeria (announced in February 2005) has involved the provision of a fixed and mobile telecommunications network and implementation, installation, and integration with the existing networks, alongside testing and commissioning.
Alcatel have provided multi-standard Evolium radio access and core network solutions as well as transmission solutions. The contract also included the deployment of a new Multi-Service IP (MSIP) network using data-aware optical technology, which has enabled Globacom to be the first company in Africa to provide triple play (voice, video and data) services.
Globacom will also later be able to offer voice and symmetric DSL services to a wider number of business and residential clients, as well as delivering new high-speed internet access and broadband multimedia services such as video-on-demand, video conferencing and broadcast TV. The services will be available initially in ten major cities. The network will meet the growing subscriber demand and facilitate migration towards next generation technology for future networks.
The network expansion is still being rolled out to outlying areas and as of early 2006 has covered over 25 towns in the first four weeks of the year. One of the latest additions to the network is Obudu Cattle Ranch, Nigeria's foremost natural tourist resort, along with the surrounding communities. The Glo Mobile network is also penetrating deeper into Benue State; it was rolled out in Oju, Anywuogbu, Ochimodi, Ega, and Ogengen. 
In addition to Imo State, the towns of Nkwere and Ideato have now been switched on (February 2006). Also covered in this rapid rollout are Iju/Itaogbolu in Ondo State, Odekpe in Anambra, Keffi in Nassarawa, Itoikin in Lagos, Omu-Aran in Kwara, Uwana, Afikpo and Amezi in Ebonyi State. Other towns currently being covered are Owode-Yewa, Ago-Ilaro, Oke-Odan, Ilaro and Idiroko in Ogun State, Igbere in Abia, Igbetti, Pariya in Adamawa State and Ogboro in Oyo State. 
The following state capitals, Gusau in Zamfara state, Damaturu in Yobe State, Birnin Kebbi in Kebbi state and Dutse in Jigawa, are also to come onto the Globacom network before the end of March 2006. With these cities joining the network, Glo will have effectively covered every state capital in the country. 
Other towns in the north of the country expected to join the Globacom coverage map within this period include Potiskum, Hadejia, Gokana, Gumel Jalawa, Gashal and Shagari town. The Globacom network currently covers over 12,000 cities and towns across Nigeria along with their connecting roads. The plan in the first half of 2006 is to deploy 800 new cell sites. 
It seems that Globacom is dedicated to providing the best coverage for any GSM network in Nigeria and is aiming to prove this to subscribers. The company is also currently wooing subscribers toward their network by giving away 180 Kia Picanto cars over 180 days to subscribers. 
Alcatel are also aiding the deployment of the fixed line network for Globacom and are currently (March 2006) in the middle of deploying an 8,600 km submarine cable for Globacom, which will connect Nigeria to England and will significantly expand the country’s international connectivity. 
Globacom will then be able to connect with the Americas via the UK, which will benefit the telecommunications industry and also help the industrial and commercial development of the economy.
GLOBACOM SERVICES
Globacom has consistently been in the fore when it comes to providing subscribers with value services. It was the first Nigerian telecoms network to introduce the preferred per-second billing system (which other Nigerian mobile operators will not introduce until 2007), the multimedia messaging service, text-2-email, mobile Internet, Glo Direct, Magic Plus, N1SIM and free connection for post paid subscribers.

Overview[edit]
GLO has an estimate of over 34 million subscribers (April 2016) of which 26 million are internet subscribers [2]and it is a 100 percent Nigerian owned company.[3]
GLO built an $800 million high-capacity fibre-optic cable known as Glo-1, a submarine cable from the United Kingdom to Nigeria.[4]
Ownership[edit]
GLO is privately owned by the Mike Adenuga Group which also consists of ETB, now merged with the Sterling Bank, Conoil PLC, a petroleum marketing company, and Conoil Producing, a crude exploration company.[5]
Strategic business units[edit]
Glo Mobile[edit]
Glo Mobile, a subsidiary of GLO, is GLO’s Mobile Network Unit. In the first year of operation, it had one million subscribers in over 87 towns in Nigeria and over 120 billion Naira in revenues.[6] Glo Mobile has now spread to other African countries, namely Benin[7] and Ghana.[8]
Glo Gateway[edit]
Glo Gateway, a subsidiary of GLO, is GLO’s International Wholesale Voice and Data Exchange Trading Business Unit. Due to an expansion program which took place in 2008, Glo Gateway now[year needed] covers 140 countries under its roaming services, and it is currently connected to 235 networks.[8] 2008 also saw growth in Glo’s data roaming for mobile phones, laptops and BlackBerry handsets, which has now spread to 72 networks in 29 countries.[8] This now gives GLO the largest roaming coverage for voice and data in Africa.[3] Glo Gateway recently acquired a license in Côte d'Ivoire.
Broadband access[edit]
As a part of GLO’s service offering, Glo Broad Access will be improved by the laying of the fibre optic cable for the metro ring, which is progressing steadily.[citation needed] The Glo Broad Access was launched on the 24th of November 2009. Glo Broad Access offers landline telephones, broadband internet and video, all on a single digital wire line.
Glo 1 submarine cable[edit]
Glo-1 is the first successful submarine cable from the United Kingdom to Nigeria, and GLO is the first individual African company to embark on such a project.[9][10]
Glo-1 has the potential to provide high speed internet services, faster, more reliable and cheaper telecom services.[11] Glo-1 will potentially facilitate foreign investment and employment opportunities especially to Africans.
The 9,800 km long cable originates from Bude in the UK and is laid from this origin to Alpha Beach in Lagos, where it will have its Landing Station.[12] Glo-1 will also improve teleconferencing, distance learning, disaster recovery and telemedicine among several other benefits for Nigerians and the people of West Africa.[13]
By country[edit]
In August 2003, Glo Mobile was launched in Nigeria. Glo Mobile introduced lower tariffs, pay per second billing and alongside other value added services. Although Glo Mobile was the fourth GSM operator to launch in Nigeria, within seven years of the company's operation, its subscriber base has grown to over 25 million.[14]
In June 2008, Glo Mobile was launched in Benin. Glo Mobile showed unprecedented growth through the sale of 600,000 SIM cards in the first ten days of operation.[15] Glo Mobile offered Per Second Billing, which charges subscribers for the exact airtime used. They also offered other value added services such as MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), Glo Magic Plus news and information, vehicle tracking, musical ring-back tones and mobile banking.
In May 2008, GLO acquired an operating license through its Glo Mobile division in Ghana and plans to capture 30% of the current 11 million subscriber market within 18 months of launch.[16] They plan on achieving this goal by launching with bundled voice and Internet services for Ghana and through specifically targeting ‘un-serviced’ areas outside Ghana’s two major cities, Accra and Kumasi. Glo Mobile was set to launch in Ghana the first quarter of 2010.[17] This has however been postponed to the third quarter of 2011, and again to 2012. In January 2012, Glo Ghana opened the "Reserve your number" campaign, but still without opening the network. On April 8, 2011 GLO launched the sub-marine optical fiber GLO1, one part of its maiden operation in Ghana, to usher in another major player in the Ghana telecommunication industry.
In October 2009, GLO acquired submarine cable landing rights and International Gateway Services in Côte d'Ivoire.
History[edit]
In 2005, Glo Mobile introduced the Glo Fleet Manager which is a Vehicle Tracking Solution. Glo Fleet Manager helps transporters/fleet operators manage their fleet. They also introduced the Glo Mobile internet service which provides subscribers with access to internet sites which have been customized for mobile phone browsing.
In 2006, Glo Mobile introduced BlackBerry. GLO started the sponsorship of the Confederation of African Football African Player of the Year Award. The company also started the sponsorship of Glo Lagos International Half Marathon.
In 2009, Glo Mobile launched Blackberry prepaid services which gives subscribers options to pay daily, weekly or monthly for the service. Blackberry prepaid service gives subscribers free yahoo mail access and free blackberry messenger. The company also launched 3G High Speed Internet services through the sale of its 3G modem. Glo Mobile 3G network is available in Lagos, Abuja, Benin and PortHarcourt.

GCX has principal offices in Mumbai and Hong Kong in addition to offices in Australia, Belgium, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
History[edit]
GCX Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of RCOM, which is listed in India on the BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited and is one of India’s largest telecommunications service companies providing wireless, wire line, long-distance, voice, data, video and Internet communications services. RCOM is part of the Reliance Group, one of India’s largest business groups which has a significant presence in the telecommunications, financial services, and entertainment, energy and infrastructure sectors.
Global Cloud Xchange was formed as part of the rebranding of certain businesses of RGBV, which includes FLAG Telecom Group Limited (“FLAG”), Reliance Vanco Group Limited (“Vanco”) and Yipes Holdings, Inc. (“Yipes”).[3][4][5]
In 2003, the Reliance Group acquired and, in 2008, renamed FLAG as Reliance Globalcom Limited (“RGL”).[6] RGL owns and operates various undersea and terrestrial fiber assets around the world, including the FEA cable system linking Europe to Asia via the Middle East and India.[7][8] Before being acquired by Reliance Group, FLAG was listed on the NASDAQ National Market and London Stock Exchange. FLAG was first established in 1993 by a group of telecommunications companies led by Bell Atlantic.
In 2007, RGL acquired Yipes through one of RGL’s wholly owned subsidiaries.[9][10] Yipes is a US-based Ethernet Service provider which provides Ethernet and application delivery services for global enterprises. Established in 1999, Yipes has pioneered the Ethernet technology in metropolitan area networks.
In 2008, RGL acquired Vanco through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries.[11][12] Vanco is a global Wide Area Network Operator. Vanco provides enterprise clients, directly or through partners, with optimized fully managed network solutions. Vanco was established in 1988 and its original parent company, Vanco plc, was listed on the London Stock Exchange before it was acquired by RGL.
In 2011, Reliance Globalcom set up world’s first global Mediterranean gateway and hub in Europe set up with Hawk cable system.[13][14][15]
In April 2013, Reliance Globalcom integrated Hawk cable system with Reliance Global Network.[16][17] Later in December, it upgraded Trans-Atlantic cable with 100G technology.[18][19]
In March 2014, RGL rebranded as Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) under the leadership of CEO, Bill Barney, to align with the company’s strategic plan to deliver an integrated portfolio of infrastructure, data center and managed network services with Cloud capabilities, especially across key emerging markets in Asia and the Middle East.[20][21]
In March and June 2014, GCX announced plans for new subsea cables between Tokyo and California [22][23] and between Mumbai and Singapore[24][25] respectively, to bridge important gap and meet soaring bandwidth demands of new cloud-based applications and services.
In July 2014, GCX announced successful debut in the Global Capital Market by raising US $350M fixed rate notes maturing in 2019. The deal received an overwhelming response from the market, and was significantly oversubscribed.[26][27]
In October and December 2014, GCX launched transformational Cloud X platform in Hong Kong[28][29] and London.[30][31] This new high performance enterprise-class platform delivers applications and content across the company’s privately owned global fiber optic network.
In March 2015, Reliance Communications (RCOM), the parent company of GCX, expanded the role of Bill Barney, CEO of Global Cloud Xchange (GCX), to also oversee RCOM’s Enterprise, IDC and National Long Distance (NLD) operations in India, while continuing as Chairman and CEO of GCX.[32][33]
In 2015, GCX launched Cloud X Fusion,[34][35][36] providing low latency connectivity across developed and emerging markets in the US, Europe, Middle East and Asia, which gives enterprises security, reliability and predictability.
In July 2015, Reliance Communications (RCOM) expanded its next generation content and cloud delivery network – part of its subsidiary Global Cloud Xchange – to five additional cities in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad as part of a wider strategy to support future growth in the country.[37][38][39] These Cloud Xchange nodes can help government departments access 240 times the amount of compute power currently available in government data centers, and over 6 times the high speed storage currently available in India.
In August 2015, Reliance Communications’ Global Cloud Xchange to expand Singapore-India connectivity,[40][41] a major step forward to deliver next generation connectivity services to support the digital transformation and economic growth of India.
In February 2016, Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) announced the launch of Cloud X in Sydney,[42][43][44] enabling customers across Australia to have on-net access to public Cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Softlayer, Google, Rackspace, VMWare and more than 20 others worldwide, as well as software services like Microsoft Office 365 and Google Apps for Work.
In May 2016, Global Cloud Xchange was named Best Managed Services Provider at the Telecom Asia Awards held in conjunction with the annual Telco Strategies in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[45][46][47]
Global Network[edit]
The principal elements of the Global Cloud Xchange Global Network include five subsea cable systems operating on major global data traffic routes: the Trans-Atlantic route, the Europe-Asia route, the Europe-Middle East & Egypt route and the Intra-Asia route.[48][49]
As of June 30, 2014, these cable systems had a total length of 68,698 route kilometres (“rkm”)[50] and landed at 46 landing stations in 27 countries. GCX has launched India Cloud Xchange (ICX) through capacity acquired on the TIC cable to boost its connectivity between India and Singapore.[51][52] GCX is also expanding through Pacific Cloud Xchange (PCX) which will connect Tokyo with the US west coast. With the added capacity on TIC and the completion of PCX, GCX will deliver further economies of scale and network cost savings to its clients.
GCX has owned as well as leased terrestrial networks with a total length of 83,432 rkm integrated within the subsea cable system. These are present in over 34 metropolitan areas across 14 countries covering major business centres. GCX also has a scalable global IP and multi-protocol label switching (“MPLS”) network provided over 27 diverse owned and leased international subsea and terrestrial cable routes, with 836 direct inter-connections to 342 third party networks.[53][54]
GCX’s managed network services platform connects approximately 27,000 sites in 158 countries through a combination of leased and owned infrastructure offered through a dedicated secure IP network. Two GNOCs in Denver and Mumbai act as the global network operational centres of the GCX Global Network, the functions of which include 24-hour monitoring, network operations, restoration coordination and technical support.[55]
